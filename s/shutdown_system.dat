2500|$|The fuel is {{uranium dioxide}} pellets, enriched to 2.5-3.5%, in {{stainless}} steel tubes. The original design {{concept of the}} AGR was to use a beryllium based cladding. When this proved unsuitable due to brittle fracture, the enrichment level of the fuel was raised {{to allow for the}} higher neutron capture losses of stainless steel cladding. This significantly increased the cost of the power produced by an AGR. [...] The carbon dioxide coolant circulates through the core, reaching [...] and a pressure of around 40 bar (580 psi), and then passes through boiler (steam generator) assemblies outside the core but still within the steel-lined, reinforced concrete pressure vessel. Control rods penetrate the graphite moderator and a secondary system involves injecting nitrogen into the coolant to hold the reactor temperature down. A tertiary <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> which operates by injecting boron balls into the reactor is included in case the reactor has to be depressurized with insufficient control rods lowered. This would mean that nitrogen pressure can not be maintained.|$|E

5000|$|CFBR designs {{mentions}} a new {{and improved}} decay heat removal (DHR) system, reactor <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> from its predecessor PFBR. Passive safety features include new Hydraulically Suspended Absorber Rods (HSAR) which fall into the core {{under the influence of}} gravity if coolant flow is lost, and the inclusion of an Ultimate <b>Shutdown</b> <b>System</b> (USD) which would use pressurized gas to forcefully inject neutron poisons directly into the core to halt re-criticality incidents.|$|E
5000|$|The Pickering A {{system did}} not {{originally}} {{have a second}} independent <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> The Bruce containment concept differs: the reactor's reactivity mechanism deck serves {{as a part of}} the containment boundary, is closer to the reactor, and more prone to damage in the event of an accident ("accidental physical disassembly"). The designers therefore foresaw the need for a second safety system to reduce the risk on an accident. Bruce received a second, fully independent Safety <b>Shutdown</b> <b>System</b> (SDS2) which uses a liquid neutron poison injection method.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{independent}} <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> installed, designed {{to shut the}} reactor down effectively within a second. The reactor also has decay heat removal systems consisting of four independent circuits of 8MWt capacity each.|$|R
50|$|Soluble poisons {{are also}} used in {{emergency}} <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems.</b> During SCRAM the operators can inject solutions containing neutron poisons directly into the reactor coolant. Various solutions, including sodium polyborate and gadolinium nitrate (Gd(NO3)3·xH2O), are used.|$|R
50|$|A {{system will}} also require an {{approved}} steam safety valve and water level control {{as well as}} valves for water into the boiler and steam to the engine.

50|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} need the safety systems to avoid mission {{critical}} failures. The worst possible consequence {{that can result}} is leakage of radioactive materials (U-235 or Pu-239). One of the systems to avoid mission critical failures for nuclear power plant is <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> It has two different forms: rod controls and safety injection control. When problem occurs in the nuclear power plant, the rod control <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> drops the rods automatically and stops the chain reaction. The safety injection control injects liquid immediately when the system faces the problem in nuclear reactor and stops the chain reaction. Both systems are usually automatically operated, but also can be manually activated.|$|E

50|$|On December 31, 1997 {{the four}} Pickering A {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} by Ontario Hydro and placed in lay up, suspending work on upgrades to the <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> Ontario Hydro committed to restarting the units, but the project underwent long delays and large cost over-runs.|$|E
30|$|Safety-critical systems {{not only}} use {{mechanisms}} {{to reduce the}} occurrence of state inconsistency, but also require methods to recover from state inconsistency for safety. Safety-critical applications such as pacemakers and nuclear <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> emphasize safety over performance. Therefore, state inconsistency is a safety issue that must be resolved completely when using state-based schedules in safety-stringent applications.|$|R
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems.</b> It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|R
25|$|There are two independent, {{fast-acting}} safety <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> as well. Shutoff rods {{are held}} above the reactor by electromagnets, and drop under gravity {{into the core}} to quickly end criticality. This system works even {{in the event of}} a complete power failure, as the electromagnets only hold the rods out of the reactor when power is available. A secondary system injects a high-pressure gadolinium nitrate neutron absorber solution into the calandria.|$|R

50|$|Millstone 2 is a {{combustion}} engineering plant {{built in}} the 1970s, and has a maximum power output of 2700 thermal megawatts, or MWth (870 MWe).

50|$|In 2016 {{researchers}} {{announced a}} reversible <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> for preventing thermal runaway. The system employed a thermoresponsive polymer switching material.

Film electrical conductivity at ambient temperature was up to 50 S cm−1. Conductivity decreases within one second by 107-108 at the transition temperature and spontaneously recovers at room temperature. The system offers 103-104x greater sensitivity than previous devices.|$|E
50|$|Safety <b>Shutdown</b> <b>System</b> 1 (SDS1):SDS1 is {{designed}} to rapidly and automatically terminate reactor operation. Neutron-absorbing rods (control rods that shut down the nuclear chain reaction) are stored inside isolated channels located directly above the reactor vessel (calandria) and are controlled via a triple-channel logic circuit. When any 2 of the 3 circuit paths are activated (due to sensing the need for emergency reactor trip), the direct current-controlled clutches that keep each control-rod in the storage position are de-energized. The result is that each control-rod is inserted into the calandria, and the reactor heat output is reduced by 90% within 2 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Safety <b>Shutdown</b> <b>System</b> 2 (SDS2):SDS2 is also {{designed}} to rapidly and automatically terminate reactor operation. Gadolinium nitrate (GdNO3) solution, a neutron-absorbing liquid that shuts down the nuclear chain reaction, is stored inside channels that feed into horizontal nozzle assemblies. Each nozzle has an electronically controlled valve, {{all of which}} are controlled via a triple-channel logic circuit. When any 2 of the 3 circuit paths are activated (due to sensing the need for emergency reactor trip), each of these valves are opened and GdNO3 solution is injected through the nozzles to mix with the heavy-water moderator liquid in the reactor vessel (calandria). The result is that the reactor heat output is reduced by 90% within 2 seconds.|$|E

5000|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} generate heat internally; {{to remove}} this heat and convert it into useful electrical power, a coolant system is used. If this coolant flow is reduced, or lost altogether, the nuclear reactor's emergency <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> {{is designed to}} stop the fission chain reaction. However, due to radioactive decay the nuclear fuel will continue to generate {{a significant amount of}} heat. The decay heat produced by a reactor shutdown from full power is initially equivalent to about 5 to 6% of thethermal rating of the reactor. If all of the independent cooling trains of the ECCS fail to operate as designed, this heat can increase the fuel temperature to the point of damaging the reactor.|$|E

5000|$|Although system safety was not compromised, {{frequent}} operation {{problems were}} experienced throughout the reactor systems due to water and corrosion. Ice formed on chiller {{units in the}} gas cleaning system, reducing their efficiency. When the reactor output was cycled down and the system cooled, water would condense on equipment and instruments within the helium system. Control rod drives rusted, and rapid shutdowns failed to operate correctly. The reserve <b>shutdown</b> <b>system,</b> which released borated graphite spheres into the core {{in the event of}} an Anticipated Transient Without SCRAM (ATWS), was sometimes unavailable because water had leached the boron to form boric acid, which then softened the graphite spheres and caused them to clump together. Steel [...] "tendons" [...] within the PCRV experienced corrosion due to chloride precipitation and were weakened. Rust flecks migrated into the coolant and lodged in critical machinery, including control rod drives. Steam generator leaks also occurred due to corrosion.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{is the final}} submission for the Engineering Internship unit (ENG 450), undertaken at WorleyParsons Resources and Energy for a duration of 19 weeks. The main objective of the final year engineering internship is to provide exposure to the applied world of engineering design or research {{through a period of}} workplace employment in a relevant area of engineering. As such, it aims to address and develop several technical and process competencies as defined by Engineers Australia. As a pre-cursor to the work undertaken as part of the Engineering Internship, the nature of the processes on the concerned facilities (Bayu-Undan) are explored. The scope of the specific Bayu-Undan II project assigned is subsequently defined in pursuit of increased hydrocarbon liquids and LNG production. The work undertaken, as detailed in this report, encompasses the activities assigned to the Instrumentation and Control discipline in the preliminary 'planning' phase of the project (formally referred to as pre-Front End Engineering Design). These tasks/activities served as the primary deliverables required for this phase of the project. An Instrument feasibility study is provided to essentially outline the scope of work required from an instrumentation perspective, in order to facilitate the defined 'flow-line' tie-ins to occur. As such, it provides the basis for specification and configuration of the associated instrumentation. As a means of establishing a basis for the required modifications, the hardware components, layout, architecture and configuration of the control and <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> on the existing facilities is subsequently explored. The modification and/or configuration of the control and <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems,</b> in order to accommodate the defined 'flow-line' tie-ins, are subsequently provided as the control and <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> vendor scope of work. This also includes all required documentation defining the appropriate configuration and/or modification of these systems. The tasks associated with the specification and procurement of several instrument packages have also been undertaken and are detailed within this report. Where possible, background research regarding instrument components, functionality and required specifications has been included...|$|R
