5|$|The strongest {{storm of}} the season, Hurricane Twelve, was first {{identified}} as a tropical depression several hundred miles southwest of Sonora, Mexico on October20. Tracking northeastward, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm. Late on October21, the storm underwent {{a brief period of}} explosive intensification, strengthening from a 50mph (85km/h) tropical storm to a 140mph (220km/h) Category 4 hurricane in roughly <b>six</b> <b>hours.</b> The hurricane maintained this intensity for a further <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> before making landfall near Mazatlán. Rapid weakening took place as the hurricane moved inland, with the system dissipating during the afternoon of October22.|$|E
50|$|Late during 1935, the {{management}} of the Goodyear plant, which was by far the largest employer of rubber workers in the industry, introduced a plan for the reduction of hourly wages for workers as well as a move from <b>six</b> <b>hour</b> shifts to eight hour shifts. The reason for management's plan was to save money on labor. The move to eight <b>hour</b> shifts from <b>six</b> <b>hour</b> shifts would cause significant layoffs of around 1,200 workers, because with <b>six</b> <b>hour</b> shifts, four shifts of workers would be employed compared to three shifts of workers being employed under eight hour shifts. Eventually, Goodyear's management {{decided to go back to}} <b>six</b> <b>hour</b> shifts because of the displeasure voiced by workers.|$|R

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed at the tail-end of a stationary front, organizing into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on October28 about 520mi (835km) south-southeast of Bermuda. Steered west-northwest and then sharply northeast ahead {{of an approaching}} cold front, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Shary <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> after formation. Within an environment of low wind shear, Shary strengthened into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75mph (120km/h) by 00:00UTC on October30 as an eye became apparent on microwave imagery. The storm became increasingly asymmetric as it interacted with the front, and Shary transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00UTC that day. The extratropical system was completely absorbed by the front <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> later. Since Shary remained south and east of Bermuda, its effects were limited to 0.54in (13.7mm) of rainfall and a gust to 35mph (56km/h).|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first developed on September 14 over the Pacific Ocean {{west of the}} Mexican coast. <b>Six</b> <b>hours</b> later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Norbert. Gradually strengthening, Norbert meandered in the weak steering currents for several days. The rate of intensification accelerated early on September 16, and shortly thereafter Norbert became a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|At 0000UTC on January17, Météo-France (MFR) {{upgraded}} {{the disturbance}} to a tropical depression, and <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> later upgraded the system further to Tropical Storm Dina. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and {{later that day}} initiated advisories about 425km (265mi) south of Diego Garcia. Dina quickly intensified, and its T-numbers using the Dvorak technique increased by 0.5 every <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> during the storm's development phase. An eye began developing late on January17, and at 1200UTC on January18, MFR upgraded Dina to a tropical cyclone, or {{the equivalent of a}} Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. This was only 36hours after it was first classified as a tropical disturbance, which is much less than the five days most tropical cyclones take. About three hours earlier, the JTWC had also upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} <b>six</b> <b>hours,</b> Urmil underwent explosive deepening {{as the main}} feeder band wrapped around the center of circulation. After the brief period of intensification, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 110km/h (70mph) according to both the RSMC Nadi and the JTWC, making it a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale. The highly favorable environment, {{in combination with the}} fast forward motion of the storm, allowed Urmil to rapidly reach its peak intensity, despite wind shear reaching 35km/h (25mph). However, as quickly as the storm strengthened, it began to weaken as convection weakened. With both wind shear and forward motion increasing, the cyclone quickly became disorganized. Around 0000UTC on January15, the center of circulation was devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. About <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> later, Urmil transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was subsequently absorbed into the mid-latitude westerlies.|$|E
