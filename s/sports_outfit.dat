50|$|From 1969-1987, Montpellier {{underwent}} two name {{changes and}} spent its time {{playing in the}} CFA and Division 2, excluding one year back in Division 1 in 1981. In 1970, {{in an effort to}} avoid bankruptcy, the club merged with Montpellier Littoral and played under the name Montpellier Littoral Sport Club #MLSC) for four years. Despite the merger, the club still had financial troubles, which led to struggles domestically. The problems led to several players leaving the club for Formation Sportive de Nettoiement, an emerging <b>sports</b> <b>outfit</b> led by entrepreneur Louis Nicollin. On 1 June 1974, the club merged with up-and-coming club AS Paillade and changed its name to Montpellier Paillade Sport Club Littoral #MPSCL#. Like the previous merger, the merger with Paillade was ultimately unsuccessful as the club failed to make any progress. At the urging of local journalist Carlo Llorens, MPSCL merged with Nicollin's club, which had quickly become competitive. Nicollin dissolved his club, was installed as Montpellier's president, and brought his players and management over to Montpellier. After slowly ascending up the league system with managers such as Robert Nouzaret, Kader Firoud, and Jacques Bonnet, Montpellier returned to the first division under the leadership of Michel Mézy for the 1987-88 season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{material}} {{of the studies}} was the physical education teachers of randomly chosen Poznań (Poland) schools: primary, grammar, and secondary schools. The studies involved 584 physical education teachers. The studies were conducted in the school year of 1999 - 2000. For the studies, an observation method was applied consisting in lesson observations during physical education lessons carried out by physical education teachers. The results of the studies form characteristic upward or downward tendencies. The higher the educational stage the higher the percentage value for the teachers who: a) assess attitudes and behavior of the students; b) monitor and assess knowledge {{of the students in}} the field of physical culture; c) assess with grades or points motor and organizational skills; d) assess verbally tasks’ achievement; e) apply and introduce self-monitoring and self-assessment of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and physical fitness of the students.

40|$|This study {{looked at}} whether drivers {{overtaking}} a bicyclist changed the proximities of their passes {{in response to}} the level of experience and skill signalled by the bicyclist's appearance. Five outfits were tested, ranging from a stereotypical sport rider's outfit, portraying high experience and skill, to a vest with ‘novice cyclist’ printed on the back, portraying low experience. A high-visibility bicycling jacket was also used, as were two commercially available safety vests, one featuring a prominent mention of the word ‘police’ and a warning that the rider was video-recording their journey, and one modelled after a police officer's jacket but with a letter changed so it read ‘POLITE’. An ultrasonic distance sensor recorded the space left by vehicles passing the bicyclist on a regular commuting route. 5690 data points fulfilled the criteria for the study and were included in the analyses. The only outfit associated with a significant change in mean passing proximities was the police/video-recording jacket. Contrary to predictions, drivers treated the <b>sports</b> <b>outfit</b> and the ‘novice cyclist’ outfit equivalently, suggesting they do not adjust overtaking proximity as a function of a rider's perceived experience. Notably, whilst some outfits seemed to discourage motorists from passing within 1 metre of the rider, approximately 1 - 2 % of overtakes came within 50 cm no matter what outfit was worn. This suggests there is little riders can do, by altering their appearance, to prevent the very closest overtakes; it is suggested that infrastructural, educational or legal measures are more promising for preventing drivers from passing extremely close to bicyclists...|$|E

50|$|When the First World War began, Dutton was {{resident}} at 42 Blücher Strasse in Berlin and {{was working}} as a <b>sports</b> <b>outfitter.</b> He was arrested in Berlin on 6 November 1914, and sent to Ruhleben, a civilian detention camp in the Spandau district. While there he was interned in Barrack 1. The camp contained between 4,000 and 5,500 prisoners. Gradually a mini-society evolved and football became a popular activity. Dutton was one of several former professional footballers at Ruhleben.

50|$|The Games faced a {{controversy}} over female athletes competing in sports bikinis. Some participating nations demanded that all sportswomen {{competing in the}} athletics, beach volleyball and swimming events wear body-covering <b>sporting</b> <b>outfits</b> instead of the usual, functional and official sports bikinis regulated by international rules. In some countries of the Muslim world, sporting suits for women called burqini, which cover the whole body except the face, the hands and the feet, are in use in accordance with Islamic culture. Furthermore, some countries asked the organizers to run {{the male and female}} events on separate days. Both regulations were applied in the first edition of the Games held in Saudi Arabia in 2005.|$|R
30|$|In addition, women wearing {{revealing}} Halloween costumes {{were rated}} more feminine than women wearing non-revealing costumes which {{may suggest that}} wearing revealing dress {{is part of a}} female gender role. This is also consistent with Gurung and Chrouser (2007); their stimulus persons were rated more feminine when dressed in revealing dress as compared to when dressed in athletic <b>sports</b> <b>outfits.</b> Finally and most importantly revealing dress affected judgments of sexualizing traits and this was a moderate effect. Thus, women wearing revealing Halloween costumes were sexualized more than those wearing non-revealing costumes. This is consistent with results of Gurung and Chrouser; in their revealing dress condition the stimulus person was rated higher on traits selected to measure sexuality (attractive, sexually experienced, desirable) than in the non-revealing condition.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} VSA {{proposal is}} represented in the following figure, derived from Beer's first conceptualization of the decision making area and operating structure. Basically, VSA advances upon Stafford Beer's proposal, based upon the distribution of numerous managerial and operative decisions within the operating structure area. The management system can limit the real decision making to strategic and high level issues, involving every decision maker. In a similar way, we may say that the operating area {{of a human being}} involves the decision of going to jog, requiring the person to wear a <b>sport</b> <b>outfit</b> and running shoes; on the other hand, the decision about pursuing higher education, starting a new venture, or practicing within an existing business, may be relegated within the higher control system.|$|R
