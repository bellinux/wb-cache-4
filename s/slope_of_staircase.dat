40|$|Realistic {{modeling}} of a 3 D environment {{has grown in}} popularity due to the increasing realm of practical applications. Whether for practical navigation purposes, entertainment value, or architectural standardization, the ability to determine the dimensions of a room {{is becoming more and}} more important. One of the trickier, but critical, features within any multistory environment is the staircase. Staircases are difficult to model because of their uneven surface and various depth aspects. Coupling this need is a variety of ways to reach this goal. Unfortunately, many such methods rely upon specialized sensory equipment, multiple calibrated cameras, or other such impractical setups. Here, we propose a simpler approach. This paper outlines a method for extracting the <b>slope</b> dimensions <b>of</b> a <b>staircase</b> using a single monocular image. By relying on only a single image, we negate the need for extraneous accessories and glean as much information from common pictures. We do not hope to achieve the high level of accuracy seen from laser scanning methods but seek to produce a viable result that can both be helpful for current applications and serve as a building block that contributes to later development. When constructing our pipeline, we take into account several options. Each step can be achieved with different techniques which we evaluate and compare on either a qualitative or quantitative level. This leads to our final result which can accurately determine the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> a <b>staircase</b> with an error rate of 31. 1 %. With a small amount of previous knowledge or preprocessing, this drops down to an average of 18. 7 % Overall, we deem this an acceptable and optimal result given the limited information and processing resources which the program was allowed to utilize...|$|R

40|$|Hair cells tightly {{control the}} {{dimensions}} of their stereocilia, which are actin-rich protrusions with graded heights that mediate mechanotransduction in the inner ear. Two members of the myosin-III family, MYO 3 A and MYO 3 B, are thought to regulate stereocilia length by transporting cargos that control actin polymerization at stereocilia tips. We show that eliminating espin- 1 (ESPN- 1), an isoform of ESPN and a myosin-III cargo, dramatically alters the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the stereocilia <b>staircase</b> in a subset of hair cells. Furthermore, we show that espin-like (ESPNL), primarily present in developing stereocilia, is also a myosin-III cargo and is essential for normal hearing. ESPN- 1 and ESPNL each bind MYO 3 A and MYO 3 B, but differentially influence how the two motors function. Consequently, functional properties of different motor-cargo combinations differentially affect molecular transport {{and the length of}} actin protrusions. This mechanism is used by hair cells to establish the required range of stereocilia lengths within a single cell...|$|R
40|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>staircase</b> separator, {{introduced}} in [2], greatly facilitates {{the design of}} divide-and-conquer algorithms for problems on rectangles. We generalize the concept <b>of</b> <b>staircase</b> separator to k-perfect staircase separator, namely a set <b>of</b> <b>staircase</b> separators which partitions a set S of n axis-parallel, disjoint rectangles into k subsets of (almost) equal size. We derive an optimal O(log n) time parallel algorithm for computing a k-perfect staircase separator, using O(n) processors on the CREW PRAM model of computation. For a special case, where k = 2, this result provides a new bound of d n 2 e, in compared to d 7 n 8 e in [2], on the quality <b>of</b> <b>staircase</b> separators for sets of rectangles. 1 Introduction In this paper we consider the problem <b>of</b> computing a <b>staircase</b> separator for a set S of n axis-parallel, disjoint rectangles in the plane.

The work is motivated by an important observation on fully discrete schemes concerning the so-called staircasing phenomenon: when sharpening monotone data profiles, fully discrete methods generally introduce stepfunction-type solutions reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>staircases.</b> In this work, we show by an analysis of dynamical systems in corresponding semidiscrete formulations that already the semidiscrete numerical model contains the relevant information on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>staircasing.</b> Numerical experiments confirm and complement the theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|We propose two {{variants}} <b>of</b> <b>staircase</b> {{codes that}} {{resolve the issue}} of parity-propagation in their encoding process. The proposed codes provide a systematic way <b>of</b> terminating a <b>staircase</b> code after an arbitrary number of blocks. The class <b>of</b> feed-forward <b>staircase</b> codes are introduced, which uses a self-protection technique to avoid parity-propagation. We also introduce the class <b>of</b> partial feed-forward <b>staircase</b> codes, which allows parity-propagation to occur over a given number of blocks. By amortizing the complexity of self-protection over several standard staircase blocks, the encoding complexity of these codes is made comparable to staircase codes. Partial feed-forward staircase codes have the same error-floor as staircase codes. Simulations confirm that {{the performance of the}} proposed codes in both the waterfall and error-floor regions is similar to the original staircase codes. The proposed codes help extend the domain <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>staircase</b> codes to systems in which parity-propagation is undesirable or termination is necessary.
