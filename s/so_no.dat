5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance is named {{when it reaches}} moderate tropical storm strength. If a {{tropical disturbance}} reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm; between 55°E and 90°E, the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius {{is responsible for the}} same task.

5|$|Hurricane Agnes of the 1972 {{season was}} the deadliest storm, killing 19people {{as a result}} of heavy flooding. The most {{damaging}} storm was Hurricane Irene, which resulted in $151 million in damage. Hurricane Hazel caused sustained hurricane-force winds (winds of 75mph (121km/h) or greater) in the state, the only storm during the time period to do <b>so.</b> <b>No</b> storms made landfall in Maryland at hurricane intensity. Since 1950, twelve tropical cyclones have collectively killed 61people.|$|E

5000|$|After {{three years}} touring and composing, {{the group had}} reached a level of {{maturity}} that most other Brazilian rock groups had only dreamt of. In 1986 they issued Viva! (Live!) -- maybe the first true [...] "live" [...] album by a Brazilian artist, without any post-production, edition or overdubs. This record showed to the country the band's true face: punkish, dirty and noisy. It is also famous {{for the use of}} several explicit words that had been censored in the original studio versions. [...] "Eu Não Matei Joana D'Arc", for instance had the line [...] "Nós <b>só</b> <b>nos</b> encontramos para passear no parque" [...] (we only met to walk through the park) replaced by [...] "Nós <b>só</b> <b>nos</b> encontramos para trepar no parque" [...] (we only met to fuck in the park).|$|R
5|$|In the two-man {{bobsleigh}} competition, a tie {{meant that}} two gold medals were awarded, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> silver medal was awarded for that event. A tie for {{second in the}} men's Super G skiing competition meant that a pair of silver medals were given out, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the four-man bobsleigh, a tie for third resulted in the awarding of two bronze medals. Due to these ties, the number of gold medals awarded was one more {{than the number of}} silver or bronze medals. In snowboarding, Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the gold medal in the men's Giant Slalom, but it was briefly stripped by the IOC after he tested positive for marijuana. After the Canadian Olympic Association filed an appeal, however, the IOC's decision was overturned.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} that Coulthard may {{be replaced}} by Schumacher for the 1999 season and beyond and, in a previous edition of the F1 Racing magazine, Ron Dennis revealed that he had approached Schumacher to sign a deal with McLaren. However, peripheral financial issues that tied Schumacher with Ferrari, such as sponsorship agreements and payment, could not be rectified in a move to the rival team and <b>so</b> <b>no</b> deal came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|The next {{mission to}} {{encounter}} Jupiter was the Ulysses solar probe. It performed a flyby maneuver {{to attain a}} polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass, the spacecraft conducted studies on Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ulysses has no cameras <b>so</b> <b>no</b> images were taken. A second flyby six years later was at a much greater distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} four tracks at Lysaker will allow NSB to run all local trains that {{previously}} have run to Skøyen {{all the way}} to Lysaker.

5|$|A {{number of}} other schemes for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> other improvements were likely to be funded in the short term.|$|E

5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating {{suggests}} that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even <b>so,</b> <b>no</b> evidence {{has been found to}} suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E
5|$|Beryl made {{landfall}} in a {{sparsely populated}} region of northeast Mexico, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> official reports of tropical storm force winds were recorded. Moisture from Beryl brought 0.8 in (20.1mm) {{of rain in}} Corpus Christi, Texas and 0.5in (13.7mm) in Brownsville, Texas in a 48-hour period between August 14 and August 16. The highest winds from these stations {{were no more than}} 28mph (46km/h). Cloud cover and rainfall resulted with cool high temperatures in southern Texas. Brownsville had a high temperature of 84˚F (28.9˚C) on August 15. This broke the record for the coolest maximum temperature in Brownsville for August 15; the previous record was 85˚F (29.4˚C) set in 1881.|$|E

5|$|Despite all the improvements, serious {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} 1999 when {{the bank of}} the drain was breached near Pinchbeck. Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded, and a review of the flood defences was then carried out. The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding for the work was not available, and <b>so</b> <b>no</b> work was done at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the WPNSA was {{selected}} to host sailing events at the 2012 Olympic Games—mainly because the Academy had recently been built, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> new venue {{would have to be}} provided. However, as part of the South West of England Regional Development Agency's plans to redevelop Osprey Quay, a new 600-berth marina and an extension with more on-site facilities were built. Construction was scheduled between October 2007 and the end of 2008, and with its completion and formal opening on 11 June 2009, the venue became the first of the 2012 Olympic Games to be completed.|$|E
5|$|Like the Jaina {{versions}} of the Krishna legends, the Buddhist versions such as one in Ghata Jataka follow the general outline of the story, but {{are different from the}} Hindu versions as well. For example, the Buddhist legend describes Devagabbha (Devaki) to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole, after she is born, <b>so</b> <b>no</b> future husband could reach her. Krishna's father similarly is described as a powerful king, but who meets up with Devagabbha anyway, and to whom Kamsa gives away his sister Devagabbha in marriage. The siblings of Krishna are not killed by Kamsa, though he tries. In the Buddhist version of the legend, all of Krishna's siblings grow to maturity.|$|E
