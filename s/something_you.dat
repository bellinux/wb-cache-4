25|$|The {{artist is}} a not great creator—Duchamp went {{shopping}} at a plumbing store. The artwork {{is not a}} special object—it was mass-produced in a factory. The experience of art is not exciting and ennobling—at best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one {{with a sense of}} distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> piss on.|$|E

25|$|Adventitious {{ideas are}} those {{concepts}} that we gain through sense experiences, ideas {{such as the}} sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and <b>something</b> <b>you</b> simply cannot will away. Ideas invented by us, such as those found in mythology, legends, and fairy tales are created by us from other ideas we possess. Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of perfection, are those ideas we have {{as a result of}} mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.|$|E
25|$|Entertainment Weekly listed Star Wars: The Clone Wars {{as one of}} {{the five}} worst films of 2008 with critic Owen Gleiberman saying, It's hard to tell the droids from the Jedi drones in this robotic {{animated}} dud, in which the George Lucas Empire Strikes Back—at the audience. What wears you out is Lucas' immersion in a Star Wars cosmology that has grown so obsessive-compulsively cluttered yet trivial that it's no longer escapism; Because this movie has bad lightsaber duels and the lack of the original cast, it's <b>something</b> <b>you</b> want to escape from.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at the United States Department of State, Keyes defended the Reagan policy of not {{imposing}} economic sanctions on South Africa as punishment for apartheid. Stated Keyes, [...] "I see the black people in South Africa as the most critical positive factor for eliminating apartheid and building the future of that country... And that is not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> do with rhetoric, slogans and noninvolvement. It's not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> will achieve through disinvestment." ...|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{framed the}} romance with the elderly Rose {{to make the}} {{intervening}} years palpable and poignant. While Winslet and Stuart stated their belief that, instead of being asleep in her bed, the character dies {{at the end of}} the film, Cameron said that he would rather not reveal what he intended with the ending because [...] "he answer has to be <b>something</b> <b>you</b> supply personally; individually." ...|$|E
500|$|We sense his untrustworthy nature {{immediately}} when he {{sits down}} beside the boys at a football game and doesn't understand it, despite the boys' best efforts to explain.

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> carry people with you." ...|$|E

500|$|In the end, 40 {{songs were}} amassed {{for the new}} record, but only ten were used. According to Schwab, the album's title was chosen to {{represent}} [...] "the tension that exists in everybody [...] the flesh and the spirit." [...] It was also representative of their new musical direction, an attempt to polarize themselves from other heavy rock acts. Similarly to their last record, a documentary was filmed that detailed the recording process, entitled I Want <b>Something</b> <b>You</b> Have: Rival Factions The DVD.|$|E
