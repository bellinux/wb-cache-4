5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E

5|$|Uncommon {{magnetic}} properties (spin glass state) {{were observed in}} diamond nanocrystals intercalated with potassium. Unlike paramagnetic host material, magnetic susceptibility measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nanocrystalline diamond system.|$|E
5|$|Following Ohayō, Kon {{began work}} on his next film, Dreaming Machine. In May 2010, Kon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal pancreatic cancer. Given half a year to live, Kon chose to spend {{the remainder of his}} life in his home. Shortly before his death Kon composed a final message, which was uploaded to his blog by his family upon his death. As Kon explained in the message, he chose not to make news of his rapidly advancing illness public, in part out of embarrassment at how drastically emaciated and ravaged his body had become. The result was that the announcement of his death was met with widespread shock and surprise, particularly given that Kon had shown no signs of illness at relatively recent public events, as the cancer progressed to a terminal <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> matter of months after being diagnosed. Kon died on August 24, 2010 at the age of 46. After his death, Kon was mentioned among the Fond Farewells in TIME's people of the year 2010. Darren Aronofsky wrote a eulogy to him, which was printed in , a Japanese retrospective book of his animation career.|$|E
5|$|Following the French withdrawal, Ali, the wāli (governor) and self-declared khedive (viceroy) of Egypt, {{sought to}} {{consolidate}} his newfound {{control of the}} country. To achieve this goal he took a number of steps to limit, and eventually eliminate, {{the ability of the}} al-Azhar ulema to influence the government. He imposed taxes on rizqa lands (tax-free property owned by mosques) and madrasas, from which al-Azhar drew a major portion of its income. In June 1809, he ordered that the deeds to all rizqa lands be forfeited to the <b>state</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> move that provoked outrage among the ulema. As a result, Umar Makram, the naqib al-ashraf, a prestigious Islamic post, led a revolt in July 1809. The revolt failed and Makram, an influential ally of the ulema, was exiled to Damietta.|$|E

The week after beating USC, Stanford defeated Washington State, moving to a 6–1 record {{for the first time since}} 1970. The Cardinal rose to No. 13 nationally and defeated the University of Washington on October 30. Against No. 15 Arizona, Stanford matched its previous season's win total. On November 13, Stanford defeated Arizona <b>State</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> closely fought 17–13 win that brought the Cardinal football team to 9–1 and its best record since 1951. The following week, Stanford beat traditional rival California in The Big Game by a 48–14 score. It was the largest margin of victory in the rivalry since 1930. Stanford's final regular-season game was against the Oregon State Beavers, and Stanford won the contest convincingly, 38–0. The No. 4 and No. 5 nationally ranked teams had lost earlier the same day, lifting Stanford in the polls and in position for a Bowl Championship Series game berth.|$|E
