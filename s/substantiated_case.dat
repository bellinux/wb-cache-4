40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{trends in}} reports of child maltreatment to the Northern Territory Department of Children and Families among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: A {{historical}} cohort study using administrative data collections of notifications and <b>substantiated</b> <b>cases</b> of maltreatment among children aged from 0 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUReS: Annual rates of notification and substantiation {{of different types}} of child maltreatment. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2010, the overall annual rates of notification for maltreatment of Aboriginal children showed an average increase of 21 % (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 19 – 1. 24). The greatest increases were in notifications for neglect and emotional abuse. There were parallel increases in rates of <b>substantiated</b> <b>cases</b> of maltreatment. Among non-Aboriginal children, the overall annual rates of notification also increased (IRR, 1. 10; 95 % CI, 1. 07 – 1. 14); however, changes in annual rates of <b>substantiated</b> <b>cases</b> for all types of maltreatment were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: There have been considerable increases in both notifications and <b>substantiated</b> <b>cases</b> of child maltreatment, most prominently among Aboriginal children. It is possible that the observed increases reflect increasing incidence of maltreatment; however, they are also consistent with a mix of increased surveillance, improved service access, changes in policy and a shift in public attitudes.

40|$|Publicación ISIEvolutionary {{transitions}} {{between different}} modes {{of development in}} marine invertebrates {{are thought to be}} biased toward the loss of feeding larvae. Because the morphology of feeding larvae is complex and nonfeeding larvae or encapsulated embryos with benthic development often have simplified morphologies, it is presumed to be easier to lose a larval stage than to reacquire it. Some authors have {{gone so far as to}} suggest that feeding larvae, morphologically similar to the ancestral feeding larvae, cannot be reacquired. However, the larval structures of some groups, most notably gastropods, are often retained in the encapsulated embryos of species that hatch as benthic juveniles. Therefore the re-evolution of feeding larvae using the same structures may be possible in these groups. Here we present the first well - <b>substantiated</b> <b>case</b> for the recent re-evolution of feeding larvae within a clade of direct-developers. DNA sequence data show that Crepipatella fecunda, a species of calyptraeid gastropod with planktotrophic development, is nested within a clade of species with direct development, and that Crepipatella dilatata, a species with direct development, appears to be paraphyletic with respect to C. fecunda. Observation of the embryos of C. dilatata shows that the features necessary for larval feeding and swimming are retained in the encapsulated veligers, suggesting that heterochronic shifts in hatching time and changes in nurse-egg allotment could have resulted in the re-evolution of feeding larvae in this species...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} has found that the decision to remove maltreated children from their home is influenced by a variety of factors including type of abuse and race of child victim. Child welfare statistics indicate that the proportion of minority children involved in child protective services are over-represented in the child welfare system, that minority children are placed in out-of-home care disproportionately in comparison with Caucasian children, and that minority children and families are receiving differential services within the child protective system. Might racial bias account for such differences? ^ In order to examine these issues, 903 social workers from around the country {{were asked to respond to}} a vignette depicting a <b>substantiated</b> <b>case</b> of child maltreatment. A multivariate, 3 (maltreatment ambiguity level) x 2 (race of child victim) x 2 (racism scale score) between-groups design was used. Analyses were also conducted to more directly compare respondents 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the two types of depicted abuse. ^ Results showed that physical abuse cases were associated with a greater array of recommended services, more barriers to treatment, increased risk of harm, and longer lengths of stay in out-of-home care. Neglect cases were associated with the perception that children are more adoptable and that families would be more likely to participate in and benefit from services. ^ This study also examined whether modern racism or aversive racism provided the most valid theoretical foundation for explaining patterns of results. The results showed limited support for the aversive racism theory and no support for the modern racism perspective. ^ Even though neither of the two theoretical perspectives was supported, the question remained whether race, in general, affected respondent decision-making. Overall, the data from this study presented an inconsistent view of how race matters in child welfare decision-making. On the one hand, race seemed to make a difference in decision-making for high risk cases with respect to out-of-home care recommendations and perceptions of risk. On the other hand, these differences were opposite of that expected. Possible explanations for the obtained results are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} characteristics of investigations of sexual abuse concerning vulnerable adults residing in facility settings that were associated with case substantiation. Data on 410 reports of sexual abuse were collected prospectively from Adult Protective Services (APS) and state licensure agency staff in New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin over a six-month period. Specifically, we examined differences between reports that were substantiated and those that were not by comparing characteristics of alleged victims, alleged perpetrators, and aspects of investigation using logistic regression. We found that a relatively low proportion of cases (18 %) were substantiated overall. Compared to cases that were not <b>substantiated,</b> <b>cases</b> that were <b>substantiated</b> were more likely to feature nursing home residents, older victims, female victims, and allegations of physical contact between the alleged perpetrator and victim. Despite the high proportion of alleged perpetrators who were facility staff (51 %) compared to resident perpetrators (25 %), cases with resident-to-resident allegations of abuse were much more likely to be substantiated, accounting for 63 % of <b>substantiated</b> <b>cases.</b> In light of these findings, we believe it is important that investigators are trained to handle sexual abuse cases appropriately and that they are able to investigate the case thoroughly, promptly, and with as much information as possible. It is also critical that investigators make substantiation decisions using the appropriate standard for confirmation (e. g., preponderance of the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, clear and convincing evidence) as state law dictates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Substantiated</b> <b>cases</b> {{of child}} maltreatment have {{declined}} more than 20 % since a peak in 1993. However, although {{sexual abuse and}} physical abuse showed significant declines during the 1990 s (47 % and 36 %, respectively), neglect fluctuated, with only a small overall decline during this period (7 %). Available data suggest that {{at least part of}} the declines in sexual and physical abuse is likely to be real. Some evidence also suggests that a decline in neglect may have been masked in some states. Possible sources for declines in child maltreatment include direct prevention efforts, economic improvements, more aggressive criminal justice efforts, dissemination of psychiatric medication, and generational changes. Public health models suggest that population-level prevention initiatives are the most promising options for further reducing maltreatment rates. However, better epidemiological and evaluation research will be needed to identify the key factors...|$|R
40|$|The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) is an {{independent}} agency of the City of New York. The Board investigates, mediates, and prosecutes complaints of misconduct {{that members of the}} public file against police officers of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). The CCRB was established in its all-civilian form, independent from the Police Department, in 1993. The Board consists of 13 members. The City Council designates five Board members (one from each borough); the Police Commissioner designates three; and the Mayor designates five, including the Chair. All appointments are made by the Mayor, who also has the authority to select the Chair of the Board. Under the New York City Charter, the Board must reflect the diversity of the City's residents and all members must live in New York City. No member of the Board may have a law enforcement background, except those designated by the Police Commissioner, who must have had a law enforcement vocation. No Board member may be a public employee or serve in public office. Board members serve three-year terms, which can be and often are renewed. They receive compensation on a per-session basis, although some Board members may choose to serve pro bono. Board members review and make findings on all misconduct complaints once they have been investigated by an all-civilian staff. From 1993 to 2013, when the Board found that an officer committed misconduct, the case was referred to the Police Commissioner with a discipline recommendation. Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the CCRB and the NYPD (effective April 11, 2013), all <b>substantiated</b> <b>cases</b> in which the Board recommends that charges and specifications be brought against an officer are prosecuted by a team of CCRB attorneys in the Agency's Administrative Prosecution Unit. <b>Substantiated</b> <b>cases</b> in which the Board recommends some discipline other than charges and specifications (e. g. instructions) are still referred to the Police Commissioner {{in the same manner as}} prior to 2013...|$|R
