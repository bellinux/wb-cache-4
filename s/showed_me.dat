25|$|I owe {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward. He <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> {{that one}} could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E

500|$|Lead vocalist Mark Hall {{says that}} [...] "Praise You In This Storm" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's experience with a young girl, Erin Browning. The band made arrangements to meet Erin, who had performed a dance at her public school to one of the band's songs, and her family on Valentine's Day 2004 before one of their concerts. Right around the time the band connected with Erin and her family was when she was found to have cancer. Erin died on November 1, 2004. According to Hall, [...] "Watching [...] walk through this really <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> truth about my worship. Watching her walk through a real storm <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> that my worship was extremely situational". Hall began writing the song before Erin's death and told her about it, but was not able to complete it before she died.|$|E

To {{accurately}} portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds (13 kilograms), shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body.
