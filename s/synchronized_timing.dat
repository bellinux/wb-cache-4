[...] While analogue systems {{in the form of}} a photosensor, rotating aperture and a light source have been used in the past, most systems in use today are digital. [...] Controlled by a computer, the synchronizer can dictate the timing of each frame of the CCD camera's sequence in conjunction with the firing of the laser to within 1 ns precision. [...] Thus the time between each pulse of the laser and the placement of the laser shot in reference to the camera's timing can be accurately controlled. [...] Knowledge of this timing is critical as it is needed to determine the velocity of the fluid in the PIV analysis. Stand-alone electronic synchronizers, called digital delay generators, offer variable resolution timing from as low as 250 ps to as high as several ms.

The persistence of similar molecular rhythms in peripheral tissues in vitro[2, 3] suggests that these tissues contain self-sustained circadian clocks that {{may be linked to}} rhythmic physiological functions. It is not known how brain and peripheral clocks are organized into a <b>synchronized</b> <b>timing</b> system; however, it has been assumed that peripheral clocks submit to a master clock in the brain. To address this matter we examined the expression of two clock genes, period (per) and timeless (tim), in host and transplanted abdominal organs of Drosophila. We found that excretory organs in tissue culture display free-running, light-sensitive oscillations in per and tim gene activity indicating that they house self-sustained circadian clocks. To test for humoral factors, we monitored cycling of the TIM protein in excretory tubules transplanted into host flies entrained to an opposite light–dark cycle. We show that the clock protein in the donor tubules cycled out of phase with that in the host tubules, indicating that different organs may cycle independently, despite sharing the same hormonal milieu. We suggest that one way to achieve circadian coordination of physiological sub-systems in higher animals may be through the direct entrainment of light-sensitive clocks by environmental signals...|$|E

But in the CRDI engines the pressure is built up independently of the injection sequence and remains permanently available in the fuel line. CRDI system that uses an ion sensor to provide real-time combustion data for each cylinder. The common rail upstream of the cylinders acts as an accumulator, distributing the fuel to the injectors at a constant pressure of up to 1600 bar. Here high-speed solenoid valves, regulated by the electronic engine management, separately control the injection timing {{and the amount of}} fuel injected for each cylinder {{as a function of the}} cylinder's actual need. In other words, pressure generation and fuel injection are independent of each other. This is an important advantage of common-rail injection over conventional fuel injection systems as CRDI increases the controllability of the individual injection processes and further refines fuel atomization, saving fuel and reducing emissions. Fuel economy of 25 to 35 % is obtained over a standard diesel engine and a substantial noise reduction is achieved due to a more <b>synchronized</b> <b>timing</b> operation.

40|$|Abstract. Emulation {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{strategies}} for preserving digital objects. With different emulation environments to choose from when preserving a collection of digital objects it is necessary to choose the emulator that is able to render the significant properties of an object best. But also on the development side it is necessary to run automated tests for new versions of emulators. In this work we present some of the main challenges for automated testing of emulators with specific digital objects. To compare different original and emulated environments it is necessary to document the environment used to render an object. Changes in this ’view-path ’ comprising all secondary digital objects needed to perform the emulation can lead to changes in behavior or appearance. For interactive and dynamic objects it is necessary to determine the external events influencing an object, e. g. user input and changes in <b>synchronized</b> <b>timing</b> can lead to different results when executing a digital object. Significant properties of descriptive forms, i. e. the physical manifestations of an object, are compared when using migration as a strategy by comparing the original and the migrated form. With emulation the descriptive form of the object remains unchanged, so properties of a rendered version of the object have to be compared to determine if the preservation was successful. Emulation environments have to be extended to allow for the extraction of significant properties of digital objects. These properties can vary over different points in the rendering process. ...|$|E
40|$|Epulopiscium sp. type B, {{a member}} of the Firmicutes, is a large (up to 300 μm), cigar-shaped {{bacterial}} symbiont of surgeonfish that propagates itself by forming multiple intracellular offspring. This unusual form of reproduction is an apparent modification of a developmental program used by some Firmicutes to produce an endospore. At the onset of offspring formation, the Epulopiscium cell divides at both poles. The polar cells are engulfed by the larger mother cell and grow within the mother cell. At the final stages of development, the Epulopiscium mother cell lyses. Here we describe changes in Epulopiscium cell structure, focusing on mother cell DNA replication and cell death. DNA replication was examined by labeling cells with the nucleotide analog bromodeoxyuridine. As expected, DNA replication occurs in the developing offspring. However, well after passage of genetic information from parent to offspring is complete, DNA within the mother cell continues to replicate. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that {{near the end of the}} offspring growth cycle, mother cell DNA disintegrates. The mother cell membrane and wall deteriorate as well. DNA replication within this terminally differentiated cell indicates the importance of mother cell nucleoids in cell maintenance and the development of offspring. The <b>synchronized</b> <b>timing</b> of mother cell deterioration within a population suggests that the Epulopiscium mother cell undergoes a programmed cell death.

40|$|Current fusion devices {{consist of}} {{multiple}} diagnostics and hundreds or {{even thousands of}} signals. This situation forces on multiple occasions to use distributed data acquisition systems as the best approach. In this type of distributed systems, {{one of the most}} important issues is the synchronization between signals, so that it is possible to have a temporal correlation as accurate as possible between the acquired samples of all channels. In last decades, many fusion devices use different types of video cameras to provide inside views of the vessel during operations and to monitor plasma behavior. The synchronization between each video frame and the rest of the different signals acquired from any other diagnostics is essential in order to know correctly the plasma evolution, since it is possible to analyze jointly all the information having accurate knowledge of their temporal correlation. The developed system described in this paper allows timestamping image frames in a real-time acquisition and processing system using 1588 clock distribution. The system has been implemented using FPGA based devices together with a 1588 <b>synchronized</b> <b>timing</b> card (see Fig. 1). The solution is based on a previous system [1] that allows image acquisition and real-time image processing based on PXIe technology. This architecture is fully compatible with the ITER Fast Controllers [2] and offers integration with EPICS to control and monitor the entire system. However, this set-up is not able to timestamp the frames acquired since the frame grabber module does not present any type of timing input (IRIG-B, GPS, PTP). To solve this lack, an IEEE 1588 PXI timing device its used to provide an accurate way to synchronize distributed data acquisition systems using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) IEEE 1588 2008 standard. This local timing device can be connected to a master clock device for global synchronization. The timing device has a buffer timestamp for each PXI trigger line and requires tha- a software application assigns each frame the corresponding timestamp. The previous action is critical and cannot be achieved if the frame rate is high. To solve this problem, it has been designed a solution that distributes the clock from the IEEE 1588 timing card to all FlexRIO devices [3]. This solution uses two PXI trigger lines that provide the capacity to assign timestamps to every frame acquired and register events by hardware in a deterministic way. The system provides a solution for timestamping frames to synchronize them with the rest of the different signals...|$|E

40|$|Performance {{information}} {{is essential to}} the design of efficient parallel programs. Whether the programmer has total control over determining the parallel execution of processes or whether some automatic means are used to parallelize serial or partially parallel code, the cost of the overhead due to parallelization must be known. This is especially important in systems where the costs of such mechanisms are high. In distributed memory systems, message passing is the primary means of communication between parallel processes, and message passing tends to be quite expensive. Users of such systems wrestle with a variety of questions related to performance issues. How is the data to be distributed among the processors? What grain size (amount of code executed serially on a processor) is required for efficient processing? How should the processes be assigned to the system nodes? Approximate answers to these question can be given only if the performance characteristics of the system are known. This paper presents a step towards the development of a performance model for two distributed memory multiprocessor systems, the Intel iPSC/ 2 and iPSC/ 860 hypercubes. From actual timing measurements, we developed formulas to estimate the communication costs on the four possibilities for message passing among multiple processors: a single sender to a single receiver, single sender to multiple receivers, multiple senders to a single receiver, and multiple senders to multiple receivers.

We tested the relationship of beach counts to climate and biogeochemical variables over time in the North Pacific Sub-tropical Gyre (NPSG). Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Change-Point Analysis (CPA), and General Regression Models (GRM) were used to characterize patterns in box jellyfish arrival at Waikiki Beach 8 - 12 days following 173 consecutive full moons. Variation in box jellyfish abundance lacked seasonality, but exhibited dramatic differences among months and among years, and followed an oscillating pattern with significant periods of increase (1998 - 2001; 2006 - 2011) and decrease (2001 - 2006). Of three climatic and 12 biogeochemical variables examined, box jellyfish showed a strong, positive relationship with primary production, > 2 mm zooplankton biomass, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index. It is clear that that the moon cycle {{plays a key role}} in <b>synchronizing</b> <b>timing</b> of the arrival of Alatina moseri medusae to shore.

In many neuronal cell types, tonic inhibition is mediated by delta subunit-containing GABA(A) Rs. We found that the frequency of in vitro cholinergically induced gamma oscillations in the mouse hippocampal CA 3 region was increased by the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) on interneurons. The NMDAR-dependent increase of gamma oscillation frequency was counteracted by the tonic inhibition of the interneurons mediated by delta subunit-containing GABA(A) Rs. Recordings of synaptic currents during gamma activity revealed that NMDAR-mediated increases in oscillation frequency correlated with a progressive synchronization of phasic excitation and inhibition in the network. Thus, the balance between tonic excitation and tonic inhibition of interneurons may modulate gamma frequency by shaping interneuronal synchronization...|$|R

40|$|SummaryLittle {{is known}} about the active {{positioning}} of transcripts outside of embryogenesis or highly polarized cells. We show here that a specific G 1 cyclin transcript is highly clustered in the cytoplasm of large multinucleate cells. This heterogeneous cyclin transcript localization results from aggregation of an RNA-binding protein, and deletion of a polyglutamine stretch in this protein results in random transcript localization. These multinucleate cells are remarkable in that nuclei cycle asynchronously despite sharing a common cytoplasm. Notably, randomization of cyclin transcript localization significantly diminishes nucleus-to-nucleus differences in the number of mRNAs and <b>synchronizes</b> cell-cycle <b>timing.</b> Thus, nonrandom cyclin transcript localization is important for cell-cycle timing control and arises due to polyQ-dependent behavior of an RNA-binding protein.
