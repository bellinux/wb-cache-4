5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} {{elements were}} <b>still</b> <b>missing</b> from the periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) {{the last two}} unknown non-radioactive elements. Since rhenium was discovered in 1908, hafnium was the last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|In early 1973, {{with the}} ransom money <b>still</b> <b>missing,</b> The Oregon Journal republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person to turn in a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E

The builders hastily equipped the ship with rudder controls built for Poltava and delivered the ship for her sea trials on , 1896.

5|$|In Nova Scotia, Able {{produced}} hurricane-force winds, {{the only}} land along its path to receive such winds; {{a gust of}} 99mph (160km/h) was reported in Halifax. The hurricane also dropped heavy rainfall, including over 4.92inches (125mm) in Annapolis Valley. Initially there were three fishing boats missing throughout the region, although two later returned to harbor. By August22, the third was <b>still</b> <b>missing</b> over the Grand Banks, which prompted a rescue team {{to search for the}} boat. Many other boats crashed against the coast, and two children died when their raft capsized. Two bridges and several roadways were washed out or flooded, and in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, floodwaters left roadways impassable. On land, Able produced heavy damage estimated at over $1million (CAD), half of which in Annapolis Valley, and split between crops, communications, and fishing industries.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{there was}} a total of seven {{depressions}} and four cyclonic storms. The most intense and deadly tropical cyclone of the season, the West Bengal cyclone, lashed that province of India and Bangladesh {{in the month of}} November. Rough seas offshore caused at least 173drownings offshore Bangladesh and India, while over 100people were left missing. In West Bengal alone, 124fatalities were reported, with over one hundred people <b>still</b> <b>missing.</b> Flooding occurred there and some areas of Bangladesh, particularly the capital city of Dhaka. Another notable storm was the Oman cyclone in May. It made a rare landfall in the Omani region of Dhofar. The storm brought historic rainfall to Oman, which in turn brought flooding to the region. Nine people drowned and damage to property, crops, and transportation reached $25million (2002USD).|$|E

5|$|The {{significance}} of atomic numbers {{to the organization}} of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood. Mendeleev's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known. Substitution of atomic numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, and Moseley predicted (in 1913) that the only elements <b>still</b> <b>missing</b> between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72 and 75, all of which were later discovered. The sequence of atomic numbers is still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.|$|E
