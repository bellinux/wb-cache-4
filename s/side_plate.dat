5|$|Use-wear {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the plates on the pommel and the crossguard {{were made by the}} same artist, while the plates on the grip were added later. The latter – obverse and reverse – were probably decorated in the same workshop and using the same tools, but by two different craftsmen. Moreover, a <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> with a rhombic pattern was added in the 19th century to replace one of the lost inscripted side plates.|$|E

500|$|The Immortal title belt was {{replaced}} by the third design of the championship belt at the March 14, 2011 tapings of the March 17 episode of Impact!, introduced by the reigning champion at the time, Sting. The design featured seven gold plates over a black leather strap. The center plate had faux diamonds aligned along its multiple rounded edges, {{similar to that of the}} Big Gold Belt. Over the center plate was a large TNA Wrestling logo and below it the words [...] "Heavyweight Champion" [...] engraved in silver. On each side of the center plate was a group of three smaller plates, one with a TNA logo engraved while the other two featured separate corresponding halves of a globe, on either side of the TNA logo <b>side</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} gun {{suffered from}} a weakness related {{to the design of}} the receiver—under field conditions, the bottom plates, which were dovetailed into the gun's two <b>side</b> <b>plates,</b> tore out. An early fix was to attach a roughly horseshoe-shaped steel bracket around the rearmost part of the receiver. A later fix was to rivet [...] "stirrups" [...] (right-angled steel pieces) to the bottom and <b>side</b> <b>plates.</b> The stirrup fix became the standard reinforcement until a more permanent fix for the problem was developed. (Another reported problem was bulging in the <b>side</b> <b>plates,</b> which was probably caused by stresses put into the <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> when hammering the dovetails closed.) ...|$|R

No major crack was observed within the region covered by the <b>side</b> <b>plates,</b> which is probably due to the confining effect of the plates with stud bolts. It was also observed that due to the catenary force many tension cracks formed along the beam length.|$|R

500|$|Known as the Meiji 26 Nen Ken Ju (meaning [...] "Pistol, Pattern of the 26th {{year of the}} Meiji era"), the Type 26 {{revolver}} was {{the first}} indigenous revolver adopted by the Japanese military. The Type 26 was produced to replace the aging Smith & Wesson New Model No. 3 and was officially adopted March 29, 1894. The design is widely {{believed to be a}} mixture of features taken from other revolvers. The lock design is similar to Galand designs, the hinged frame is similar to Smith & Wesson designs, and the hinged <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> covering the lock is similar to the Modèle 1892 revolver. The cartridge was loaded with black powder until 1900 when the cartridges began to be loaded with smokeless powder. The Type 26 is considered a remarkable leap in Japanese pistol development despite the international [...] influence, with the matchlock being the most common domestic Japanese handgun 40 years earlier. Production stopped after 1923 when much of the Koishikawa Arsenal was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, with assembly continuing until the exhaustion of stockpiled parts. Approximately 59,000 Type 26 revolvers were produced and an additional 900 revolvers were made in pre-production. Restoration and re-issue of revolvers that had been removed from service because of damage or wear, was carried out on an as needed basis over a period of many years. The original Type 26s are missing the external markings of later produced revolvers and are identifiable by numbers stamped on internal parts. Type 26s were still being used in 1945 which, according to firearms expert and author Ian Hogg, is considered a testament to their original workmanship and a much more suitable combat weapon than later Japanese produced pistols.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} between incident waves and a floating rectangular breakwater with the vertical porous <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> {{has been investigated}} {{in the context of}} the two-dimensional linear potential theory. The matched eigenfunction expansion method(MEEM) for multiple domains is applied to obtain the analytic solutions. The dependence of the transmitted coefficients and motion responses on the design parameters, such as porosity and protruding depth of <b>side</b> <b>plates,</b> is systematically analyzed. It is found that the non-dimensional wavelength where the sudden drop of transmission coefficients occurs, corresponds to the heave resonant frequency obtained from Ruol et al. (2013) for π-type floating breakwater. It is concluded that both properly selected porosity and deeper protruding depth of <b>side</b> <b>plates</b> are helpful in reducing the transmission coefficients and also extending the wider applicable extent of incident wavelength for performance enhancement...|$|R

5000|$|After Marlin {{started making}} the Colt 1914s, it {{developed}} an improved {{version of the}} M1895. In 1917 this {{was adopted by the}} US Army as a training weapon and approximately 2,500 were purchased. Besides its designation of Colt-Browning M1895/14, it was also called the [...] "Marlin Gun" [...] and [...] "Model 1917". The primary improvement was the use of a detachable barrel, a more generous <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> cut-out and a sliding door on the right <b>side</b> <b>plate</b> opening (also made larger) for easier access. Despite these improvements, the Marlin was limited to 500 rounds of continuous fire due to a tendency to overheat.
