5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically {{in response to a}} change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on <b>specific</b> <b>rules,</b> children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E

CARB's rulemaking included ILUC. For some biofuels, CARB identified land use changes as {{a significant source of}} additional GHG emissions. It established one standard for gasoline and alternative fuels, and a second for diesel fuel and its replacements.|$|E
5|$|GR is {{the better}} known of the two romanization systems which {{indicate}} the four tones of Mandarin by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers discriminate between otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the tones with either diacritics (for example Pinyin: āi, ái, ǎi and ài) or numbers (Wade–Giles: ai1, ai2, etc.). GR spells the same four tones ai, air, ae and ay. These spellings, which follow <b>specific</b> <b>rules,</b> indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ai.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Data Mining {{techniques}} {{are useful for}} analyzing data from many different dimensions and for identifying relationships. Non-parametric data models are explored and a heuristic approach is proposed for <b>specific</b> <b>rule</b> generation in practical cases. The most suited algorithm for a specific application is presented and learning methods evaluation is given. A problem of feature extraction and <b>specific</b> <b>rule</b> inferring from heart diseases data set is considered and experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|In packet {{classification}} problem a best matching rule is found for incoming packet {{using one of}} the following rule, first matching <b>rule,</b> most <b>specific</b> <b>rule,</b> or highest priority rule. While {{packet classification}} problem on prefix router table with most <b>specific</b> <b>rule</b> was substantially studied, the one with highest priority rule hasn’t. We propose a dynamic data structure BOB for packet classification with highest priority rule that matches the given destination address. BOB can be used for general nonintersecting range router table (including prefix router table). When constraining to prefix router table, further improvements for BOB are presented, BO-BIP for highest priority rule and BOBIPV for most <b>specific</b> <b>rule.</b> As in experiment results, the proposed data structure achieve the good balance between lookup time, update time and memory requirement. ...|$|R

5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E
5|$|There are no <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> {{that apply}} to acts or {{omissions}} in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{four people}} {{can play in}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which has <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches {{are two of the}} multiplayer modes of play. This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team has lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when time expires, which causes the round to end in sudden death.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on <b>specific</b> <b>rules,</b> children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
