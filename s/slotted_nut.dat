5000|$|A {{castellated}} nut, {{also called}} a castle nut or <b>slotted</b> <b>nut,</b> is a nut with slots (notches) cut into one end. [...] The {{name comes from}} the nutâ€™s resemblance to the crenellated parapet of a medieval castle.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{chainring}} bolt. These {{are used}} in various lengths both to join rings and to fasten the assembly to the spider of the crank. While some have recessed hex fittings in both screw and nut, some like this have a <b>slotted</b> <b>nut</b> that {{requires the use of}} a special tool.|$|E
50|$|The bolt or axle has one or {{two holes}} drilled through its {{threaded}} end. The nut is torqued properly and then, if the slot is not aligned with {{the hole in the}} fastener, the nut is rotated forward to the nearest <b>slot.</b> The <b>nut</b> is then secured with a split pin/cotter pin, R-clip or safety wire. It is a positive locking device.|$|R
50|$|Several factors affect fretted {{instrument}} intonation, including {{depth of}} the string <b>slots</b> in the <b>nut,</b> bridge saddle position, {{the position of the}} frets themselves, and the technique of the musician.|$|R
5000|$|GA {{split beam}} nut, {{also known as}} a split hex <b>nut</b> or <b>slotted</b> beam <b>nut,</b> is a locknut with slots cut in the top that {{separate}} the outside end into two or more sections that are bent slightly inward, making the thread diameter undersized in the slotted portion. As the nut is threaded on, these sections are forced back out to their original position and increase the friction between the nut and the fastener, creating the locking action.|$|R
50|$|String <b>slots</b> in a <b>nut</b> {{without a}} zero fret must be {{cut to the}} proper depth to make string height correct. Strings that are too low at the nut can buzz against the frets, and too high throws off {{intonation}} of fretted notes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{cause of}} poor {{intonation}} on a fretted instrument {{is that the}} maker didn't cut the string <b>slots</b> in the <b>nut</b> deep enough. If the string is higher than fret height at the nut, the string deflection-caused pitch increase is progressively greater closer to the nut.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{may have}} come from the German Nut (pronounced [...] "noot"), meaning groove or <b>slot.</b> The <b>nut,</b> however, is called a de:Sattel ("saddle"; also Obersattel) in German, whereas the part of a guitar known as the saddle in English, the surface of the bridge on which the strings rest, is called a de:Stegeinlage or Steg, in German. In French, the nut is known as a :fr:sillet, which, like German, can also {{translate}} to mean saddle. The Italian term, capo tasto (or capotasto; [...] "head of fretboard"), is the origin of the capo.|$|R
5000|$|Some guitars have {{a rolling}} nut. In this design, made popular by the Fender company, the strings sit on roller {{bearings}} instead of <b>nut</b> <b>slots.</b> The rollers let the string freely slide or roll through the nut. The roller nut {{helps keep the}} guitar in tune by preventing the strings from getting stuck in the nut.|$|R
50|$|The System II tremolo {{system was}} {{designed}} by John Page, Chip Todd and Charlie Gressett.The System III tremolo system {{was designed by}} John Page, Dan Smith, Charlie Gressett and John Carruthers. The System I, II and III tremolo systems were manufactured in Germany by Schaller.Sometimes parts of the tremolo system are lost and one common modification {{is to make the}} bridge function as a hardtail by locking the bridge into a non movable position and installing a string tree for the first and second strings so that the strings don't slip out of the <b>nut</b> <b>slots.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} nut made {{of relatively}} soft plastic or bone will easily clamp the string and make fine tuning difficult. The clamping effect does not only result from too narrow <b>nut</b> <b>slots,</b> but notably {{more from the}} impression of the string windings into the nut material {{at the bottom of}} the slot. That effect is more prevalent with wire wound nylon strings than with steel strings. Using a zero fret relieves the pressure from the nut material and the nut serves only to center the strings sideways. Tuning is smooth and without sudden movement and intonation jumps. There are only a few manufacturers making metal (bronze)conventional nuts which avoid the string clamping effect.|$|R
