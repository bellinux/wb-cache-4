40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} {{existing}} evidence {{that supports the}} <b>subconjunctival</b> <b>use</b> of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) {{in the treatment of}} various ophthalmic diseases. Methods: A literature search was performed for published articles about the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic characteristics of triamcinolone, as well as its potential ophthalmic use, focused mainly in the subconjunctival mode of delivery. Search terms included corticosteroids, triamcinolone, ocular, subconjunctival, and ophthalmic. Results: Corticosteroids represent the mainstay of treatment of ocular inflammation, exerting their action by affecting multiple pathways of the inflammatory response, making them particularly effective in the majority of cases. However, due to the number and severity of the side effects associated with their use, they have to be given with caution. Corticosteroids can be given topically, subconjunctivally, intraocularly, and systemically to treat a variety of ocular diseases with specific pharmacological and PK characteristics. Triamcinolone {{is one of the most}} widely used corticosteroids in the treatment of ocular inflammation. This glucocorticoid used subconjunctivally was proven to be particularly safe and effective in some common and important inflammatory ophthalmic diseases such as anterior scleritis, uveitis, and corneal graft rejection. Further, there are other indications for its successful use where data exist, but somehow less abundant. Conclusions: This article highlights the potential of TA to complement the treatment armamentarium of anterior segment inflammation...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Ten {{patients}} received ocular gentamicin therapy topically or subconjunctivally. Systemic absorption was not detected after {{topical use}} but was detected after subconjunctival administration. The relative safety of ocular gentamicin therapy is discussed and {{the literature is}} reviewed. Gentamicin instilled topically as eyedrops or sub-conjunctivally is commonly used to treat eye infections. It {{is well known that}} gentamicin can produce ototoxicity, particularly in patients with renal disease, as this drug is almost entirely excreted by the kidney (Goodman and Gilman, 1975). Previous experiments in man have indicated systemic absorption following <b>subconjunctival</b> <b>use,</b> but the results are conflicting (Furgiuele, 1970; Mathalone and Harden, 1972). We believe this to be the first attempt to evaluate the systemic absorption of gentamicin following both topical and subconjuncti-val administration. Patients and methods Ten patients were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of 4 children and 1 adult who had been admitted for routine squint surgery. They were treated with topical gentamicin drops (Genticin 0 - 3 %O drops) instilled 2 -hourly into both eyes for a 5 -day period until between 20 and 38 mg of the drug had been administered (Table 1). Urine was collected over 24 hours after the last dose was administered and analysed for gentamicin by bacteriological (Alcid and Seligman, 1973) and radioimmuno assay (RIA) techniques. Group II consisted of 5 adult post-cataract patients who were given either 10 or 20 mg of gentamicin subconjunctivally. Blood was removed 1, 2, and 4 to 6 hours after subconjunctival injection. After centrifugation the serum concentration of gentamicin was determined by RIA using a ki...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is described that overcomes {{the two biggest}} problems facing the surgeon when dissecting a pterygium from the cornea-bleeding and eye movement. Our technique however, requires only minimal anesthesia (topical and <b>subconjunctival)</b> and the <b>use</b> of a disposable speculum and suction ring. An added advantage is this particular speculum gives good exposure of the superior bulbar conjunctiva; this facilitates harvesting a conjunctival autograft...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose:to {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of a surgical and pharmacological combined treatment in high-risk failure perforating keratoplasty (PKP) Methods: 10 eyes of 10 patients with pre-exhisting corneal neovascularization due to different corneal pathologies, and mean visual acuity lower than 0. 69 LogMAR (min 1. 3 to max 0. 39 LogMAR) were treated using a combined approach: perforating keratoplasty and Anti-Vegf administration. 0. 5 ml bevacizumab injections were performed into four <b>subconjunctival</b> spaces <b>using</b> a 20 G needle. No further injections were made during 1 year follow up that was once {{a day for the}} first week, once a week for the first month and once a month for the first year. During follow up we focused our attention on (eventuale) neovessels growth and on patients’ visual acuity Results: 10 ± 3 days after surgical treatments, all 10 eyes showed a complete regression of pre-exhisting host corneal neovessels. During follow-up time no signs of graft rejections or corneal neovascularization were noticed. In the observed cases, visual acuity improved from 0. 69 to 0. 3 LogMAR, with a mean improvement of 0. 39 LogMAR Conclusions:according to our experience, with the combined approach we observed a complete regression of pre-exhisting corneal neovascularization. Moreover, the treatment prevented from neovessels growth after keratoplasty all follow-up time long. This approach could reduce graft-failure possibility also for corneal transplantations described in literature as "high-risk keratoplastie...|$|R
40|$|THE {{infection}} of the cornea with Pseudomonas pyocyaneus is well known to ophthalmologists. The invasion usually occurs after an injury to the corneal epithelium which may be in itself trivial, such as the trauma caused by the impaction and subsequent removal of a small foreign body. The infection usually appears, within 2 days of the injury and has a typical appearance. The lesion is a very white slough at first and later forms a dense white ring around a relatively translucent central area; if the infection has been present for more than 24 hours an hypopyon may be present. Until recently treatment has been of little avail and either the eye has been entirely lost from perforation or all useful vision has been sacrificed because of gross corneal opacification. Recently the introduction of strep-tomycin and especially of the polymyxins has made the outlook less grave, {{as evidenced by the}} recent observations of Ainslie and Smith (1952) and Bignell (1951), and Williams, Hench, and Guerry (1954) have cured experi-mental infections in rabbits by <b>using</b> <b>subconjunctival</b> injections of Polymyxi...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Laser {{treatment}} for {{retinopathy of prematurity}} (ROP) {{may be associated with}} systemic stress for the infant. No national consensus on the optimum method of anaesthesia for the treatment of ROP currently exists. This study ascertains the anaesthetic practices employed for the treatment of ROP by ophthalmologists in the United Kingdom (UK), and also their attitudes towards these practices. Materials and methods A postal questionnaire was sent to 46 consultant ophthalmologists identified as performing {{treatment for}} ROP in the UK. The consultants were asked to estimate the annual number of babies with ROP that they treated with laser, what methods of anaesthesia they employed, for comments regarding the arrangements for, and types of anaesthesia employed and whether they believed that the neonatal stress response to laser treatment was associated with a significant risk of systemic complications. Results In all, 35 (76 %) questionnaires were returned. A total of 30 (86 %) respondents reported performing laser treatment for ROP. Of these, 15 (50 %) used general anaesthesia for all cases and 11 (37 %) intravenous sedation combined with topical anaesthesia for all cases. Oral sedation combined with topical anaesthesia, rectal chloral hydrate and paracetamol combined with topical anaesthesia, intravenous ketamine combined with topical anaesthesia, and subtenon's local anesthesia were used by one (3 %) respondent each. There were no ophthalmologists <b>using</b> <b>subconjunctival</b> or topical anaesthetic alone or treating without anaesthesia. Conclusion This survey reveals considerable variation in practice among UK ophthalmologists regarding the anaesthetic methods employed in the treatment of ROP, and their beliefs regarding the systemic stress associated with treatment...|$|R
40|$|Retinoblastoma is {{the most}} common primary intraocular {{malignancy}} of childhood. A potentially curable cancer, its treatment has improved significantly over the last few decades. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the literature on various conservative treatment modalities available for the treatment of retinoblastoma and their effectiveness, when used alone or in combination. Pubmed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched through 2012 for published peer reviewed data on conservative treatment modalities for retinoblastoma. Various studies show that while enucleation remains the standard of care for advanced intraocular tumors, conservative modalities that can result in globe salvage and preservation of useful vision are being increasingly employed. Such modalities include systemic chemotherapy, focal consolidation with transpupillary thermotherapy, laser photocoagulation and cryotherapy, plaque brachytherapy, and delivery of local chemotherapy <b>using</b> <b>subconjunctival,</b> sub-tenon, or intra-arterial routes. When used alone or in combination, these treatment modalities can help in avoidance of external beam radiotherapy or enucleation, thus reducing the potential for long-term side effects, while salvaging useful vision. Radioactive plaque brachytherapy has an established role in selected patients with intraocular retinoblastoma. Local injections of chemotherapeutic agents via the sub-tenon or sub-conjunctival route have been used with varying degrees of success, usually as an adjunct to systemic chemotherapy. Intra-arterial ophthalmic artery delivery of melphalan has shown promising results. It is important to recognize that today, several treatment options are available that can obviate the need for enucleation, and cure the cancer with preservation of functional vision. A thorough knowledge and understanding of these conservative treatment modalities is essential for appropriate management...|$|R
40|$|The role of macrophages in Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal {{infection}} in susceptible (cornea perforates), C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) vs resistant (cornea heals), BALB/c mice was tested by depleting macrophages <b>using</b> <b>subconjunctival</b> injections of clodronate-containing liposomes before corneal infection. Both groups of inbred mice treated with clodronate-liposomes compared with PBS-liposomes (controls) exhibited more severe disease. In B 6 mice, the cornea perforated and the eye became extremely shrunken, whereas in BALB/c mice, the cornea perforated rather than healed. The myeloperoxidase assay detected significantly more PMN in the cornea {{of both groups}} of mice treated with clodronate-liposomes vs PBS-liposomes. In independent experiments, ELISA analysis showed that protein levels for IL- 1 �, macrophage-inflammatory protein 2, and macrophage-inflammatory protein 1 �, all regulators of PMN chemotaxis, also were elevated in both groups of mice treated with clodronate-liposomes. Bacterial plate counts in B 6 mice treated with clodronate-liposomes were unchanged at 3 days and were higher in control-treated mice at 5 days postinfection (p. i.), whereas in BALB/c mice, bacterial load was significantly elevated in the cornea of mice treated with clodronate-liposomes at both 3 and 5 days p. i. mRNA expression levels for pro (IFN- � and TNF-�) - and anti (IL- 4 and IL- 10) -inflammatory cytokines also were determined in BALB/c mice treated with clodronate-liposomes vs control-treated mice. Expression levels for IFN- � were significantly elevated in mice treated with clodronate-liposomes at 3 and 5 days p. i., while IL- 10 levels (mRNA and protein) were reduced. These data provide evidence that macrophages control resistance to P. aeruginosa corneal infection through regulation of PMN number, bacterial killing and balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels.

40|$|At present, {{guinea pigs}} have been {{increasingly}} {{used for the}} study of human myopia. However, little is known about involvement of genetics, protein profiles and key molecules in axial growth of the guinea pig eyes in normal and manipulated visual conditions. This study evaluated the suitability of guinea pigs as an animal model {{for the study of}} human refractive errors based on comparison with other currently available species. Various aspects of guinea pigs as an animal model have been researched in this study including the development of refraction and axial components of the guinea pig eye under a normal visual environment, genetic profiles of the guinea pig eye compared with human and mouse eyes, changes in protein profiles, refraction and axial components of the eye during myopic development and recovery (after termination of form deprivation or hyperopic defocus) in response to manipulated visual environments and pharmacological intervention <b>using</b> <b>subconjunctival</b> injection of apomorphine, a non-selective dopamine receptor agonist. Guinea pigs had baseline ocular biometry comparable to humans under a normal visual environment and had similar process of emmetropization compared to humans. Moreover, guinea pigs appeared to be closer to humans than mice based on the ocular gene profiles. Axial myopia induced in guinea pigs was effective. The myopia and recovery were mainly due to changes in vitreous length and choroidal thickness. In respect of pharmacological intervention, a subconjunctival injection of apomorphine could inhibit form-deprivation myopia by slowing axial elongation of the eye in guinea pigs. This study evaluated this myopic animal model comprehensively at the phenotypic genetic and proteomic levels. Guinea pigs are now only the second small animal with detailed gene and protein changes compared to humans. This study the first to use a pharmacological model with detailed dose response curves. Based on the evidence obtained guinea pigs an alternative to other currently available species {{for the study of the}} development of human refractive errors...|$|R
40|$|An {{erodible}} ring-shaped ocular insert containing {{an antibiotic}} (tylosin tartrate) {{has been developed}} for treatment of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK). Four additional tasks have been completed: (1) a test to determine the retention time of the ocular device {{in the eyes of}} the calves, (2) an in vitro test to determine the degradation characteristics of the device, (3) an in vitro study to obtain the drug release profiles of the insert, and (4) a study to compare the use of rings and a field treatment method using infected cattle;The device remained in the eyes an average of 3. 92 days, with the retention time ranging from 1 day to 6 days;The device completely dissolved in saline in 80 days. The device seemed to erode faster {{in the eyes of the}} calves than when used in in vitro tests;The drug release rate from the device after 5 days was still above the minimum release rate of 1. 3 [mu]g/hr required to treat IBK infections;Two groups of Holstein calves were infected with Moraxella bovis, the agent that causes IBK. A comparison of the ocular ring treatment with that of a field method of treatment <b>using</b> <b>subconjunctival</b> injections of Azimycin°ler demonstrated that the treatment using the ring device was significantly more effective than the subconjunctival injection method. Clinical observations showed that the eyes receiving the medicated ocular devices improved while the eyes which were treated with subconjunctival injections of Azimycin°ler remained the same or worsened (p 3 ̆c 0. 008). Also, bacterial evaluations performed by quantatively monitoring the number of bacteria in treated and control eyes for both treatment methods over a test period in excess of 5 days showed that the medicated ocular devices suppressed or kept the bacteria counts low (or nil) as compared to relatively high counts seen in those eyes that were treated with subconjunctival injections of Azimycin°ler (p 3 ̆c 0. 03);The bioerodible ocular device has several advantages over conventional methods, including the subconjunctival injection method, in that it is more effective in treating IBK, is easy to insert, and can provide extended treatment therapy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} of study were to (i) examine the regional differences in methods of performing cataract surgery across different jurisdictions in Australia and New Zealand (ii) identify {{risk factors for}} post-operative endophthalmitis and (iii) explore the implication of changes in surgical practice {{on the number of}} cases of post-operative endophthalmitis and resultant net cost to health system. Methods: Cataract surgeons across Australia and New Zealand were surveyed about their demographics, surgical techniques, use of pre- and post-operative antibiotics and antiseptics and cases of post-operative endophthalmitis. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the regional variations in the use of methods of chemoprophylaxis and surgical practices. Multivariate Poisson regression was performed to identify factors associated with the incidence of post-operative endophthalmitis. A cost analysis was conducted to determine the impact of an increased use of chemoprophylatic treatment on the number of cases of post-operative endophthalmitis and net cost savings to the health system from its use. In addition, the results of the current survey of surgical practices of cataract surgeons was compared with those from an earlier survey conducted approximately 10 years ago. Result: The response to the survey of ophthalmologists was 82 %, but after excluding ophthalmologists who did little or no cataract surgery, the study sample comprised 540 participants of the 896 who were initially sent the survey. Participating cataract surgeons reported 162, 120 cataract surgeries and 92 cases of post-operative endophthalmitis, an incidence rate of 0. 056 %. Regional variations were found in the methods of chemoprophylaxis and surgical techniques. Chloramphenicol was the most frequently used topical antibiotic in Australia, while neomycin was used by majority of cataract surgeons in New Zealand. The only notable change found over the past decade was a sharp fall in <b>use</b> of <b>subconjunctival</b> antibiotics from 75 % to 45 % in the current survey. A slight increase in use of post-operative topical antibiotics was noticed. Subconjunctival injection of antibiotics was the only form of chemoprophylaxis associated with a reduction in incidence of endophthalmitis. Results from this survey indicated that cataract surgeons routinely using corneal or limbal incisions had an incidence of endophthalmitis considerably higher than those surgeons routinely using scleral wounds, whilst surgeons routinely using temporally sited wounds had almost half the incidence of endophthalmitis compared to surgeons using superior wounds. The cost implications of subconjunctival gentamycin injection for chemoprophylaxis were examined. Additional costs of subconjunctival antibiotics were subtracted from the reduced cost of treating fewer cases endophthalmitis. There would potentially be a net saving to the Australian health system of $ 110, 354 if all cataract surgeons <b>used</b> <b>subconjunctival</b> chemoprophylaxis. Conclusion: Regional variation in chemoprophylaxis and surgical techniques did not entirely explain differences in post-operative endophthalmitis incidence. Subconjunctival antibiotics would only need to reduce the incidence of endophthalmitis by 15 % for it to be cost-effective...|$|R
