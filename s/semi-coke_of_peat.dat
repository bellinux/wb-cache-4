Both of the dynamic properties were often related to dynamic loading such as earthquake, moving traffic, machineries and bomb blasting. The study was conducted at western part of Johore such as Parit Sulong and Pontian where deposition <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> soil were exists and recognised as problematic soils to the engineers. This study was carried out to determine the shear {{wave velocity}} <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> soil using Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Wave (MASW) method and estimation shear modulus <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> using empirical formula. To use the empirical formula, the density <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> soil was also needed thus using the peat sampler for every 0. 5 meter depth to obtain the density. From the MASW test for both test sites, the shear velocity <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> at Parit Sulong is between 40 m/s and 55 m/s until depth of 1. 5 m meanwhile at Pontian, the shear wave velocity between 21 m/s and 67 m/s until 2. 5 m depth. Using shear velocity, shear modulus <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> were estimated for Parit Sulong are ranged between 1575 kPa – 3514 kPa and Pontian are ranged between 385 kPa – 5117 kPa.

30|$|Peat {{has special}} natural {{characteristics}} and engineering properties {{due to the}} high content of organic matter. The composition and structure <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> are complicated, and organic matter in peat can be compressible.

Peat has special three phase composition containing gas bubbles, water, compressible organic matters and incompressible minerals. A consolidation model is proposed to study the deformation behavior <b>of</b> <b>peat.</b> The deformation <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> is considered as a coupling process of the volume change of gas bubbles, compression of organic matter and the drainage of water.

40|$|Peatlands in Ireland have {{accumulated}} {{large amounts of}} carbon from the atmosphere since the last ice age. In their natural state, peatlands act as sinks of carbon dioxide, but sources of methane. In Ireland, four million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> is extracted annually to produce 6 % of the total primary energy requirement.

40|$|It is {{important}} to know the behavior <b>of</b> <b>peat,</b> especially the stress-strain <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> soil. Peat cannot support too much load on it because <b>of</b> <b>peats</b> have very low strength, high compressibility and long-term settlement. The suitable method to achieve the objective of this research study is using the direct simple shear test. It will be compared with the direct shear test. Peat is in anisotropy condition and contain fibric, so peat cannot be tested with all devices of shear strength test. Normal stresses are 12. 5 kPa, 25 kPa, 50 kPa and 100 kPa with 0. 1 mm/min rate of shear.
