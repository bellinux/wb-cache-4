60|$|Her eyebrows were faintly contracted. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him pathetically.|$|E
60|$|Wingate laughed softly. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed mutely. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} bright, unquailing eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a swift bright look; next moment shakes her head, sighs, and looks down again.|$|R
60|$|RAINA (placing {{her hands}} on his {{shoulder}} as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with admiration and worship). My hero! My king.|$|R
60|$|I came {{slowly back}} to the table, and stood facing her across it. <b>She</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me with very piteous eyes.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, half smiling, half pouting; {{altogether}} bewitching.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} brooding. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him {{suddenly}} in surprise.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Britling {{as if she}} {{measured}} his understanding.|$|E
6000|$|... [Throughout {{all this}} MRS. MEGAN has sat stolidly before the [...] fire, but as FERRAND {{suddenly}} steps forward <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> [...] him.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harold did," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me triumphantly; [...] "he beat all the boys, {{and had to}} {{come back}} again to Boola Boola." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{places a}} cushion for her, and prepares tea; <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> [...] him softly, {{but as he}} {{finishes}} and turns to her, she drops that [...] glance.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} her grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.|$|E
60|$|The woman hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the clock}} and down again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him almost}} {{for the first}} time since her entrance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quelle belle nuit!" [...] cried <b>she,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the stars--the {{moon was}} now gone {{down behind the}} broad tower of Jean Baptiste. [...] "Qu'il fait bon? que l'air est frais!" ...|$|R
60|$|EILEEN. Yes--for good. (<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his averted face. He remains silent. She {{continues}} apprehensively.) You don't say anything. I thought--you'd be glad. You've {{always told}} me it was the honourable thing to do.|$|R
60|$|As {{he looks}} down <b>at</b> her, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and whimpers: ‘My lungs is weakly; my lungs is dreffle bad. Poor me, poor me, my cough is {{rattling}} dry!’ and coughs in confirmation horribly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him shyly, {{yet with}} unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a little grimace and patted his hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} an {{expression}} of pleading in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|He takes {{back the}} sheet of paper, {{clutches}} his brow, and crosses to [...] the door. As he passes FAITH, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with eyes full of [...] expression. JOHNNY catches the look, jibs ever so little, and goes [...] out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I not," [...] says <b>she,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him and sneaking {{close to}} his vest, [...] "and now I say it again, {{and it is to}} last forever. Look, Dick, at its leaves, how wet they are. Those are my tears, and it was {{thinking}} of you that made them fall." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{drinking}} {{in his words}} with eager pleasure.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and answered, not him, but her own thoughts.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{and to his}} amazement {{her eyes}} were swimming.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. He stood {{a shadowy}} {{presence}} beyond the light.|$|E
60|$|He pats {{her on the}} shoulder. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} beaming eyes and he goes out, much moved. Having {{disposed}} of him, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> at Tanner. His back being turned to her, she gives a moment's attention to her personal appearance, then softly goes to him and speaks almost into his ear.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, smiling {{through the}} tears that suffused er eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which name {{were you}} {{speaking}} of?" [...] rejoins <b>she</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{with all her}} native Irish humour flashing up {{for a moment in}} her naughty eyes. The next minute she would have given her hand not to have said it; for, with a very terrible word, Elsley springs to his feet and dashes out of the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a {{sound and}} saw her father {{standing}} in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{a slight}} {{sinister}} smile contracted her white face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and he {{saw that}} her face was unusually pale.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> paused, <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her companion, {{and stopped}} another {{compliment}} on the incorrigible Allan's lips.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he stopped}} in front of Clementina; <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> helplessly <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and he resumed his walk.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> Phillips <b>at</b> the House, {{and gave}} him Greyson's message. He had just {{returned}} from Folkestone, and was worried.|$|R
