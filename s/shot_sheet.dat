5000|$|This {{engagement}} was John Paul Jones' last {{battle in}} the cause of American freedom, but he soon had to forestall a budding mutiny. He uncovered a plot by the English seamen whom he had enlisted from among British prisoners of war in France to fill out his crew (built around survivors from Bonhomme Richard), to take over Ariel; Jones put the troublemakers in irons. The rest of her voyage was uneventful; Ariel finally reached Philadelphia with her badly needed military stores—which included 437 barrels of gunpowder, 146 chests of arms, a large quantity of <b>shot,</b> <b>sheet</b> lead, and much medicine—on 18 February 1781.|$|E

60|$|In his jump he bumped {{against the}} nose of a Dragon behind him, which opened its mouth to growl and <b>shot</b> another <b>sheet</b> of flame at him. The flame was bright, but not very hot, yet Woot screamed with terror and sprang forward with a great bound. This time he landed on the paw of the great Chief Dragon, who angrily raised his other front paw and struck the Green Monkey a fierce blow. Woot went sailing {{through the air and}} fell {{sprawling}} upon the rocky floor far beyond the place where the Dragon Tribe was grouped.|$|R
50|$|Bert Stern first {{published}} The Last Sitting in 1982. The book included {{a large number}} of the over 2,500 images that Stern had <b>shot,</b> including contact <b>sheets</b> with images Monroe had disliked and crossed out. In the book, Stern recounted being enchanted by Monroe until a near-intimate encounter after the second day of shooting; he then realized that she was deeply troubled.|$|R
50|$|His {{most recent}} {{photographs}} of landscapes viewed {{through the windows}} of customized vehicles achieve the widescreen grandeur of CinemaScope film and provide the viewer the sensation of occupying the driver’s seat. He <b>shot</b> hundreds of <b>sheets</b> of film for each landscape in an attempt to capture the perfect vista, but ultimately collaged various details to produce landscapes that most closely adhered to his ideal.|$|R
50|$|Eric {{follows a}} path of further self-destruction, visiting his {{potential}} murderer, former employee Richard Sheets a.k.a. Benno Levin. Eric seems ready to commit suicide, but instead deliberately shoots himself in the hand. Sheets/Levin, who feels adrift in the capitalist system, explains that Eric's mistake in speculating was looking for perfect symmetry and patterns in the currency market: he should have looked for the lopsided—his body with its asymmetrical prostate was telling him this. The film ends with the potential murderer holding a gun to Eric's head threatening to kill him, but does not show a final <b>shot.</b> As <b>Sheets</b> points the gun to Eric's head, Eric seems to have overcome the fear of death and waiting for it.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic {{shot peening}} (USP) on AALY 12 sheet was studied. Several {{parameters}} (arc heights, surface roughness, surface topography and micro hardness) with different USP process parameters were measured. The research proposes that {{radius of curvature}} of <b>shot</b> peened <b>sheet</b> increases with time and electric current decreasing, while increases with pin diameter increasing, and radius of curvature reaches a saturation level after a specific processing time and electric current. An empirical model {{of the relationship between}} radius of curvature and pin diameter, electric current, time was also obtained. The research shows that the increment of surface and vertical micro hardness of material is more obvious with longer time and higher value of electric current, which can be up to 20 % and 28 % respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} on different <b>shot</b> peened <b>sheets</b> of Armco iron and the steel C 60. The residual stress (RS) distributions have been determined by the X-ray method and by the bending arrow etching method. From these results, the residual stress distributions of first, second (and third) kind have been evaluated. The nondestructive testing {{has been carried out}} using the magnetic Barkhausen noise method. From these Barkhausen noise events which are rectified and recorded over the tangential field strength, different stress and microstructure sensitive quantities have been derived. The most important parameter for these testing procedures is the analyzing frequency. This investigation has shown that shot peened surface states can be characterized by these micromagnetic quantities: especially the homogeneity of shot peened-, the work-hardened profile- and the quantitative (after calibration) residual surface-stress state...|$|R
5000|$|Hyo-jung is {{revealed}} to have <b>shot</b> the music <b>sheet</b> at Young-eon`s throat {{in the first}} scene out of anger at losing her voice. Seon-min thinks Young-eon should move on and [...] "cross over". Young-eon is angered by her statement, since she wants {{nothing more than to}} live again. Not long after, Young-eon kills Cho-ah and takes over Seon-min's body. After talking to her reflection at her locker, Young-eon-in-Seon-min walks alongside Seon-min's mother, talking about how as soon as she is old enough she will learn to drive.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the direct-adhesion polymer metal hybrid (PMH) {{technology}} has been increasingly used in replacing all-steel load-bearing structural components especially in automotive front-end modules. This work investigates correlations between the surface topography of aluminum sheet, injection overmolding process parameters and adhesion between polymer and metal. To this end several mold surfaces were prepared by <b>shot</b> peening aluminum <b>sheets.</b> Adhesion was measured using the shear test. Different microscopy techniques were implemented: optical microscopy for statistical characterization of adhesion at different process conditions, scanning electron and scanning probe for characterization of the adhesion phenomenon at the micro- and nano-scale...|$|R
5000|$|Seeing {{his friend}} shot down, John Lang rushed down Main Street to the Equity Bar. Finding his friends there, he demanded extra weapons from the bartender. The three {{remaining}} LS ranch hands rushed out towards the Jenkins Saloon. They {{went around the}} back, just as Lem Woodruff, Louis Bousman, Charley and Tom Emory — under the now-identified aliases of [...] "Squirrel-Eye Charley" [...] (Charles August Arnim), [...] "Poker Tom" [...] (William Oscar Arnim), and [...] "The Catfish Kid" [...] (John Gough) — exited {{the back door of}} the saloon. Gunfire erupted immediately. Woodruff and Charley Emory were shot first. As Frank Valley ran towards the door of an adobe shack behind the saloon from which gunfire had erupted, he was shot in the head as soon he opened the door to enter. Chilton <b>shot</b> Jesse <b>Sheets,</b> a local restaurant owner, in the face, and he fell dead. Chilton was then shot in the chest by someone shooting from a woodpile outside the saloon. Dying, he handed his gun to Lang.|$|R
50|$|Calcite {{crystals}} {{line the}} sides and bottom of water-filled cavities. Variations of level at different periods are marked by rings, ridges and ruffled margins. These are strongly marked about Broaddus Lake and the curved ramparts of the Castles on the Rhine. Here also are polished stalagmites, a rich buff slashed with white, and others, like huge mushrooms, with a velvety coat of red, purple or olive-tinted crystals. In {{some of the smaller}} basins with an excess of carbonic acid, there is formed, besides the crystal bed below, a film above, <b>shot</b> like a <b>sheet</b> of ice across the surface. One pool 12 ft wide is thus covered so as to show but a third of its surface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} {{in an attempt to}} improve fatigue strength of materials by creating compressive residual stresses in the surface layers {{as a result of the}} shot peening process. For example, during exploitation of the separating screener, some parts of screen sieve plate situated near the fixed edge undergo the largest deformation caused by impact bending and need special treatment. In this paper, the results of experimental tests are presented to analyse the effect of micro shot peening on surface layer characteristics and fatigue strength of steel sheet specimens. The effect of shot peening is more visible when fatigue life is taking into account. Thus, the use of <b>shot</b> peening of <b>sheet</b> surface made it possible to increase fatigue life of screener sieve...|$|R
40|$|The {{hardness}} is {{a resistance}} {{for the local}} plastic deformation producing the stress field itself. The hardness number, therefore, is affected by applied or residual stresses. In order to clarify the influences of residual stresses on the hardness numbers quantitatively, <b>shot</b> peening and <b>sheet</b> bending were performed for a medium carbon steel (C: 0. 45 %). Hardness and residual stress measurements were made using a micro-Vickers hardness tester and a X-ray diffractometer respectively. The following results are obtained; (1) Hardness numbers increase in the compressive stress field induced by shot peening. (2) The maximum hardness increment was 13 HV in the compressive stress field. (3) The influences of compressive residual stresses induced by shot peening on the hardness number {{are similar to the}} case of sheet bending. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of arms, {{including}} cannons and small arms, bowls and storage jars, surgical and carpentry tools, as well as wooden pieces of the hull and metal pieces from the rigging, have been recovered from the wreck. Arms on the ship included two bombardettas, fifteen versos (a type of breech-loading swivel gun), haquebuts, haquebuzes (a smaller type of arquebus), grenades, crossbows and quarrels, swords, daggers, breech chambers (powder cartridges) for the bombardetas and versos, <b>shot</b> molds and <b>sheets</b> of lead to be melted as needed to make shot. The wreck also contained many pot sherds {{from a variety of}} olive jars, escudillas (bowls) and lebrillos (basins) of styles typical of Spanish and Portuguese pottery of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Some more crudely made vessels of uncertain provenance were also found.|$|R

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the utilization of}} radioactively contaminated lead shot located at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) for radiation shielding on a radioactive liquid process tank located at Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W). The use of previously contaminated shot precludes the radioactive contamination of clean shot. With limited treatment and disposal options for contaminated lead shot, the reuse of lead for shielding is significant due to the inherent characteristic of becoming a mixed waste when radiologically contaminated. The INEL conducted a lead cleanup campaign in 1990. This was designed to ensure control of potential Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulated waste. Contaminated lead from throughout the INEL, was containerized per the lead Waste Acceptance Criteria at the generator sites. Limited areas at the INEL are designated for mixed waste storage. As a result, some of the lead was stored at the RWMC in the air support weather shield (ASWS). This lead was contaminated with small amounts of fission product contamination. The lead was {{in the form of}} <b>shot,</b> brick, <b>sheet,</b> casks, and other various sized pieces. In 1993, ANL-W identified a need for lead shot to be used as shielding in a radioactive liquid waste storage and processing tank at the Fuel Cycle Facility (FCF). The contaminated lead used on this project had been in storage as mixed waste at the RWMC. This paper will focus on the processes and problems encountered to utilize the contaminated lead shot...|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} study the {{response}} in materials exposed to high energy laser pulses has been developed in this thesis. The method is based on focused and defocused Speckle Correlation and uses an illumination cw laser and digital camera to acquire images of speckle patterns. These images were captured using a CCD camera before, {{during and after the}} laser drilling processing and were saved in a computer. All image processing was performed after the drilling process has been finished. By using this method the size of the affected zone, in-plane strain, surface tilt and surface deformations can be quantified with the temporal resolution limited by the frequency of the camera being used. This thesis comprises three papers. One conference paper was presented at the International Conference on Laser-Matter Interaction in St. Petersburg 2003, and two papers were submitted to Applied Optics. Results are shown from single <b>shot</b> interaction on <b>sheets</b> of Al 2 O 3 and stainless steel as well as responses in sheets of copper and silver during percussion hole drilling. The results obtained during processing are also compared with SEM images. It is concluded that the method gives valuable information about the drilling process and that it is a robust and highly sensitive alternative to Interferometry for the study of laser-matter interaction processes.
