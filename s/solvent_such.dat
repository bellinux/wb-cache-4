5|$|These {{facts are}} {{obscured}} by the omission of the solvent from the expression that is normally used to define pKa, but pKa values obtained in a given mixed solvent {{can be compared to}} each other, giving relative acid strengths. The same is true of pKa values obtained in a particular non-aqueous <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> a DMSO.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically {{have a high}} affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic <b>solvent,</b> <b>such</b> as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used as}} a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} is {{performed in a}} polar <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as dimethylformamide (DMF), often {{in the presence of}} lithium chloride, which accelerates the reaction.|$|E
50|$|For {{textiles}} that {{cannot be}} cleaned with water (such as textiles with water-soluble dyes), dry cleaning using organic <b>solvents,</b> <b>such</b> as perchlorethylene or trichlorethylene, or petroleum <b>solvents,</b> <b>such</b> as white spirits, is recommended.|$|R
50|$|Commonly used {{solvents}} are polar aprotic <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as THF, DMSO, Acetonitrile, DMF {{as well as}} in non-polar aprotic <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as toluene. Neat solvents or {{a mixture}} of solvents may be used.|$|R
50|$|COC and COP are {{generally}} attacked by non-polar <b>solvents,</b> <b>such</b> as toluene. COC shows good chemical resistance and barrier to other <b>solvents,</b> <b>such</b> as alcohols, {{and is very}} resistant to attack from acids and bases.|$|R
25|$|Butadiene is {{typically}} {{isolated from the}} other four-carbon hydrocarbons produced in steam cracking by extractive distillation using a polar aprotic <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as acetonitrile, N-methylpyrrolidone, furfural, or dimethylformamide, from which it is then stripped by distillation.|$|E
25|$|The oxygen-carrying protein {{hemoglobin}} {{was discovered}} by Hünefeld in 1840. In 1851, German physiologist Otto Funke published {{a series of articles}} in which he described growing hemoglobin crystals by successively diluting red blood cells with a <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as pure water, alcohol or ether, followed by slow evaporation of the solvent from the resulting protein solution. Hemoglobin's reversible oxygenation was described a few years later by Felix Hoppe-Seyler.|$|E
25|$|Solubility {{equilibrium}} {{is a type}} {{of dynamic}} equilibrium that exists when a chemical compound in the solid state is in chemical equilibrium with a solution of that compound. The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the <b>solvent,</b> <b>such</b> as acid or alkali. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent equilibrium constant. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios.|$|E
50|$|Long {{reaction}} {{times are}} required for this synthesis and when performed {{in the presence of}} coordinating <b>solvents,</b> <b>such</b> as dimethoxyethane, adducts are formed. Hence non-coordinating <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as benzene or toluene must be used to obtain the free complexes.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{oxygen-containing}} groups {{make the}} aromatic fragments very polar; therefore, the depolymerized coal samples obtained at pH =  1.99 – 4.09 can be well dissolved in polar <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as DMSO, DMF and acetone, but cannot be dissolved in low polarity <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as CHCl 3.|$|R
50|$|Coordinating <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as ether or THF, are {{required}} to solvate (complex) the magnesium(II) center. The solvent must be aprotic since alcohols and water contain an acidic proton and thus react with phenylmagnesium bromide to give benzene. Carbonyl-containing <b>solvents,</b> <b>such</b> as acetone and ethyl acetate, are also incompatible with the reagent.|$|R
25|$|The {{reaction}} {{occurs in}} the presence of 2,2'-dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as benzene. The mechanism begins with formation of the 2-pyridinethiol ester (scheme 19). Proton-transfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center, providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product. One of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone (scheme 20).|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in a separatory funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquid–liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to include a layer or sphere of water molecules around the solute, and model the bulk with an implicit <b>solvent.</b> <b>Such</b> an approach is proposed by M. J. Frisch and coworkers and by other authors. For instance in Ref. the bulk solvent is modeled with a Generalized Born approach and the multi-grid method used for Coulombic pairwise particle interactions. It {{is reported to be}} faster than a full explicit solvent simulation with the particle mesh Ewald summation (PME) method of electrostatic calculation. There are a range of hybrid methods available capable of accessing and acquiring information on solvation.|$|E
50|$|As {{shown in}} the {{structural}} formula, MOED can exist in two resonance forms: A neutral molecule and a zwitterion. Research indicates that the zwitterion form is most representative when the compound exists in polar <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as water, and the neutral form when it exists in nonpolar <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as chloroform.|$|R

25|$|Lithium {{monoxide}} anion (LiO−) is a superbase {{existing in}} the solution state in an aprotic solvent. It was the world's strongest known base until 2008, when Orthodiethynylbenzene dianion, Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion and Para-diethynylbenzene dianion became the world's strongest known bases. Orthodiethynylbenzene dianion {{is the strongest}} base, followed by Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion and Para-diethynylbenzene dianion. Strong bases like lithium monoxide anion (LiO−) is made in an aprotic <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as tetrahydrofuran. The deprotonation agent used {{in the creation of}} Lithium monoxide anion is lithium diisopropylamide. The methyl anion CH3− was the strongest known base before lithium monoxide anion was discovered.|$|E
25|$|Every {{electrochemical}} capacitor has two electrodes, mechanically {{separated by}} a separator, which are ionically connected to each other via the electrolyte. The electrolyte {{is a mixture of}} positive and negative ions dissolved in a <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as water. At each of the two electrodes surfaces originates an area in which the liquid electrolyte contacts the conductive metallic surface of the electrode. This interface forms a common boundary among two different phases of matter, such as an insoluble solid electrode surface and an adjacent liquid electrolyte. In this interface occurs a very special phenomenon of the double layer effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{mobile phase}} is the phase that moves in a {{definite}} direction. It {{may be a}} liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or a polar <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as methanol in reverse phase chromatography and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.|$|E
5000|$|Hard <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as {{hydrogen}} fluoride, {{water and}} the protic solvents tend to solvate strong solute bases such as the fluorine anion and the oxygen anions.

25|$|A Snyder {{column is}} an {{extremely}} effective air-cooled column used in selected fractional distillations. It is a single glass tube {{with a series of}} circular indentations/restrictions in the walls of the cylinder (e.g., 3 or 6) in which rest, inverted, the same number of roughly tear-shaped, hollow, sealed glass stoppers; above each point where an inverted tear-shaped stopper rests, the cylinder has further Vigreux-type indentations, in this case serving to limit how high the glass stopper can be raised (by vapor flow) above its resting place, where, when not raised, it seals the circular opening created by the circular indentation. These floating glass stoppers act as check valves, closing and opening with vapor flow, and enhancing vapor-condensate mixing. A standard application of Snyder columns, is as the condenser/fractionation column above a Kuderna-Danish concentrator, used to efficiently separate a low boiling extraction <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as methylene chloride from volatile but higher boiling extract components (e.g., after the extraction of organic contaminants in soil).|$|E

500|$|The {{sample holder}} {{held up to}} 4 cells.

As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a sample were made in comparison to a blank, or standard, [...] "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent." [...] The standard could be a cell filled with a <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as distilled water or a prepared solvent of a known concentration. At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, transmittance, to be obtained.

500|$|Praseodymium {{may then}} be {{separated}} from the other lanthanides via ion-exchange chromatography, or by using a <b>solvent</b> <b>such</b> as tributyl phosphate where the solubility of Ln3+ increases as the atomic number increases.

40|$|Proteins {{carry out}} the most {{difficult}} tasks in living cells. They do so by interacting specifically with other molecules.

Our analysis suggests that proteins will be unstable in most polar <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as ethanol, extremely stable in non-polar <b>solvents</b> <b>such</b> as cyclohexane, and even more stable in a vacuum.
