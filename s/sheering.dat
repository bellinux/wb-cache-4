5000|$|The <b>sheer</b> is {{a measure}} of {{longitudinal}} main deck curvature, in naval architecture. The <b>sheer</b> forward is usually twice that of <b>sheer</b> aft. Increases in the rise of the <b>sheer</b> forward and aft builds volume into the hull, and in turn increases its buoyancy forward and aft, thereby keeping the ends from diving into an oncoming wave and slowing the ship. In the early days of sail, one discussed a hull's <b>sheer</b> in terms of how much [...] "Hang" [...] it had. William Sutherland's The Ship-builders Assistant (1711) covers this information in more detail.|$|R

But she was so slowed by her damage and a 6-inch hit at 16:10 that holed the base of her rear funnel, which reduced her boiler draught until repairs were completed 20 minutes later, that the ship could not take station aft of Iwate until 17:05.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>sheer</b> hulks {{originated}} with the Royal Navy in the 1690s, and persisted in Britain {{until the early}} nineteenth century.

2500|$|Savage Night, {{published}} in 1953, is generally ranked {{as one of}} his best novels. It is also one of his oddest literary offerings. Its narrator, Charlie [...] "Little" [...] Bigger (also known as Carl Bigelow), is a small, tubercular hitman whose mind is deteriorating with his body. In reviewing Savage Night, Boucher said it was [...] "written with vigor and bite, but <b>sheering</b> off from realism into a peculiar surrealist ending of sheer Guignol horror. Odd that a mass-consumption paperback should contain the most experimental writing I've seen in a suspense novel of late." [...] Savage Night contains an interlude—whether or not it is fantasy or dream, hallucination or flashback is unclear—when Bigger meets a poor, verbose writer who, much like Thompson himself, has a penchant for booze and makes a living writing pulp fiction to be sold alongside pornography. That writer also claims to operate a [...] "farm" [...] where he grows vaginas {{as a metaphor for the}} material he writes.|$|E

5000|$|Temporary <b>sheers</b> {{comprise}} two upright spars, lashed {{together at}} {{their heads and}} their feet splayed apart. Unlike in a gyn, which has three legs and is thus stable without support, stability in <b>sheers</b> (derricks, and single-legged gin poles) is provided by a guy. [...] The heels of the spars are secured by splay and heel tackles. The point {{at the top of}} the <b>sheers</b> where the spars cross and are lashed together is the [...] "crutch", to which a block and tackle is attached. Unlike derricks, <b>sheers</b> need no lateral support, and only require either a foreguy and an aftguy or a martingale and a topping lift. Being made of two spars rather than one, <b>sheers</b> are stronger than a derrick of the same size and made of equivalent materials. Unlike the apex of a gyn, which is fixed, the crutch of a <b>sheers</b> can be topped up or lowered, via the topping lift, through a limited angle. In the era of sailing vessels, it was common for dockyards to employ a <b>sheer</b> hulk, an old floating ship's hull fitted with <b>sheer</b> legs, and used to install masts in other ships.|$|R
