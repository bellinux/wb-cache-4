40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made on the design of the ITER electron cyclotron emission (ECE) diagnostic over the past two years. Radial and oblique views are still included in the design in order to measure distortions in the electron momentum distribution, but the oblique view has been redirected to reduce <b>stray</b> millimeter <b>radiation</b> from the electron cyclotron heating system. A major challenge has been designing the 1000 K calibration sources and remotely activated mirrors located in the ECE diagnostic shield module (DSM) in the equatorial port plug # 09. These critical systems are being modeled and prototypes are being developed. Providing adequate neutron shielding in the DSM while allowing sufficient space for optical components is also a significant challenge. Four 45 -meter long low-loss transmission lines transport the 70 – 1000 GHz ECE from the DSM to the ECE instrumentation room. Prototype transmission lines are being tested, as are the polarization splitter modules that separate O-mode and X-mode polarized ECE.

Two plasma views are planned, a radial view and an oblique view that is sensitive to distortions in the electron momentum distribution near the average thermal momentum. Both views provide high spatial resolution electron temperature profiles when the momentum distribution remains Maxwellian. The ECE diagnostic system consists of the front-end optics, including two 1000 K calibration sources, in equatorial port plug EP 9, the 70 - 1000 GHz transmission system from the front-end to the diagnostics hall, and the ECE instrumentation in the diagnostics hall. The baseline ECE instrumentation will include two Michelson interferometers that can simultaneously measure ordinary and extraordinary mode ECE from 70 to 1000 GHz, and two heterodyne radiometer systems, covering 122 - 230 GHz and 244 - 355 GHz. Significant design challenges include 1) developing highly-reliable 1000 K calibration sources and the associated shutters/mirrors, 2) providing compliant couplings between the front-end optics and the polarization splitter box that accommodate displacements of the vacuum vessel during plasma operations and bake out, 3) protecting components from damage due to <b>stray</b> ECH <b>radiation</b> and other intense millimeter wave emission and 4) providing the low-loss broadband transmission system...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{imperfection}} of {{the single}} path absorption, ECRH at ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) is always accompanied by <b>stray</b> <b>radiation</b> in the vacuum vessel. New ECRH scenarios with O 2 and X 3 heating schemes extend the operational space, but they have also the potential to increase the level of <b>stray</b> <b>radiation.</b> There are hazards for invessel components. Damage on electric cables has already been encountered. It is therefore necessary to monitor and control the ECRH {{with respect to the}} <b>stray</b> <b>radiation</b> level. At AUG a system of Sniffer antennas equipped with microwave detection diodes is installed. The system is part of the ECRH interlock circuit. We notice, however, that during plasma operation the variations of the Sniffer antenna signal are very large. In laboratory measurements we see variations of up to 20 dB in the directional sensitivity and we conclude that an interference pattern is formed inside the copper sphere of the antenna. When ECRH is in plasma operation at AUG, the plasma is acting as a phase and mode mixer for the millimeter waves and thus the interference pattern inside the sphere changes with the characteristic time of the plasma dynamics. In order to overcome the difficulty of a calibrated measurement of the average <b>stray</b> <b>radiation</b> level, we installed bolometer and pyroelectric detectors, which intrinsically average over interference structures due to their large active area. The bolometer provides a robust calibration but with moderate temporal resolution.

40|$|The 21 cm multibeam {{receiver}} on the Parkes telescope {{has been}} used for many neutral hydrogen (HI) imaging projects, for example, the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) and the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. In many experiments to date, basic radio frequency interference (RFI) rejection has been accomplished on a per-feed basis, using the median statistic throughout the processing, which eliminates outliers in a nonparametric fashion at the expense of increased statistical noise. The classic 21 cm baseline ripple problem has been largely ignored, except for the subtraction of a coarse template which is calculated independently of feed, time, telescope elevation, and receiver rotation. The ripple is especially strong during the daytime, when the Sun acts as a broadband RFI noise source. Here we report on new techniques that we are developing, for application to raw, postcorrelation multibeam data, which handle RFI rejection and ripple suppression in more sophisticated ways. RFI can be identified by the presence of coincident outliers on multiple feeds, by sharp increases or decreases in flux time series that are inconsistent with a beam-smeared sky, and by the presence of highly polarized flux. We present our progress with this approach and highlight some remaining difficulties. We also present a novel technique for modeling the variation during telescope scans of 21 cm baseline ripple caused by <b>stray</b> continuum <b>radiation</b> undergoing multiple reflections in the telescope cavity and demonstrate its application to HIPASS data; this may increase the usefulness of daytime spectral line observing...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a thermal-neutron coded-aperture imager that reveals the locations of hydrogenous materials from which thermal neutrons are being emitted. This imaging detector can be combined with an accelerator to form an active interrogation system in which fast neutrons are produced in a heavy metal target by means of xcitation by high energy photons. The photo-induced neutrons can be either prompt or delayed, depending on whether neutronemitting fission products are generated. Provided that there are hydrogenous materials close to the target, some of the photo-induced neutrons slow down and emerge from the surface at thermal energies. These neutrons {{can be used to}} create images that show the location and shape of the thermalizing materials. Analysis of the temporal response of the neutron flux provides information about delayed neutrons from induced fission if there are fissionable materials in the target. The combination of imaging and time-of-flight discrimination helps to improve the signal-to-background ratio. It is also possible to interrogate the target with neutrons, for example using a D-T generator. In this case, an image can be obtained from hydrogenous material in a target without the presence of heavy metal. In addition, if fissionable material is present in the target, probing with fast neutrons can stimulate delayed neutrons from fission, and the imager can detect and locate the object of interest, using appropriate time gating. Operation of this sensitive detection equipment in the vicinity of an accelerator presents a number of challenges, because the accelerator emits electromagnetic interference as well as <b>stray</b> ionizing <b>radiation,</b> which can mask the signals of interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{incentive}} for conducting Degenerate Four Wave Mixing (DFWM) within guided wave devices is two-fold: (1) By coupling the optical beams into guided wave devices, the optical power densities {{can be increased}} orders of magnitude due to the tight confinement of the beams. Such an increase in power density means a concomitant increase in conversion efficiency of the signal beam. (2) The potential signal processing applications of DFWM (logic gates, switching, correlation/convolution), particularly for ultra-fast serial processing, would be better exploited, and adjoined to existing integrated circuit technology, by such an integrated optic/guided wave approach. In this dissertation we describe experiments and present data confirming the presence of DFWM within a planar glass thin film with carbon disulphide as the nonlinear cover medium. Optical pulses from a Q-switched, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser are coupled into the glass film. The nonlinear polarization required to produce the desired conjugate signal is generated within the CS₂ by the evanescent tails of the guided input beams as they probe the nonlinear cover medium. The signals measured agree well with theory, but {{because they were so}} small in magnitude, signal-to noise ratios were small due to <b>stray</b> background <b>radiation</b> scattering from beamsplitters and other associated optics. Additionally, recent studies (Jain & Lind, 1983) indicate nonlinear responses in semiconductor (CdS/Se) doped glasses, commercially available as color glass filters, that are orders of magnitude higher than corresponding nonlinearities within CS₂, in addition to possessing subnanosecond response times. We have performed experiments upon such glasses in an effort to fabricate nonlinear optical waveguides within them via ion-exchange techniques. We have successfully fabricated single mode planar guides, but they are currently too lossy to allow demonstration of any guided wave nonlinearities. Also, we describe experiments in which we have measured (bulk) DFWM grating lifetimes with greater precision than previously reported. Results indicate a fast (20 to 50 pico-seconds, depending on the particular glass) electronic response, superimposed upon, but clearly distinguishable from, a slower (10 's of nanoseconds) thermal response...|$|R
