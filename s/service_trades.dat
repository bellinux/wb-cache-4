The Chinese and Jews were employed mainly in <b>service</b> <b>trades</b> and retail businesses. The Germans arrived after the 1890s, and most were businessmen. In the cigar factories, they worked as managers, bookkeepers, and supervisors. Cigar boxes were made by German-owned factories. Several early cigar box labels were made by German lithographers. The Germans formed their own club, the Deutsch Amerikanischer Verein. The club building is still standing on Nebraska and 11th Avenue. It contained a restaurant {{open to the public}} that served German food. In 1919, because of anti-German feelings from World War I, they sold the building to the Young Men's Hebrew Association. The building is now used as offices for the City of Tampa.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{determinants}} of <b>trade</b> in <b>services</b> using a gravity model, with particular attention given {{to the role of}} barriers to <b>services</b> <b>trade.</b> Initially, the application of the gravity equation to <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> is examined. A variety of econometric estimators are tested and the Hausman-Taylor model is found to be the best estimator. The gravity model fits <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> flows in a similar manner to trade in goods. Wealth of countries and a common language are the most important determinants of <b>services</b> <b>trade,</b> distance is generally found to be insignificant. A variable measuring barriers to <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> is introduced into the gravity equation. Although the variable is only found to be weakly significant, a quantified set of tariff equivalents of those barriers is estimated. ...|$|R

In this paper, we revisit the <b>trade</b> effects of <b>services</b> agreements using an updated database on bilateral <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> flows from the OECD and based on recent developments in the estimation of structural gravity models. Our results suggest a <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> effect of 13. 7 % at the intensive margin, with significantly higher estimates for intra-EU trade.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{liberalization of}} trade in both inter-temporal intermediation services and goods {{in a joint}} spatial-inter-temporal trade model. Joint multi-commodity spatial intertemporal models are not (to our knowledge) used in the trade literature as general comparative statics results are unavailable and (in the presence of incomplete markets) existence can also be an issue. Here we use numerical simulation methods. We first consider world with <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> autarky {{in which there is}} no domestic intermediation service provision, and <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization involves costless inter-temporal intermediation provided by foreign service providers. This simple treatment allows us to model <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization as removing period by period budget constraints for domestic consumers. In such a world, if nonzero tariffs apply to spatial trade we present an example showing how <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization can be welfare worsening. One implication is that negotiations on services in the WTO General Agreement on <b>Trade</b> in <b>Services</b> (GATS) need not be welfare improving if there are also ongoing tariff negotiations. We then expand the model to capture a more complex world where costly intermediation services can be provided by both within-country and foreign providers. We again illustrate how services liberalization can be welfare worsening. We finally discuss whether welfare worsening <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization is likely in a real-world situation of highly restricted <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> and considerably more open goods <b>trade,</b> and when <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> are around 1 / 3 of total goods and <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> as is often claimed from available global <b>service</b> <b>trade</b> data. ...|$|R

Asia 2 ̆ 019 s relatively high-level of regional bias of <b>services</b> <b>trade</b> {{can be explained by the}} following factors: (i) a relatively high prevalence of a shared language (Chinese), which is essential to <b>services</b> <b>trade,</b> but not to goods trade; and (ii) the archipelagic nature of the region, which inhibits goods <b>trade</b> more than <b>services</b> <b>trade.</b> In contrast, for example, major European countries share land borders with their neighbors and they speak different languages.
