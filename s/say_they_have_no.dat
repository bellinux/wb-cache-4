2500|$|Lewis {{was born}} Albert Meister on April 30, 1923. He had {{originally}} given his birth year as 1910. His reputed early radio {{work in the}} mid-1930s would indicate the earlier birth date, as did an off-the-cuff remark on the TVLegends interview, 2002, where he says [...] "not a bad memory for 92". Ted Lewis, his son, firmly said his father was born in 1923 to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. Other sources placed his birth in Wolcott, New York, but no official record of his birth has been published to date (2006), and officials in Wolcott <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> record of any Meister. The Times wrote: [...] "Lewis was born Albert Meister, probably in 1923, although he insisted that {{he was born in}} 1910. This, and Lewis's many other questionable stories, means that much of the actor's life is a broth of conjecture that his fans will no doubt squabble over for years to come." [...] On his application for a Social Security number, completed sometime between 1936 and 1950, Lewis gave his date of birth as April 30, 1923. [...] The 1940 census lists an Albert Meister [...] "age 16" [...] living on Douglass Street in Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
