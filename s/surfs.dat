500|$|Filming began {{two weeks}} after the readthrough, on March 5, 2010, and took over two weeks to shoot. Wiseman's {{direction}} was to film the episode like a [...] "postcard of Hawaii," [...] {{but at the same time}} show its darker side when the team fight the antagonists. Dae Kim's schedule overlapped between the Five-0 pilot and Lost, although at the time his character in the latter show was in the process of being killed off. The first few days of filming was affected due to bad weather conditions, particularly strong winds and sudden sporadic rain showers. The first day was spent in Pearl Harbor, near the USS Missouri (BB-63). Line producer Pat Crowley made an appearance as a helicopter pilot. The second day of filming took place at the North Shore, shooting scenes for Kono's introduction. Before filming began, Park, who had never surfed before, was taught the basics, though the scenes in which Kono <b>surfs</b> were mostly done by a body double. Filming was severely hindered by bad weather, forcing the production team to reschedule. Day three was spent on Kamekona's scenes.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Surf</b> skis {{were later}} used by lifesavers to rescue {{drowning}} swimmers. Until the 1960s, <b>surf</b> boats—lightweight rowing boats {{with a crew}} of five—were responsible for the rescue work in and behind the <b>surf</b> line. These boats were expensive and require {{a huge amount of}} skill to be used effectively. It was soon realised that a double <b>surf</b> ski could do almost everything that a <b>surf</b> boat could do, and in 1946 the importance of <b>surf</b> skis was noted by the <b>surf</b> lifesaving associations and they were included in lifesaving competitions and championships. Riders could stand up on them to <b>surf</b> them back to shore. These early <b>surf</b> skis were very wide and bear little resemblance to their modern counterparts. <b>Surf</b> skis were quickly introduced into <b>surf</b> lifesaving as a competition event. Over time they became narrower to maximise speed. In Britain in the eighties <b>surf</b> skis were also short boats that developed from <b>surf</b> kayaks and we're made by Frank Goodwin of Valley canoe products and UK <b>surf</b> skis in south Wales They were part of <b>surf</b> canoeing discipline managed by British Canoe Union [...] Then in late 80s skis separated from Bcu to form the British wave ski assn.|$|R
5000|$|In 1902 it {{was against}} the law to enter the ocean during {{daylight}} hours in Australia [...] A Sydney newspaper editor William Gocher announced his challenge of this law at Manly Beach. Eventually as more people began to challenge the law it was reversed but inexperienced swimmers were having problems with unusual <b>surf</b> conditions such as rip currents and the number of drownings increased. Groups of volunteers began to patrol the beach to assist and in 1906 the Bondi Beach <b>Surf</b> Bathing Association was formed. The <b>Surf</b> Bathing Association of New South Wales was formed on 18 October 1907 when nine voluntary <b>surf</b> life saving clubs and representatives of the Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS) met and affiliated to represent the interests of <b>surf</b> lifesavers.

It was at this time that Dan Hickey was replaced by Marty Beller who had previously collaborated with TMBG. For the album's first single, [...] "Experimental Film", TMBG teamed up with Homestar Runner creators Matt and Mike Chapman to create an animated music video. The band's collaboration with the Brothers Chaps also included several Puppet Jam segments with puppet Homestar and the music for a Strong Bad email titled [...] "Different Town".

2500|$|In tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, {{associated}} with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle, {{such as a}} personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may {{also be used to}} ride waves. Recently with the use of V-drive boats, Wakesurfing, in which one <b>surfs</b> on the wake of a boat, has emerged.

2500|$|Beck {{composed}} {{two main}} themes for the film: the Ant-Man superhero theme and a theme for family. In addition {{to using the}} traditional brass for the Ant-Man theme, Beck used an alto flute and violas, which he felt had [...] "a {{little bit of the}} sound world of the heist movie and the spy movie, the old James Bond sound." [...] For a sequence where Ant-Man <b>surfs</b> down a water pipe on a raft made of ants, Beck began arranging the theme as a [...] "regular action cue" [...] but found it [...] "a little too intense for the scene". Reed wanted it to have more of a sense of fun, and Beck eventually wrote a piece evoking the [...] "classic guitar surf music", but with the orchestra rather than a guitar. The family theme represents the film's two father-daughter relationships, between Scott Lang and his daughter Cassie, and between Hank Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne. Beck also intended for it to [...] "signify the emergence of Hope as something of a hero herself". Additionally, the villainous Yellowjacket has [...] "a more traditional theme, presented in traditional fashion, but augmented with processed electronics to convey the crazed and obsessed nature of the character". Of the many ant species featured in the film, Reed and Beck felt that the bullet ants deserved their [...] "own identity"; since the species is primarily indigenous to South America, Beck used ancient Aztec drums and tribal flutes to give them a [...] "regional flavor". For a scene where Ant-Man infiltrates the Avengers headquarters, Beck quotes Silvestri's Avengers theme and Jackman's Falcon motif from Winter Soldier.|$|E

2500|$|The player begins Mario's Time Machine in Bowser's museum. The {{museum is}} the main hub, where the player obtains the {{artifacts}} and directly accesses all the game's levels (which consist of locations on Earth in different time periods) using the Timulator. In the Super NES and MS-DOS versions, for each artifact, the player is given the year and place it originated from. For example, the player learns that the [...] "Apple" [...] artifact originated from 1687 Cambridge. The player can then time travel using this information; time traveling itself is a minigame in which Mario <b>surfs</b> through a wide ocean, collecting mushrooms. Collecting enough mushrooms will transport Mario to the time period and location programmed into the Timulator. The player is given a short document describing the life and notability of the historical person associated (e.g. Isaac Newton), but the document itself has some of its terms missing. The player thus is required to converse with the non-player characters depicting the local denizens of the time period {{in order to learn}} various facts and be able to fill in the blanks. The player chooses the words from a list of pre-determined words; if the player incorrectly fills a blank more than twice, he is sent back to 1993 and is required to try again. When the player fills all the blanks correctly, he can then successfully return the artifact to its original owner. In the game's ending cutscene, Mario manages to confront Bowser, who then steals back the Timulator to make his escape. At this point there are three possible outcomes based on the player's overall performance: in the worst outcome, in which the player fails to return the artifacts quickly enough, Bowser successfully escapes to an area known as Paradise; in the other two outcomes, the Timulator experiences mechanical overload, sending and trapping Bowser in the Jurassic era.|$|E
