5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be <b>stacked</b> <b>in</b> heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory, and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|E

50|$|The dealer now {{throws the}} die twice. The {{result of the}} first throw selects one of the tile <b>stacks</b> <b>in</b> front of the dealer, {{counting}} from left to right. The dealer places the single remaining tile {{on top of this}} selected stack. If the number thrown is greater than the number of <b>stacks</b> <b>in</b> front of the dealer, then the count will continue using the <b>stacks</b> <b>in</b> front of the player to dealer's right, and one of these will be selected. The selected stack now has six tiles.|$|R
5000|$|A stack {{is called}} a <b>stack</b> <b>in</b> groupoids or a (2,1)-sheaf if it is also fibered in groupoids, meaning that its fibers (the inverse images of objects of C) are groupoids.

Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were <b>stacked</b> <b>in</b> 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below the}} target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber to protect them from the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are <b>stacked</b> <b>in</b> vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E

5|$|Tessellation can be {{extended}} to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be <b>stacked</b> <b>in</b> a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets <b>stacked</b> <b>in</b> pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E
