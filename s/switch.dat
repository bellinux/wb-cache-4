40|$|The study {{presents}} an innovative representation modeling of the <b>switched</b> time-delay system {{and study the}} problem of delay-independence stability and <b>switching</b> law design for <b>switched</b> time-delay systems.

There are two basic problems in stability and <b>switching</b> law design of the <b>switched</b> time-delay system.

40|$|A {{performance}} optimization {{based on}} the optimal <b>switching</b> threshold(s) for a multi-branch <b>switched</b> diversity system is discussed in this paper. For the conventional multi-branch <b>switched</b> diversity system with a single <b>switching</b> threshold, the optimal <b>switching</b> threshold {{is a function of}} both the average channel SNR and the number of diversity branches, where computing the optimal <b>switching</b> threshold is not a simple task when the number of diversity branches is high. The newly proposed multi-branch <b>switched</b> diversity system is based on a sequence of <b>switching</b> thresholds, instead of a single <b>switching</b> threshold, where a different diversity branch uses a different <b>switching</b> threshold for signal comparison. Thanks to the fact that each <b>switching</b> threshold in the sequence can be optimized only {{based on the}} number of the remaining diversity branches, the proposed system makes it easy to find these <b>switching</b> thresholds. Furthermore, some selected numerical and simulation results show that the proposed <b>switched</b> diversity system with the sequence of optimal <b>switching</b> thresholds outperforms the conventional system with the single optimal <b>switching</b> threshold. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

This paper aims to briefly survey recent results in this field. First, the stability analysis for <b>switched</b> systems is reviewed.

After a brief review of the stability analysis under restricted <b>switching</b> and the multiple Lyapunov function theory, the <b>switching</b> stabilization problem is studied, and a variety of <b>switching</b> stabilization methods found in the literature are out-lined. Then the <b>switching</b> stabilizability problem is investigated, that is under what condition it is possible to stabilize a <b>switched</b> system by properly designing <b>switching</b> control laws. Note that the <b>switching</b> stabilizability problem {{has been one of the}} most elusive problems in the <b>switched</b> systems literature. A necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic stabilizability of <b>switched</b> linear systems is described here.
