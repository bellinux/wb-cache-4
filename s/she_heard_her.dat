25|$|After Moore's absence {{continued}} {{for longer than}} was usual for her, she was reported missing several days later. The neighbor later told police that shortly after Moore had re-entered the house, <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> arguing with Bonie. After a loud bang, the argument ended.|$|E

500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E
60|$|Corny did not reply. I {{doubt if}} <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> him. <b>Her</b> soul still ached for her fallen queen.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>heard,</b> and <b>her</b> {{dark eyes}} filled with tears, and her stately head sank for a moment almost to her horse's mane.|$|R
60|$|She looked--I felt <b>her</b> look. <b>She</b> sobbed--I <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sob, {{and then}} her arms were about me and her lips were pressed upon my own.|$|R
2500|$|Soraya {{first became}} {{interested}} in music at age 5 when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> uncle playing music in Colombia. Her uncle played [...] "Pueblito Viejo", a Colombian traditional folk song using an instrument called the tiple, which {{is a kind of}} guitar with triple strings. Her parents bought her a guitar, which she taught herself how to play. She became proficient in classical violin, and her first 'public' performance was at [...] Carnegie Hall in New York City {{as a member of the}} N.Y.C. Youth Philharmonic. [...] She was valedictorian of her class at Point Pleasant Boro High School, where she began writing her own music.|$|E
2500|$|The leading perjurers, the Gävle Boy, Lisbeth Carlsdotter and the Myra Maids (Annika Hinrichzdotter and Agnis Eskilsdotter), were {{executed}} on 20 December 1676. The daughter of Brita Zippel, Annika Zippel, {{were sentenced to}} be whipped and died during the punishment. The oldest daughter of Malin Matsdotter, Anna [...] "Annika" [...] Eriksdotter, was herself under arrest after having stated during her testimony against her mother that she had herself begun to follow her example by abducting children to Satan. Imprisoned, she reported that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> mother call for her in her dreams, pinch her and ask her to [...] "come as soon as possible" [...] because she had accused her of witch craft. Anna Eriksdotter was, as the other remaining accused, freed from the charge of witch craft, but sentenced to be whipped for perjury. During the whipping, the crowd attacked the guards performing the whipping by throwing stones. Malin's younger daughter Maria Eriksdotter was given an official warning to make amends for her sin of perjury.|$|E
2500|$|After {{refitting}} {{and three}} days of training, Tunny departed Hawaii on 5 August for Midway Island. She arrived at Midway Island on 9 August and was again underway on 10 August. On 18 August, she sighted Pagan Island and Alamagan Island; and, on 22 August, she entered her assigned area in the Palau Islands and began patrols. Early {{in the morning of}} 24 August, she sighted a six-ship convoy as it emerged from Toagel Mlungui Pass. Tunny trailed the convoy until she could obtain a good firing position and, at moonrise on 25 August, she submerged to [...] and began her approach. At 01:40, she launched three torpedoes and then another two in rapid succession. She then ducked her periscope and dove to avoid being rammed by the first target. The convoy passed overhead as Tunny dove deep in expectation of depth charges. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> torpedoes explode {{at the end of their}} run, but the absence of depth charges was both welcome and unexpected. Near dawn, Tunny made another attack, launching six torpedoes at ships of the convoy without success. Meanwhile, a destroyer escort had joined the convoy. Alerted to Tunnys presence, she now bore down on the submarine. Tunny dove, and, for the next two hours, the enemy ship remained overhead pinging and tracking. The destroyer escort dropped two patterns of six depth charges close by the submarine but finally gave up the search. At noon, Tunny came to periscope depth and, finding no sign of the convoy, set her course for Toagel Mlungui, securing from battle stations after an exhausting 15 hours.|$|E

60|$|But {{the wind}} screeched and howled so madly that <b>she</b> scarce <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> own voice, {{and the man}} {{certainly}} failed to hear her, for he did not move.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{must have}} gone quite to sleep, for {{she did not know}} when the door was opened, and how the soft voices had come in that <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> over <b>her.</b>|$|R
2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E
60|$|Madeline was mute. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> heart thundering in her ears.|$|E
60|$|And then <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> name spoken, {{and looked}} round, to see Eddy.|$|E
60|$|Hereupon {{the poor}} woman {{explained}} <b>her</b> difficulties. <b>She</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> husband murmuring {{in his sleep}} something about committing a burglary, and the words Rosebud Cottage had more than once escaped his lips.|$|R
60|$|She started violently, {{as though}} <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> a sound. <b>Her</b> face was convulsed with sudden fear.|$|R
6000|$|She {{waited in}} the stillness, her elbows on the rail and {{her face in her}} hands as if she had already {{forgotten}} what she had said. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> at <b>her</b> elbow the deep murmur of: ...|$|R

60|$|Thus Celia, mutely {{bending over}} her tapestry, until <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sister calling her.|$|E
6000|$|A cold {{perspiration}} {{stood on}} her forehead. She opened {{her lips to}} shriek to her mother: but checked herself when <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> stirring gently in the outer room. Her pulses throbbed too loudly at first for her to hear distinctly: but she {{felt that it was}} no moment for giving way to emotion; by a strong effort of will, she conquered herself; and then, with that preternatural acuteness of sense which some women possess, she could hear everything her mother was doing. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> put on her shawl, her bonnet; <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> open the front door gently. It was now long past midnight. Whither could she be going at that hour? ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when she}} was just seventeen, and was looking forward to the time when she would begin to carry her plan into effect, a terrible blow came. <b>She</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>her</b> mother that Robert was dead.|$|R
60|$|Over on the {{embankment}} {{a child was}} crying; and the passionate screaming sound, broken by the gulping of tears, made her cover her lips, as though <b>she</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> own escaped soul wailing out there.|$|R

60|$|She rose abruptly, as if <b>she</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> aunt speak, and Dan {{perceived}} {{that he had}} been making a long call.|$|E

6000|$|As she mused the pitiful {{vision of}} her mother's life laid its spell {{on the very}} quick of her being--that life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness.
