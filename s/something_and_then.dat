5|$|Napoleon's divisional commanders were {{immediately}} {{impressed by his}} capacity for hard work, {{from the beginning of}} Italy campaign. Subordinates could never say they would attend to <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> let it slide, and the staff who had been stationary in Nice for four years suddenly felt pulsating effect of Napoleon's energy. In the nine month between arrival in Nice and the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys should stand in parades to the conditions under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who suffer}} from social anxiety {{disorder}} fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous {{in the presence of}} people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations. People {{who suffer from}} this disorder may behave a certain way or say <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing when someone is talking to them.|$|E

500|$|Colin Salmon plays James Middleton, a {{civil servant}} who sits between the British {{government}} and the Ministry of Defence. Salmon previously worked with Sky1 on Hex. He was attracted to the role in Strike Back due to the script being [...] "a page-turner, and they're rare. It's really lovely to sit down to start reading <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{not be able to}} stop because you have to know what's going to happen next," [...] as well as hearing of who was involved in the project. A member of The Prince's Trust charity, Salmon took the opportunity to visit some of their projects in Soweto while the series was filmed.|$|E
500|$|Radical Axis {{provided}} animation for {{the series}} using Final Cut Pro. Described as [...] "lo-fi animation", Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost-cutting measure, {{with the exception of}} Amalockh, a many-armed monster summoned in the season two episode [...] "Corndog Chronicles", which was drawn and animated by Todd Redner at the studio, and Shark, which was borrowed from the Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode [...] "Kentucky Nightmare". In a behind-the-scenes clip of the show, Maiellaro explained that to animate the series, he would first grab a nearby sheet of copy paper, draw <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> scan it, followed by him sending the file to an animator. Rhoda, a character from the series, was drawn {{on the back of a}} script page for Perfect Hair Forever. A scan of the paper revealed the textual contents behind it, which Maiellaro decided to leave in.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{wrote an}} {{extremely}} negative {{review of the}} episode and called it [...] "terrible". He felt that Pam's behavior due to Jim being gone was uncalled for. Furthermore, he felt that Dwight [...] "swung too far into the territory that is known as 'annoying caricature. Campbell did, however, write highly of Ellie Kemper, saying that [...] "she's played [...] funnily and warmly as anyone else". Several reviewers argued that the episode functioned as a filler episode. Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called it the [...] "epitome of filler". ScreenCrush reviewer Damon Houx wrote that [...] "if everyone {{were in the same}} location this would be a bottle episode". Furthermore, Darryl's subplot was mostly criticized. Tedder wrote that while [...] "it's fine to have a story line where someone pursues <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> realizes it wasn't what it was cracked up to be" [...] he wished that the show had actually developed Val as a character. White wrote that she did not enjoy seeing [...] "this manipulative version of Darryl" [...] because it contrasted with his earlier characterization in episodes like [...] "The Deposition". Zaman called the subplot [...] "surprising".|$|E

500|$|Babe {{made her}} final {{appearance}} on 9 February 2017. In the episode, Babe {{tries to make}} amends with her family by taking care of Sylvie, but instead takes her to the canal and tells her that Stan {{is on the other}} side, before leaving her alone. Badland explained that Babe [...] "would not have actually killed" [...] Sylvie, but instead [...] "enticed her to do <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> walked away from it". When Shirley discovers Babe's actions, she tells her to leave so Babe tries to steal money from the pub's safe. Shirley catches her in the act and announces her actions to Mick. Babe pleads with Mick for another chance, but when she calls Linda a [...] "stuck-up cow", Mick escorts her out. Badland explained that Babe does this because she is [...] "absolutely desperate". Outside the pub, Babe curses the family and exclaimed, [...] "I hope you lose everything and your precious pub", which caused media outlets to question whether it foreshadows speculation the family would lose their pub. Badland believed that [...] "with all the threats she made, Babe might be back at some point." [...] She added that, [...] "She's cursed the Carters, and you don't cross Aunt Babe and get away with it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Garland {{entered the}} season as one of four seniors on La Salle's men's {{basketball}} roster. Ramon Galloway, who led the team in scoring in 2012–13, graduated the previous year. Garland debuted as a senior in an exhibition game vs Indiana University of Pennsylvania on November 2, 2013, scoring 16 points on [...]500 shooting. He made his first official appearance in a double-overtime home contest against Manhattan. Garland led a 13–3 run, highlighted by two key shots, that forced overtime. He made a three-pointer with {{minutes left in the}} game, but his team ran out of time before they could rally. Nevertheless, Garland scored a career-high 28 points, hitting 12 free throws. He had an effective second game as well. Against Quinnipiac at the ESPN Tip-Off Marathon, despite scoring far fewer points, his last-minute rebound was instrumental to the Explorers' victory. Head coach John Giannini said, [...] "He had zero rebounds in 44 minutes against Manhattan. The rebound that really iced the game today was a defensive rebound by Tyrone. Sometimes you don't play well, you don't do <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> you learn from it and do better, so I am pleased with him". The guard had another notable performance on November 22, 2013, against Morgan State, when he led both teams with 25 points. He also added four three-pointers. On January 25, 2014, Garland notched a career-best 30 points vs VCU. His team's 10-point 2014 Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to St. Bonaventure, in which he contributed 0 points in 30 minutes, marked the end of his collegiate career. He finished the season averaging 12.6 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 0.7 steals. Garland, Sam Mills, Tyreek Duren, and Taylor Dunn, recorded the most wins for a single senior class at La Salle in 22 years.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{has stated}} that he [...] "does not know enough" [...] to say whether he approves of the {{legislation}} of medicinal marijuana, but none of The Simpsons writers use the drug. [...] "It's {{one of the most}} sober writing staffs I've ever encountered", staff writer Max Pross said in the episode's DVD commentary. When asked about what stance the episode holds regarding the legislation of medicinal marijuana, Jean said that series' staff wanted to explore both sides of the issue, rather than making an absolute statement. He added that the episode is rather a critique of legislations that are immediately criminalized after they are legitimized. [...] "The stance is that it seems ridiculous to legalize <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> criminalize it, which I have seen happen in various states", Jean said. He continued, [...] "It's just weird to take away a right or to grant people a liberty and then abandon it. I would say that's the strongest statement [...] makes." [...] The episode also criticizes the use of genetically modified foods. At the beginning of the episode, Marge announces that the family's dinner includes genetically modified vegetables, to which Lisa replies [...] "American corporations should stop playing god with nature." [...] She then notices that her potato starts eating her carrot. Even though the episode portrays genetic modifications in a negative light, none of The Simpsons writers were actually against the technique. After the scene was written, Reiss asked all the writers if they were against genetic modifications of food, and none of them were. [...] "Very often we take these stands on the show that we do not believe in at all", Reiss explained in the DVD commentary for the episode. The scene was originally three times longer, and was conceived during a rewrite session with the staff writers.|$|E

2500|$|According to Harris, {{the head}} of the casting {{department}} refused to negotiate her salary, stating that she was a [...] "scale character who dies in the first twenty minutes." [...] This ultimately led to her dropping out of the project. [...] "People automatically assume I wanted some crazy amount of money, or something," [...] Harris commented in 2014, [...] " [...] it's not like I [...] demanding of anything, really... When you've been asked to do <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> they insult you by saying, [...] "You're a piece of shit, you die in the first act—I don't give a fuck that you were in two other Halloween movies, who cares?"... I was in shock." [...] Actress J. C. Brandy was cast as Harris's replacement.|$|E
2500|$|Dhyana is {{integrally}} {{related to}} Dharana, one leads to other. Dharana {{is a state}} of mind, Dhyana the process of mind. Dhyana is distinct from Dharana in that the meditator becomes actively engaged with its focus. Patanjali defines contemplation (Dhyana) as the mind process, where the mind is fixed on <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> there is [...] "a course of uniform modification of knowledge". Adi Shankara, in his commentary on Yoga Sutras, distinguishes Dhyana from Dharana, by explaining Dhyana as the yoga state when there is only the [...] "stream of continuous thought about the object, uninterrupted by other thoughts of different kind for the same object"; Dharana, states Shankara, is focussed on one object, but aware of its many aspects and ideas about the same object. Shankara gives the example of a yogin in a state of dharana on morning sun may be aware of its brilliance, color and orbit; the yogin in dhyana state contemplates on sun's orbit alone for example, without being interrupted by its color, brilliance or other related ideas.|$|E

[...] " [...] – I just love her. Working with her (has) been wonderful. For her, [...] more of the do-it-yourself girl. She’s so into music, art, she’s such a rich character {{that there are a}} lot of different things to draw on," [...] stated One Tree Hill’s costume designer, Carol Cutshall. [...] "Sometimes she’ll just be in a plaid flannel shirt because she’s painting. Some days she’ll be in a concert T-shirt. We have to find the right concert T-shirt. I do alter them a lot." [...] Cutshall would take a men’s concert T-shirt, and have Burton put it on. [...] "She’s also very, very slender, so I’ll taper them down to her figure. We come out of it with kind of a one-o-f-a-kind rock T-shirt. I take <b>something</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> turn it into my own piece of clothing," [...] said Cutshall. Peyton’s main brands have been Cheap Monday, Levi’s, some Diesel and Miss Sixty.|$|E
