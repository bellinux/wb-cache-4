However, the stress reactivity and emotional variations {{in women with}} premenstrual syndrome (PMS), who are especially sensitive to the variations in hormone cycles, have not been explained. Methods: The present study used an electroencephalogram (EEG) stress evaluation test, a <b>physiology</b> <b>stress</b> evaluation test, and the positive affect and negative affect scale (PANAS) to evaluate the stress reactivity pattern and emotional state of women with PMS. Results: The results showed that women with PMS had higher negative affect and lower positive affect compared with controls. Moreover, under stressful conditions, the women with PMS had a higher alpha activity and a lower respiration rate than the controls. The differences in stress reactivity and emotional states between women with PMS and controls {{were based on a}} covariant analysis with menstrual cycle (luteal and follicular phases) as the covariate. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that, compared with controls, women suffering from PMS have a continuous abnormality in emotional state and stress reactivity, which was independent of the menstrual cycle.

30|$|Extreme {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the serious threats affecting crop production and distribution worldwide (Yokotani et al., 2008). In plants, a transient increase of 10 – 15  °C above ambient, is generally considered as heat shock or heat stress, which negatively affects plant growth, seed germination, photosynthesis, respiration, water relation, and membrane stability in plants (Wahid et al., 2007), and is often accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion radicals, and singlet oxygen (Liu and Huang, 2000; Mittler, 2002; Apel and Hirt, 2004; Song et al., 2014).

Inbred C 57 BL/ 6 J mice display a remarkably high interindividual variability in their trait anxiety, which predicts the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to acute stress, indicating that extremely different coping strategies can develop in genetically identical individuals. Differences in trait anxiety and stress response seem to be moderated by the function of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor and expression levels of the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM.

40|$|Stress {{is perhaps}} easiest to conceptualize {{as a process}} which allows an {{organism}} to accommodate for the demands of its environment such that it can adapt to the prevailing set of conditions. Psychological stress {{is an important component}} with the potential to affect physiology adversely as has become evident from various studies in the area. Although these studies have established numerous effects of psychological <b>stress</b> on <b>physiology,</b> a global strategy for the correlation of these effects has yet to begin. Our comparative and systematic analysis of the published literature has unraveled certain interesting molecular mechanisms as clues to account for some of the observed effects of psychological <b>stress</b> on human <b>physiology.</b> In this study, we attempt to understand initial phase of the physiological response to psychological stress by analyzing interactions between innate immunity and metabolism at systems level by analyzing the data available in the literature. In light of our gene association-networks and enrichment analysis we have identified candidate genes and molecular systems which might have some associative role in affecting psychological stress response system or even producing some of the observed terminal effects (such as the associated physiological disorders). In addition to the already accepted role of psychological stress as a perturbation that can disrupt physiological homeostasis, we speculate that it is potentially capable of causing deviation of certain biological processes from their basal level activity after which they can return back to their basal tones once the effects of stress diminish.

Objective: To investigate the acrosome status and alterations of testicular proteins involved in spermatogenesis and testosterone synthesis in chronic stress in rats.

50|$|The {{impact of}} {{childhood}} adversity is also noted in When the Body Says No: Understanding the Stress-Disease Connection. He notes that early experiences {{have a key}} role in shaping a person's perceptions of the world and others, and in <b>stress</b> <b>physiology,</b> factors that affect the person's health later on. He says that emotional patterns ingrained in childhood live in the memory of cells and the brain and appear in interpersonal interactions. He describes the impact of 'adverse childhood experiences' or ACEs (e.g. a child being abused, violence in the family, a jailed parent, extreme stress of poverty, a rancorous divorce, an addict parent, etc.) on how people live their lives and their risk of addiction and mental and physical illnesses, as seen in a number of U.S.-based Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) studies. Having a number of ACEs exponentially increases a person's chances of becoming an addict later on e.g. a male child with six ACEs has a 4,600% or 46-fold increase in risk. ACEs also exponentially increase the risk of diseases e.g. cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc. and also suicide and early death.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} article, Allen Schore (2002) {{reviewed}} the existing research literature concerning attachment, <b>stress,</b> trauma, <b>physiology,</b> and neuroscience. Schore investigated {{the connection between}} early attachment relationships and their effects on the infant’s developing brain and nervous system within {{the first two years}} of life. This paper is a partial summary of Schore’s article and focuses on secure and traumatizing attachment relationships. It is very important for an infant to form a secure attachment relationship with its caregivers. These bonds are crucial because the infant is dependant upon caregivers for everything related to survival such as nutrients, warmth, and protection. Recent studies have shown that early attachment relationships are strongly connected to the development of critical structures in the brain responsible for emotion regulation, attachment behaviour, and stress related coping mechanisms. The brain system responsible for instinctive attachment behaviour is located in the right orbitofrontal cortex, the outer layer of the brain behind the right eye. We will refer to this brain system and its connections as the attachment centre. The fact that th...|$|R
