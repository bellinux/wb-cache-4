6000|$|England {{may have}} seven {{different}} grades of productiveness in her [...] iron and coal supplies, of which her grades 1, 2, and 3 are [...] {{superior to the}} best grade of the United States, while grades 1, [...] 2, 3, and 4 in the United States may compare only with grades 4, [...] 5, 6, 7 of England. So long as England can supply herself and the [...] United States also with coal and iron from the three superior [...] grades, the United <b>States</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> work grade 1 at home. But if the [...] supply for England and the world requires grade 5 to be worked, [...] then the United States can begin the industry on her best grade, [...] although that is far inferior to the best grade in England. [...] Likewise, if the United States has three grades of wheat-land [...] superior to England’s best grade, the ability of England to grow [...] wheat depends on whether the United States can, or can not, supply [...] both herself and England from grades 1, 2, and 3. If we must [...] resort to grade 4, then England can begin to grow wheat as well as [...] we. In short, under a system of free exchange, as great a [...] diversity as under protection is probably possible, but only in [...] {{such a way that}} the best possible advantages in each particular [...] industry are employed. Smaller amounts in some branches, and [...] greater amounts in others, may be produced under a free than under [...] a restrictive system, but with all the greater gain which arises [...] from a proper and healthy adjustment of trade. The most poorly [...] endowed enterprises in each occupation would be given up, but not [...] the whole industry itself. No class of persons feel the [...] competition of rivals more than English farmers since American [...] wheat has come into English markets, and yet it does not follow [...] that England can not grow a bushel of wheat. The fact is, merely, [...] that some kinds of lands were thrown out of cultivation, and a [...] readjustment made, to the benefit of those wanting cheaper food. [...] So with us: we should not, by the free exchange, be forced to give [...] up the iron and coal industries entirely; for the best mines would [...] still keep that occupation in existence to “diversify” the others.|$|E

50|$|Empirical, theoretical, and {{simulation}} {{studies have}} led to a number of dramatic demonstrations of the importance of adequate taxon sampling. Most of these can be summarized by a simple observation: a phylogenetic data matrix has dimensions of characters times taxa. Doubling the number of taxa doubles the amount of information in a matrix just as surely as doubling the number of characters. Each taxon represents a new sample for every character, but, more importantly, it (usually) represents a new combination of character states. These character <b>states</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only determine where that taxon is placed on the tree, they can inform the entire analysis, possibly causing different relationships among the remaining taxa to be favored by changing estimates of the pattern of character changes.|$|E
