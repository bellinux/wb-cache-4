5|$|To defuse {{tension with}} the Burgundians a second double {{marriage}} was arranged in 1409. Isabeau's daughter Michelle married John the Fearless' son Philip the Good; Isabeau's son, Dauphin Louis, married John's daughter Margaret. Before the wedding, Isabeau negotiated a treaty with John the Fearless in which <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> defined family hierarchy and her position {{in relation to}} the throne.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} the second serial, The Daleks, that the {{programme}} caught the imaginations of viewers and began to ingrain itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson, but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready in order to produce it. Once it was clear what a great success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> knew the programme better than he did.|$|E

25|$|Cloris Leachman as Grandma Ida, Lois' {{mother and}} Malcolm's grandmother. She despises Francis and Lois, except on one {{occasion}} when she was kind to Lois. Ida has one common interest with Francis: they both despise Lois for being a control freak. She is generally disliked by the family, bar Reese whom <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> favors. She lost her leg saving Dewey from {{being hit by a}} truck, one of her few recorded good deeds. She once tried to sue Lois, her own daughter, for slipping on a leaf in the walkway of Lois' house and becoming temporarily injured. She was foiled by Francis and the boys who gave their support their parents and the lawyer willingly abandons her. Ida favors Susan over Lois as she is more graceful and talented.|$|E
25|$|Upon commencing her tests Curtiss {{found that}} {{although}} Genie's comprehension was clearly {{ahead of her}} production, it was only slightly ahead. Genie had begun to diversify her two-word utterances to include sentences in either subject-verb or verb-object order, suggesting she was grasping the subject–verb–object sentence structure typically used in English, and could follow other basic word order rules as evidenced in her verb-complement sentences. While Genie did not use plural forms of words and could not distinguish between plural and singular words or inflections, by October 1971 <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> distinguished between one versus more than one object and understood numbers and quantitative descriptors. She also started using some regular past tense forms of weak verbs. On tests she consistently did better recognizing and responding to the conjugations of irregular past tense verbs and strong verbs, but she only started to use these forms, either in imitation or in spontaneous speech, in 1973, and they remained limited.|$|E
25|$|Throughout linguists' testing, {{the size}} of Genie's {{vocabulary}} and {{the speed with which}} she expanded it continued to outstrip all anticipations. By mid-1975 she could accurately name most objects she encountered, and clearly knew more words than she regularly used. By contrast, Genie had far more difficulty with learning and using basic grammar. <b>She</b> <b>clearly</b> mastered certain principles of grammar, and her receptive comprehension consistently remained significantly ahead of her production, but the rate of her grammar acquisition was far slower than normal and resulted in an unusually large disparity between her vocabulary and grammar. In everyday conversations Genie typically spoke only in short utterances and inconsistently used what grammar she knew, although her use of grammar remained significantly better in imitation, and her conversational competence markedly improved during her stay but remained very low, which the scientists found unsurprising and suggested provided evidence that the ability to engage in conversation was a separate skill from knowing language.|$|E

500|$|It {{was then}} that Roxette {{embarked}} on an ambitious worldwide tour. The Join the Joyride! World Tour 1991/92 tour eventually reached more than 1.5 million fans in 107 concerts around the world, including a few dates in the US. On reviewing their Universal Amphitheater performance, Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Fredriksson is squandering her talents in pop's low-rent district. <b>She's</b> <b>clearly</b> superior to Roxette's uncomplicated, hook-crammed material..." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lacey Thornfield is Wendy's sexpot roommate. She is a {{conceptual}} artist {{who specializes in}} confrontational spoken-word performance art and works small jobs to pay off her student loans. It is unclear exactly what she knows about Wendy's new job, but <b>she's</b> <b>clearly</b> suspicious. In the ABC Family series she also has demonstrated an apparent crush on the Middleman, as shown by her often referring to him as [...] "sexy boss-man" [...] or [...] "pillow lips".|$|R
25|$|Some of Genie's {{pronunciation}} {{rules and}} limitations were characteristic of typical General American English speakers, and her progress with learning to pronounce individual phonemes followed relatively normal patterns for a first-language learner, {{but many others}} were highly atypical. Her speech typically contained unusually extensive deletions and substitutions, including vowel reduction, neutralization, and consonant modifications, and she typically spoke in an extremely high-pitched and monotonic voice. Curtiss determined that, despite the unpredictability with which Genie applied many of her pronunciation rules, there were several clearly defined patterns in her speech. Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and phonological limitations were normal for General American English speakers, and <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> limited the variability of her substitutions. Similar to young children, Genie's enunciation remained far better in imitation than in her own utterances. The scientists {{worked very hard to}} strengthen Genie's voice and improve her articulation, but in her dissertation Curtiss wrote that Genie's speech was still extremely difficult to represent using standard IPA.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{a small amount}} of {{responsiveness}} to nonverbal information, including gestures and facial expressions from other people, and made reasonably good eye contact. However, her demeanor was completely devoid of any expressions or discernible body language, and she could only nonverbally get across a few very basic needs. <b>She</b> <b>clearly</b> distinguished speaking from other sounds but remained almost completely silent and unresponsive to speech, and any responses she gave were to accompanying nonverbal signals. When upset Genie would wildly attack herself, but remained completely expressionless and never cried or vocalized; some accounts said she could not cry at all. To make noise, she would push chairs or other similar objects. Her outbursts initially occurred very often and had no discernible trigger—Kent wrote that she never tried to indicate the source of her anger—and continued until someone diverted her attention or she physically tired herself out, at which point she would again become silent and non-expressive.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{location}} of the body, the murder investigation was allocated to the RUC B Division (West Belfast), based at the Springfield Road station where CID Detective Alan Simpson served. He formed part of the CID team set up to investigate the Ogilby killing. After Sharlene was located in a children's home, she was interviewed by a female detective; <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> remembered the events of 24 July. It was arranged for Sharlene to accompany three CID detectives in a car to Sandy Row and she was able to direct them to the disused bakery in Hunter Street. A Scenes of Crime Officer was sent to the scene to examine the building's interior and collect the evidence. Forensics later showed that the bloodstains police detectives found on the floor and on the items retrieved from inside the UDA club matched Ogilby's blood group. Documents were also found on the premises bearing William Young's name. By that time the suspects had already been rounded up and taken in for interrogation. These were the eight women who had been inside the car with Ogilby on the evening of 23 July following the fracas outside the Glengall Street bus station.|$|E

25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters {{on the arm of}} Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. <b>She</b> <b>clearly</b> misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E

A sometime poet, Cisneros uses those words so precisely that many of her images stick in a reader's mind. Of two people kissing, for instance, she writes: 'It looked as if their bodies were ironing each other's clothes.'" ...|$|E

MacDonald, Professor of English at New Mexico State University {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter points out that {{although}} Potter regarded the lives of her father and his friends as comical and even beneath notice, yet <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> respected and valued their outdoor pursuits from the bemused treatment she accorded them in Jeremy Fisher. She valued nature untouched by humans even more, MacDonald notes, {{as evidenced by the}} careful observation in the illustrations. Jeremy Fisher was written without the many revisions typical of Potter's other productions, and the pictures appear effortless in their execution. MacDonald writes, [...] "Her ability to show human society without also implying its damaging effects on flora and fauna further underscores the book's felicitous composition and success".|$|E
500|$|Coates {{approaches}} Doggett in {{the fourth}} episode of season 4; Doggett responds {{in a manner that}} shows clearly that she is still affected by the rape. This is also the first time that Doggett openly refers to the incident as a 'rape'. Coates is seen to be visibly distressed by this. Towards the middle of the season, it is shown that Coates finally apologizes to Doggett and <b>she,</b> <b>clearly</b> surprised and relieved, forgives him and goes on to tell Big Boo about what happened. Big Boo, still furious about the rape, refuses to accept Doggett's decision, straining their friendship. In the twelfth episode of the season, Doggett explains to Big Boo the reasons why she decided to forgive Coates; [...] "Pain is always there... but suffering is a choice". The two resume their friendship following this.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Hit" [...] {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} music critics. Poppy Reid of The Music Network criticized the song for {{its reliance on}} autotune and lyrics [...] "you just don't expect (or want) from a 41-year-old". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated {{in a review of}} Love? that apart from [...] "Good Hit" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind", [...] "Lopez shines when the beat hits 120 or higher." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy called the song generic. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club was critical of the song, stating that: [...] " [...] in which she drones [...] "I got that good hit" [...] when <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> doesn't—nor does she seem to even want it." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush noted [...] "Good Hit" [...] to sound as if Lopez was covering Britney Spears [...] "rather than doing her own thing." [...] Monica Herrera from Billboard agreed, comparing the song to Britney Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] and additionally to the work of Nicki Minaj.|$|E

It seems, at first, not like the clever self-twitting <b>she</b> <b>clearly</b> intended, but rather a facile confirmation of her haters' conviction: that the middle-aged Madonna {{does not have a}} worldview beyond her next Pilates appointment. In 2004, Blender magazine listed the song at number nine on the list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever, stating that Madonna [...] "updates the 'Material Girl'-era satire of commercialism and spiritual emptiness... with what is hands-down the most embarrassing rap ever recorded. Nervous and choppy, she makes Debbie Harry sound as smooth as Jay-Z." [...] The magazine also said that the worst moment of the song is when after rapping, Madonna sings 'Nothing is what it seems' with no profundity. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song to be [...] "jittery, tuneless, and shallow to the point of self-parody".|$|E
500|$|In {{late summer}} {{he was invited}} by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family. <b>She</b> <b>clearly</b> had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged {{to make it clear}} to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzymała [...] "My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores", and {{responding}} to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was [...] "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed." [...] He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament—"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere", he wrote to Grzymała.|$|E

Marcia Adair of the Los Angeles Times commented in reviewing Dream With Me that [...] "her voice has matured quite a lot over the past 10 months. ... hat makes us feel like she will survive the journey from child star to adult performer is her magnificent sense of pitch, her natural ability to shape phrases and the ease with which she performs." [...] Jon Caramanica, in The New York Times, reviewed her Avery Fisher Hall concert: [...] "In {{the first half of the}} show Ms. Evancho often receded, but toward the end of the night she found purpose, delivering 'A Time for Us' with punch, and closing out Sarah McLachlan’s 'Angel' with what felt like real yearning". The Wall Street Journal called Evancho's 2011 performance of the song [...] "Angel" [...] on the Tonight Show [...] "moving".|$|E
