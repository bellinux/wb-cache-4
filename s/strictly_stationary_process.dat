5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and statistics, a stationary process ( [...] a <b>strict(ly)</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>process</b> or strong(ly) stationary process) is a stochastic process whose joint probability distribution {{does not change}} when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance, if they are present, also do not change over time.|$|E
50|$|A weaker form of {{stationarity}} commonly {{employed in}} signal processing {{is known as}} weak-sense stationarity, wide-sense stationarity (WSS), covariance stationarity, or second-order stationarity. WSS random processes only require that 1st moment (i.e. the mean) and autocovariance do not vary with respect to time. Any <b>strictly</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>process</b> which has a mean and a covariance is also WSS.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a two-step procedure for more efficient nonparametric prediction of a <b>strictly</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>process</b> admitting an ARMA representation. The procedure {{is based on}} the estimation of the ARMA representation, followed by a nonparametric regression where the ARMA residuals are used as explanatory variables. Compared to standard nonparametric regression methods, the number of explanatory variables can be reduced because our approach exploits the linear dependence of the process. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality results for our estimator. A Monte Carlo study and an empirical application on stock market indices suggest that significant gains can be achieved with our approach. ...|$|E
