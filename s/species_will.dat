5|$|It is {{classified}} within the genus as within the Lanceolata group, {{which consists of}} 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These <b>species</b> <b>will</b> often interbreed {{with each other in}} areas where two members of the group occur. P.terminalis has been reported to interbreed with Persoonia cornifolia and Persoonia sericea, two other members of the group.|$|E
5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed {{to sleep on the}} wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several <b>species</b> <b>will</b> feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other <b>species</b> <b>will</b> sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns are {{long-lived}} {{birds that}} spend considerable time raising {{only a few}} young, and are thus said to be K-selected. The bird has life span that was thought be around 20 years, however National Geographic, The University of Alberta & Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concluded in 2010 that more than 50% of this <b>species</b> <b>will</b> live past their 30th birthday. A study in the Farne Islands estimated an annual survival rate of 82%.|$|E
50|$|When R > R*j, <b>species</b> j's {{population}} <b>will</b> increase; when R is {{less than}} R*j, <b>species</b> js population <b>will</b> decline. Because of this, the species with the lowest R* will eventually dominate. Consider the two species case, where R*1 < R*2. When species 2 is at equilibrium, R = R*2, and <b>species</b> 1's population <b>will</b> be increasing. When species 1 is at equilibrium, R = R*1, and <b>species</b> 2's population <b>will</b> be decreasing.|$|R
25|$|At equilibrium, therefore, some {{fraction}} of the <b>species's</b> habitat <b>will</b> always be unoccupied.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{omnivorous}} <b>species</b> that <b>will</b> {{feed upon}} vegetation, fish, insects, worms, and carrion.|$|R
5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger <b>species</b> <b>will</b> take it over and expand it.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds' life {{histories}} are dramatically {{different from those}} of land birds. In general, they are K-selected, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for up to ten years), and invest more effort into fewer young. Most <b>species</b> <b>will</b> only have one clutch a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the Cassin's auklet), and many species (like the tubenoses and sulids), only one egg a year.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most <b>species</b> <b>will</b> occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|E

5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This <b>species</b> <b>will</b> also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|E
5|$|Their native {{habitats}} {{are very}} varied, with different elevations, bioclimatic areas and substrates, being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures, and including grassland, scrub, woods, river banks and rocky crevices. Although requirements vary, overall {{there is a}} preference for acidic soils, although some <b>species</b> <b>will</b> grow on limestone. Narcissus scaberulus will grow on granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer, while Narcissus dubius thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.|$|E
5|$|This {{catch-all}} category {{refers to}} other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up. Kleptoparasites are seabirds {{that make a}} part of their living stealing food of other seabirds. Most famously, frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour, although gulls, terns and other <b>species</b> <b>will</b> steal food opportunistically. The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy. Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of the}} diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%. Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises, as will giant petrels. Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging: an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses. Some <b>species</b> <b>will</b> also feed on other seabirds; for example, gulls, skuas and pelicans will often take eggs, chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies, while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups.|$|E

50|$|Taxonomic bias: fossils with easily {{discernible}} morphologies {{will be easy}} {{to distinguish}} as separate <b>species,</b> and <b>will</b> thus have an inflated abundance.|$|R
5|$|While nesting, Arctic terns are {{vulnerable}} to predation by cats and other animals. Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger herring gull steals eggs and hatchlings. Camouflaged eggs help prevent this, as do isolated nesting sites. While feeding, skuas, gulls, and other tern <b>species</b> <b>will</b> often harass the birds and steal their food. They often form mixed colonies with other terns, such as common and Sandwich terns.|$|E
5|$|A second form of mimicry {{occurs when}} two aposematic organisms {{share the same}} anti-predator {{adaptation}} and mimic each other, {{to the benefit of}} both species, since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them. This form of mimicry is known as M端llerian mimicry, after Fritz M端ller, a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century. Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are M端llerian mimics; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung. Therefore, a predator which has had a negative experience with any such <b>species</b> <b>will</b> likely avoid any that resemble it in the future. M端llerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range, each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All <b>species</b> <b>will</b> catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).|$|E

50|$|If {{pregnancy}} occurs, the placental hormone chorionic gonadotropin {{continues to}} maintain the corpus luteum, but in some <b>species</b> it <b>will</b> eventually degrade sometime during pregnancy.|$|R
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most <b>species</b> <b>will</b> forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|Barriers to {{reproduction}} {{between two}} diverging sexual populations {{are required for}} the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be {{possible for them to}} produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the <b>species</b> <b>will</b> remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype. The importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.|$|E
5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. The corn crake may take pests such as Sitona weevils, leatherjackets and wireworms. In Africa, termites, cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed. These opportunist hunters {{will take the}} occasional vertebrate such as a small frog, rodent or fish. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. In Africa, both <b>species</b> <b>will</b> occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. Crex crakes forage singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes {{in association with the}} other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and common quails.|$|E
50|$|These birds visit small flowers, {{including}} those ignored by other <b>species,</b> and <b>will</b> also take tiny insects. They are frequently chased off by larger hummingbirds.|$|R
5000|$|Insurance Effect If an {{ecosystem}} contains more <b>species</b> then it <b>will</b> {{have a greater}} likelihood of having redundant stabilizing <b>species,</b> and it <b>will</b> have {{a greater number of}} species that respond to perturbations in different ways.

50|$|Melaleuca flavovirens is {{a drought}} {{resistant}} <b>species</b> but <b>will</b> tolerate wet situations and is tolerant of frosts. It can be propagated from seed or from cuttings.|$|R
5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} on the individual species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can leap out of the water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small animals can be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water. They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most <b>species</b> <b>will</b> eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
5|$|In the summer, the Alpine chough feeds {{mainly on}} {{invertebrates}} collected from pasture, such as beetles (Selatosomus aeneus and Otiorhynchus morio {{have been recorded}} from pellets), snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and fly larvae. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the European Hackberry (Celtis australis) and Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), rose hips, and domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus vernus albiflorus, including the pistils, perhaps {{as a source of}} carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where additional food is available, winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough <b>species</b> <b>will</b> hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Seabird colonies {{are highly}} variable. Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an {{albatross}} colony, or densely packed {{as with a}} murre colony. In most seabird colonies, several different <b>species</b> <b>will</b> nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without nests), on cliffs, in burrows under the ground and in rocky crevices. Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces. The tropical Bonin petrel nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive wedge-tailed shearwater. When the seasons overlap, the wedge-tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels {{in order to use}} their burrows.|$|E
