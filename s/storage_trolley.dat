40|$|Radioactive wastes from {{hospitals}} {{form one}} of {{the various types of}} urban wastes, which are managed in developed countries in a safe and organized way. In countries where growth of nuclear medicine services are envisaged, implementations of existing regulatory policies and guidelines in hospitals in terms of handling of radioactive materials used in the treatment of patients need a good model. To address this issue, {{a brief description of the}} methods is presented. A designed prototype waste <b>storage</b> <b>trolley</b> is found to be of great help in decaying the I- 131 solid wastes from wards before releasing to waste treatment plant of the city. Two delay tanks with collection time of about 2 months and delay time of 2 months alternately result in 6 releases of urine toilet effluents to the sewage treatment plant (STP) of the hospital annually. Samples of effluents collected at releasing time documented radioactive releases of I- 131 much below recommended levels of bi-monthly release. External counting of samples showed good statistical correlation with calculated values. An overview of safe procedures for radioactive waste disposal is presented...|$|E
50|$|Both depots {{are used}} {{not only for}} the <b>storage</b> of <b>trolley</b> buses, but also for diesel powered buses. In {{contrast}} with the depots used solely for diesel buses, these depots are fully covered, for the better safeguarding of the fleet.|$|R
50|$|The Trolley Barn {{was built}} in the early 1970s to store the growing stock of equipment. While the {{building}} has no real antique value, it provides a well-used maintenance pit for trolley maintenance, room for <b>trolley</b> <b>storage,</b> and a health & welfare room for volunteer operators and conductors.|$|R
50|$|Changeover between diesel and {{overhead}} electric power {{takes place at}} the station, similar to Airport Station on the Blue Line. There is a small <b>storage</b> area for <b>trolley</b> buses. The station is the first station at the surface when going outbound from South Station; Courthouse and World Trade Center are both in the Waterfront Tunnel. Like all Silver Line stations, Silver Line Way is fully accessible for wheelchair users.|$|R
50|$|The Midwest Electric Railway {{is located}} in the heart of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa on the campgrounds of the Midwest Old Thresher's Reunion {{sandwiched}} between Locust and S. Walnut Streets. The railroad crosses E. Thresher Road in two places. The main headquarters for MERA and <b>trolley</b> <b>storage</b> is in a silver-painted trolley barn which is located on S. Locust Road less than a half mile from south of Thresher Road.|$|R
50|$|Trolleys {{entered and}} exited through the garage {{doors at the}} {{northwest}} corner. Tracks throughout the building branched out {{to allow them to}} be stored and repaired. An elevator in the rear could bring them up to additional space on the second floor, part of which was devoted to the company's offices as well as reading and recreation rooms. The third floor was devoted entirely to <b>trolley</b> <b>storage</b> and maintenance. At the trolley system's peak the barn serviced 85 cars.|$|R
25|$|The site on Commercial Street was {{originally}} a refinery for the American Sugar Refining Company (predecessor to Domino Sugar) opened in 1868, {{and later became}} a <b>trolley</b> <b>storage</b> yard and washing facility for the B In 1946 the Board of Transportation began constructing a new facility on this site, opened in July 1949 as the Crosstown Trolley Coach and Car Depot to serve 78 trolley coaches and 60 trolley cars. It was fully converted into a bus depot in 1954. The current depot consists of a two-story brick administration building facing Commercial Street, and shop for repairs, inspection and washing facing Newtown Creek, along with a large storage lot for buses. The depot holds around 120 buses at capacity. At one time, it operated ten lines: B18 (discontinued), B24, B29 (now part of the B24), B30 (discontinued), B39 (discontinued/reestablished 2013), B48, B59 (now Q59), B60, B61 (originally the Crosstown Line, since split into a new B61 and B62), and B62 (now part of the B43). The B62's northern terminal was located one block away from the depot at Manhattan Avenue and Box Street. The depot operations ended on November 7, 1981 because of service reductions and operating cost. It later stored several new General Motors-built RTS-04 buses awaiting entry into revenue service in 1982.|$|R
