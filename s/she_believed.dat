5|$|It is {{impossible}} to judge the truth of these diary entries, but Reich's second daughter, the psychiatrist Lore Reich Rubin, told Christopher Turner that <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> Reich had {{been a victim of}} child sexual abuse, and that this explained his lifelong interest in sex and childhood sexuality.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the text, she {{contrasts}} the constructive, creative imagination with destructive commerce. By associating commercialism {{with the}} anonymous lover in the text, Wollstonecraft was also directly censuring Imlay, who <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> cared more for his business speculations than {{for her and}} their child.|$|E
5|$|According to Lee, she {{received}} a frantic call on June 21, 2009, from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide reported that Jackson was feeling ill.

5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Cottingley Fairies {{gradually}} declined after 1921. Both girls {{married and}} lived abroad {{for a time}} after they grew up, yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination. In 1966 a reporter from the Daily Express newspaper traced Elsie, who had by {{then returned to the}} UK. Elsie left open the possibility that <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> she had photographed her thoughts, and the media once again became interested in the story.|$|E
5|$|Lawrie and Vinson {{approved}} the models. On January 8, Ross telephoned the commission, informing them of this. With Sinnock ill (he died in 1947) and the March of Dimes campaign under way, Ross did {{not wait for}} a full meeting of the commission, but authorized the start of production. This caused some ill-feeling between the Mint and the commission, but <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> that she had fulfilled her obligations under the executive order.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> that {{religious}} unity was necessary for a peaceful public life and explicitly rejected the idea of religious toleration. However, she never allowed the Church to interfere with what she considered to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E
5|$|Rand's {{stated goal}} in writing fiction was to portray her {{vision of an}} ideal man. The {{character}} of Howard Roark, the protagonist of The Fountainhead, was the first instance where <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> she had achieved this. Roark embodies Rand's egoistic moral ideals, especially the virtues of independence and integrity.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Selena's {{full-length}} Spanish albums Selena (1989) and Ven Conmigo (1990), which included Tejano and other Mexican pop styles, she decided that her next recording would feature an English-language song. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> that such a song would convince EMI Records' chairman Charles Koppelman that {{she was ready to}} release a crossover album. EMI had wanted her to acquire a larger fan base before launching her crossover career. In spite of this, Selena included the song on Entre a Mi Mundo.|$|E

5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{argued for}} girls and boys to have equal {{recreational}} and educational opportunities and for women to have fair wages. Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> that women {{had the right to}} suffrage, education, property, control over their earned money, and custody of their children. She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Kocianski began wrestling on the Notre Dame High School {{scholastic}} wrestling team. She was {{the first}} female varsity wrestler in the school's history.

At the time, {{she was also a}} member of USA Wrestling, a freestyle wrestling association. Her life goal was, according to her, to become a professional wrestler, and <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> that having a solid amateur background would help her reach it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>believes</b> that YouTube has an {{important}} role to play in issues concerning body image. On her view, body image is shaped by the [...] "perfect" [...] images of women in magazines and movies and that when women and girls pursue these [...] "perfect" [...] body images, the result can sometimes be eating and body image disorders. <b>She</b> <b>believes</b> that YouTube provides content creators with a platform to present girls and women as they really are, which <b>she</b> <b>believes</b> will encourage them to be more confident in who they are.|$|R

5|$|For {{the first}} two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album. She left school after doing her mock A-levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications. In 2005, Bush stated in an {{interview}} with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> EMI signed her before she was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie, and mime training with Adam Darius.|$|E
5|$|From 1951 to 1963, Stevens {{served as}} {{vice-president}} of the Lucy Stone League, though she struggled with maintaining militancy. Stevens was not anti-male, rather pro-female. She {{did not follow}} a belief that for women to succeed, men had to be omitted; rather, <b>she</b> <b>believed</b> that collaboration with men was essential. In her last years, Stevens supported the establishment of feminist studies as a legitimate field of academic inquiry in American universities and tried to establish a Lucy Stone Chair of Feminism at Radcliffe College.|$|E
5|$|Further {{inspiration}} for the album came from Madonna's exploration of other cultures and art, literature, and music, referencing them in the songs. <b>She</b> <b>believed</b> that the tracks should stand on their own, so that one could sing them accompanied with just a guitar. Madonna {{enlisted the help of}} her daughter Lourdes and son Rocco, calling them her A advisers. They visited night clubs and were able to provide her with news about up-and-coming music and artists, helping to create the sounds she gravitated towards for the album.|$|E
