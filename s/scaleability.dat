40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of interconnection networks for massively parallel computer systems is <b>scaleability.</b> The fiber-optic network described in this paper uses both wavelength division multiplexing and a confgurable ratio between optics and electronics to gain an architecture with good <b>scaleability.</b> The network connects distributed modules together to a huge parallel system where each node itself typically consists of parallel processing elements. The paper describes two different implementations of the star topology, one uses an electronic star and f b e r optic connections, the other is purely optical with a passive optical star in the center. The medium access control of the communication concept is presented and some <b>scaleability</b> properties are discussed involving also a multiple-star topology. ...|$|E

40|$|Here {{we discuss}} the use of well {{calibrated}} resist and etch bias models, {{in conjunction with a}} fast microlithographic aerial image simulator, to predict and “optimize ” the printed shapes through all critical levels in a dense SRAM design. Our key emphasis here is on “optimization criteria, ” namely, having achieved good predictability for printability with lithography models, how to use this capability in conjunction with device and circuit design considerations, not just to achieve “best printability, ” but rather to achieve the combination of best electrical performance, yield, and density. The key lithography/design optimization issues discussed here are: (1) tighteningof gate width variation by reducing spatial curvature in the source and drain regions, (2) achieving sufficient contact areas, (3) maximizing process window for overlay, (4) reducing leakage mechanisms by reducing contributions of stress and strain due to the printed shapes of oxide isolation regions, (5) examining topological differences in design during the optimization process, (6) accounting for mask corner rounding, and (7) designing for <b>scaleability</b> to smaller dimensions (here to 0. 18 µm) to achieve optimal design reusability.
