50|$|In 1950 the Korean War {{resulted}} both in many war injuries, and in widespread poverty. Therefore, unfortunately, {{there was}} no way for survivors to prepare for old age. They had to work for economic renewal, not for private finance. As a result, Korea has the highest number of <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Generation</b> members than any other Asian country. That is why Korea still has a large family system. Especially in rural areas, large, extended families live together. As with the <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Generation</b> in other countries, the main concern in Korea is the additional cost of caring for elderly parents.|$|E

CD 30 mRNA was detectable in the tumor cells of 9 of 9 cases of EC or mixed germ cell tumors with an EC component but in no other nonlymphoid tumors.

By Northern blot analysis, CD 30 transcripts could be demonstrated in the EC cell line Tera- 2. Employing a highly sensitive second <b>generation</b> <b>sandwich</b> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we could detect the soluble CD 30 molecule in 8 of 8 sera from patients with a diagnosis of EC but not in 8 of 10 sera from patients with other testicular germ cell tumors.

50|$|Becoming {{a part of}} the <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Generation</b> {{can affect}} your {{financial}} status, your personal time, health, and career development.

40|$|There {{is limited}} evidence, in {{particular}} for the UK, {{on the recent}} trends and characteristics of the so-called “Sandwich generation”. This refers to those individuals in their mid-life who are facing the responsibilities of caring for multiple generations, usually towards young/adult children and elderly parents. With the large generation {{of the baby boomers}} entering mid and late life and an increasing number of families sharing longer years of their life among 3 - 4 generations, there is an increasing concern regarding the pressure that individuals could face when they are involved in multiple roles such as simultaneous caring roles as well as paid employment. In this paper, we use recent data from the 1958 National Child Development Survey to examine how mid-life men and women distribute their time dedicated to provide help to their elderly parents and to their own adult children (in terms of providing grandchild care). Moreover, we investigate the socio-demographic characteristics that distinguish individuals supporting multiple generations from those who provide help only towards one generation, or individuals who do not provide any support towards family members. Initial results from the research show that around one third of mid-life individuals are ‘at risk’ of providing care to multiple generations, meaning that they have at least one parent or parent-in-law alive and at least one grandchild alive (regardless of whether their adult child who is the parent of their grandchild is alive or not), and therefore may become ‘sandwiched’ between the older generation and the younger generation in terms of providing support. Among these individuals, half provide care to both generations simultaneously. With a broader definition of support provided towards parents/ parents-in-law, we found that being <b>sandwiched</b> between two <b>generations</b> in terms of having support responsibilities is more common than what has been found in previous studies. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich {{composites}} {{are widely}} used in various industries such as aeronautical,mechanical, automotive, marine and others. However, most of the existing sandwiches are not suitable and cost effective for applications in civil infrastructure. An innovative fibre composite sandwich panel made of glass fibre reinforced skins and a high strength core material has been developed for building and other structural applications. The behaviour of this new <b>generation</b> <b>sandwich</b> panel has been studied to assist the technical persons and the construction crews in better understanding its properties for an efficient use. This project seeks to investigate the behaviour of fibre composite sandwich panels for their use in flooring applications under different loading conditions. The properties of the sandwich panels will be determined firstly before the panels are tested under different loading conditions of point load and uniformly distributed load. The main objectives of this project are to research the background information relating to sandwich panels for civil design purposes, conduct initial testing of the core, skin and sandwich panel to gain material properties and use those material properties for finite element analysis in Strand 7. Testing will then be completed on slab specimens under point load and uniformly distributed loading conditions and evaluate results and recommend changes to design or testing. This process will be repeated for variables such as fibre orientation, fixity and one and two-way spanning slab systems. The panels were found to behave similarly under both loading conditions with the slab system and fixity not having a dramatic effect on failure mode or deflection. The 0 ° main fibre orientation deflected less than 90 ° main fibre orientation due to increases stiffness. The modelling of point load system {{was found to be}} very accurate due to almost exact replication of experimental test being achieved. The modelling of the UDL analysis was not as accurate as point loading, due to variables in experimental testing that were not able to be achieved in finite element mode...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to give a deeper {{understanding}} of Power Spectral Density analysis and how {{it can be used to}} predict the impact of fluctuating loads induced directly to a rocket nozzle. The initial study mainly deals with understanding how the response may vary with changed geometrical setup of the reinforcement structure. That is why a great deal of the time has been spent on parameterize the model to make it easy to automatically loop over many different geometrical and material properties of the nozzle extension. The work was implemented on a simplified FE-model of the next <b>generation</b> <b>sandwich</b> nozzle extension that was under development at GKN Aerospace Engine Systems. The thesis will only address the impact of buffeting loads during atmospheric ascent as it is the most critical stage of the flight. The occurrence of buffeting loads during atmospheric ascent is due to varying pressure fields as it passes through the atmosphere. This load depends primarily on the shape of the vehicle, but the severity can change rapidly depending on the dynamic pressure, angle of attack and Mach number. To analyze the behavior of a random load it is important to understand which critical structure modes are present in the specified frequency range. Excitation of these modes can lead to structural failure of the nozzle due to excessive displacement. Evalaution of the critical mode frequencies indicated a linear relationship, up to 60 mm stiffener height, between the eigenfrequency of the critical modes and the stiffener height, where both 3 -wave and 4 -wave increase modes more rapidly for higher stiffeners than for the ovalisation mode. The pendulum and torsion mode will have nearly constant frequencies. Both the torsion and pendulum mode are caused by motion at the nozzle throat and are unaffected by the increased stiffness of the lower part of the nozzle. Connecting these linear relations to the energy distribution of the PSD spectrum showed an increase of available energy for the ovalisation mode and a decrease for 3 -wave and 4 -wave modes for higher stiffeners. A further study of how the reinforcement structure affects the eigenfrequencies and the magnitude of the critical modes states that the stiffener height has the largest contribution. The increased stiffener height gives an exponentially decreased radial displacement of the nozzle wall. The stiffener thickness has a minor effect on the mode frequencies and contributes only to an increased structural stiffness of the reinforcement structure. This states that it is better to use higher stiffeners than an increased number of lower stiffeners. At the same time the allowed stiffener height is limited by an increased stiffness of the wall at each stiffener due to increased risk for axial buckling between stiffeners. An important notice is that the PSD spectrum for the Ariane 5 rocket was not available during the thesis. Instead a PSD spectrum from a slightly larger nozzle extension was used. How this PSD spectrum relates to the Ariane 5 PSD spectrum needs to be further investigated to verify the magnitude of these critical modes. Finally, the study has shown that PSD analysis is a time efficient and competent tool that could be used as a first approach during the design phase. A problem that was stated early on was the lack of support to handle nonlinear behaviors such as plasticity in ANSYS. This meant that large temperature changes occurring during flight could not be accounted for in this PSD analysis. However LS-DYNA has recently implemented a non-linear solver for the aerospace industry, based on Boeing software N-FEARA, a NIKE 3 D-based finite element tool for structural analysis of vibro-acoustic loads. If the LS-DYNA non-linear solver can account for large thermal and structural loads, the PSD analysis might be an alternative to perform time history analysis.

5000|$|A {{separate}} but intertwined expenditure issue focuses on family aging—the {{degree to which}} longevity has changed the age structure of the family with substantial implications for the financial relationships between and among family members. When we say that [...] "people are living longer" [...] we are also saying that parents are living longer. The 1980s concept of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> focused on forty-year-olds (usually women) simultaneously {{taking care of their}} sixty-five-year old parents and their babies and toddlers. Greater longevity is accompanied by the emergence, however, of the senior <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> in which sixty-year-olds are now the generation in the middle taking care (socially and financially) of their ninety-year old parents alongside caring for their teenage and young-adult children. [...] These demographically new [...] "senior sandwich" [...] responsibilities of middle-agers can have substantial impact on their expenditure stage years, as they are now caring for elderly parents just as they are planning for their own later life. Simultaneously, anticipation of these responsibilities can also add complexity to their accumulation stage planning. While the wealth span model primarily is an individual-level construct, financing health care and middle-age care for elderly parents are issues of both macro financial-social policy and individual behavior.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Sandwich Generation" [...] was {{introduced}} to the social work and the gerontology communities, respectively, by Dorothy Miller and Elaine Brody in 1981.

Now that people are living longer and children are growing up and needing continued care, the [...] "sandwiching" [...] is felt by both men and women who are in their fifties and sixties.

50|$|Taking care of {{an elderly}} parent while caring for your own {{children}} is a very time consuming task.

Depression and anxiety are a huge risk factor for the <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Generation,</b> especially for women who are involved. On the contrary, men, and some women, are typically at risk for loss of career development. They might be at the peak of their career and have to take a step down and lose their opportunity to be able to help care for their aging parent or growing children.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} century {{substantial}} changes in complexity have affected both the accumulation and expenditure stages of the wealth span. The increased complexity of the expenditure is dramatically evidenced by the fundamental demographic facts of increasing life expectancy which, at base, means spending over a longer number of years. Clearly the largest set of complexities precipitated by greater longevity are seen in older age health, scientific and cultural responses to health and aging, {{and of course the}} personal and societal financing of health care—including health care insurance, Medicare in particular, and the emergence of long-term care, including long-term care insurance, as a somewhat separable cluster of financial and political issues. Further exacerbating this complexity, the senior <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> responsibilities noted above extend the personal and financial impact of older-age longevity to the middle-age children of elderly parents. For example, In 1900 only 39 percent of persons age 50 had one surviving parent, rising to 80 percent by 2000. Further, in 1900 only 7 percent of 60-year olds had even one parent alive, rising to 49 percent by 2000.|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{therapists}} {{need to be}} {{cognizant of}} evidence-based role balance advice and strategies that women with multigenerational caring responsibilities can implement independently or with minimal assistance, as role balance {{may not be the}} primary goal during many encounters with this population. Hence, this study aimed to identify the viewpoints on the most helpful role balance strategies for working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women, both from their own perspectives and from the perspective of occupational therapists. This was achieved through a Q method- ology study, where 54 statements were based on findings from interviews, <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> literature and occupational therapy literature. In total, 31 working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women and 42 occupational therapists completed the Q sort through either online or paper administration.

40|$|<b>Sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> {{caregivers}} simultaneously {{provide care}} to their aging parents/in-laws {{and at least}} one child under 18 years living in the home (Sinha, 2013). In 2012, 2. 23 million Canadians were considered sandwiched caregivers. This group is expected to grow as individuals are delaying marriage, resulting in delayed childrearing (Robinson, Barbee, Martin, Singer, Yegidis, 2003). Further, the government has been advocating for caregiving to move from formal to informal caregiving. Although this would help the government immensely, this creates challenges for middle-aged adults occupying multiple roles. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the lived experiences of <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women and the influence caregiving had on their health behaviours. This study used phenomenology as its theoretical orientation. One- on-one semi-structured interviews were the main form of data collection for nine <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women. The following themes emerged: (1) The role of the caregiver; (2) Caregiving: It is a balancing act; (3) Stormy seas: It is not always sunshine and rainbows; and (4) Silver linings amidst the turmoil. By reflecting on their past and current experiences, the <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women described the perceived challenges and benefits associated with their complex caregiving roles. Further, the mothers’ health (e. g. physical activity, nutrition, sleep and mental health) was compromised due to time constraints placed on their lives as a result of caregiving.

40|$|Approximately 10 % {{of women}} in {{developed}} countries are working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women, who combine paid employment with ongoing multigenerational caring responsibilities {{for at least one}} child under 18 years and one parent or parent-in-law. This role combination is expected to become more common due to the increased workforce participation of women, childbirth at an older age, reduced fertility rates, an ageing population and a trend towards community based care. Although there are numerous benefits related to membership in the working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation,</b> there are also a range of costs related to role participation and quality of life. In particular, these women face a complex array of challenges to achieving a satisfactory level of role balance. This thesis describes a two-staged research project, where multiple methods were utilised to explore role balance related experiences and strategies among Australian working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women. The Model of Juggling Occupations was developed to provide a conceptual framework linking the six papers contained within this thesis. The first stage of this research project focused on exploring role balance experiences among 18 working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women through a case study approach, where data were collected through a questionnaire, time diary and interview (Papers I – IV). The three methodological approaches were utilised to investigate the within-role factors of activity participation, values, interests, perceived competence and habits for the three defining roles of mother, parental carer and working, along with the enriching and conflicting between-role interactions. A combination of qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques were utilised to reveal that working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women tended to experience a moderate level of role balance. Interests and habits were the two within-role factors most strongly associated with the experience of role balance. Although enriching interactions between roles facilitated role balance to some extent, between role conflict posed a greater barrier to role balance outcomes. The second stage of this research project focused on identifying the role balance strategies utilised by working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women (Papers V – VI). This was achieved through interviews with the 18 women from the case study approach, along with a viewpoint study of 31 working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women and 42 occupational therapists. Findings from the interviews revealed the women used six types of within-role balance strategies: living with integrity, being the best you can, doing what you love, loving what you do, remembering why, and searching for signs of success. The women also described six types of between-role balance strategies: maintaining health and wellbeing, repressing perfectionism, managing time and energy, releasing responsibility, nurturing social connection, and reciprocating. The viewpoint study revealed the most helpful specific role balance strategies were allowing enough time for rest, sleep and ‘me time’, along with relinquishing control, embracing realistic expectations and using time management techniques. Overall, this thesis provides evidence that role balance among Australian working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> women is a desirable and achievable state, despite numerous challenges and complexities. These women often achieved role balance at the level of “doing” activities associated with their multiple roles. However, they struggled at times with “being” in a single role in the moment due to conflicting demands on their attention. It is possible that achieving a higher level of role balance is reliant on the process of “becoming” a working <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> woman, where they balance “doing” and “being” aspects within and between their multiple roles. These findings add substantial knowledge to this field and have the potential to guide the development of services to improve role balance among working women with multigenerational caring responsibilities, along with the introduction of policies to optimise their participation within their homes, workplaces and communities...|$|E
40|$|Background In {{the recent}} years, chronic {{diseases}} {{have been identified}} as challenges of public health and healthcare and are the major causes of death in the female population. Females make up 75 % of family caregivers. The <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> females, who care for their aging parents while supporting their own children, encounter an increase in stress related to chronic diseases, but in some studies, the issue of care involves lower depression risk and more constructive psychological effects. Objectives The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between family caregiving and chronic diseases in <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> females. Patients and Methods This study was a case-control study in Ahvaz in which 360 females including 180 <b>sandwich</b> <b>generation</b> caregivers and 180 caregivers of one generation (i. e. those only taking care of their own child) were selected using the random cluster sampling method during six months. The two groups of participants were matched in terms of age, number of children under their care and their socioeconomic status. Data analysis was conducted using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S test or KS test) and chi-square tests through the SPSS v. 22 software. Results A statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the presence of chronic diseases (P = 0. 001). There was a significant correlation between chronic diseases and number of children (P = 0. 03), person receiving care (P = 0. 004), educational level (P = 0. 001), caregiving duration (P = 0. 005), and socioeconomic status (P = 0. 14). Chronic diseases in caregivers with more than four children, under diploma educational level, and with unfavorable socioeconomic status were more than others. Additionally, the occurrence of chronic diseases was more in females caring for their grandchildren. There was no significant correlation between chronic diseases and the age of caregivers (P > 0. 05).
