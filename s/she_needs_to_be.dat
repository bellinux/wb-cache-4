Naomi admits to Liam {{that she has}} been feigning interest in things he likes and that <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true to herself, even if it means their relationship won't work. This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was sexually harassed by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor.

Potter was proprietary over Hill Top and jealously guarded it to and for herself and some of this jealousy is projected onto Mrs. Tittlemouse's anxiety about the sanctity of her home.

500|$|The cast of FOX musical series Glee {{performed}} {{this song}} on the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", with Heather Morris' character, Brittany Pierce, taking the lead. The episode revolved around teen drinking and its dangers. The members of Glee Club are asked to perform at the school's alcohol awareness assembly, in which [...] "Tik Tok" [...] {{is one of the}} songs performed. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that the song's inclusion in the episode was superfluous, stating that it was just an excuse to get a Kesha song on Glee. VanDerWerff however, wrote that he [...] "REALLY liked Heather Morris'" [...] rendition of the song. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised Brittany's choreography and overall performance in [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "The huge star of this number was clearly Brittany, who more and more every week proves that <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved to the forefront of this show's big performances and storylines." [...] Gonzalez gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a B, calling it [...] "pure, fun entertainment up until we got to the part straight out of the mind of Gordie LaChance. So even though the purple vomit was a bit too much for this weak viewer, the performance made me add a Ke$ha song to my iTunes, which I never thought would happen." [...] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a mostly positive review, writing, [...] "Love Brittany as we do, we wish Rachel or Mercedes stepped up to the mic. The performance is less risqué than their Pep Rally [...] "Push It" [...] but winds up causing more controversy when Brittany pukes on Rachel and Santana also vomits up grey slush. It's a fitting end to the song, and the episode." ...|$|E

Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in the book, , that although Madonna's vocals lacked emotional complexity in the tune, she nevertheless created a [...] "compelling" [...] version, [...] "right up to its grand orchestral finale". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented: [...] "Easily one of Madonna's greatest vocal performance to date, the singer's dramatic interpretation of Evita's unofficial theme song was both loyal and bizarrely autobiographical". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, David Gritten opined that [...] "show-stoppers like 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina', which need to be belted out, sound comfortable for her". George Hatza from The Reading Eagle, said that [...] " [...] sings 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in a beautiful, soaring, goosebump-inducing contralto". J. D. Considine, from The Baltimore Sun, said {{it was one of}} the [...] "big songs" [...] from the soundtrack. In her review of Evita, Janet Maslin from The New York Times commented that the track was [...] "tinglingly sung". Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, wrote: [...] "Madonna, to her credit, puts on quite a show. She sings. She tangos [...] She even belts out 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' to prove she's just folks". Peter Keough, from the Boston Phoenix, praised Madonna's [...] "stunning delivery" [...] of the track. He wrote: [...] " [...] sings a softly lush soprano that captures Evita's quiet vulnerability. Her full-lipped, precise notes stride across the song's grandiose orchestrations. Webber's songs allows her all the room <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> many things; she succeeds at them all". A very positive review came from the [...] Hartford Courants Greg Morago, who called the song [...] "a calculated, theatrical triumph of shameless pandering and steely determination that parallels the pop diva's own rise to the top. Madonna makes this song her own; she was born to play the chignon-coiffed, diamond-studded Santa Evita".|$|E

She was rated overall only 4/10 for this game.

[...] Their official guide for 2011's Mortal Kombat deemed Kitana a capable fighter who once again [...] "is at her deadliest in the corner" [...] and is also especially good if played against Baraka and Cyber Sub-Zero. Prima observed Kitana in MK2011 as her [...] "cheapest" [...] incarnation so far, stating [...] "Kitana is not only one of the most damaging characters in the game, but in addition to the Fan Lift and Square Wave Punch, she can combo her Air Fan almost any time an opponent is airborne." [...] According to Prima's guide to MKX, [...] "Kitana {{is one of the more}} unique characters in the game" [...] due to her inheriting many of Jade's special moves, and she [...] "is a zoning character at heart, but she can play offensively or defensively" [...] depending of a variation chosen. The guide recommended the [...] "Mournful" [...] variant for former Jade players, and the [...] "Assassin" [...] variant, which [...] "tries to take the generally defensive style Kitana has in Mortal Kombat X and add some offensive firepower to it," [...] for veteran Kitana players.|$|E
