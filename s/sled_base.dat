40|$|Grand Push Auto is an {{exertion}} game {{in which}} players aim to push a full sized car to ever increasing speeds. The re-appropriation of a car as essentially a large weight allows us to create a highly portable and distributable exertion {{game in which}} the main game element has a weight of over 1000 kilograms. In this paper we discuss initial experiences with GPA, and present 3 questions for ongoing study which have been identified from our early testing: How might we appropriate existing objects in exertion game design, and does appropriation change how we think about these objects in different contexts, for example environmental awareness? How does this relate to more traditional <b>sled</b> <b>based</b> weight training? How can we create exertion games that allow truly brutal levels of force...|$|R
40|$|Recently, we {{demonstrated}} polymer solution light-emitting devices (SLEDs) using polymeric solutions as the light-emitting medium. The {{operating mechanism}} of the SLED was proven to be electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL). In this manuscript, we report the results obtained from ac impedence studies on the <b>SLED.</b> <b>Based</b> on the results, the SLED can be modeled as a combination of device capacitance (C 1), solution layer resistance (R 1), interfacial capacitance (C 2), and interfacial resistance (R 2). It {{was found that the}} impedance characteristics of the SLED are a strong function of the bias voltage. At low bias voltages, the impedance plots exhibited semicircular and linear characteristics in the high- and low-frequency range, respectively. With increase in the bias voltage, C 2 decreased, implying an ECL mechanism for the SLED. Finally, an interesting behavior was observed when the SLED was biased at 8 V. The impedance spectrum was {{similar to that of the}} solid-state polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC), suggesting some similarities in the device operating mechanism between the SLED and LEC...|$|R

40|$|A new {{klystron}} based X-band rf {{power source}} operating at 11. 994 GHz has been installed {{and started to}} be commissioned at CERN in collaboration with CEA Saclay and SLAC for CLIC accelerating structure tests. The system comprises a solid state high voltage modulator, an XL 5 klystron developed by SLAC, a cavity <b>based</b> <b>SLED</b> type pulse compressor, the necessary low level rf system including rf diagnostics and interlocks and the surrounding vacuum, cooling and controls infrastructure. The system is designed to produce up to 50 MW rf pulses of 1500 ns pulse width and 50 Hz repetition rate. After pulse compression, up to 100 MW of rf power at 250 ns pulse width {{will be available in}} the structure test bunker. This paper describes in more detail this setup and the process of commissioning which is necessary to arrive at the design performance...|$|R
40|$|Fish larvae {{and fish}} eggs were sampled from the inshore waters of eastern Lake Michigan from 1978 through 1980, using a benthic sled and a {{plankton}} net towed within 0. 5 m {{of the lake}} bottom. Differences between estimates of ichthyoplankton abundance based on the benthic <b>sled</b> and those <b>based</b> on the plankton net towed near bottom were examined along with interactions between gear, bottom depth, and time of day. Time of day {{was determined to be}} an important factor in comparing these two gear, but data were inconclusive as to the effect of depth on gear differences. Abundance of fish eggs calculated using sled tow data was significantly higher than that for the plankton net. For nighttime collections, density of alewife Alosa pseudoharengus larvae sampled in the plankton net significantly exceeded that for the sled, whereas density of spottail shiner Notropis hudsonius larvae <b>based</b> on <b>sled</b> data was significantly higher than that based on the plankton net for day sampling. Overall, the plankton net appeared to be adequate for sampling abundance of alewife larvae, while the sled was preferred for sampling fish eggs, spottail shiner larvae, and the following less common, but apparently demersal larvae: trout-perch Percopsis omiscomaycus, johnny darter Etheostoma nigrum, ninespine stickleback Pungitius pungitius, and slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus...|$|R
40|$|Wireless Inertial Measurement Units (WIMUs) are {{increasingly}} {{used to improve}} our understanding of complex human motion scenarios. In sports this allows for more valid coaching, selection and training methods leading to improved athletic performance. The Push-Start in the Winter Olympic sport of Bob-Skeleton is poorly understood but believed to be critical to performance. At the University of Bath a piece of gym-based equipment called the “Assassin” used by athletes to practice the Push-Start was instrumented with a custom WIMU system to investigate this motion regime. A test subject performed 36 runs, comprising 3 runs at each of 12 combinations of 3 Incline and 4 Weight settings. A developed algorithm automatically identified valid data-files, extracted the Pushing-Phase Acceleration data, and estimated sled Velocity and Displacement. The average velocities derived from an existing Light-Gate and WIMU data-files were comparable, with an average Root Mean Squared Error of 0. 105 meters per second over the 52 valid WIMU data-files identified, covering 11 of the 12 Weight and Incline settings. Additional investigation of WIMU data revealed information such as: step count; track incline; and whether weights had been added could be determined, although further verification and validation of these features are required. Such an automated WIMU-based system could replace performance monitoring methods such as Light-Gates, providing higher fidelity performance data, additional information on equipment setup with lower-cost and greater ease-of-use by coaches or athletes. Its portable and modular nature also allow use with other training scenarios or equipment, such as using additional on-body WIMUs, or use with outdoor and ice-track sleds, enabling performance monitoring from the gym to the ice-track for improved candidate selection, comparison and training in Bob-Skeleton and other ice-track <b>based</b> <b>sled</b> sports. ...|$|R
40|$|The project Active Child Models for Traffic Safety Research {{is funded}} by Folksams Forskningsstiftelse. The overall aim is to {{increase}} the safety of child car occupants and thereby reduce the number of traffic induced injuries in 3 to 12 year-old children. This will be done by creating a computer model of a child that includes active musculature. The model will be used to reproduce emergency manoeuvres with biofidelic response at low acceleration levels. Literature on child safety has been reviewed with a main focus on child numerical models. Very few child models exist and for most of them, their response is validated against Anthropometric Test Devices (ATDs) certification corridors and not paediatric data. Models of children and child sized ATDs are either finite element or multi body models. Finite element models are more likely to predict injuries and contacts, whereas multi body models can preferably be used to reproduce kinematics in long duration events like emergency manoeuvres. Because of this, it has thus been decided to first work with child multi body models in the MADYMO code (TASS, Rijswijk, the Netherlands). The models that will be studied are the 6 and 10 year-old child facet models and the Q 6 and Hybrid III 6 year-old ATDs available in MADYMO as well as the 6 year-old pedestrian model previously developed by Jikuang Yang at Chalmers University of Technology. Simulation activities have been planned and the models’ responses will be analysed and compared with kinematics data of child volunteers in emergency manoeuvres and <b>sled</b> tests. Then, <b>based</b> on their performance, one model will be chosen to implement active musculature. Extra experimental data for tuning and validation of the model may be required. As a consequence, new experiments on child volunteers are planned, including the acquisition of muscular activity. The model response will be compared to those results. Based on the active child multi body model capability to reproduce pre-crash events, it will be discussed and decided in January 2013 whether to continue with a multi body model or start the same process with a finite element model. In the long term, the active child model will be used to reproduce both pre-crash and in-crash events and help understanding the protective principles of forward facing children and how they interact with current and future vehicle safety systems and child restraints...|$|R
