50|$|The most {{well-known}} problem {{that can be}} avoided with proper heat-up is the dry-out spalling, which is often the result of excessive pressurization of entrapped steam after heating above the ebullition point of water.Similarly to the Portland concrete used in civil engineering, water {{is added to the}} refractory castables to provide workability and allow molding, pumping, <b>shotcreting</b> or other forms of placement.Water exists within castables in free or combined forms: while free water remains in the pores without reaction with the materials' other constituents, combined water is present usually in the hydrated compounds of cement. As a result, the energy needed for their removal is different and, while free water leaves for the atmosphere at higher rates from about 100 degrees Celsius, temperatures at the range of 150 to 300 degrees Celsius may be necessary to remove the combined water.Because of the technological trend to reduce alkali content from the majority of refractories, the amount of combined water present in the moment of heat-up was reduced in the last years. On the other hand, recent developments which led to increases in mechanical strength, thermal shock resistance, erosion resistance, etc., also led to a reduction in permeability. Such permeability reduction caused an increase in vapor entrapment, which can lead to explosive spalling.|$|E

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{conducted}} a research study to document and develop safe practices {{for the use}} of <b>shotcrete</b> as ground support in underground mines, particularly in underground metal mines operating in weak host rock. <b>Shotcrete</b> is the generic name for a mixture of cement, sand, fine aggregate, and water that is applied pneumatically and compacted dynamically under high velocity. The objective of this research is to reduce mine worker fatalities and injuries resulting from rockfall accidents. Although the information, techniques, and technology covered in this publication will impact both the mining and construction sectors, the primary audience is the mining industry with a focus on underground metal mines operating in weak ground conditions. The information and practices covered in this publication relating to the use of <b>shotcrete</b> can be put to use by mining professionals towards improving mine design and ground control plans. The guidance and practices reported in this document will help safety auditors, mining companies, and <b>shotcrete</b> suppliers in improving their <b>shotcrete</b> product specifications and the performance of ground support systems, evaluating ground control plans, and assessing <b>shotcrete</b> quality control. Ground control safety can be improved by providing these groups with {{a better understanding of the}} use of <b>shotcrete</b> in weak rock conditions, field test methods and equipment for measuring the strength properties of <b>shotcrete</b> directly at the mine site, and a practical means of conducting quality control during <b>shotcrete</b> applications. Development of Portable Test Machines: NIOSH researchers developed three portable test machines for determining <b>shotcrete</b> strength properties directly at the mine site. These portable test machines can be used to measure the early-age compressive strength of the <b>shotcrete,</b> the flexural load capacity and toughness of the <b>shotcrete,</b> and the installed quality and bond strength of the <b>shotcrete</b> that is applied to underground entries; this enables the test machines to be used to verify safe re-entry times. Onsite testing of as-placed <b>shotcrete</b> allows the mine personnel and <b>shotcrete</b> supplier to determine if the <b>shotcrete</b> is performing to design specifications. Using these <b>shotcrete</b> test machines directly at a mine site allows the support capabilities of the <b>shotcrete</b> to be evaluated in terms of the specific ground conditions, support methods, mining spans, and entry dimensions at the mine. As a result, mine design decisions regarding the use of <b>shotcrete</b> can be made from a much more informed position. Ultimately, this enhanced onsite knowledge of <b>shotcrete</b> strength properties and the quality of <b>shotcrete</b> application techniques can result in better ground support system designs and procedures, thereby reducing the number of fatalities and injuries associated with groundfall accidents. <b>Shotcrete</b> Characteristics and Application: When the <b>shotcrete</b> is applied in-cycle to underground mine surfaces as part of the ground support system, it becomes important to quantify when mining can safely resume under the material. As part of the overall ground support system, <b>shotcrete</b> is typically sprayed on the surface of an underground opening to stabilize the ground and prevent raveling. <b>Shotcrete</b> is also applied at lower water-to-cement ratios than concrete and develops its own unique strength characteristics. In addition, the quality of the applied <b>shotcrete,</b> the competency of the underlying rock, and the load-carrying capability of the <b>shotcrete</b> once cured are of critical importance. The significant <b>shotcrete</b> characteristics examined in this report are: slump, compressive strength, tensile strength, early strength, adhesion strength, and flexural strength. Of these <b>shotcrete</b> characteristics the engineering strength properties that are determined using early strength, adhesion strength, and flexural strength testing methods are the focus of this report. The significant <b>shotcrete</b> tests to determine characteristics examined in this research study are: 1. Slump Test - used to determine (wet) uncured <b>shotcrete</b> consistency. 2. Compression Test - used to measure cured <b>shotcrete</b> compression strength. 3. Tensile Test - used to measure cured <b>shotcrete</b> tensile strength. 4. Early Strength Partial-beam Test - used to measure <b>shotcrete</b> cure strength development over time. 5. Overcoring and Direct-tension Pull Test - used to measure cured <b>shotcrete</b> adhesion strength. 6.

40|$|<b>Shotcrete</b> is a cement-based mixture {{pneumatically}} projected at {{high velocity}} onto a receiving surface. The material component of <b>shotcrete</b> is essentially concrete or sometimes mortar, {{but the process}} of <b>shotcrete</b> application is unique. This process allows a good compaction of concrete to be obtained without vibration. Compared to cast-in-place concrete, other important advantages of the <b>shotcrete</b> process {{are related to the}} reduction of the amount and time for formwork installation, removal, and associated labor costs, the very flexible logistics, very good working safety and good environmental conditions. Nowadays, because of the significant advances that occurred mainly in the last few decades, <b>shotcrete</b> can be considered a proper repair material particularly suitable in different situations such as where formwork is not practical or can be reduced or eliminated, where access to the work area is difficult, where thin layers and/or variable thickness is required and where normal casting techniques cannot be employed.

40|$|When ground {{conditions}} are weak, particularly in free formed tunnel linings or retaining walls, sprayed concrete {{can be applied}} on the exposed surfaces immediately after excavation for <b>shotcreting</b> rock outcrops. In these situations, shotcrete is normally applied conjointly with rock bolts and mesh, thereby supporting the loose material that causes many of the small ground falls. On the other hand, contractors want to determine the thickness and volume of sprayed concrete for both technical and economic reasons: to guarantee their structural strength but also, to not deliver excess material {{that they will not}} be paid for. In this paper, we first introduce a terrestrial LiDAR-based method for the automatic detection of rock bolts, as typically used in anchored retaining walls. These ground support elements are segmented based on their geometry and they will serve as control points for the co-registration of two successive scans, before and after <b>shotcreting.</b> Then we compare both point clouds to estimate the sprayed concrete thickness and the expending volume on the wall. This novel methodology is demonstrated on repeated scan data from a retaining wall in the city of Vigo (Spain), resulting in a rock bolts detection rate of 91 %, that permits to obtain a detailed information of the thickness and calculate a total volume of 3597 litres of concrete.
