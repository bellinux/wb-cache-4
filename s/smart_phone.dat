25|$|Paperless geocaching means hunting a geocache {{without a}} {{physical}} printout of the cache description. Traditionally, {{this means that}} the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a PDA or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read GPX files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by Garmin, DeLorme and Magellan have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a PDA. Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with a web-enabled <b>smart</b> <b>phone.</b> The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a <b>smart</b> <b>phone</b> with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.|$|E

Consequently, one needs a <b>smart</b> <b>phone</b> or a scorecard: the Eastern portion of Woodford County was known variously as Edwards (1814–16), Crawford (1816–19), Clark (1819–21), and Fayette (1821-25) Counties, while the Western part of today's county was included in Madison (1814–17), Bond (1817–21), and Sangamon (1821–25) Counties.|$|E
40|$|Social Networking {{has become}} very popular on <b>smart</b> <b>phones.</b> Game playing is an {{important}} part of social networking. However, most games that run on <b>smart</b> <b>phones</b> are single-player games. Multiplayer games on <b>smart</b> <b>phones</b> are an area that is still in its infancy. Not many games of this type are available on Smartphone platforms. A lot of research and experimentation is needed before the area of mobile multiplayer games can become mature and wide-spread. In this paper we report on our experience developing a multiplayer game that can be played by two players who are not geographically co-located using their <b>smart</b> <b>phones.</b> The system handles connectivity between the two <b>smart</b> <b>phones.</b> Whenever a player makes a move, the opponent player sees it at a near real time speed.

25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{medication}} is dispensed in blister packaging. It is relatively simple to equip blister packages with printed conductive trace grids. These grids are then connected to an electronic module. The electronic monitor records the time a trace has been broken and can then transmit this information to an NFC <b>smart</b> <b>phone</b> or even be GSM enabled to transmit the information immediately if a suitable data network is available. A more reasonable solution at the moment would be to connect the package to a hub, handheld device, tablet or smart watch via low power Bluetooth. In this case the package data would be sent whenever the medication blister is in close proximity to the bluetooth receiver. It avoids the huge effort required to equip every single blister with a SIM module and expensive monthly data subscription.|$|E
25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for <b>smart</b> <b>phone</b> screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E

Tablets were evaluated more positively than <b>smart</b> <b>phones</b> by the students as a means to increase confidence. Both tablets and <b>smart</b> <b>phones</b> were evaluated positively, both as a means of improving students’ motivation to learn, and as a means to develop reading comprehension, spelling, and vocabulary.

He had previously worked on ports for two other Digital Pictures games, Double Switch (1993) and Quarterback Attack (1995).

Inspired by the idea, Hogle worked quickly {{and was able to}} recreate all of disc one to play on a <b>smart</b> <b>phone</b> within three days. He posted a short video of his work online, and some gaming websites published stories on the video and contacted Tom Zito to ask if he was involved. Hogle got into contact with Zito, and the two began working towards a full release. The original source code and 1987 master footage is lost. Riley, however, possessed a copy of the timed master footage and provided it to Hogle. Because the footage was already timed, it was easier for Hogle to develop, however he had to replay the original game multiple times to learn what actions triggered which scenes.|$|E
