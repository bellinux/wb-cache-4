50|$|The Federal Trade Commission {{announced}} April 2008 that it {{issued a}} complaint challenging {{a series of}} acquisitions by TALX Corporation that substantially lessened competition in the markets for outsourced unemployment compensation management (UCM) and verification of income and employment (VOIE) services. The Commission and TALX have reached an agreement settling the Commission's challenge. “TALX acted illegally,” <b>says</b> <b>Jeffrey</b> Schmidt, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, “by acquiring virtually all of its competition {{in a series of}} transactions. While each transaction individually may not have been problematic, the FTC looked at the cumulative effect of the acquisitions. This case sends a message that firms can’t get away with unlawful acquisitions just because they take place in relatively small increments.” The complaint alleges that TALX's acquisitions have enhanced its ability to increase prices unilaterally and to decrease the quality of services in the relevant markets. In addition, the complaint notes, TALX has alliance partners, including Automated Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Convergys, Inc., and Ceridian, Inc., which have agreements with TALX to outsource to TALX {{some or all of the}} UCM services they provide for their clients.|$|E
5000|$|After {{trying on}} many pairs of glasses, George finally decides upon {{a new style}} and buys them, but is distressed when Kramer later points out that they are women's-style glasses made by Gloria Vanderbilt. Dwayne also refuses George a {{discounted}} price. When Kramer finds out about the refused discount, he goes down to the optometrist store and [...] "threatens" [...] him with a candy bar, forcing Dwayne to reinstate the discount and his promise to Kramer in owing him. George then makes a deal with an unsuspecting blind man to trade the man's uncomfortable eyeglass frames with George's, and have the lenses switched. With his vision back, George finally realizes {{that it was not}} Amy kissing Jeffrey, but a mounted police woman affectionately petting her horse. Meanwhile Kramer, bursting into Jerry's apartment, accidentally jars Jerry's giant new air conditioner loose from the windowsill, and it falls to the sidewalk, serendipitously crushing the same dog that had earlier bitten Elaine at the optometrist's. Uncle Leo gives Jerry and Amy tickets to see Paul Simon live and tells them that Jeffrey apologized; Jerry mistakes Jeffrey's apology for the latter supposedly seeing Amy and blames her until Uncle Leo <b>says</b> <b>Jeffrey</b> apologized for getting different seats. The episode ends as we see George's [...] "stolen" [...] glasses right on top of the lockers in the Health Club.|$|E
40|$|Several Austrian {{economists have}} {{recently}} introduced an emphatic distinction between calculation problems and knowledge problems besetting socialism. F. A. Hayek, they suggest, has shoved aside or perverted the analysis that Ludwig von Mises got {{straight in the}} first place. Especially now that experience in Eastern Europe bears out the arguments of Mises and Hayek, {{it is important to}} face the issue of the supposed tension between their positions. "While Mises saw calculation as the problem of socialism, " <b>says</b> <b>Jeffrey</b> Herbener (1991, p. 43), "Hayek views it as a knowledge problem. " "Mises demonstrated that even with perfect information, the central planners in socialism cannot rationally calculate how to combine resources to render efficient production. " According to Joseph Salerno, "Mises unswervingly identified the unique and insoluble problem of socialism as the impossibility of calculation-not, {{as in the case of}} F. A. Hayek, as an absence of an efficient mechanism for conveying knowledge to the planners " (Postscript 1990, p. 59, in a section entitled "Mises vs. the Hayekians"). The "Hayekian position criticizing the relative inefficiency of nonmarket mechanisms for discovery, communication, and use of knowledge in the allocation of productive resources " is "categorically different" from the Misesian critique (Ibid., p. 64). "For Hayek, the major problem for the socialist planning board is its lack of knowledge, " says Murray Rothbard. Hayek's "argument for the free economy and against statism rests on an argument from ignorance. " For Mises, however, the central problem is no...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after The News of the World story broke, rival tabloid the Daily Star {{ran a story}} alleging Archer {{had paid}} for sex with Coghlan, {{something}} The News of the World had been careful to avoid stating directly. Archer responded by suing the Daily Star. The case came to court in July 1987. Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather {{than that of a}} guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded £500,000 damages. Archer stated he would donate the money to charity. However, this case would ultimately result in Archer's final exit from front-line politics some years later.

Within about half an hour, he continued, he realized the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the genetic code to identify individuals. The method has become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife population genetics studies. Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.|$|R

As Mr. Waller is about to whip Outlaw, Jeffrey, Clel’s son, asks him to stop because they are friends.

Delie prohibits John from teaching Sarny to read because she does not want anyone to be whipped. John agrees but says that Delie is teaching Sarny something worse: to be afraid. Sarny states that she will just learn how to read by herself.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about Cognitivism, and I had better {{say at the}} {{beginning}} what motivates it. If you read books about the brain (say Shepherd (1983) or Kuffler and Nicholls (1976)) you get a certain picture {{of what is going}} on in the brain. If you then turn to books about computation (<b>say</b> Boolos and <b>Jeffrey,</b> 1989) you get a picture of the logical structure of the theory of computation. If you then turn to books about cognitive science, (say Pylyshyn, 1985) they tell you that what the brain books describe is really the same as what the computability books were describing. Philosophically speaking, this does not smell right to me and I have learned, at least at the beginning of an investigation, to follow my sense of smell. II. The Primal Story I want to begin the discussion by trying to state as strongly as I can why cognitivism has seemed intuitively appealing. There is a story about the relation of human intelligence to computation that goes back at least to Turing's classic paper (1950), and I believe it is the foundation of the Cognitivist view. I will call it the Primal Story: We begin with two results in mathematical logic, the Church-Turing thesis (or equivalently, the Churchs's thesis) and Turing's theorem. For our purposes, the ChurchTuring thesis states that for any algorithm there is some Turing machine that can implement that algorithm. Turing's thesis says that there is a Universal Turing Machine which can simulate any Turing Machine. Now if we put these two together we have the result that a Universal Turing Machine can implement any algorithm whatever. But now, what made this result so exciting? What made it send shivers up and down the spines of a whole generation of young workers in artificial intelligence is the following thought: Suppose the brain is a Un [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Juris was {{involved}} with the Boston Occupy on Dewey Square, both as a protester and as an academic observer. Juris recalls seeing a large rowdy young crowd of protesters walking the streets and chanting things like 'We are the 99%' and even encouraging bystanders by calling them the 99%. He also recalls seeing police brutality against peaceful veterans {{who were part of}} the occupy movement. The same violent images that followed the disencampment of Occupy Wall Street. In his article, [...] "Reflections on #Occupy Everywhere", Juris asserts that websites and listservs were {{a big part of the}} inception of Occupy, but the movement took a turn towards a more decentralized, social media led organization. He believes this was for the best as their online presence allows for the movement to maintain some sort of media influence. Juris notes that social media outlets, such as Facebook and Twitter, were an important part of organizing movements at the initial stages, but have since slowed their presence on internet platforms. Jeffrey also noted that the modeling of the movement was based on the structure of social media. It was no longer about getting people to join the movement, but rather to bring as many groups of people together for their unique agenda. For example, one group could have a successful peaceful non-violent protest and then afterward, more violent protesters can come thru and express themselves. Juris asserts that new radical democracy does not depend on a consensus among everyone, but rather a respect for other people's point of view. He says the new social media platforms call for new types of political, social, and economic organizations. The old systems are no longer serving our society as best as they could and <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>says</b> it is time for major reform.|$|R

Lester and Ester promote Jeffrey's ability to untie knots to the {{other children in the}} neighborhood who come by to see him over by Amanda's tent. Jeffrey has another encounter with Mars Bar during a football game and accidentally knocks him down. Mars runs up to him asking if he wants a bite of his chocolate. <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>says</b> yes and Mars bites it, asking him again if he wants a bite. To Mars' surprise, Jeffrey still bites it. Back on Hector Street, a man collapses in front of Cobble's Corner. As Jeffrey tries to him up, the man scolds him to go back over to his own side. Mr. Cobble comes up to him and tells him to do the same. When he and Amanda return home, they find Martha scrubbing of profanity that was written on the house that says [...] "FISH BELLY GO HOME". Jeffrey is horrified by this and doesn't understand why skin color should matter to anyone. He doesn't even want to be white since he finds it to be such a boring color. Amanda feels Jeffrey is considering leaving and doesn't want him to and suggest he goes with her to Mr. Cobble's store to untie his huge knot that no one has been able to do even the greatest of people. The next day, Mr. Cobble lets Jeffrey perform the task of untying the knot ball. Jeffrey amazes him and all the people around him when he successfully unties the ball. Mr. Cobble and many of the black bystanders cheer him on. The story is printed in the Two Mills Gazette. This angers Mars Bar who has his friends help him trash Amanda's tent and destroy her favorite book in the process. Jeffrey is heart broken by this and feels his presence there on the East End is making things worse. He leaves a note for the family and decides to run away and crosses over to the West End.|$|R
6000|$|The niece, {{according}} to Mrs. Prest, {{was not so}} old, and she risked the conjecture that {{she was only a}} grandniece. This was possible; I had nothing but my share in the very limited knowledge of my English fellow worshipper John Cumnor, who had never seen the couple. The world, as I <b>say,</b> had recognized <b>Jeffrey</b> Aspern, but Cumnor and I had recognized him most. The multitude, today, flocked to his temple, but of that temple he and I regarded ourselves as the ministers. We held, justly, as I think, that we had done more for his memory than anyone else, and we had done it by opening lights into his life. He had nothing to fear from us because he had nothing to fear from the truth, which alone at such a distance of time we could be interested in establishing. His early death had been the only dark spot in his life, unless the papers in Miss Bordereau's hands should perversely bring out others. There had been an impression about 1825 that he had [...] "treated her badly," [...] just as there had been an impression that he had [...] "served," [...] as the London populace says, several other ladies in the same way. Each of these cases Cumnor and I had been able to investigate, and we had never failed to acquit him conscientiously of shabby behavior. I judged him perhaps more indulgently than my friend; certainly, at any rate, it appeared to me that no man could have walked straighter in the given circumstances. These were almost always awkward. Half the women of his time, to speak liberally, had flung themselves at his head, and out of this pernicious fashion many complications, some of them grave, had not failed to arise. He was not a woman's poet, as I had said to Mrs. Prest, in the modern phase of his reputation; but the situation had been different when the man's own voice was mingled with his song. That voice, by every testimony, was one of the sweetest ever heard. [...] "Orpheus and the Maenads!" [...] was the exclamation that rose to my lips when I first turned over his correspondence. Almost all the Maenads were unreasonable, and many of them insupportable; it struck me in short that he was kinder, more considerate than, in his place (if I could imagine myself in such a place!) I should have been.|$|R
