Once generated, these gases transport chlorine and bromine into the stratosphere, where they {{play an important role}} in ozone depleting catalytic cycles. The Florida Everglades is one location where methyl halide emissions have been proposed to be elevated due to high primary production and ionic halogens. This region also provides a unique study environment due to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>intrusions,</b> which occur during storm or low marsh water level-high tide events. The purpose of this research was twofold. First, quantification of methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl) and methyl bromide (CH 3 Br) production from periphyton mats on a temporal scale was needed. Secondly, to determine how varying concentrations of salinity affect CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br production originating from calcareous periphyton mats within the Everglades. Periphyton was exposed to continuous 12 hour dark/light cycles in varying concentrations of <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> (0, 0. 1, 1, 5, and 10 parts per thousand). All water samples were analyzed to determine the production rate of CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br in periphyton samples using a gas chromatograph coupled with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). Periphyton mats were found to be a producer of CH 3 Cl in all freshwater (0 parts per thousand) trials and sampling times; however, results from CH 3 Br analysis found production rates that suggest consumption occurred in the majority of the 0 parts per thousand trials. Production rates for CH 3 Cl ranged from 0. 077 to 0. 109 g- 1 hr- 1 after 24 hours, 0. 027 to 0. 073 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 48 hours, and 0. 034 to 0. 047 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 72 hours. Production rates for the CH 3 Br freshwater experiments ranged from - 0. 00025 to 0. 00185 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 24 hours, - 0. 00022 to - 0. 00078 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 48 hours, and - 0. 00042 to - 0. 00061 pM g- 1 hr- 1 after 72 hours. This research has also shown that increased salinity does have a significant positive effect on the production of CH 3 Cl and CH 3 Br from calcareous periphyton mats, which is important in areas that could be prone to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>intrusions</b> or rising sea levels due to global climate change...|$|R
25|$|Current {{predictions}} {{based on}} the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 2007 say that Climate Change might impact the countries closer to the equator more seriously than the countries located more in the North or South. Tropical Vietnam {{is assumed to be}} one of the most vulnerable countries in connection with Climate Change. The medium emission level scenario for 2080-2099 predicts a higher annual rainfall which occurs in the already wet months of the year. At the same time, the dry months might become even hotter due to temperature rise and the stress on the crops might increase due to higher evaporation rates and less available water. Like the current climate differs both in time and in space, also the changing climate is predicted to affect rather the North than the South and it might influence rather the winter than the summer months. Beneath rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise is predicted to affect Vietnam as a country with a coastal line of more than 3,000km especially.

40|$|Soil {{properties}} such as stress-strain {{response and}} hydraulic conductivity {{are affected by}} the transport of chemicals in soils. For stress-deformation and stability analysis of geotechnical structures, it is necessary to consider the effect of chemicals on the stress-strain-strength behavior. In this study, the residual flow procedure is modified to incorporate the chemical effects on the hydraulic conductivity to solve interface between fresh <b>water</b> and <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> in <b>intrusion</b> problems. The results are compared with previous analysis that did not consider chemical effect under the interface. The residual flow procedure of free surface problem is also modified to involve the capillary zone that experiences influences in soil strength parameters. In this study, the chemical considered is sodium chloride. Laboratory model tests are performed to study the changes in conductivity and free surface seepage characteristics of sand-bentonite mixtures with different concentrations of sodium chloride. A series of laboratory triaxial tests are performed on the cylindrical specimens of sand-bentonite mixture with different (5, 10, 15 %) sodium chloride contents. Deformation (elastic modulus, E) and strength (cohesion, c, and angle of friction, φ) parameters are obtained from the triaxial tests as functions of confining pressure and sodium chloride concentrations. The stress-strain-strength behavior based on the above parameters is introduced in a finite element procedure with the residual flow procedure (RFP) as explained above. The latter allows consideration of free surface seepage with locations of <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> fronts in dams/slopes subjected to transient (rise - steady state - draw down) fluctuations in the upstream heads. By integrating a slope stability (limit equilibrium) procedure in the finite element method, factors of safety with time are computed. The analyses are performed with fresh <b>water</b> and <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> and the two results are compared to identify the effect of <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> on stability and deformation in a typical dam configuration. Overall, the study presents an integrated procedure in which constitutive response as affected by <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> is introduced in a finite element procedure.

Farbotko, 2010). Already susceptible to environmental impacts, and with fragile economic systems, the world's numerous small island states and territories are likely to experience large-scale shifts in their economies and labour markets {{as a result of the}} impact of global environmental change. Given their geographical parameters, agriculture (including viticulture), fisheries, tourism and transportation cut across most small island states and territories as four critical economic and labour market sectors, deserving special research and policy attention. So much is at stake. How, then, does a policy maker, an industry investor, an employer or a trade union offi cial in a small jurisdiction like Malta make sense of the considerable data and science about environmental change (including climate change) in order to make smart decisions about future trends and needs?

A team of experts assembled by The Nature Conservancy assessed the situation in 2004. They identified seven target habitat types that were in particular need of conservation management: bottomland hardwood forest, cypress swamp, relict ridge woodland, fresh/intermediate marsh, brackish/salt marsh, lake open water, and littoral submersed aquatic vegetation. [...] The bottomland hardwood forest and cypress swamp are suffering from lack of fresh water input and sediment deposition owing to the levees upstream from the lake. In addition, bottomland hardwoods are being invaded by exotic species such as Chinese tallow while freshwater marshes are being invaded by exotic species such as elephant's-ear.

Salt-sensitive species: C.  appressa, C.  bichenoviana and J.  usitatus did not survive ≥ 10. 4  mS cm(- 1), removing their ability to take up nitrogen (N). Salt-tolerant species, such as F.  nodosa and J.  kraussii, maintained N-removal even at the highest salt concentration. However, their levels of water stress and stomatal conductance suggest that N-removal would not be sustained at concentrations ≥ 10. 4  mS cm(- 1). Increasing salt concentration indirectly increased phosphorus (P) removal, by converting dissolved forms of P to particulate forms which were retained by filter media.

40|$|Paokahu {{landfill}} operated near Gisborne from 1977 to 2002. About {{1 million}} cubic metres of mixed domestic and industrial (predominantly food processing) wastes were disposed {{of at the}} site. The Paokahu landfill {{is located on the}} Poverty Bay Flats on low lying flat ground, which was originally the base of a tidal lagoon. A 300 m wide band of costal dunes separates the landfill from the Poverty Bay coast. The landfill covers an area of approximately 20 Ha and is unlined but fully capped. Leachate is collected in a cut-off drain which surrounds three quarters of the landfill. Disposal of the leachate is by spray irrigation onto the landfill cap with 13, 000 - 15, 000 m 3 of leachate irrigated annually. The site is currently used for grazing sheep. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} improve our understanding of the effect that Paokahu landfill is having on the environment and to determine if the current management practices are sustainable. Specific objectives were to collate and review all the groundwater and leachate monitoring data held by Gisborne District Council to determine if the landfill was affecting the local groundwater and to investigate the effect of leachate irrigation on the landfill cap's soil and vegetation. The groundwater monitoring data showed the local groundwater was generally affected by <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>intrusions</b> giving the groundwater high anion and cation concentrations. There was no evidence of a leachate plume originating from the landfill and no conclusive evidence of leachate contamination in any of the groundwater monitoring bores. The leachate had a high electrical conductivity (mean = 9350 Scm- 1) and high soluble salts content (mean values, Na = 845 gm- 3, K= 496 gm- 3, Ca = 240 gm- 3, Mg = 127 gm- 3, Cl = 1346 gm- 3). Heavy metals were present in low concentrations and Semi Volatile Organic Compounds were no longer present in the leachate. Cation and anion concentrations were generally higher in the groundwater than in the leachate. The main risk to groundwater quality from leachate contamination was from ammonical nitrogen and nitrate. The leachate irrigation had caused an increase in soil cation concentrations particularly Na in the landfill cap. However, the soil Exchangeable Sodium Percentage of 1. 5 - 2. 9, leachate Sodium Adsorption Ratio (6. 5) and Electrical Conductivity of (4317 S cm- 1) and silty soil material of the landfill cap indicated that soil swelling and dispersion was unlikely to occur in irrigated areas of the landfill cap. Dispersion index testing supported this conclusion with no significant increase in aggregate dispersion under the irrigated areas of the landfill compared to the non-irrigated areas. Soil metal concentrations were low and there was no significant difference in soil heavy metal concentrations between the irrigated and non-irrigated areas of the landfill cap. Leachate Mn concentrations (mean = 1. 39 g m- 3) were high enough to be potentially toxic to plants, but the soil pH (7. 4) and Ca (46. 7 me/ 100 g) content mean that Mn toxicity is unlikely to occur.
