40|$|Objectives. To {{develop a}} {{software}} application for the pharmaceutical biotechnology drug {{research and development}} process. The Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Virtual Laboratory was offered as a hybrid course in spring 2003. We evaluated (1) the software’s pedagogical effectiveness, and (2) how students utilized the software in the teaching/learning process. Methods. Software development involved software-authoring tool selection, mock-up layouts of content screens, educational content creation, and storyboard development with artwork, animation, and programming. All modules were developed and refined based on student usability testing. Course implementation permitted student choice of face-to-face, hybrid, or online course formats. Student learning was assessed through quizzes, pretests, and posttests; assessment of <b>student</b> <b>mode</b> of learning (eg, how the students used the software and course participation format); and transference of learning from the course to other situations. Results. Results of student posttests and quiz scores were not influenced by students ’ choice of course participation format. Hardcopy materials were rated more important than software or electronic materials. Conclusion. Based on anonymous surveys, students felt that the software was a valuable learning tool. However, students preferred to use their “tried and true ” method – studying hardcopy notes...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{relationship}} between students’ academic performance and <b>student</b> expression <b>mode</b> in student-teacher interactions. Research found that academically high performers receive higher levels of micro differentiation (i. e., higher quality of support). The present study aimed to investigate an explanation for this finding and hypothesized that high-performing students utilize more demonstrations of understanding than claims of understanding compared to low-performing students. Thereby, they would elicit higher levels of micro differentiation by enabling teacher assessments students’ needs and facilitating dialogic exchange. The method of investigation included 1) development of a coding scheme for student expression of understanding and 2) analysis of student and teacher responses in teacher-student interactions {{in relation to the}} students’ academic performance using the developed coding scheme.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{research}} project aimed at identifying the preferred approaches to learning of mature students in an online graduate programme.

A questionnaire, operationalizing four learning modes, was used to solicit responses from graduate <b>students.</b> The <b>modes</b> were independent learning, instrumental learning, interactive learning, and collaborative learning.

Gender {{constitution in}} schools [...] Chapter Three. Pre-service teacher training [...] Conclusion. Providing children with ethical experiences {{has been an}} educational struggle fraught with theoretical and practical incompatibilities. Post Foucauldian theorists, such as Deborah Youdell and Laura Teague, have attempted to disrupt processes of inequality in schools by exploring how teachers might utilise performatives to constitute their students in ways that let them live. These ethical experiences disrupt unethical pedagogies that may injuriously constitute students – limiting the freedom of their existence. This study focuses on gendered constitutions specifically by engaging in discourses with pre-service teachers that explore their perceptions, beliefs and attitudes of gender. This study found that pre-service teachers were apprehensive when grappling with gendered discourses which diminished their agency. The roles of teachers, schools and institutions were considered whereby this study found that each struggled to implement ethical pedagogies that let students live. Finally, suggestions were made {{in an attempt to}} bridge the gap between theory and practice; promoting pre-service institutional training in performative politics to allow for ethical relations between teachers and <b>students.</b> <b>Mode</b> of access: World wide web 1 online resource (v, 65 pages...|$|R
40|$|There is a large, and {{possibly}} increasing, cohort of students arriving from China {{to study in}} Australian universities. While some of these students may actually study in a law degree, those who do commercial studies, either at an undergraduate or graduate level, quite often have to complete some form of law type studies {{as part of their}} course. The means by which law is actually taught and assessed appears to be a challenge for many of these students who may never have encountered a problem based style of teaching. This paper outlines {{some of the problems that}} Chinese students appear to have when encountering law studies for the first time. Similarly this paper attempts to consider the debate as to whether Chinese students might be characterised simplistically as surface rote learners, rather than reflective and independent scholars. The paper outlines some of the traditions of Confucian education and ponders on whether this impacts on particular <b>student's</b> <b>mode</b> of learning. The paper proposes some suggestions for consideration, particularly in utilising some aspects of Confucian learning, the main point being that there should be greater sensitivity and awareness for our Chinese students, and hopefully a greater discussion on how their needs might be addressed...|$|R

Results also suggest how complex college teaching has become in terms of the range of preparation, abilities, and motivation students bring to the classroom; the difficulties inherent in creating an active, engaging learning environment in large lecture courses, and the competition faculty face from other professional demands upon them.

40|$|TITLE: Making {{sense of}} complex data: A {{conceptual}} framework for studying students development of reflective inquiry dispositions To make sense of complex data in inquiry, students must develop reflective modes of classroom work. This study examines {{the process of developing}} such reflective dispositions for individual students, {{in the context of a}} middle-school earth science inquiry unit designed by the researchers and collaborating teachers. Valid characterization of this learning process requires a conceptual framework through which to attend to the multiple variables that contribute to dispositional learning. The proposed conceptual framework identifies a reflective disposition as a property not just of the individual, but of the individual within an activity system. Relevant variables for study include elements of the classroom activity system, elements of the intended domain of reflective data analysis, and elements of the individual <b>students</b> <b>modes</b> of understanding. These are proposed as three contexts of reflection, referred to as the task context, the data context, and the role context. This three-context framework for understanding reflection in inquiry is used as a tool for data analysis, characterizing the dispositional learning of each focus student in the study. Reflection was found to be an often-shared social process, shaping and being shaped by the negotiation of the meaning of activity. Learning was mediated by interactions between group interactional modes (in the task context) and individuals roles (in the role context). Two focus groups studied were found to have markedly different modes of interaction: one characterized as a comfort zone for work with complex data, the other a confrontation zone. These modes afforded the development of different role [...] ...|$|R
