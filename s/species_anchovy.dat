40|$|European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus {{increased}} its abundance and {{distribution in the}} North Sea during the mid- 1990 s and may consume similar zooplankton to and/or compete with other occupants of the North Sea like herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus.

Anchovy was found to be more generalist, consuming a higher diversity of prey items. Herring was more specialized, with low diversity of food items. Sprat was intermediate between anchovy and herring. The dietary overlap between anchovy and sprat was highest, followed by herring and sprat before anchovy and herring. The mean weight of stomach contents did not differ between species.

30|$|In the edible {{muscles of}} the pelagic <b>species,</b> <b>anchovy</b> {{was found to have}} {{significant}} higher content of Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu and Pb. Actually; {{it is well known that}} metal concentrations in fish tissues are related to metal contents in environment. Thus, this finding in anchovy could be linked to feeding on zooplankton since it is able to accumulate a high metal content. Topping (1973) have also reported that fish species feeding on plankton contain higher concentration of trace metals than bottom feeding fish. Gundogdu et al. (2016) reported the same results with high metals content in muscle of E. encrasicolus from Black sea than content found in muscle of T. trachurus and M. barbatus. The reason for high metal concentrations in small fish could also be due to the metal complex with the mucus in skin that is impossible to be purified completely from fish tissue before the analysis. Thus, for small fish the skin may be an important site for the uptake of metals due to their high surface area to body ratio.|$|E
40|$|A multi-species {{approach}} to fisheries management requires {{taking into account}} the interactions between species in order to improve recruitment forecasting of the fish species. Recent advances in Bayesian networks direct the learning of models with several interrelated variables to be forecasted simultaneously. These models are known as multi-dimensional Bayesian network classifiers (MDBNs). Pre-processing steps are critical for the posterior learning of the model in these kinds of domains. Therefore, in the present study, a set of 'state-of-the-art' uni-dimensional pre-processing methods, within the categories of missing data imputation, feature discretization and feature subset selection, are adapted to be used with MDBNs. A framework that includes the proposed multi-dimensional supervised pre-processing methods, coupled with a MDBN classifier, is tested with synthetic datasets and the real domain of fish recruitment forecasting. The correctly forecasting of three fish <b>species</b> (<b>anchovy,</b> sardine and hake) simultaneously is doubled (from 17. 3 % to 29. 5 %) using the multi-dimensional approach in comparison to mono-species models. The probability assessments also show high improvement reducing the average error (estimated by means of Brier score) from 0. 35 to 0. 27. Finally, these differences are superior to the forecasting of species by pairs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Objective echoes {{identification}} {{is not possible}} nowadays when several species are present in an area. Mid-water trawl catches are usually used to split fish schools into species during acoustic surveys. Moreover it is weIl known that because of a lively behaviour {{of these types of}} species, the catchability may vary a lot from one species to another. Therefore, in order to verify the reliability of identification by trawling, 68 hauls carried out during 4 acoustic surveys (1991 - 1994) have been analysed. Five pelagic <b>species</b> (<b>anchovy,</b> mackerel, horse-mackerel, sprat and sardine), observed during these surveys in Bay of Biscay were considered. On the one hand, taking into account the vertical echo-sounder data and the vertical course of the trawl from nets onde data, a theoretical weight was calculated, and compared with the real catch. The results showed that catchability varied a lot between species and within species according to school structure. On the other hand, a vertical avoidance of fish was simulated by changing the vertical trawl position to approach the real catch and study specific behaviours which could bias the identification. As a result, it seems that trawl species compositions could be used with a better precision by applying a correcting factor according to specific catchabilities if completed by an aggregation classification...|$|E
40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} are {{the link between}} planktonic {{production}} and higher trophic levels. Competition for resources {{may play a role}} in the population dynamics of species, some of them probably standing out from the others due to greater feeding success. It is therefore important to understand the trophic niche of species overlapping both spatially and temporally. In this study, we have investigated the diet, prey preference, trophic niche breadth and diet overlap of the 8 major small pelagic <b>species</b> (<b>anchovy,</b> sardine, sprat, Atlantic and Mediterranean horse mackerel, bogue, Atlantic mackerel and Atlantic chub mackerel) inhabiting the Bay of Biscay. Results indicate that all fish feed mainly on calanoid copepods, incorporating larger prey like euphausiids and decapods to complete their diet. Differences in ingested prey diversity seem to be more limited by the available zooplankton at sea than by a specific diet preference by fish species, resulting in an overall high diet overlap, especially within clupeids but also between clupeids and other (larger) predator species. Consumption estimations for different prey groups could therefore determine whether such a large diet overlap between small pelagic fish, together with spatial co-occurrence, results in competition or enhances the effects of intraguild predation, which is important in terms of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|E

40|$|Natural drivers, acting {{at various}} spatio-temporal scales firstly {{determine}} {{the distribution and}} abundance of species. On top of this natural forcing we usually find anthropogenic effects. Disentangling the relative influence of these two sources of variability {{has always been a}} challenge in ecology, and particularly in fisheries science. The Guadalquivir Estuary (SW Spain) serves as nursery ground for several commercial species in the Gulf of Cadiz. This study aims at quantifying the relative influence of biological (predator-prey effects), environmental (e. g. temperature, winds) and anthropogenic (dam discharges) effects on this nursery function with the focus on an important <b>species,</b> <b>anchovy.</b> We used data from a monitoring programme consisting of monthly records since 1997 at two sites: Tarfia (32 km) and Bonanza (8 km) (distance from the river mouth). Nonparametric models (GAM) were fit to the data to estimate the partial effects of the various covariates. We found positive and linear effects of temperature and mysids on anchovy abundance in both stations, while turbidity, winds and freshwater input had a negative effect, reducing fish abundance. A dam, 110 km upstream from the Guadalquivir mouth regulates freshwater discharges, directly influencing the estuarine habitat quality and extent, as captured by our models. In order to separate the anthropogenic effects from natural variability we further ran the models on a number of scenarios combining a range of dam discharges and environmental conditions. Water management stands out as a key node where potentially conflicting interests (irrigators, electric power, shipping, aquaculture, fisheries) converge.

40|$|Influenced {{by one of}} {{the largest}} Mediterranean rivers, Po, the {{northern}} Adriatic (NA) production is highly variable seasonally and interannually. The changes are especially pronounced between winters and seemingly reflect on total Adriatic bioproduction of certain <b>species</b> (<b>anchovy).</b> We analysed the long-term changes in the phytoplankton production in the region, as derived from monthly oceanographic cruises, in relation to concomitant geostrophic currents distribution in the area and to Po River discharge rates in days preceding the cruises. In winter and early spring the phytoplankton abundances depended on existing circulation fields, in summer and autumn they were related to Po River discharge rates 1 – 15 days earlier and on concomitant circulation fields, while in late spring phytoplankton abundances increased 1 – 3 days after high Po River discharge rates regardless of the circulation fields. During the entire year the phytoplankton abundances were dependent on forcing of the previous 1 – 12 months of surface fluxes and/or Po River rates. The role of wind was uncertain but that was partly due to unmatched sampling time frames between meteorological and sea data. Low evaporation rates in November reflected significantly on the next February circulation pattern and, although with somewhat lower significance, on large phytoplankton blooms in the same month. We showed that the role of wind in evaporative flux enhancements is not straightforward as evaporative fluxes are highly dependent on other factors, e. g. air–sea temperature difference. Wind-induced vertical mixing was only sporadically related to phytoplankton abundances. From 1990 to 2004 a shift towards large winter bioproduction induced by circulation changes appeared. The investigations performed represent the preliminary actions in the construction of an empirical ecological model of the NA which can be used in the sustainable economy of the region, as well as for validation of the numerical ecological model of the region, which is currently being developed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The anchovy/sardine {{complex is}} an impor-tant fishery {{resource}} {{in some of}} the largest upwelling systems in the world. Synchronous, but out of phase, fluctuations of the two species in distant parts of the oceans have prompted a number of studies dedicated to determining the phenomena, atmospheric and oceanic, responsible for the observed synchronicity and the biological mechanisms behind the population changes of the two <b>species.</b> <b>Anchovy</b> and sardine are of high commercial value for the fishing sector in Greece; this study investigates the impact of large-scale climatic indices on the anchovy/sardine complex in the Greek seas using fishery catches as a proxy for fish produc-tivity. Time series of catches for both species were analysed for relationships with teleconnection indices and local environmental variability. The connection between the teleconnection indices and local weather/ oceanic variation was also examined in an effort to describe physical mechanisms that link large-scale atmospheric patterns with anchovy and sardine. The West African Summer Monsoon, East Atlantic Jet and Pacific–North American (PNA) pattern exhibit coher-ent relationships with the catches of the two species. The first two aforementioned patterns are prominent atmospheric modes of variability during the summer months when sardine is spawning and anchovy juve-niles are growing. PNA is related with El Niño Southern Oscillation events. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) appears as a significant link between atmo-spheric and biological variability either because higher temperatures seem to be favouring sardine growth or because lower temperatures, characteristic of produc-tivity-enhancing oceanic features, exert a positive influence on both species. However at a local scale, other parameters such as wind and mesoscale circula-tion describe air–sea variability affecting the anchovy/ sardine complex. These relationships are non-linear and in agreement with results of previous studie...|$|E

Approximately 0. 5 million mt of marine trash fish was used for livestock, aquaculture and fish meal. Local marine fish meal consisting of protein content from 50 to 68 % and catfish byproduct meal containing protein level from 50 to 60 % were available. Based on FCR values of 5 major species including catfish, black tiger shrimp, white leg shrimp, Asian seabass, and snake head, aquafeed production was estimated at around 2. 5 million mt. Marine fish oil/squid liver oil requirement was from 15. 5 to 31 thousand mt. Fish meal demand was from 252 and 430 thousand mt. Almost all fish meal and marine fish oil used in aquafeed were imported. Moreover, soybean and other plant ingredients are potential alternative sources to replace fish meal and fish oil.

40|$|The {{impact of}} climate on {{fisheries}} resources {{has become a}} focal point for fisheries research. The objective of this thesis is to describe different aspects of the impact of teleconnections on marine ecosystems within the Mediterranean. Chapter I describes interactions between teleconnection patterns and oceanic variability in the Mediterranean. Atmospheric variability over the Atlantic and Eurasian sector forces oceanic circulation in the western Mediterranean, by altering the route of Atlantic storm tracks. The Indian monsoons are found to be related to gyre and upwelling formations in the eastern Mediterranean. Important links between the Mediterranean Oscillation and hemispheric circulation are also discussed. Chapter II studies the impact of atmospheric and oceanic forcing on the spatiotemporal distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration in the Mediterranean. A number of teleconnection indices with an important role in determining chlorophyll-a concentration are identified, especially for coastal areas, upwellings and gyres. Chapter III has an exploratory nature, with common trends in the landings of 41 fish species from the eastern Mediterranean identified and compared to fishing effort or large-scale environmental drivers. Teleconnections over the Atlantic or El Nino-related teleconnections, filtered by local SST and wind variability, are highlighted as driving forces behind some of the observed common landing trends. Chapter IV focuses on the biological complex of two commercial <b>species,</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus). The results suggest that the West African Summer Monsoon, the East Atlantic Jet and the Pacific North American teleconnection patterns have a consistent correlation with anchovy and sardine distribution and abundance. Relationships between oceanic circulation in the Mediterranean and atmospheric variability over the neighbouring oceanic and continental masses were described and linked to biological variability. Oceanic structures that interrupt the oligotrophic regime of the area are affected by teleconnection patterns and in turn they influence fisheries productivity. Interactions between teleconnection patterns and fisheries can explain {{a large proportion of the}} observed fluctuations in marine resources and synchronicity between species and locations. The processes modulating the effects of climatic forcing vary at fine spatiotemporal scales, the different characteristics and habitat requirements of the species and interactions between the species. Further research is essential in order to delineate these effects and improve the management of marine resources in the persistently over-exploited environment of the Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|Ecosystem models {{provide a}} {{platform}} allowing exploration into the possible responses of marine food webs to fishing pressure and various potential management decisions. In {{this study we}} investigate the particular effects of overfishing on the structure and function of the southern Benguela food web, using two models with different underlying assumptions: the spatialized, size-based individual-based model, OSMOSE, and the trophic mass-balance model, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE). Starting from the same reference state of the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem during the 1990 s, we compare {{the response of the}} food web to scenarios of overfishing using these two modelling approaches. A scenario of increased fishing mortality is applied to two distinct functional groups: i) two species of Cape hake, representing important target predatory fish, and ii) the forage <b>species</b> <b>anchovy,</b> sardine and redeye. In these simulations, fishing mortality on the selected functional groups is doubled for 10 years, followed by 10 years at the initial fishing mortality. We compare the food web states before the increase of fishing mortality, after 10 years of overfishing and after a further 10 years during which fishing was returned to initial levels. In order to compare the simulated food web structures with the reference state, and between the two modelling approaches, we use a set of trophic indicators: the mean trophic level of the community and in catches, the trophic pyramid (biomass per discrete trophic level), and the predatory/forage fish biomass ratio. OSMOSE and EwE present globally similar results for the trophic functioning of the ecosystem under fishing pressure: the biomass of targeted species decreases whereas that of their potential competitors increases. The reaction of distant species is more diverse, depending on the feeding links between the compartments. The mean trophic level of the community does not vary enough to be used for assessing ecosystem impacts of fishing, and the mean trophic level in the catch displays a surprising increase due to the short period of overfishing. The trophic pyramids behave in an unexpected way compared to trophic control theory. because at least two food chains with different dynamics are intertwined within the food web. We emphasize the importance of biomass information at the species level for interpreting dynamics in aggregated indicators, and we highlight the importance of competitive groups when looking at ecosystem functioning under fishing disturbance. Finally, we discuss the results within the scope of differences between models, in terms of the way they are formulated, spatial dimensions, predation formulations and the representation of fish life cycles...|$|E

Three fish <b>species,</b> <b>anchovy</b> Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardinops sagax {{and round}} herring Etrumeus whiteheadi, co-exist over the western Agulhas Bank (W AB) in the {{southern}} Benguela upwelling ecosystem. To date, data on high-resolution distributions in ichthyoplankton {{in the region is}} lacking. To address this need, coarse and high-resolution ichthyoplankton data were collected using a California vertical egg tow (CalVET) net and a continuous, underway fish egg sampler (CUFES) for horizontal data, respectively, and plankton pump and a closing WP II net for vertical data. Simultaneous measurements of temperature were recorded during the CalVET net hauls. Eggs from vertically stratified samples were grouped into three categories based on their developmental stage using established protocols. Volumetric estimates of egg density (eggs. m- 3) from on-station CUFES samples were significantly correlated with normalized areal (eggs. m- 2) estimates of egg density from CalVET net samples at these stations for sardine (r 0. 91), round herring (r= 0. 80) and anchovy (r = 0. 73), demonstrating the validity of the CUFES sampling technique. Underway sample collection reduced the survey coefficient of variation for sardine and round herring eggs but not for anchovy eggs. Horizontal egg distribution patterns for anchovy showed that high egg densities were centered at two specific regions: midshelf (east of Cape Point) and offshore {{in the southern}} region of the study area, whereas those of sardines and round herring were more continuously distributed above and beyond the 200 m isobath. Egg abundances for all species generally increased from inshore towards offshore. The mean egg densities for all three species were found to be spatially associated, whereas the station by station distribution patterns of anchovy eggs were spatially distinct from sardine and round herring. Eggs of all three species were concentrated near the surface (0 - 20 m), although proportions varied among species. All developmental stages of anchovy egg were confined close to the surface indicating that this species spawns near the surface. Sardine and round herring vertical egg profiles varied ontogenetically, even though all developmental stages were concentrated near the surface. A significant (> 50 %) proportion of early egg stages were widely distributed between 0 - 60 and 0 - 80 m for sardine and round herring, respectively. These results therefore show that the spawning depths of these three c 1 upeiforms overlap to a large extent, but the intensity of spawning varied at depth for each species. In general the vertical thermal structure seemed to affect only how deeply the eggs are distributed rather than the mean egg abundance. The differences in vertical egg profiles among and within (with respect to ontogenetic variation) species were found to be statistically significant (Chi-squared test, P < 0. 05). Investigations of spawning patterns in relation to temperature, longitude and latitude were used to compare the spawning habitats of the three species. Quotient rule analysis was used to distinguish the preferred temperature ranges of all three species. Round herring spawn over a wider temperature range (16. 5 - 18. 1 °C) than anchovy (17. 4 - 17. 8 ° C and sardine (17 - 18. 1 °C). Two spawning peaks were apparent for round herring (main peak at 17. 2 °C and secondary peak at 17. 8 °C), whereas only one peak at 18. 0 °C was apparent for anchovy and sardine. Anchovy spawning showed a domed-shape relationship with geographic location and the relationship was viewed to be more informative (r 2 = 0. 13 longitude, ~ = 0. 11 latitude) compared to sardine (r 2 = 0. 08 longitude, r 2 = 0. 07 latitude) and round herring (r 2 = 0. 04 longitude, r 2 = 0. 06 latitude). These results indicate that anchovy were more specific in their selection of spawning habitat than sardine and round herring. Generally, these results suggest that the overall spawning habitats of anchovy, sardine and round herring on the W AB overlap to a large extent, but their exact locations of the point of spawning are spatially distinct...|$|E
40|$|Stocks’ {{overexploitation}} and socio-economic sustainability are {{two major}} issues currently at stake in European fisheries. In this view the European Commission is considering the implementation of management plans {{as a means to}} move towards a longer-term perspective on fisheries management, to consider regional differences and to increase stakeholder involvement. Adriatic small pelagic <b>species</b> (<b>anchovies</b> and sardines) {{are some of the most}} studied species in the world from a biologic perspective; several economic analysis have also been realised on Italian pelagic fishery; despite that, no complete bioeconomic modelization has been carried out yet considering all biologic, technical and economic issues. Bioeconomic models cannot be considered foolproof tools but are important implements to help decision makers and can supply a fundamental scientific basis for management plans. This research gathers all available information (from biologic, technologic and economic perspectives) in order to carry out a bioeconomic model of the Adriatic pelagic fishery. Different approaches are analyzed and some of them developed to highlight potential divergences in results, characteristics and implications. Growth, production and demand functions are estimated. A formal analysis about interaction and competition between Italian and Croatian fleet is examined proposing different equilibriums for open access, duopoly and a form of cooperative solution. Anyway normative judgments are limited because of poor knowledge of population dynamics and data related to the Croatian fleet. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} of promoting and rewarding the sustainable management in fisheries and aquaculture using product differentiation through eco-labelling and organic labeling respectively. At the same time food safety concerns arise due to the often food crisis experienced worldwide in the past few years. In this paper, we present a choice experiment addressing preferences for seafood products in Greece. Amongst other attributes, four different <b>species</b> (namely <b>anchovy,</b> cod, seabream and mussels) are included while two types of labels i. e. eco-label and organic label and a safety certification are introduced. As expected, new labels for fisheries products have a positive impact in the market. Consumers are positive towards the prospect of labelling for fisheries products, as compared to unlabelled products...|$|R
