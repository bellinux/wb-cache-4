Analytical tools like Optical Microscope, <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (<b>SEM),</b> X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are widely employed {{in the study of}} slag.|$|E
25|$|Electron {{diffraction}} is {{most frequently}} used in solid state physics and chemistry to study the crystal structure of solids. Experiments are usually performed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), or a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (<b>SEM)</b> as electron backscatter diffraction. In these instruments, electrons are accelerated by an electrostatic potential {{in order to gain}} the desired energy and determine their wavelength before they interact with the sample to be studied.|$|E
25|$|Other {{completely}} {{different approach to}} microscopy is electron microscope (EM), which gives a beam of electrons {{in order to be}} focused onto the desired specimen with a design capable of giving a magnifying power up to 100,000 times.6 Electron microscopes are also used but very little when compared to light microscopes. (TEM) transmission electron microscope is more difficult to use and requires more sample preparation than <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (<b>SEM)</b> and thus have found very few applications in forensic science.|$|E

25|$|A <b>scanning</b> <b>{{electron}}</b> <b>microscope</b> (<b>SEM)</b> {{is a type}} of {{electron microscope}} that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens can be observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.|$|E
25|$|In November 2007, Homann {{took the}} skull {{to the office}} of {{anthropologist}} Jane MacLaren Walsh, in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History for examination. Walsh carried out a detailed examination of the skull using ultraviolet light, a high-powered light microscope, and computerized tomography. Homann took the skull to the museum again in 2008 so it could be filmed for a Smithsonian Networks documentary, Legend of the Crystal Skull and on this occasion Walsh was able to take two sets of silicone molds of surface tool marks for <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (<b>SEM)</b> analysis. The SEM micrographs revealed evidence that the crystal had been worked with a high speed, hard metal rotary tool coated with a hard abrasive such as diamond. Walsh's extensive research on artifacts from Mexico and Central America showed that pre-contact artisans carved stone by abrading the surface with stone or wooden tools and in later pre-Columbian times, copper tools, in combination with a variety of abrasive sands or pulverized stone. These examinations led Walsh {{to the conclusion that the}} skull was probably carved in the 1930s, and was most likely based on the British Museum skull which had been exhibited fairly continuously from 1898.|$|E
