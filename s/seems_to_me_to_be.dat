500|$|In 1909, Beecham {{conducted}} the first complete performance of A Mass of Life, {{the largest and}} most ambitious of Delius's concert works, written for four soloists, a double choir, and a large orchestra. Although the work was based on the same Nietzsche work as Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra, Delius distanced himself from the Strauss work, which he considered a complete failure. Nor was Strauss an admirer of Delius, as he was of Elgar; he told Delius that he did not wish to conduct Paris: [...] "the symphonic development <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too scant, and it seems moreover to be an imitation of Charpentier".|$|E
500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred to me that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E

500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviews were more {{critical}} of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine considered it better than King Solomon's Mines, he opined, [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has {{anything that can be}} called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them". Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of Time: A Monthly Miscellany, who declared: [...] "In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to be described as a romance... it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the method of the modern melodrama". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: [...] "Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'." [...] Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She who widely garnered universal praise. [...] "Ayesha", Moore declares, [...] "is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted She: ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicingâ€”like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.|$|E

2500|$|As far as I can {{see there}} is no {{difference}} between a firing squad, an electric chair, a gas chamber, or hanging.

There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no present significance as to whether an execution is by a firing squad or in some other way.

Today, it was a Muslim; tomorrow, unless the government's powers are taken away from them, it could be any number of categories of 'enemy combatants' who have not yet been identified." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Romney {{expressed}} his difficulty in jotting down each reference {{while watching the}} film, writing that [...] "propositions, allusions, sounds, images rush on in wave after wave, each building a new layer on top ofâ€”or violently erasingâ€”what's immediately gone before. Trying to make any sense of it all, {{even in the most}} rudimentary or provisional way, is an anguish-inducing process" [...] and that [...] "you might be closer to understanding a Godard film if you'd read everything the director had readâ€”but then you'd also have to have read it all {{in exactly the same way}} that he had read it, making the same connections." [...] Ted Fendt wrote that [...] "knowing the original sources of Godard's work often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about as useful to 'unlocking' the films and videos as reading a heavily footnoted copy of The Waste Land." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 January 1896, in {{conversation}} with L. A. Tollemache, Gladstone explained that: [...] "I am not so much afraid of Democracy or of Science as of the love of money. This <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a growing evil. Also, {{there is a danger}} from the growth of that dreadful military spirit". On 13 January, Gladstone claimed he had strong Conservative instincts and that [...] "In all matters of custom and tradition, even the Tories look upon me as the chief Conservative that is". On 15 January Gladstone wrote to James Bryce, describing himself as [...] "a dead man, one fundamentally a Peelâ€“Cobden man". In 1896, in his last noteworthy speech, he denounced Armenian massacres by Ottomans in a talk delivered at Liverpool. On 2 January 1897, Gladstone wrote to Francis Hirst on being unable to draft a preface to a book on liberalism: [...] "I venture on assuring you that I regard the design formed by you and your friends with sincere interest, and in particular wish well to all the efforts you may make on behalf of individual freedom and independence as opposed to what is termed Collectivism".|$|E
