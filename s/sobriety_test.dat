40|$|The {{horizontal}} gaze nystagmus test (HGNT) is {{one component}} of field <b>sobriety</b> <b>testing</b> conducted by police officers {{to determine whether a}} suspect is intoxicated. The HGNT is the centerpiece of the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (NHTSA) Standardized Field <b>Sobriety</b> <b>Tests.</b> The walk-and-turn test and the one-leg-stand test are also included in this three-test battery of field <b>sobriety</b> <b>tests.</b> Prior to the NHTSA funded work at standardizing field <b>sobriety</b> <b>testing,</b> roadside tests were selected and administered according to personal preferences. Today, however, many police agencies and officers use the standardized three-test battery that resulted from NHTSA 2 ̆ 7 s work. Although the HGNT is used in conjunction with the walk-and-turn and the one-leg-stand tests, this discussion will focus solely on the HGNT due to the recent decision by the North Dakota Supreme Court in City of Fargo v. McLaughlin...|$|R

50|$|Critics of {{standardized}} field <b>sobriety</b> <b>tests</b> often question the statistical evidence behind them, {{and the ability}} of the officers to administer the tests and actually judge for impairments related to alcohol. According to Barone, one study involved completely sober individuals who were asked to perform the standardized field <b>sobriety</b> <b>tests,</b> and their performances were videotaped. “After viewing the 21 videos of sober individuals taking the standardized field tests, the police officers’ believed that forty-six percent of the individuals had ‘too much to drink’”. It should not be out of the question for the standardized field <b>sobriety</b> <b>tests</b> to be re-examined for reliability and validity. A standardized test that claims to have scientific support should be able to be repeated. Along with that, the standardized field <b>sobriety</b> <b>tests</b> do not have a specific standard for grading, and it is left up to the discretion of the officer to determine whether what he/she see observes is actually a cue sufficient to count against the test subject. To err is human. The NHTSA’s 1977 study had an error rate of 47 percent, and the 1981 study had an error rate of 32 percent, which is considered unusually high for a scientific study.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Homer remains {{oblivious to}} Ned's animosity. He {{arrives at the}} Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but Ned and his family get in their car and race off without him. Pulled over by Chief Wiggum for speeding, Ned takes a <b>sobriety</b> <b>test</b> as disapproving townspeople watch. At church, when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer, Homer inhales very loudly through his nose, causing Ned to yell at Homer. This alarms the congregation, who become even more upset with Ned. But Homer sticks up for Ned and convinces the congregation to give him another chance. The next week, everything returns to normal, as Homer once again is annoyed by Ned.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of Wednesday, August 11, 1965, 21-year-old Marquette Frye, an African American man {{behind the wheel of}} his mother's 1955 Buick, was pulled over for {{reckless}} driving by California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer Lee Minikus. After administering a field <b>sobriety</b> <b>test,</b> Minikus placed Frye under arrest and radioed for his vehicle to be impounded. Marquette's brother, Ronald, a passenger in the vehicle, walked to their house nearby, bringing their mother, Rena Price, back with him {{to the scene of the}} arrest.|$|E
50|$|In {{the recent}} wake of legalized marijuana, law {{enforcement}} has sought {{a method of}} breath testing to determine the content of THC present in an individual. Law enforcement efficiently combats {{driving under the influence}} with tools like breathalyzers during field <b>sobriety</b> <b>tests.</b> Excluding edibles, a THC breathalyzer has the potential to measure how ‘high’ an individual may be at the time. The legality of marijuana does not entail safety on the road, and accurate methods have become required to determine driver impairment. A THC breathalyzer could revolutionize roadside <b>sobriety</b> <b>testing</b> for drivers suspected of impairment.|$|R

5000|$|Field <b>sobriety</b> <b>tests</b> are {{a battery}} of tests used by police {{officers}} {{to determine if a}} person suspected of impaired driving is intoxicated with alcohol or drugs. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began research in 1975 on how to test suspects for impaired driving. The NHTSA developed a series of tests that police officers could use when evaluating suspected impaired drivers. [...] By 1981, officers in the United States began using the organization's battery of standardized <b>sobriety</b> <b>tests</b> to help make decisions about whether to arrest suspected impaired drivers. The tests were designed to indicate intoxication associated with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.10%.|$|R
25|$|In August 1992, Otter {{was pulled}} over on Interstate 84 near Meridian for {{suspicion}} of {{driving under the}} influence. He said the arresting officer observed him swerving as he was reaching for his cowboy hat, which had been blown off by the wind in his open car. Otter offered several explanations for failing the field <b>sobriety</b> <b>test</b> including: his stocking feet were stung by weeds and gravel, he had run eight miles (13km) and his knee hurt, he was hungry, {{and that he had}} soaked his chewing tobacco in Jack Daniel's. A jury convicted Otter in March 1993, and he was sentenced to 72 hours of community service and 16 hours at an alcohol treatment program, fined $700, and had his license revoked.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{was arrested}} in Fairfax County, Virginia at 2:45am on October 27, 2004 for {{allegedly}} {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol following a birthday party in Washington for former Redskins receiver Rod Gardner. Pulled over for driving 82mph on the Beltway, where the speed limit is 55mph, Taylor failed a field <b>sobriety</b> <b>test</b> and then refused a blood alcohol (BAC) test, which resulted in his arrest. A Fairfax County judge acquitted Taylor of the charges in March 2005 after viewing a videotape of Taylor's roadside sobriety tests that, according to the judge, failed to demonstrate obvious intoxication. Taylor was, however, convicted for refusing to take a blood alcohol test requested by a Virginia state police officer. But when this case was heard on appeal in March 2005, Taylor was acquitted of refusing to take the BAC test, with the judge ruling there was a lack of probable cause for the request.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, 2006, Barry {{was stopped}} by Secret Service Uniformed Division police {{officers}} after stopping at a green light and running a red light. According to a Secret Service spokesman, the police officers pulled over his car, smelled alcohol, and administered a field <b>sobriety</b> <b>test.</b> Barry was then taken to the U.S. Capitol Police station for a breathalyzer test. The Secret Service said that the breathalyzer test did not give an accurate reading, but Barry later said that it gave a successful reading of 0.02%, which {{is less than the}} legal limit of 0.08%. The police officers asked Barry to give a urine analysis, which Barry refused. The officers gave Barry a ticket for running a red light and failing to submit to a urine analysis. He was also charged with driving an unregistered vehicle and misuse of temporary tags. Barry pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prosecutors offered Barry a deal to drop the charge of driving under the influence in exchange for a guilty plea from Barry; he declined. A judge found him not guilty of the charges.|$|E

25|$|This {{would all}} {{change in the}} middle of 2005 however. In June 2005 Police responded to a call about a man doing pushups in the street and jumping on cars in a {{residential}} neighborhood near Tallahassee, Florida. When they reached the scene, Tallahassee police officer Zachary Lyne stated that Sexton was sitting {{in the middle of}} the street wearing only a pair of wet shorts and when repeatedly asked to state his name he eventually responded only that he was God. Lyne then stated that Sexton became belligerent and had to be pepper sprayed and subdued. Sexton was not charged with a crime as he passed a <b>sobriety</b> <b>test,</b> and police stated that he had not committed a criminal act. The police then, after consulting with Sexton's parents, released him to a hospital for medical observation. Initially there were allegations of drug abuse which Sexton's family quickly repudiated. Sexton was later diagnosed with Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease that can cause joint swelling and brain inflammation if left untreated. The disease was deemed to be in its later stages by a Lyme disease specialist when it was diagnosed, who then recommended a treatment program of intensive antibiotic therapy for several months.|$|E

Although before the 1996–97 NBA season the Bullets/Wizards were expected to make the playoffs with Webber, Howard, and Strickland, there were rumors that Webber had difficulty adjusting to being a less important part of the offensive game plan in the presence of All-Star Howard. Howard was plagued with shin splints, causing him to miss several preseason games. On November 11, 1996, Howard failed a <b>sobriety</b> <b>test</b> when he was caught speeding and was charged with driving while intoxicated. The following month he pleaded not guilty and committed to enter an alcohol rehabilitation and education program. After Lynam coached the Bullets to a 22–24 record, he was fired and the Bullets hired Bernie Bickerstaff, who posted a 22–13 record. [...] Over the course of the 1996–97 season, Howard accumulated 24doubledoubles in 82games, while averaging 19.1points and 8.1rebounds. Although Howard averaged over 19points per game and played all 82games, he only scored 30 or more points twice during the regular season. [...] The team finished its regular season with a 44–38 record but was swept in three games in the Eastern Conference first round by the Chicago Bulls, who went on to win their second consecutive NBA championship. The 1997 NBA Playoffs were Howard's only NBA playoff appearance in his six-plus seasons with the Washington franchise, and he averaged 18.7points and 6rebounds while playing 43minutes per game. The playoff appearance marked the franchise's first playoff appearance since the 1988 NBA Playoffs.|$|E
