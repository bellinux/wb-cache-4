5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; <b>she</b> <b>snatched</b> a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E

6000|$|CLEOPATRA (wringing {{her hands}} and calling). Ftatateeta. Ftatateeta. It is dark; and I am alone. Come to me. (Silence.) Ftatateeta. (Louder.) Ftatateeta. (Silence. In a panic <b>she</b> <b>snatches</b> the cord and pulls the {{curtains}} apart.) ...|$|R
60|$|Scornfully <b>she</b> <b>snatches</b> {{the dagger}} out of Aegisthus's hand and {{advances}} to the bed. You see it shining {{over her head}} in the glimmer of the lamp, and--and the lamp goes out, with a groan, and all is dark.|$|R
60|$|SIMONE. Paul, Paul, {{give that}} to me! (<b>She</b> <b>snatches</b> the pistol from his hand.) If {{anything}} {{were to happen}} to you, Paul, I should kill myself with this. You must live, you must consent to accept the money. You mustn't let your honour make a martyr of you.|$|R

6000|$|FTATATEETA. Not from thee, baby. (<b>She</b> <b>snatches</b> {{his ankle}} {{from under him}} and flies stooping along the palace wall {{vanishing}} in the darkness within its precinct. Bel Affris roars with laughter as the Persian tumbles. The guardsmen rush out of the palace with Belzanor and a mob of fugitives, mostly carrying bundles.) ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK [grimacing] Sorry. [He {{goes for}} {{his cap and}} rifle. Mrs Warren returns. He takes her hand] Good-night, dear Mrs Warren.

60|$|The {{owner of}} the {{cauliflower}} is too indignant to reply. <b>She</b> <b>snatches</b> it away, appears to be comforting it, replaces it in the basket.

60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>snatched</b> it {{from his}} lips and thrown it into the grate.|$|R
60|$|Before {{he could}} touch the bill <b>she</b> <b>snatched</b> {{it from the}} pavement, tore it into fragments, and threw them over the wall.|$|E

Caesar makes a bound and manages to catch her and hold her while Ftatateeta escapes.) ...|$|R
