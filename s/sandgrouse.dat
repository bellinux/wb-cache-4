5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Pterocles are mainly found in the drier parts of northern, eastern and {{southern}} Africa though the range of some species extends into the Middle East and western Asia. The Madagascar <b>sandgrouse</b> is restricted to Madagascar. The black-bellied <b>sandgrouse</b> and the pin-tailed <b>sandgrouse</b> also occur in Spain, Portugal and southern France. Most species are sedentary though some make local migrations, typically to lower altitudes in winter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sandgrouse</b> are principally seed eaters. Other {{food items}} eaten include green shoots and leaves, bulbs and berries. Insect food such as ants and {{termites}} may be eaten {{especially during the}} breeding season. The diet of many <b>sandgrouse</b> is highly specialised, with the seeds of {{a small number of}} plant species being dominant. This may depend on local availability but in other cases it reflects actual selection of favoured seeds over others by the <b>sandgrouse.</b> Seeds of leguminous plants are usually {{an important part of the}} diet. In agricultural areas oats and other grain are readily taken. Seeds are either collected from the ground or directly from the plants. Foraging techniques vary between species that coexist which reduces competition; in Namibia, double-banded <b>sandgrouse</b> feed slowly and methodically whilst Namaqua <b>sandgrouse</b> feed rapidly, exploring loose soil with their beaks and flicking it away sideways. Grit is also swallowed to help grind up food in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sandgrouse</b> is {{the common}} name for Pteroclididae, a family of sixteen species of bird, members of the order Pteroclidiformes. They are {{traditionally}} placed in two genera. The two central Asian species are classified as Syrrhaptes and the other fourteen species, from Africa and Asia, are placed in the genus Pterocles. They are ground dwelling birds restricted to treeless, open country, such as plains, savannahs and semi-deserts. They are distributed across northern, southern and eastern Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East and India through to central Asia. The ranges of the black-bellied <b>sandgrouse</b> and the pin-tailed <b>sandgrouse</b> extend into the Iberian Peninsula and France, and Pallas's <b>sandgrouse</b> occasionally breaks out in large numbers from its normal range in Asia.|$|E

50|$|In {{the scrub}} habitat of western Rajasthan, they live largely on desert gerbils, but also hunt hares, rats, doves, gray partridges, <b>sandgrouses,</b> peafowl, bulbuls, sparrows and eat eggs of ground birds. They {{have also been}} {{observed}} killing cobras, saw-scale vipers, sand boas, geckos, scorpions and beetles.|$|R
50|$|Columbea is a clade {{suggested}} by genome analysis that contains Columbiformes (pigeons and doves), Pteroclididae (<b>sandgrouses),</b> Mesitornithidae (mesites) and Mirandornithes (flamingos and grebes). Until their recent placement as the sister taxon to Passerea, {{in the last}} decade various genetic analysis found them to be in (the almost obsolete) clade Metaves.|$|R
5|$|The spotted <b>sandgrouse</b> is a ground-dwelling {{bird and}} feeds on seeds and other plant {{material}} that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the spotted <b>sandgrouse</b> are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The <b>sandgrouse</b> strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other <b>sandgrouse</b> freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. <b>Sandgrouse</b> {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and <b>sandgrouse</b> are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting <b>sandgrouse</b> and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sandgrouse</b> {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although there have been some localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied <b>sandgrouse,</b> P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E
50|$|The little {{rainfall}} {{that occurs}} is usually torrential, {{so that the}} ground, consisting of marls and sandstone with little vegetation, is unable to retain moisture. Instead, the rain causes erosion, forming the characteristic landscape of badlands. Arroyos formed by torrential rain harbor the scarce vegetation and fauna such as swifts, hedgehogs, jackdaws, pin-tailed <b>sandgrouses,</b> blue rock thrushes, stone curlews, trumpeter finches, and crested larks.|$|R
50|$|Metaves ("higher birds") is a {{controversial}} clade proposed by Fain & Houde (2004) and later rescued on {{the studies of}} Ericson et al. (2006) and Hackett et al. (2008). This group consists of several lineages that diversified early in Neornithes evolution. These lineages include Strisores (hummingbirds, swifts, nightjars and allies), pigeons, <b>sandgrouses,</b> mesites, Eurypygae (sunbittern and kagu), tropicbirds and Mirandornithes (flamingos and grebes), but the exact members of Metaves and their relationship differs between those studies and the group is only supported by b-fibrinogen gene.|$|R
25|$|The Trabancos region {{stands out}} for its {{concentration}} of great bustards (more than 2000); {{as well as}} having the largest reproductive concentration of black-bellied <b>sandgrouses</b> (Pterocles orientalis) in Castile and Le√≥n (with more than 200 mating pairs). It is also the winter season nesting ground of more than 1,500 red kites (Milvus milvus). There are also numerous birds of prey; the most abundant are Montagu's harriers (Circus pygargus, 50 mating pairs) and lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni; almost 150 mating pairs), {{but there are also}} hawks, goshawks, falcons, owls, and others. The region is also host to numerous gamebirds, including the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa).|$|R
5|$|<b>Sandgrouse</b> have small, pigeon like {{heads and}} necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and {{sometimes}} tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes {{at dawn and}} dusk. Their legs are feathered down to the toes.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes of central Asia. Their range extends from the Caspian Sea through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's <b>sandgrouse</b> can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>sandgrouse</b> {{is found}} in North Africa and the Middle East. In Africa its range extends through Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger. In the Middle East it is native to Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan and its range extends as far as Pakistan and north west India. In 2016, a flock of around a hundred birds arrived at Kutch after a gap of 19 years.|$|E
40|$|Ducula carola carola (spotted imperial-pigeon) were {{examined}} {{for the presence}} of chewing lice. Three species of chewing lice of the suborder Ischnocera and belonging to two genera were found and identified.

40|$|Abstract Background Phylogenetic {{hypotheses}} of higher-level {{relationships in}} the order Charadriiformes based on morphological data, partly disagree with those based on DNA-DNA hybridisation data. So far, these relationships have not been tested by analysis of DNA sequence data. Herein we utilize 1692 bp of aligned, nuclear DNA sequences obtained from 23 charadriiform species, representing 15 families. We also test earlier suggestions that bustards and <b>sandgrouses</b> may be nested with the charadriiforms. The data is analysed with methods based on the parsimony and maximum-likelihood criteria. Results Several novel phylogenetic relationships were recovered and strongly supported by the data, regardless of which method of analysis was employed. These include placing the gulls and allied groups as a sistergroup to the sandpiper-like birds, {{and not to the}} plover-like birds. The auks clearly belong to the clade with the gulls and allies, and are not basal to most other charadriiform birds as suggested in analyses of morphological data. Pluvialis, which has been supposed to belong to the plover family (Charadriidae), represents a basal branch that constitutes the sister taxon to a clade with plovers, oystercatchers and avocets. The thick-knees and sheathbills unexpectedly cluster together. Conclusion The DNA sequence data contains a strong phylogenetic signal that results in a well-resolved phylogenetic tree with many strongly supported internodes. Taxonomically it is the most inclusive study of shorebird families that relies on nucleotide sequences. The presented phylogenetic hypothesis provides a solid framework for analyses of macroevolution of ecological, morphological and behavioural adaptations observed within the order Charadriiformes. </p...|$|R

5|$|<b>Sandgrouse</b> are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The <b>sandgrouse</b> is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sandgrouse</b> are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with {{a few pieces of}} dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20‚Äì25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E
5|$|Some animals' colours and {{patterns}} resemble a particular natural background. This {{is an important}} component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling parakeets are mainly green; woodcocks of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed bitterns are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat. Similarly, desert animals are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the gerbil or fennec fox, birds such as the desert lark or <b>sandgrouse,</b> or reptiles like the skink or horned viper.Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example khaki uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.Many moths show industrial melanism, including the peppered moth which has coloration that blends in with tree bark. The coloration of these insects evolved between 1860 and 1940 to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas. This is taken by zoologists as evidence that camouflage is influenced by natural selection, as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.|$|E
25|$|Mammals of the Western Desert {{have been}} {{depleted}} {{over the years}} and the addax and scimitar oryx are no longer found there, and the Atlas lion has probably gone as well. The remaining mammals include the rhim gazelle, dorcas gazelle, Barbary sheep, R√ºppell's fox, lesser Egyptian jerboa and Giza gerbil. Notable birds from this desert include the spotted <b>sandgrouse,</b> greater hoopoe-lark and white-crowned wheatear.|$|E
25|$|Animal life {{includes}} Arabian leopard, Arabian wolves, striped hyenas, mongooses, baboons, hares, sand cats, and jerboas. Animals such as gazelles, oryx, leopards and cheetahs {{were relatively}} numerous until the 19th century, when extensive hunting reduced these animals almost to extinction. Birds include falcons (which are caught and trained for hunting), eagles, hawks, vultures, <b>sandgrouse,</b> bulbuls etc. There are {{several species of}} snakes, {{many of which are}} venomous. Saudi Arabia is home to a rich marine life. The Red Sea in particular is a rich and diverse ecosystem. More than 1200 species of fish have been recorded in the Red Sea, and around 10% of these are found nowhere else. This also includes 42 species of deepwater fish.|$|E
500|$|The spotted <b>sandgrouse</b> has a rapid wing {{beat and}} flies swiftly. Its call is a musical [...] "queeto-queeto" [...] which distinguishes it from {{other species of}} <b>sandgrouse</b> with similar plumage.|$|E
500|$|They are {{vulnerable}} to attack while watering but {{with a large number}} of birds milling about, predators find it difficult to select a target bird and are likely to have been spotted before they can get close to the flock. The choice of a watering site is influenced by the topography of the nearby ground. The <b>sandgrouse</b> tend to avoid sites with cover for mammalian predators and their greatest risk is usually from predatory birds. <b>Sandgrouse</b> travel tens of miles to their traditional water holes and tend to disregard temporary water sources which may appear periodically. This probably has a survival value because a dried up water source in an arid region could result in dehydration and death. The Burchell's <b>sandgrouse</b> in the Kalahari Desert sometimes travels over [...] daily to reach a water source. Not all species need to drink every day, and the Tibetan <b>sandgrouse</b> does not need to travel to drink because of the abundance of water from melting snowfields in its habitat.|$|E
500|$|The spotted <b>sandgrouse</b> {{reaches a}} length of about [...] The male has a small reddish-brown nape {{surrounded}} by a band of pale grey that extends to the bill and round the neck in a collar. The chin, neck and throat are orange and the breast grey. The upper parts are pinkish-grey with dark flight feathers and dark patches on the wings, tail and lower belly. The primaries are pale with dark trailing edges, a fact that distinguishes this species from the crowned <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles coronatus) which has completely dark primaries. The female also has an orange throat region but is generally duller in plumage than the male. The body colour is greyish-brown liberally spotted with small dark markings and with dark patches on the wings, tail and lower belly. The central tail feathers in both sexes are elongated {{but not to the}} extent that they are in the pin-tailed <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles alchata). When flying overhead, a dark belly stripe is visible.|$|E
500|$|The family Columbidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Columbidae is the only living family in the order Columbiformes. The <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pteroclididae) were formerly placed here but were moved to a separate order Pteroclidiformes based on anatomical differences (e.g., they are unable to drink by [...] "sucking" [...] or [...] "pumping"); they are now considered to be more closely related to shorebirds. Recent phylogenomic studies support the grouping of pigeons and <b>sandgrouse</b> together, along with mesites, forming the sister taxon to Mirandornithes.|$|E
500|$|Tephrosia apollinea {{is cited}} as [...] "unpalatable", {{although}} {{the seeds of}} the plant are reportedly a favourite of <b>sandgrouse</b> inhabiting the scrub-desert of northern Sudan, and the butterfly Colias croceus is known to feed on it. This has allowed it to colonize the landscape in parts of the Middle East which have been overgrazed, especially at lower altitudes.|$|E
500|$|The spotted <b>sandgrouse</b> (Pterocles senegallus) is {{a species}} of ground {{dwelling}} bird in the family Pteroclididae. It is found in arid regions of northern and eastern Africa and across the Middle East and parts of Asia as far east as northwest India. It is a gregarious, diurnal bird and small flocks forage for seed and other vegetable matter on the ground, flying once a day to a waterhole for water. In the breeding season pairs nest apart from one another, the eggs being laid in a depression on the stony ground. The chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and eat dry seed, the water they need being provided by the male which saturates its belly feathers with water at the waterhole. The spotted <b>sandgrouse</b> is listed as being of [...] "least concern" [...] by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in its Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
500|$|The {{draining}} of Norfolk's coastal marshes commenced in {{the late}} 17th and 18th centuries, and sea defences including the [...] "Old Lord's Bank" [...] at Titchwell were shown in maps from 1786 and 1797. For the next 170 years or so, the reclaimed marsh was arable, producing crops and beef cattle. A huge influx of Pallas's <b>sandgrouse</b> into Britain in 1853 led to several arrivals at Titchwell, including mated pairs. The last bird seen was on the saltmarsh, and the rest were on the dunes or in marram grass; many were shot.|$|E
500|$|Exacerbating these issues, columbids are {{not well}} {{represented}} in the fossil record. No truly primitive forms {{have been found to}} date. The genus Gerandia has been described from Early Miocene deposits in France, but while it was long believed to be a pigeon, it is now considered a <b>sandgrouse.</b> Fragmentary remains of a probably [...] "ptilinopine" [...] Early Miocene pigeon were found in the Bannockburn Formation of New Zealand and described as Rupephaps; [...] "Columbina" [...] prattae from roughly contemporary deposits of Florida is nowadays tentatively separated in Arenicolumba, but its distinction from Columbina/Scardafella and related genera needs to be more firmly established (e.g. by cladistic analysis). Apart from that, all other fossils belong to extant genera.|$|E
500|$|The Pteroclididae was {{formerly}} {{included in the}} Galliformes due to the similarities the family shares with the true grouse. However, it was later discovered that these similarities are superficial and a result of convergent evolution. <b>Sandgrouse</b> were later placed near the Columbiformes largely due to their reported ability to drink by the [...] "sucking" [...] or [...] "pumping" [...] action of peristalsis of the esophagus, an unusual characteristic. More recently, {{it has been reported}} that they cannot suck up water in this way, and they are now treated separately in the order Pteroclidiformes. They have been considered near passerine birds and are considered by some to be closer to the shorebirds (Charadriiformes).|$|E
500|$|<b>Sandgrouse</b> have small, pigeon-like {{heads and}} necks and sturdy compact bodies. They {{range in size}} from [...] in length and from [...] in weight. The adults are sexually dimorphic with the males being {{slightly}} larger and more brightly colored than the females. They have eleven strong primary feathers and long pointed wings giving them a fast direct flight. The muscles of the wings are powerful and the birds are capable of rapid take off and sustained flight. In some species, the central feathers in the tail are extended into long points. The legs are short and members of the genus Syrrhaptes have feathers growing on both the legs and toes and no hind toes, while members of the genus Pterocles have legs feathered just at the front, no feathers on the toes and rudimentary hind toes raised off the ground. The plumage is cryptic, generally being in shades of sandy brown, grey and buff, variously mottled and barred, enabling the birds to merge into the dusty landscape. There is a dense layer of under down which helps insulate the bird from extremes of heat and cold. The feathers of the belly are specially adapted for absorbing water and retaining it, allowing adults, particularly males, to carry water to chicks that may be many miles away from watering holes. The amount of water that can be carried in this way is 15 to 20 millilitres (0.5 to 0.7 fluid ounce).|$|E
2500|$|... {{beauty of}} their plumage. Great numbers of eagles, vultures, hawks, {{bustards}} and other {{birds of prey}} are met with; and partridges, duck, teal, guineafowl, <b>sandgrouse,</b> curlews, woodcock, snipe, pigeons, thrushes and swallows are very plentiful. A fine variety of ostrich is commonly found. Among the birds prized for their plumage are the marabout, crane, heron, blacks bird, parrot, jay and hummingbirds of extraordinary brilliance, ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} nest {{construction is}} the scrape, which {{is merely a}} shallow depression in soil or vegetation. [...] This nest type, which typically has a rim deep {{enough to keep the}} eggs from rolling away, is sometimes lined with bits of vegetation, small stones, shell fragments or feathers. These materials may help to camouflage the eggs or may provide some level of insulation; they may also help to keep the eggs in place, and prevent them from sinking into muddy or sandy soil if the nest is accidentally flooded. Ostriches, most tinamous, many ducks, most shorebirds, most terns, some falcons, pheasants, quail, partridges, bustards and <b>sandgrouse</b> are among the species that build scrape nests.|$|E
