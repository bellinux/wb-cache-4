40|$|The use of Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} methods of pressure measurement. Effective both on simple and complex surfaces, PSP can produce global surface pressure maps with exceptional spatial resolution. However, there are practical issues that hinder its accuracy. Surface preparation and paint application is tedious, expensive, and time consuming. Sensitivity to temperature is also an issue as it affects luminescent molecules and their transitions. Research has focused on developing <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> or decals, pre-coated with PSP material. One advantage to this approach is quick and easy application to areas of interest during experimentation. This would not only minimize cost and surface preparation time, but simultaneously unveil a solution to the issue of PSP degradation. Should the PSP degrade from use or handling, one would need only to quickly remove the flawed strip and apply fresh PSP coated tape. Due to the more controlled conditions under which the tapes would be prepared, it would also be possible to apply dual coatings. For example: running a stripe of PSP along with a parallel stripe of Temperature Sensitive Paint would grant the ability to determine relative temperature and pressure measurements on a given surface. It would also allow for pressure measurement adjustments accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Since Kramer (1933) {{investigated}} the optical properties ofhemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin solutions, many {{methods have been}} proposed for the photometric estimation of the oxygen saturation of blood. A new method can only be advocated if it offers economy of apparatus or reagents, greater ease of performance, or the elimination of sources of error. It is upon these grounds that the following method is proposed for consideration. METHOD (1) Colorimeter and Cuvettes. Any simple photoelectric colorimeter that employs small cylindrical cuvettes of about 0 5 / 0 6 cm. internal diameter could be used.

The optical thickness of the cylindrical cuvette (" EEL " No. 305) is therefore reduced by inserting a glass rod of 5 32 / 5 A 40 mm. maximum diameter and with ovality of not more than 0 - 15 mm.

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of Lamb waves to damage and/or defect detection in structures is typically confined to lower frequencies in regimes where only the lower order modes propagate {{in order to}} sim-plify interpretation of the scattered wave-fields. Operation at higher frequencies offers the potential to extend the sensitivity and diagnostic capability of this technique, however there are technical chal-lenges associated with the measurement and interpretation of this data. Recent work by the authors has demonstrated the ability of fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) to measure wave-fields at frequencies in excess of 2 MHz [1]. However, when this work was extended to other thinner plate specimens {{it was found that}} at these higher frequencies, the cyanoacrylate adhesive (M-Bond 200) used to attach the FBG sensors to the plate was significantly affecting the propagation of the waves.

The cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints can further {{be enhanced by}} using Rhodamine 6 G (Jian and Dao-an 1991). Morris (1992) suggested the use of basic yellow 40 in place of gentian violet for enhancing cyanoacrylate-fumed fingermarks on adhesive side of tape. Isaac (1993) used rhodamine 6 G for enhancing cyanoacrylate-fumed fingermarks on different kinds of <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>tapes.</b> Kobus et al. (1983) suggested the use of gentian violet and coumarin 540 to {{enhance the quality of}} cyanoacrylate developed prints on polyethylene and aluminium foil respectively. Chesher et al. (1992) used acid fuchsin, Nile blue A, safranin bluish and Rit® fabric dye in combination with OMNIPRINTTM 1000 alternate light source to enhance the quality of cyanoacrylate developed prints on white polyethylene dinner plate. Post-treatment with vapors of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde was suggested {{to improve the quality of}} cyanoacrylate-fumed latent fingerprints on solvent-sensitive surfaces such as oil marker writings and materials with rough surfaces such as unglazed earthenware (Takatsu et al. 2012). The use of RAY (Rhodamine, Ardrox, Basic Yellow) dye stain, gentian violet and alternate powder was suggested for enhancing the quality of cyanoacrylate-developed fingerprints on the adhesive side of various kinds of tapes. Processing of cyanoacrylate fumed prints with gentian violet, followed by alternate powder and finally with RAY dye stain was suggested as best processing sequence to enhance the quality of developed prints (Wilson 2010). Chadwick et al. (2014) observed that staining of Polycyano UV processed marks with rhodamine 6 G significantly improves its performance on aluminium, glass and polyethylene bags. The use of sublimating dyes such as 1 -amino- 2 -phenoxy- 4 -hydroxy-anthraquinone and 1, 4 -bis-(ethylamino)-anthraquinone was suggested to enhance the quality of cyanoacrylate developed (fresh and aged upto 2  months) prints on plastics, metals and glass surfaces. The particles of dyes adhere to polymerized cyanoacrylate and provide red purple or blue color to it (Morimoto et al. 1998). Lock et al. (1995) suggested the use of europium thenoyltrifluoroacetone ortho-phenanthroline (EuTTAPhen) complex for enhancing the quality of cyanoacrylate-developed prints. Olenik (2015) described a procedure to develop latent fingermarks on smooth and adhesive sides of duct tape and other plastic tapes, including black electrical tape using cyanoacrylate fuming followed by dyeing with basic yellow 40. The procedure involves the fuming of tape with cyanoacrylate vapors followed by application of basic yellow 40. After dyeing, tape is rinsed under running tap water, followed by drying and visualized with orange or yellow goggles under blue light as well as under forensic light source in the range of 415 to 485  nm. Menzel et al. (1983) observed that application of post-treatment procedures (dusting, staining and ninhydrin/zinc chloride) to cyanoacrylate developed prints significantly improves the detectibility of latent prints. They suggested the use to ultraviolet and blue-green argon-ion laser together with fluorescent powder dusting, fluorescent dye staining and ninhydrin/zinc chloride post-processing of cyanoacrylate developed prints. Sonnex et al. (2016) used cyanoacrylate fuming followed by Infrared spectral mapping for visualization and enhancement of latent fingermarks on smooth, shiny fabrics such as silk, nylon and polyester, of different colors and patterns. However, due to the presence of carbonyl functional group in cotton and polycotton and their absorbency to latent fingermark residues, these fabrics gave poor results. Stoltzfus and Rebane (2016) used NIR two-photon induced fluorescence imaging technique to image cyanoacrylate processed fingermarks on highly-reflective substrates. Chadwick et al. (2011) suggested the use of styryl 11, a laser dye, over rhodamine 6 G for the enhancement of cyanoacrylate-developed fingermarks in near-infrared region. The luminescence emission intensity of STaR 11, combination of styryl 11 and rhodamine 6 G, was better than styryl 11 and rhodamine 6 G individually and could be used for enhancing the visualization of cyanoacrylate-developed fingermarks on multicolored glossy cardboard in visible and near-infrared regions.|$|R

A breakthrough in this area would have great commercial value in transportation, marine and construction industry infrastructures. The patented NASA GLACS system has undergone considerable testing {{to meet the needs of}} commercialization. A moisture-cure coating gives excellent adhesion with ease of application compared to existing galvanic products on the market. The latest development, GalvaCori; can be sprayed or hand applied to almost any structure shape. A <b>self-adhesive</b> conductive <b>tape</b> system has been devised to simplify current collection within the coating areas. In testing programs, millivolt potential and milliamp output per square foot of anode have been closely studied at actual test sites. These two parameters are probably the most challenging items of a resin-based, room-temperature-applied, galvanic coating. Extensive re-formulation has resulted in a system that provides the needed polarization for catholic protection of {{reinforcing steel}} in concrete in a variety of structure environments. The rate of corrosion of rebar in concrete is greatly affected by the environment of the structure. In addition to this, for any given concrete structure; moisture level, carbonization, and chloride contamination influences the rate of rebar corrosion. Similarly, the cathodic protection level of galvanic systems is also dependent on the moisture level of the concrete. GalvaCorr is formulated to maintain galvanic activity as the moisture level of the structure declines. GalvaCorr is available as a three-part kit. The mixing step requires about ten minutes. The viscosity can be easily adjusted to meet the application needs. The pot or working life is four to six hours, depending on the temperature.
