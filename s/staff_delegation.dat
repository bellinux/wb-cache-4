The program is conducted by the YMCA Center for Civic Engagement in Nashville. Youth in Government is an annual conference held for high school and middle school students in the State Capitol to simulate the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Students serve as either Senators or Representatives, justices or lawyers in the Supreme Court, the Governor and his cabinet, which includes the Commissioners of all the State Executive Branches. Students can also serve {{as members of the}} conference press corps or lobbyists for a firm. Each fall, a Model United Nations conference is sponsored, where students participate as either a member country of the General Assembly, a member country of the Security Council, a member of the Secretariat, a lawyer in the International Court of Justice, or a member of the conference press corps. Both programs are for high school students (9-12) and also offer abbreviated versions to middle school students across the state.

Message from this large US {{study is that}} 'bottom-up' practice improvements in treatment services initiated by counsellors are still strongly influenced by the climate-setting and support offered by an organisation's leadership and ethos, especially how far they foster professional development. Summary Although innovations may be initiated or mandated by leadership to improve clinical practice, the decision to implement a new intervention in client care is often determined by the individual counsellor. The main focus {{of this study was}} on 'bottom-up adoption', the degree to which individuals in an organisation choose to try an innovation, not the degree to which leaders mandate it. In turn this perspective focuses attention on how leaders and organisations foster staff commitment to practice improvements. In investigating these issues, the study was guided by an influential model of the processes involved in the planning and adoption of innovations developed by Texas Christian University's Institute of Behavioral Research, which has researched these processes in the UK as well as the USA and other countries. The study was conducted in nine US states and derived its data from 421 counselling staff at 71 outpatient drug-free programmes, a subset of the 92 where more than one staff member had completed a survey on how they saw the treatment environment at their centre. It aimed to tease out what makes counsellors more or less likely to adopt and spread innovations in the treatment of substance use problems, a 'propensity to innovate' tapped by questions such as how often they had adopted new ways of working as a result of training workshops, how often they had encouraged other counsellors to use new ideas they had adopted, and how well clients respond to new ideas and materials. Other questions looked for qualities in the counsellor which might have influenced their propensity to innovate, such as feeling they influence others in their workplace, flexibly adapt to work demands, feel it is important to and take steps to foster their professional development, and are confident of their abilities. The study hypothesised that it was by bolstering such qualities in their staff that leaders foster their adoption of new practices, so another set of questions asked about their programme director's leadership qualities such as setting an example, encouraging new ways of looking at the work, and providing well defined performance goals and objectives. It was also expected that the positive influence of these leadership virtues on staff would be greatest when the climate of the organisation as a whole was conducive to change, tapped by questions about the climate at their centre in respect of the clarity and nature of its mission, cohesion among the <b>staff,</b> <b>delegation</b> of authority over their work to staff, adequacy of communications, staff stress, and how receptive the organisation is to change. In assessing interrelationships between these variables the study adjusted as needed for any influence of differing staff experience levels, qualifications, professional certification status, and caseloads, and the possible clustering of similar views among staff at the same centre...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to illustrate, and analyze how social workers are able to more {{effectively}} pursue operative possibilities within their own particular organizations. The main question concerning this issue is: How are social workers, working within the same district organization able to realise any potential for co-operation with other social workers, in different locales and units, yet working within the same organization? Following on from this question, further issues arise such as: 1. How do the varying demands of the clients affect the workload of the social worker? 2. How does the organization facilitate or hinder co-operation between social workers? 3. How does the workload, <b>staff</b> turnover and <b>delegation</b> influence on the co-operation between social workers? To attempt to answer to the above set of questions a qualitative method was employed. A group interview was conducted bringing together a group of five social workers working within the same district administration of the city of Stockholm. The outcome of the interview has been examined using a theoretical framework based on organization theory, symbolic interactionism and social constructivism; all applied in accordance with post-modern research principles.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the staffing, division of labor, and resulting profitability {{of primary care}} physician practices. Division of labor {{is viewed as a}} mechanism to increase the efficiency of production processes through specialization. At the same time, division of labor also introduces coordination cost as handoffs and communication needs increase. We attempt to empirically assess the net effect in primary care physician offices. We collected data from a sample of these practices and tested two hypotheses: (H 1) controlling for <b>staff</b> size, greater <b>delegation</b> through the use of more staff types will decrease the throughput of visits, and (H 2) controlling for staff size, income per unit time generated by the practice is decreasing in the number of staff types. We find evidence supporting both hypotheses. We conclude that many physicians are gaining little financial benefit from delegating work to support staff. This suggests that small practices with few staff may be viable alternatives to traditional practice designs. healthcare management, service operations, survey research, econometric analysis...|$|R

General Maurice Gamelin explained that the Germans had broken through on a 50 km front and had already advanced 60 km inward from Sedan. When Churchill asked about the strategic reserve, Gamelin replied that there was none. Churchill then inquired when and where Gamelin proposed to attack the flanks of the bulge. Gamelin replied with a hopeless shrug and the famous words: [...] "Inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of method." [...] Six more squadrons were requested for France, above the four additional RAF squadrons which had already that morning been authorised. If the French request were heeded, it would leave just 25 squadrons for home defence, the final limit. Churchill explained that a minimum of 39 fighter squadrons was needed to defend British war industries. Bomber aircraft, he argued, would be better employed attacking the Ruhr; they were unsuitable against tanks. However, the same evening, Churchill warned his War Cabinet that more aircraft should be committed for fear that French resistance would crumble as swiftly {{as that of the}} Poles. French morale was accordingly raised, but matters were not as they seemed. The six extra squadrons were to be based in Kent and would operate from French airfields only during daylight hours. Moreover, three would fly in the mornings and three in the afternoons, and three had already been committed to France as part of Lord Gort's air power. Over the coming three to four days, the strength of the British Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) would be further reduced.|$|R

Studies within these programs are examining the underlying forces shaping Californiaâ€™s future, cutting across {{a wide range of}} public policy concerns, including education, health care, immigration, income distribution, welfare, urban growth, and state and local finance. PPIC was created because three concerned citizens â€“ William R. Hewlett, Roger W.

Though the guru forgave him publicly, two of his followers attacked Halley a week later and fractured his skull.By 1975, Fifth Estate was lingering onâ€”many staff had burnt out through too much activism and they had their share of internal disputes. The debts were mounting. In August 1975, Vol. 11, No.1 declared [...] "The issue you are now holding is the last issue of the Fifth Estate - the last issue of a failing capitalist enterpriseâ€¦This is also the first issue of a new Fifth Estate." [...] This was the first explicitly anti-authoritarian issue of Fifth Estate.

The principal of a school has an acthe and {{important role to play}} in this regard. This study will subsequently focus on the different categories or various types of teachers found in the primary school, because each and every member of the personnel is equally involved in in-service {{training and}} the development of the staff programme. A brief look is taken at the influence the curr'iculum,the pupils and the community have on the teacher regarding his or her in-service training. Evaluation of the teachers remains one of the principal's main tasks. The different types of school climates will also be studied, since the nature of the climate of a school to a great extent detel'lllines the effectiveness of the education offered there. If a healthy climate is created, greater productivity will ensue, which in its tum will result in better-equipped and well-adjusted teachers, frolll whose teachings the pupils will benefit greatly. Attention is also paid to the matter of class visits, one of the most general and obvious forms of in-service training. Class visits provide the principal with the opportunity to keep his finger on the pulse of the whole organisation. the five facets comprising the class visit will also be discussed at length, as each of these facets is of great importance to the realisatfon of in-servfce training. For this purpose, formal as well as informal class visits will be dealt with. The important part played by communicatfon is explained and stressed, especially in respect of the primary school. A facet of communication, namely the delegation of tasks, will also be looked into, because of its relevance for the teacher's in-service training. While executfng some of the tasks which the principal cannot possibly find time for, every teacher is being trained and prepared for promotfon. The professfonal growth of teachers has also become a focal point where trainfng for managerial positions is concerned. The deputy headmasters are dependent on guidance by the headmaster. Principals have the responsibility of discreetly and meaningfully stimulating the deputy {{as well as the other}} teachers on the staff. The principal who is sincerely concerned with the professional development of his staff contributes successfully towards an in-service guidance programme by including class visits. various types of <b>staff</b> meetings and <b>delegation</b> in his programme â€¢ Attention will be given to ways and means by which the principal can apply each of these skill s in order to purposefully stimulate the professional development of his staff. To enable the principal to give meaningful help and guidance in these matters. he should ensure that an open climate prevails at his school. The principal should also have a clear understanding of what can reasonably be expected of a new. as well as an experienced teacher. and he must also clearly formulate his own responsibilities in the training of both. In-service training of the working teacher should naturally be a continuous process. The principal is responsible for the professional growth of his staff and the quality of teaching at his school. He plays an an-important role in the professional development of the teachers on his staff. Continued research pertaining to the training of principals is therefore absolutely essential...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 10 University of Washington Abstract Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in the Patient Centered Medical Home: Assessing {{utilization}} {{patterns and}} identifying key medical home elements Ian A. Randall Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Christopher Johnson, PhD The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) started implementing a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) modelâ€”named Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) â€”across {{the nation in}} 2010. The PACT initiative focused on seven foundational principles: 1) creating patient-driven services, 2) offering team-based care, 3) increasing care efficiency, 4) providing comprehensive care including access to specialists, 5) developing longitudinal patient relationships, 6) improving communication, and 7) developing coordinate care. Key features of the PACT model hold promise to improve primary care and reduce avoidable utilization of resource-intensive services for vulnerable and high-need patient subpopulations. At the VHA, one such group is Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a condition with high prevalence among Veterans {{that is associated with}} combat trauma. To date, we are unaware of existing research that provides a comprehensive assessment of the effect of PTSD on utilization patterns across a range of utilization outcomes, utilizes a control group, or explores individual associations between PACT elements and utilization outcomes. This dissertation research seeks to address these knowledge gaps by addressing the following research questions: 1) What is the association between whether a Veteran with PTSD received care in the pre- or post-PACT period, and the quarterly utilization rates for key health services? 2) What is the effect of receiving care in a high-PACT implementation clinic on utilization patterns, compared to receiving care in a low-PACT implementation clinic? 3) What is the association between PACT elements and clinic-level utilization rates for hospitalizations and ED encounters for all eight PACT elements developed in the PI 2 : 1) Access, 2) Continuity, 3) Care Coordination, 4) Comprehensiveness, 5) Self-Management Support, 6) Patient-Centered Care and Communication, 7) Shared Decision Making, and 8) <b>Delegation,</b> <b>Staffing</b> and Team Functioning. Results from Chapter 2 indicate that Veterans receiving care in the post-PACT period experienced significantly lower utilization rates of hospitalizations and specialty care, and higher primary care rates. Results from Chapter 3 research indicate that Veterans that received care in VHA clinics with high levels of PACT implementation experienced decreased utilization rates for hospitalizations, specialty mental health, urgent care and emergency department (ED) utilization, compared to a low-level of PACT implementation. We did not find an increase in primary care rates in Chapter 3, and effect sizes for changes in utilization and mental health visits were modest. In Chapter 4, we found that high levels of Access, Comprehensive Care and Self-Management Support were associated with significantly lower ED utilization rates. We did not find any significant associations between PACT elements and hospitalization rates. This dissertation research provides ample evidence that PACT is driving changes in utilization patterns and reducing downstream utilization of resource-intensive health services. There is also some evidence that PACT is intensifying primary care, or potentially improving primary care, which is causing the subsequent decline in hospitalizations, and specialty, urgent and emergent care. Finally, this research sheds light on three PACT elements that were associated with decreases in ED utilization [...] Access, Comprehensive Care and Self-Management Supportâ€”offering evidence to health systems and policymakers about high-impact interventions within the PCMH model...|$|R
