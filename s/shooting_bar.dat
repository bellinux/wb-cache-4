50|$|On 5 April 2007, White House {{officials}} announced a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposal to <b>shoot</b> <b>barred</b> owls {{to reduce the}} threat they pose to the spotted owl. It called for delineating 18 sites {{within the range of}} the spotted owl where 12-32 barred owls would be taken per site for 5 to 10 years. Approximately 2150 to 2850 barred owls would be killed for a 3- to 5-year study, and 4650 Barred Owls would be killed for a 10-year study If the precedent-setting removal study is implemented, it would, during its first year, result in the death of 36 times more raptors than in all other conservation-based projects combined in the United States and its territories, and 84 times more raptors than in the largest ongoing effort worldwide, at a cost of $1 million annually; simplifying the cost to dollars per barred owl killed approximates $700 per barred owl for the first year and $2800 per barred owl for each subsequent year. Many environmentalists fear increased blame on barred owls for declining spotted owl numbers will result in less attention being paid to territorial protection and resumption of logging in protected spotted owl habitat.|$|R

In the scene McTeague is {{too embarrassed to}} examine the teeth {{of a young woman}} and Potter has to take over.

50|$|In 2004 Courtney led a {{team that}} {{summarized}} all scientific information regarding the northern spotted owl. This scientific synthesis altered {{the tenor of the}} debate over this iconic species, contributing to a recognition that fire and invasion by the barred owl were just as important threats as timber harvest. This scientific panel recommended the development of the first Recovery Plan to be finalized for the species. However the federal planning process was marred with controversy and accusations of political interference, leading to Courtneys recall to provide transparent and independent scientific evaluations. Ultimately the panel recommended significant changes, which led to a final Recovery Plan, and the current conservation strategy which distinguishes between fire-prone east-side forests and moister west-side forests. The <b>shooting</b> of <b>barred</b> owls to save spotted owls remains controversial.|$|R

5000|$|Clyde {{did indeed}} hear it—and he and Jones {{unleashed}} a mighty torrent of fire, joined almost immediately by Buck, all three <b>shooting</b> their <b>BARs</b> {{right through the}} windows and doors of the cabins. Coffey's nineteen-year-old son Clarence was watching from behind and later said his father [...] "was pushed back like {{he was hit by}} a high-pressure hose." [...] The boilerplate shield stood up to actual penetration, but the BARs' impact was literally staggering to the sturdily-built sheriff. The flying glass and wood chip debris abraded the officers, but they were able to fall back, miraculously without being hit by any outlaw gunfire. They returned the fire, but even their substantial, [...]45-caliber Thompson [...] "sub-guns" [...] were no match for the bandits' thundering Browning output: one BAR slug exiting the cabin penetrated the rear wall of the kitchen in the Tavern, passed through both walls of a stove and wound up lodged in Coffey, Jr's arm; others penetrated Tavern walls {{at both ends of the}} place, and several ricocheted off the pavement of the Slim's Castle parking lot.
