We aim to calibrate the Scheimpflug camera using a roughly hand positioned calibration pattern with bundle adjustment technique. The assumptions used by classical calibration methodologies are not valid anymore for cameras undergoing <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition.</b> Therefore, we slightly modify pin-hole model to estimate the Scheimpflug angles. The results are tested on real data sets captured from cameras limited by various industrial constraints, and {{in the presence of}} large distortions...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} producing fingerprints by {{total internal reflection}} using a right-angle prism does not give true size images. In this case an anamorphic real image is formed by the <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition</b> with keystone distortion. A method of combining a single prism with the right-angle prism for anamorphic stretching to get the correct fingerprint image is described. The method of constructing such a type of an optical system is discussed in detail. The method is useful to directly obtain the correct fingerprints using a CCD camera...|$|E

The sample is imaged on a CCD sensor by a telecentric imaging system and its tilt is monitored by an optical autocollimator. The sample, the telecentric imaging system and the CCD sensor satisfy the <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition.</b> In measurement, the light extinction measurement method and the four quadrants average method are used to improve the accuracy.

40|$|An all {{electronic}} 3 -D Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) {{system has}} been developed for use in high velocity (supersonic) flows. Two high resolution CCD cameras mounted in a stereo viewing configuration are {{used to determine the}} out-of-plane velocity component from the difference of the in-plane velocity measurements. Double exposure image frames are acquired and Fuzzy inference techniques are used to maximize the validity of the velocity estimates obtained from the auto-correlation analysis. The CCD cameras are tilted relative to their respective lens axes to satisfy <b>Scheimpflug's</b> <b>condition.</b> Tilting the camera film plane ensures that the entire image plane is in focus. Perspective distortion still results, but can be corrected by proper calibration of the optical system. A calibration fixture is used to determine the experimental setup parameters and to assess the accuracy to which the z-plane displacements can be estimated. The details of the calibration fixture and procedure are discussed in the text. A pair of pulsed Nd:YAG lasers operating at 532 nm are used to illuminate the seeded flow from a convergent nozzle operated in an underexpanded condition. The light sheet was oriented perpendicular to the nozzle flow, yielding planar cross-sections of the 3 -component velocity field at several axial stations. The key features of the supersonic jet are readily observed in the cross-plane vector plots...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present work is to correct errors {{occurring}} in a stereoscopic PIV system and caused by misalignments between the calibration plane and the measurement plane. The experimental measurements have been conducted using an angular stereoscopic system with <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>conditions</b> and a PIV-calibration pattern has been mounted on stages which can translate in three dimensions and rotate around the vertical axis. In order to correct the errors in perspective, a calibration of the cameras has been done by setting the PIV-calibration pattern in different z-positions and utilizing different mapping functions of the physical plane coordinates (x, y, z); afterwards, a cross-correlation of the images recorded by the two cameras at the same instant has been used to calculate the disparity map and to obtain the equation of the measurement plane, i. e. an estimated value of the misalignment; finally, a reconstruction of the three-dimensional displacement field has been made: in this reconstruction the image has been de-warped inside the iterative deformation PIV process, {{in order to reduce the}} loss of image quality. A displacement field has been simulated to show the efficiency of the correction of misalignment errors. A correction of the formulae generally used in literature to estimate the viewing angles permits to obtain better results even for out of plane displacements. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{transverse}} profile imager for ultrabright electron beams is presented, which overcomes resolution issues in present designs by observing the <b>Scheimpflug</b> imaging <b>condition</b> {{as well as}} the Snell-Descartes law of refraction in the scintillating crystal. Coherent optical transition radiation emitted by highly compressed electron bunches {{on the surface of the}} crystal is directed away from the camera, allowing to use the monitor for profile measurements of electron bunches suitable for X-ray free electron lasers. The optical design has been verified by ray tracing simulations, and the angular dependency of the resolution has been verified experimentally. An instrument according to the presented design principles has been used in the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility, and different scintillator materials have been tested. Measurements in conjunction with a transverse deflecting radiofrequency structure and an array of quadrupole magnets demonstrate a normalized slice emittance of 25  nm in the core of a 30  fC electron beam at a pulse length of 10  ps and a particle energy of 230  MeV...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{fields for}} a sphere sedimenting through a Newtonian and two non-Newtonian liquids near {{a wall in}} a square tank are {{investigated}} using 3 -D stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) and line integral convolution (LIC) methods. The PIV data were taken using an angular stereoscopic configuration with tilt and shift arrangements for the <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition</b> {{and a pair of}} liquid correction prisms. Data were recorded from planes perpendicular and parallel to the wall for each fluid case over a range of distances from the wall. The PIV and LIC results highlight significant differences in the wake structure for all three cases.

The atmospheric backscattering echo of a high-power continuous-wave laser diode is received by a Newtonian telescope and recorded by a tilted imaging sensor satisfying the <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition.</b> The principles {{as well as the}} lidar equation are discussed in details. A Scheimpflug lidar system operating at around 808 nm is developed and employed for continuous atmospheric aerosol monitoring at daytime.

40|$|This work {{proves the}} {{feasibility}} of a novel concept of differential absorption lidar based on the Scheimpflug principle. The range-resolved atmospheric backscattering signal of a laser beam is retrieved by employing a tilted linear sensor with a Newtonian telescope, satisfying the <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition.</b> Infinite focus depth is achieved despite employing a large optical aperture. The concept is demonstrated by measuring the range-resolved atmospheric oxygen concentration with a tunable continuous-wave narrow-band laser diode emitting around 761 nm over a path of one kilometer during night time. Laser power requirements for daytime operation are also investigated and validated with single-band atmospheric aerosol measurements by employing a broad-band 3. 2 -W laser diode. The results presented in this work show the potential of employing the continuous-wave differential absorption lidar (CW-DIAL) technique for remote profiling of atmospheric gases in daytime if high-power [GRAPHICS] narrow-band continuous-wave light sources were to be employed...|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} 3 D {{laser scanning}} {{system has been}} designed and built for robot vision. By tilting the charge coupled device (CCD) plane of portable 3 D scanning system according to the <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition,</b> the depth-of-view is successfully extended from less than 40 to 100 mm. Based on the tilted camera model, the traditional two-step camera calibration method is modified by introducing the angle factor. Meanwhile, a novel segmental calibration approach, i. e., dividing the whole work range into two parts and calibrating, respectively, with corresponding system parameters, is proposed to effectively improve the measurement accuracy of the large depth-of-view 3 D laser scanner. In the process of 3 D reconstruction, different calibration parameters are used to transform the 2 D coordinates into 3 D coordinates according to the different positions of the image in the CCD plane, and the measurement accuracy of 60 mu m is obtained experimentally. Finally, the experiment of scanning a lamina by the large depth-of-view portable 3 D laser scanner used by an industrial robot IRB 4400 is also employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and high measurement accuracy of our scanning system.

40|$|All-reflective imaging {{systems that}} are {{asymmetrical}} and eccentric {{have the advantage of}} providing more degrees of freedom to improve image quality. A disadvantage of these asymmetrical imaging systems is that they suffer from asymmetric mapping. This asymmetric mapping manifests itself mainly in the presence of keystone distortion and anamorphism. Due to the increase in degrees of freedom, the complexity of such systems escalates; thus, the designer is confronted with the difficult task of determining optimal starting points. This work addresses several first-order aspects of the design and characterisation of asymmetrical, all-reflective, aspherical, eccentric imaging systems. In contrast to the work of Stone and Forbes, which is based upon the theory of Hamiltonian optics and includes both the first- and second-order considerations, this work is based upon the theory of collineation. Because of the inherent simplicity of the collinear mapping, which is a projective transformation, we are able to present a simple but certainly not naive way of designing and characterising such asymmetrical all-reflective imaging systems. The simplicity of this proposition has the advantage that we can gain insights into asymmetrical mapping behaviour. Specifically, we apply the collinear mapping model on all-reflective asymmetrical imaging systems resulting in the description of how the mapping between conjugate planes may be described. First we will define keystone distortion and anamorphism. Then we will introduce and investigate the significance of the Cardinal points and planes, the <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition</b> and the horizon planes and show how they are applied in the designing of imaging {{systems that are}} free of both keystone distortion and anamorphism. Having established a first-order layout of the optical system, we will then develop a process for converting the first-order layouts into imaging systems consisting of real aspheric surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPanoramic {{photography}} is quite old, but {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in the field of}} aerial photography. Due to increased efficiency of aircraft warning facilities and accuracy of anti-aircraft missles the problem of obtaining photographs for aerial reconnaissance and mapping and charting becomes extremely hazardous. The obvious solution is to fly higher and further away and to take oblique photographs. This doesn't seem to be difficult, at first glance, but the object to camera distance becomes extremely long, thereby reducing the scale of the photograph. Decreasing the scale of a photograph decreases its usability. The only way to keep a proper scale then, is to increase the focal length. Increasing the focal length increases the format size and the overall camera dimensions, and more important weight. Weight and size are at a premium in an aircraft and to combat this a folded optical system is coupled to a slit scan device which utilizes moving film. This reduces weight and size, but introduces other technical problems, which are presently being solved by the U. S. Air Force. Assuming that the panoramic camera is built and is operational suitable. A method of rectification must be devised in order to effectively utilize the photography. Three methods of rectification are discussed. First, a pancratic lens coupled to a slit scanning device. Second, a mechanical rectifier, utilizing moving film and paper. Third, a mathematical Solution. The pancratic lens-slit scan system tends to recreate the conditions in existence at the time of exposure. The <b>Scheimpflug</b> <b>condition</b> is neglected by selecting a slit width so small that the image remains within the focal range. During the exposure the images were in perfect focus from nadir to horizon, as the distances involved are considered to be infinity. But in rectifier the object to image distance varies from 4 feet at the nadir to 6 feet at 0 = 60 °. Therefore a lens system had to be designed to keep proper focus for all object to image distances and the proper magnification, (to insure the correct scale). These two variables are a function of the angle of scan (0). The basic design for this pancratic lens starts with selecting 2 lenses of 22 inch focal length and computing the movements necessary to accomplish the required magnifications and focal distances. It was found that this could be easily accomplished, but the final lens system would have to be designed by a competent lens designer and would be much more complicated, due to a aberration corrections. For proper illumination the filament of the light source has to move as a function of 0 in order to keep imaged onto the aperture. The effective f/no very nicely stayed approximately the same, 14. 75 to 17. 25, throughout all the lens movements. For overall illumination the speed of the scan has to vary to compensate for loss due to the inverse square law, due to tilting of the image plane, and due to increased density of negative toward the horizon. The second system, the mechanical system, consists of either a pancratic or a fixed lens system, with the negative moving past a slit and the image being projected down on a table onto moving paper. The moving parts that have to be calibrated are: the negative, printing paper, light source filament, 1 st projection lens, 2 nd projection lens, rotation of lens system, image to object distance, and tilt of easel. Most of these relationships are easy to compute and control, but the paper speed when determined will be difficult to control. As has been observed in the field, continuous printing devices do not operate efficiently in operational organizations. The third system, the mathematical solution, uses surfaces which were derived by trial and error after extensive mathematical research. This system can be proved, mathematically, not to be perfect. In fact the distortion has not been reduced less than 14 per cent. This is too much for reconnaissance and charting purposes. In view of the limitations of the various rectifiers it is felt that the pancratic lens-slit scan system would be the most practical rectifier for field use. If accepted for field use this pancratic lens system could eventually replace the current tri-metrago method of charting. The panoramic rectification system would eliminate many operations and specialized techniques and save money by reducing man-power requirements per chart...|$|E
