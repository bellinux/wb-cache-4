Differences of the checkpoint system in normal cells versus tumor cells might provide a new opportunity in cancer drug development; therefore, efforts to identify the <b>spindle</b> checkpoint <b>inhibitors</b> have been fostered.

40|$|We {{are testing}} the {{hypothesis}} that migration of the newly formed mouth (i. e., oral membranellar band) in stentor is homologous to mitotic chromosomal movement and that both types of movement within single cells depend directly on microtubule elongation. The following compounds synchronously delay the migration of the oral membranellar band as an exponential function of concentration: Colcemid, podophyllotoxin, β-peltatin and vinblastine. Delay for these compounds can be described by the equation, y = kxn, where y is delay in hours and x is concentration of mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitor</b> in moles/l. We discovered that the animal pineal gland hormone, melatonin (5 -methoxy n-acetyl tryptamine), also specifically and reproducibly delays oral band regeneration according to an equation of this form.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Stentors {{treated with}} toxic {{substances}} can be induced to shed their oral bands (19, Fig. 1), complex structures composed of many cilia organized into membranelles. Regenerating membranellar bands {{were observed in}} control stentors removed from toxic (urea-containing) medium at about 3. 5 hours. At 8 hours regenerated control organisms were indistinguishable from normal unshed stentors. Experimental animals replaced into colchicine medium were inhibited from regeneration at low, nontoxic concentrations of this mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Upon removal of the colchicine and replacement of the shed animals into normal medium or normal medium to which GTP had been added, complete and normal regeneration of the membranellar band ensued. Our observations are consistent with many suggesting that colchicine acts by reversibly binding with a protein during processes involving microtubule formation. Colchicine inhibition of membranellar band formation further indicates that oral membranelles are specialized evolutionary homologs to other centriole (= basal body, = kinetosome) derivatives such as mitotic spindle fibers, cilia and flagella, axopods, etc. (structures containing the ubiquitous microtubules of eukaryotic cells) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{colchicine}} upon glucose induced insulin release by the isolated perfused rat pancreas was examined {{in order to}} characterize {{the participation of the}} β cell microtubular apparatus in the biphasic insulin secretory response to glucose. After a short pretreatment (25 min) with a low colchicine concentration (2 x 10 - 5 M), both the early and late phases of glucose induced insulin secretion were markedly enhanced. As either the concentration of colchicine or the length of the pretreatment period with this mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitor</b> were increased, the facilitating effect faded out and partial inhibition of insulin release was observed. However, colchicine, even at high concentration, markedly enhanced the residual early release of insulin evoked by glucose in the presence of diazoxide (0. 05 mg/ml). These findings suggest that a fraction of the early phase of insulin secretion completely escapes from the inhibitory effect of colchicine and may correspond, therefore, to a modality of hormonal release which does not involve the oriented intracellular translocation of secretory granules; and extensive disruption of the microtubular apparatus is associated with inhibition of insulin release, especially during the late phase of the secretory response to glucose.

40|$|AbstractPolyploidization {{occurs during}} normal {{development}} {{as well as}} during tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated if the responses to genotoxic stress in cancer cells {{are influenced by the}} ploidy. Prolonged treatment of Hep 3 B cells with the <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitor</b> nocodazole resulted in mitotic slippage, followed by re-replication of the DNA to produce polyploids. Reintroduction of p 53 restored the checkpoints and suppressed polyploidization. Remarkably, a stable tetraploidy cell line could be generated from Hep 3 B by a transient nocodazole treatment followed by a period of recovery. Using this novel tetraploid system, we found that tetraploidization increased the cell volume without significantly affecting the cell cycle. Although tetraploidization was accompanied by an increase in centrosome number, the majority of mitoses in the tetraploid cells remained bipolar. Polyploidization sensitized cells to genotoxic stress inflicted by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors without affecting the sensitivity to spindle inhibitors. Accordingly, more gamma-H 2 AX foci were induced by radiation in tetraploids than in normal Hep 3 B cells. Likewise, primary tetraploid human fibroblasts displayed higher gamma-H 2 AX foci formation than diploid human fibroblasts. An implication for chemotherapy is that some cancer cells can be sensitized to genotoxic agents by a preceding step that induces polyploidization...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of roses with resistance to {{black spot disease}} and doubling the genome of diploid roses to facilitate hybridization with tetraploid cultivars are both important in rose breeding and were investigated in this thesis. Thirty five rose species and cultivars were challenged with four pathotypes of Diplocarpon rosae, the causal agent of black spot disease in roses. Patterns of resistance and susceptibility in leaf disc assays identified novel sources of genetic resistance and indicated crosses that might give insight into the inheritance of black spot disease resistance. Only roses from the section Cinnamomeae, or with Cinnamomeae ancestry, were susceptible to pathotype DA 2, suggesting a relationship between resistance to black spot disease and the phylogeny of the sub-genus Eurosa. The possibility that the pathosystem involving pathotype DA 2 {{differs from that of}} the other three pathotypes, DAl, ZM 1 and CW 1, is discussed. Hybrids between a resistant and a susceptible variety of Rosa rugosa proved susceptible, indicating that the resistance was not inherited as a single dominant gene in this case.

40|$|Breast cancer {{patients}} with tumors lacking the three diagnosticmarkers (ER, PR, andHER 2) {{are classified as}} triple-negative (primarily basal-like) and have poor prognosis {{because there is no}} disease-specific therapy available. To address this unmet medical need, gene expression analyses using more than a thousand breast cancer samples were conducted, which identified elevated centromere protein E (CENP-E) expression in the basal-a molecular subtype relative to other subtypes. CENP-E, a mitotic kinesin component of the spindle assembly checkpoint, is shown to be induced in basal-a tumor cell lines by the mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitor</b> drug docetaxel. CENP-E knockdown by inducible shRNA reduces basal-a breast cancer cell viability. A potent, selective CENP-E inhibitor (PF- 2771) was used to define the contribution of CENP-E motor function to basal-like breast cancer. Mechanistic evaluation of PF- 2771 in basal-a tumor cells links CENP-E–dependent molecular events (e. g., phosphorylation of histone H 3 Ser- 10; phospho-HH 3 -Ser 10) to functional outcomes (e. g., chromosomal congression defects). Across a diverse panel of breast cell lines, CENP-E inhibition by PF- 2771 selectively inhibits proliferation of basal breast cancer cell lines relative to premalignant ones and its response correlates with the degree of chromosomal instability. Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic efficacy analysis in a basal-a xenograft tumor model shows that PF- 2771 exposure is well correlated with increased phospho-HH 3 -Ser 10 levels and tumor growth regression. Complete tumor regression is observed in a patient-derived, basal-a breast cancer xenograft tumormodel treatedwith PF- 2771. Tumor regression is also observed with PF- 2771 in a taxane-resistant basal-a model. Taken together, CENP-E may be an effective therapeutic target for patients with triple-negative/basal-a breast cancer. Mol Cancer Ther; 13 (8); 2104 – 15. 2014 AACR...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{separation of}} macromolecular syntheses from protein assembly into microtubular structures has permitted {{the use of}} the Stentor ciliated oral membranellar band regenerating system as an assay for mitotic <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (Banerjee 2 ̆ 6 Margulis, 1971). Melatonin, the pineal gland hormone, is additive to Colcemid in this assay; like Colcemid it specifically inhibits band migration as a sensitive function of developmental stage and concentration. Altho the entire process of band formation and cilia regeneration (stages 0 – 8) is inhibited by melatonin, stage 3 is especially sensitive. Delay in morphogenesis at stage 3 can be measured as a precise function of inhibitors (Colcemid, podophyllotoxin, melatonin) of the form y=kxn, where y is delay in hours and k is the concentration of inhibitor in moles. Riboflavin (0. 2 μM) and nicotinamide (0. 2 μM) in combination reversed Colcemid-induced delay in band regeneration, but (unlike melatonin) the vitamins alone were totally without effect on the regenerating system. Therefore melatonin probably interacts with microtubule protein whereas the B vitamins interact in some way with Colcemid to nullify its activity...|$|R

40|$|Kinesins {{from the}} bipolar (Kinesin- 5) family are conserved in {{eukaryotic}} organisms and play critical roles during the earliest stages of mitosis to mediate spindle pole body separation and {{formation of a}} bipolar mitotic spindle. To date, genes encoding bipolar kinesins {{have been reported to}} be essential in all organisms studied. We report the characterization of CaKip 1 p, the sole member of this family in the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. C. albicans Kip 1 p appears to localize to the mitotic spindle and loss of CaKip 1 p function interferes with normal progression through mitosis. Inducible excision of CaKIP 1 revealed phenotypes unique to C. albicans, including viable homozygous Cakip 1 mutants and an aberrant spindle morphology in which multiple spindle poles accumulate in close proximity to each other. Expression of the C. albicans Kip 1 motor domain in Escherichia coli produced a protein with microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity that was inhibited by an aminobenzothiazole (ABT) compound in an ATP-competitive fashion. This inhibition results in ‘rigor-like’, tight association with microtubules in vitro. Upon treatment of C. albicans cells with the ABT compound, cells were killed, and terminal phenotype analysis revealed an aberrant spindle morphology similar to that induced by loss of the CaKIP 1 gene. The ABT compound discovered is the first example of a fungal <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitor</b> targeted to a mitotic kinesin. Our results also show that the non-essential nature and implementation of the bipolar motor in C. albicans differs from that seen in other organisms, and suggest that inhibitors of a non-essential mitotic kinesin may offer promise as cidal agents for antifungal drug discovery...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{instability}} is {{a characteristic}} of most cancers and it refers to an increased tendency of alterations in the genome during {{the life cycle of}} cells. The fidelity of DNA replication is highly ensured by different checkpoints; the activation of spindle checkpoints prevents cells from premature entry into mitosis, avoiding incorrect chromosome segregation and aneuploidy, a typical feature of many cancers. Mitostatin, a novel protein, endowed with tumor suppressor activity, has been reported to bind centrosomal proteins Odf 2 and ninein, and its depletion causes an alteration of the anchorage of microtubules to the centrosome. Since functional defects of centrosomes are associated to mitotic failure, Mitostatin may have a key role in guarding the fidelity of mitosis in cells. Here we show that the depletion of Mitostatin in cancer cells, synchronized by aphidicolin (G 1 /S) block and released into nocodazole-containing medium, leads to mitotic slippage and adaptation to the spindle checkpoint (SAC) {{in the presence of a}} <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Concomitantly, Mitostatin depletion promotes the early degradation of Mad 2 and cyclin B 1. Since the activated spindle checkpoint delays cell exit from mitosis by preventing cyclin B 1 proteolysis, the cyclin B 1 early degradation leads to mitotic checkpoint escape and resulting chromosome instability. In this study, we report for the first time that the depletion of Mitostatin induces an increase of numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations compared to control cells. These aberrations include aneuploidy, the formation of triradials and broken chromosomes. Taken together, our observations suggest that Mitostatin plays a critical role in guarding the fidelity of mitosis, enabling the optimal activation of the spindle checkpoint (SAC). Thus, low levels of Mitostatin found in certain human tumors may contribute to cellular transformation by promoting genomic instability...|$|E
40|$|The E 6 and E 7 {{genes of}} the high-risk human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) types encode oncoproteins, and both act by {{interfering with the}} activity of cellular tumor suppressor proteins. E 7 proteins act by associating {{with members of the}} retinoblastoma family, while E 6 increases the turnover of p 53. p 53 has been implicated as a regulator of both the G 1 /S cell cycle checkpoint and the mitotic spindle checkpoint. When fibroblasts from p 53 knockout mice are treated with the <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitor</b> nocodazole, a rereplication of DNA occurs without transit through mitosis. We investigated whether E 6 or E 7 could induce a similar loss of mitotic checkpoint activity in human keratinocytes. Recombinant retroviruses expressing high-risk E 6 alone, E 7 alone, and E 6 in combination with E 7 were used to infect normal human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs). Established cell lines were treated with nocodazole, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry. Cells infected with high-risk E 6 were found to continue to replicate DNA and accumulated an octaploid (8 N) population. Surprisingly, expression of E 7 alone was also able to bypass this checkpoint. Cells expressing E 7 alone exhibited increased levels of p 53, while those expressing E 6 had significantly reduced levels. The p 53 present in the E 7 cells was active, as increased levels of p 21 were observed. This suggested that E 7 bypassed the mitotic checkpoint by a p 53 -independent mechanism. The levels of MDM 2, a cellular oncoprotein also implicated in control of the mitotic checkpoint, were significantly elevated in the E 7 cells compared to the normal HFKs. In E 6 -expressing cells, the levels of MDM 2 were undetectable. It is possible that abrogation of Rb function by E 7 or increased expression of MDM 2 contributes to the loss of mitotic spindle checkpoint control in the E 7 cells. These findings suggest mechanisms by which both HPV oncoproteins contribute to genomic instability at the mitotic checkpoint...|$|E

In the last decades, {{numerous}} evidences showed that polyploidization also involves in either an early step or a critical promoting factor in tumorigenesis. In this study, I investigated whether ploidy influences {{the response of}} cancer cells to genotoxic agents. Using a novel polyploid system, Hep 3 B-T cells, generated by prolonged nocodazole treatment of Hep 3 B cells followed by mitotic slippage and re-replication of the DNA, the genotoxicity of the new tetraploid cells was compared with its diploid counterpart. I found that tetraploidization increased the cell volume without affecting the cell cycle distribution and doubling time. In spite of the centrosome overduplication due to polyploidization, the majority of Hep 3 B-T cells underwent bipolar mitosis. Polyploidization sensitized cells to genotoxic agents inflicted by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors without affecting the sensitivity to <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Accordingly, I found that more gamma-H 2 AX foci, a molecular marker present on sites of DNA damage, were induced by radiation in Hep 3 B-T cells than in Hep 3 B cells.

These results raise an implication for chemotherapy of which some cancer cells may be sensitized to genotoxic agents by a preceding step that induces polyploidization...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} the p 53 oncosuppressor associates to centrosomes in mitosis and this association is disrupted by treatments with microtubule-depolymerizing agents. Here, we show that ATM, an upstream activator of p 53 after DNA damage, is essential for p 53 centrosomal localization and {{is required for the}} activation of the postmitotic checkpoint after spindle disruption. In mitosis, p 53 failed to associate with centrosomes in two ATM-deficient, ataxiatelangiectasia–derived cell lines. Wild-type ATM gene transfer reestablished the centrosomal localization of p 53 in these cells. Furthermore, wild-type p 53 protein, but not the p 53 -S 15 A mutant, not phosphorylatable by ATM, localized at centrosomes when expressed in p 53 -null K 562 cells. Finally, Ser 15 phosphorylation of endogenous p 53 was detected at centrosomes upon treatment with phosphatase inhibitors, suggesting that a p 53 dephosphorylation step at centrosome contributes to sustain the cell cycle program in cells with normal mitotic spindles. When dissociated from centrosomes by treatments with <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> p 53 remained phosphorylated at Ser 15. AT cells, which are unable to phosphorylate p 53, did not undergo postmitotic proliferation arrest after nocodazole block and release.

We report two antagonic non-random chromosome arrangements in untreated premeiotic cells: the parallel configuration with homologue chromosomes associated {{side by side}} in the metaphase plate and the antiparallel configuration having homologue chromosomes with antipolar distribution in the metaphase ring. The antiparallel aspect also appeared in colchicinized cells. The spatial chromosome arrangement in both configurations is groupal size-dependent and maintained through meiosis. We also describe, in untreated gonia cells, endomitosis followed by reductional mitosis which restores the diploid number. In B. jararaca males we observed that some gonad regions present changes in the meiotic mechanism. In this case, endoreduplicated cells segregate the diplochromosomes to opposite poles forming directly endoreduplicated second metaphases of meiosis with the suppression of first meiosis. By a successive division, these cells form nuclei with one set of chromosomes. Chromosome doubling in oogonia is known in hybrid species and in parthenogenetic salamanders and lizards. This species also presented chromosome rearrangements leading to aneuploidies in mitosis and meiosis. It is suggested that somatic pairing, endomitosis, meiotic alterations, and chromosomal aberrations can be correlated processes.

Of 31 compounds tested four gave rise only to an increase of XO exceptions, indicating the induction of chromosome loss. Six compounds, all known <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (cokchicine, organic mercury, leand, and tin compounds) gave rise to an increase both of XXY and XO or of only XXY. The effect by metalloorganic compounds of which methylmercury was studied particularly closely, folows a peculiar pattern. In females with structurally normal X chromosomes only an increase of XX gametes is obtained, while with X chromosomes heterozygous for long inversions only 0 gametes are increased. The data indicates that the effect ofthe metal compounds occurs at first meiosis and that the process is connected with a meiotic drive, giving rise to a preferential segregation of the two X chromosomes to the functioning pole. The increase only of 0 gametes with structurally heterozygous X chromosomes can tentatively be explained by a loss due to crosig over within the inversion. An increase {{of the effect of}} methyl mercury was obtained where the normal pairing of the X chromosomes was interfered with by means of autosomal inversions. Likewise a synergisdc increase of nondisjunction was obtained when a temperature chock of 10 °C was appled together with treatment with methylmercury.

Among 4401 3 -year survivors of a childhood cancer in eight French and British centres and 25 120 patients younger than 20 years old at first malignant neoplasm (FMN) extracted from the Nordic Cancer Registries, 16 patients developed a melanoma as a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). A cohort study of the French and British cohorts was performed. In a nested case-control study, the 16 patients who developed a melanoma as a SMN (cases) were matched with 3 - 5 controls in their respective cohort according to gender, age at the first cancer, the calendar year of occurrence of the first cancer and follow-up. Radiotherapy appeared to increase the risk of melanoma for local doses > 15 Gy, Odds Ratio (OR) = 13 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 0. 94 - 174). Regarding chemotherapy, we observed an increased OR for both alkylating agents and <b>spindle</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> OR 2. 7 (95 % CI: 0. 5 - 14). Children treated for a gonadal tumour as a FMN were found to be at a higher risk of melanoma, OR 8. 7 (95 % CI: 0. 9 - 86). The adjusted OR for the local radiation dose was 1. 07 (95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 15). In conclusion, radiotherapy may contribute to an increased risk of melanoma as a SMN, but only at very high doses of low linear energy transfer radiation. Common genetic origins between gonadal tumours and malignant melanomas are likely. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Finally, we show that mosaic embryos have full developmental potential, provided they contain sufficient euploid cells, a finding of significance {{for the assessment of}} embryo vitality in the clinic. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Treatment {{in medical}} {{oncology}} is gradually shifting {{from the use}} of nonspecific chemotherapeutic agents toward an era of novel targeted therapy in which drugs and their combinations target specific aspects of the biology of tumor cells. Multiple myeloma (MM) {{has become one of the}} best examples in this regard, reflected in the identification of new pathogenic mechanisms, together with the development of novel drugs that are being explored from the preclinical setting to the early phases of clinical development. We review the biological rationale for the use of the most important new agents for treating MM and summarize their clinical activity in an increasingly busy field. First, we discuss data from already approved and active agents (including second- and third-generation proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory agents and alkylators). Next, we focus on agents with novel mechanisms of action, such as monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), cell cycle-specific drugs, deacetylase inhibitors, agents acting on the unfolded protein response, signaling transduction pathway inhibitors and kinase inhibitors. Among this plethora of new agents or mechanisms, some are specially promising: anti-CD 38 MoAb, such as daratumumab, are the first antibodies with clinical activity as single agents in MM. Moreover, the kinesin <b>spindle</b> protein <b>inhibitor</b> Arry- 520 is effective in monotherapy as well as in combination with dexamethasone in heavily pretreated patients. Immunotherapy against MM is also being explored, and probably the most attractive example of this approach is the combination of the anti-CS 1 MoAb elotuzumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, which has produced exciting results in the relapsed/refractory setting.

40|$|Nek 6 and Nek 7 {{are members}} of the NIMA-related serine/threonine kinase family. Previous work showed that they {{contribute}} to mitotic progression downstream of another NIMA-related kinase, Nek 9, although the roles of these different kinases remain to be defined. Here, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the regulation and function of Nek 6 and Nek 7 in human cells. By generating specific antibodies, we show that both Nek 6 and Nek 7 are activated in mitosis and that interfering with their activity by either depletion or expression of reduced-activity mutants leads to mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, while completely inactive mutants and small interfering RNA-mediated depletion delay cells at metaphase with fragile mitotic spindles, hypomorphic mutants or RNA interference treatment combined with a <b>spindle</b> assembly checkpoint <b>inhibitor</b> delays cells at cytokinesis. Importantly, depletion of either Nek 6 or Nek 7 leads to defective mitotic progression, indicating that although highly similar, they are not redundant. Indeed, while both kinases localize to spindle poles, only Nek 6 obviously localizes to spindle microtubules in metaphase and anaphase and to the midbody during cytokinesis. Together, these data lead us to propose that Nek 6 and Nek 7 play independent roles not only in robust mitotic spindle formation but also potentially in cytokinesis. 1404...|$|R
40|$|Kinesin- 5 (also {{known as}} Eg 5, KSP and Kif 11) is {{required}} for assembly of a bipolar mitotic <b>spindle.</b> Small molecule <b>inhibitors</b> of Kinesin- 5, developed as potential anti-cancer drugs, arrest cell in mitosis and promote apoptosis of cancer cells. We performed a genome-wide siRNA screen for enhancers and suppressors of a Kinesin- 5 inhibitor in human cells to elucidate cellular responses, and thus identify factors that might predict drug sensitivity in cancers. Because the drug’s actions play out over several days, we developed an intermittent imaging screen. Live HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged histone H 2 B were imaged at 0, 24 and 48 hours after drug addition, and images were analyzed using open-source software that incorporates machine learning. This screen effectively identified siRNAs that caused increased mitotic arrest at low drug concentrations (enhancers), and vice versa (suppressors), and we report siRNAs that caused both effects. We then classified the effect of siRNAs for 15 genes where 3 or 4 out of 4 siRNA oligos tested were suppressors as assessed by time lapse imaging, and by testing for suppression of mitotic arrest in taxol and nocodazole. This identified 4 phenotypic classes of drug suppressors, which included known and novel genes. Our methodology should be applicable to other screens, and th...|$|R
40|$|A {{diverse group}} of proteins, the {{activities}} of which are precisely orchestrated during mitosis, have emerged as targets for cancer therapeutics; these include the Aurora kinases (AKs), Polo‐like kinases (PLKs), and the kinesin spindle protein (KSP). KSP {{is essential for the}} proper separation of spindle poles during mitosis. Agents that target KSP selectively act on cells undergoing cell division, which means that KSP inhibitors are mitosis‐specific drugs, and have demonstrated remarkable activities in vitro. However, a significant obstacle to the success of KSP inhibitors is that these compounds, with tremendous efficacy in vitro, have demonstrated little or even no antitumor activity in vivo. Accumulated data suggest that a combination of KSP inhibitors with various cytostatic drugs will result in a more powerful tumor‐killing effect than monotherapy. Combination therapies might predominate and represent the next frontier in the discovery research of KSP inhibitors as potential anticancer drugs. Few published studies have reviewed combination therapy using KSP inhibitors. Herein we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on KSP inhibitor monotherapy and therapeutic combinations. The current state and problems are also discussed. Two are better than one: Targeted therapies in the form of antibodies and small molecules have been studied in combination with kinesin <b>spindle</b> protein (KSP) <b>inhibitors</b> to enhance their efficacy against cancer in preclinical investigations. Accumulated data suggest that a combination of KSP inhibitors with various cytostatic drugs will result in a more powerful tumor‐killing effect than monotherapy. Combination therapies may predominate and represent the next frontier in discovery research for KSP inhibitors as potential anticancer drugs...|$|R
