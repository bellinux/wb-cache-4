500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T <b>slave</b> <b>unit,</b> looking more like a flat-bed truck, with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E

50|$|Several camera {{equipment}} manufacturers have support for remote flash triggering built into {{at least some}} of their camera and flash models. This eliminates the issue of slave flashes triggering upon seeing a pre-flash, as the master flash unit (whether a shoemount flash or the camera's pop-up flash) sends predefined signals to the <b>slave</b> <b>units</b> to control them. However, the user is restricted to using flash units from that camera manufacturer, or a limited selection of third-party units which are compatible with it.|$|R
5000|$|Fill flash or [...] "fill-in flash" [...] {{describes}} flash used {{to supplement}} ambient light {{in order to}} illuminate a subject close to the camera {{that would otherwise be}} in shade relative {{to the rest of the}} scene. The flash unit is set to expose the subject correctly at a given aperture, while shutter speed is calculated to correctly expose for the background or ambient light at that aperture setting. Secondary or <b>slave</b> flash <b>units</b> may be synchronized to the master unit to provide light from additional directions. The <b>slave</b> <b>units</b> are electrically triggered by the light from the master flash. Many small flashes and studio monolights have optical slaves built in. Wireless radio transmitters, such as PocketWizards, allow the receiver unit to be around a corner, or at a distance too far to trigger using an optical sync.|$|R

50|$|The {{implication}} of the energy <b>slave</b> <b>unit</b> is {{that each of the}} workers who did not walk were able to return to picking apples, and therefore increase their personal productivity. Doing the labor of 10 persons with 2.5 persons worth of work (10-7.5), the laborers with energy slaves can produce 10/2.5, or 4 times, as much work, in the same amount of time. Their personal wealth, and/or that of their employer, can be expected to increase; however, because of the huge energy investment behind the infrastructure, the margin of benefit for the employer and the workers must be less than 4 times the value of the work of the unassisted workers.|$|E

40|$|This thesis-project aims to {{research}} the possibilities of new wireless technologies in general control-situations. We have studied different existing control protocols, and developed a new protocol focusing on textbased menus. Our protocol is scaleable, easy to implement, and platform- and media independent. Since our protocol supports Plug and Play with dynamically allocated id’s, {{it does not require}} a unique id in the hardware. To test the protocol we have developed a prototype system, consisting of a mobile phone connected to a server, which in turn is connected to two <b>slave</b> <b>units,</b> controlling peripheral equipment on 220 Volt. The phone is an Ericsson T 28, equipped with a Bluetooth unit. The server is runningthe real-time OS eCos on an ARM 7 TDMI Evaluation Kit, and the <b>slave</b> <b>units</b> consist of two developer boards equipped with PIC-processors. Communication between the phone and the server is done over Bluetooth. However we did not find a working Bluetooth protocol stack ported to eCos, so a serial cable was used instead. Communication between the server and the slaves is done over a RS- 485 serial network which simulates the traffic over a radio-network. The results show that our protocol is working, and that our system would be easy to implement, cheap to produce and very scalable...|$|R

5000|$|The British Rail Class 13 was {{a type of}} {{diesel-electric}} shunting locomotive. The type {{was designed}} in 1965 {{because of the need}} to provide more powerful shunters for the Tinsley Marshalling Yard. Because of Tinsley's status as a hump yard, {{it was not possible to}} use a single locomotive owing to the risk of grounding. So, to achieve the required power, a pair of [...] shunters were permanently coupled in 'master and slave' formation, with the <b>slave</b> <b>unit</b> having had its cab removed. Both units were then ballasted to improve traction. Initially coupled cab-to-cab, it was found more practical to couple master nose to slave cab.|$|E
5000|$|Where the {{computing}} {{systems are}} duplicated, but both actively process each step, {{it is difficult}} to arbitrate between them if their outputs differ {{at the end of a}} step. For this reason, it is common practice to run DMR systems as [...] "master/slave" [...] configurations with the slave as a [...] "hot-standby" [...] to the master, rather than in lockstep. Since there is no advantage in having the <b>slave</b> <b>unit</b> actively process each step, a common method of working is for the master to copy its state at the end of each step's processing to the slave. Should the master fail at some point, the slave is ready to continue from the previous known good step.|$|E
