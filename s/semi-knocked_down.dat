50|$|Ford Australia {{introduced}} the Pilot onto the Australian market in 1949, importing {{the model in}} both fully assembled and <b>semi-knocked</b> <b>down</b> form. Initially dearer than the Canada-sourced Ford Custom V8, its price was gradually reduced in relative terms until it was cheaper than the Custom. A coupe utility variant was also produced.|$|E
50|$|General Motors also {{operated}} the GM Avto factory, located in Saint Petersburg and opened in 2008. It was upgraded in 2012 and {{has produced the}} Opel Antara and Chevrolet Captiva SUVs, the Chevrolet Cruze from late 2009, and the Trailblazer from <b>semi-knocked</b> <b>down</b> kits. It ceased production in July 2015, before Chevrolet's exit from the Russian market {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E

25|$|In Russia, it was {{produced}} by the Kaliningrad-based company Avtotor, since 2005, using <b>semi-knock</b> <b>down</b> technology. It {{was removed from the}} range at the beginning of 2012, when the new generation of the Aveo was introduced on the market.|$|R
5000|$|The first Fukang {{appeared}} in 1992 as a <b>semi-knock</b> <b>down</b> production, rebadged Citroën ZX hatchback. The car {{was called the}} Fukang DC7140 in China, the name translating as ‘Prosperity and Health’ in Chinese. Later on, the DC7160 with a fuel-injected 1.6 liter engine {{was added to the}} lineup. 17,000 of the SKD ZXs were built until late 1996, when Dongfeng's own two plants in Wuhan province became up to speed and local production commenced. Local capacity was 150,000 per annum.|$|R
50|$|In November 1926, the Ford Motor Company of Malaya Ltd. (Ford Malaya) was {{incorporated}} in Singapore, {{and the company}} set up a small garage in a two-storey shop house on Anson Road. The garage carried out wheel-fitting and touching up for Model T units between 1926 and 1929. In January 1930, Ford Malaya moved operations to a warehouse in Prince Edward Road, where they carried out more sophisticated <b>semi-knock</b> <b>down</b> (SKD) assembly. The new plant assembled SKD kits which were imported from Ford Canada and Ford England. Ford's market share in British Malaya peaked at 80% in 1939.|$|R
50|$|Besides the Volkswagen {{production}} base in Germany, this generation {{was produced in}} a number of other countries, including Brazil, China, Nigeria, Mexico, South Africa, USA, and the former Yugoslavia. The Mark 2 Jetta went on to become the first Volkswagen model produced in China by Volkswagen Group China's second joint venture partner FAW-Volkswagen. Production began on 5 December 1991. Initially sold as complete knock down (CKD) kits, local manufacturing has gradually taken over in the form of <b>Semi-Knocked</b> <b>Down</b> kits in 1992, and full local production in 1995.|$|E
50|$|NV Spemotri was BMW's main {{importer}} of motorcycles {{during the}} 1950s; they mainly {{brought in the}} two-cylinder R25, R26, and R27. A handful of BMW 700s were imported to Indonesia by NV Spemotri in the early 1960s; the Salim Group held the import rights until they sold the tiny concession to the Astra Group in the late 1970s. The first BMW to be assembled locally was the 520/4, which was sent CKD and built in Jakarta by PT Indonesia Service Coy. 780 E12 was assembled from 1976 until 1981, with the 520/6 replacing the four-cylinder in 1978. Indonesia Service Coy later built the E28, E30, E36, and E34 models, until assembly {{was taken over by}} the PT Gaya Motor company in 1993. Assembly is currently of a limited variety of <b>semi-knocked</b> <b>down</b> cars, while the remainder of the range is available CBU.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} look into how the weaknesses and shortcomings in soft and hard infrastructure have been the obstacles to the upgrading and diversification of industrial structure in Viet Nam. It is important to overview the status of key industries before examining what elements of soft and hard infrastructure pose problems to firms in these industries. A survey is then conducted to determine the impacts of those elements. It is well documented that though achieving high performance in terms of export volumes, Viet Nam’s textile and apparel industry as well as footwear industry mainly include original equipment manufacturers for foreign multinational firms. These industries do not even have control over the domestic market. Meanwhile infant industries such as electronics and automotive mainly import and assemble complete knock down kits. To become higher value-added industries, they should be upgraded to become <b>semi-knocked</b> <b>down</b> kit assemblers and then own design manufacturers (or even own brand manufacturers) and free-on-board exporters. Development of supporting industries and human resource will be the key factor while hurdles created by soft and hard infrastructure should be immediately removed. ...|$|E
50|$|In 1916, the Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Corporation got the Vickers L class {{submarine}} informations. Mitsubishi {{which lost}} competition to the Kawasakis Type F submarines (Fiat-Laurenti design, Ro-1 class and Ro-3 class), bought the license for the L class submarine from Vickers. The IJN hoped an improvement of submarine technologies will be achieved and ordered this submarine from Mitsubishi. Mitsubishi bought 6 submarine kits, and built 2 boats by <b>semi-knock</b> <b>down.</b> The submarine crews {{were satisfied with}} the Vickers diesels because they proved to be reliable. The IJN studied the diesel engines and made many variants of similar design, for example: Kampon Mk.24 diesel for the Ro-100 class.|$|R
