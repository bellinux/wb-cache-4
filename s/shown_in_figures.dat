5|$|Some common {{structures}} are <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> 3 and 4, {{along with their}} lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E

25|$|Each duplex {{sequencing}} read {{contains a}} fixed 5-nucleotide sequence (<b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> in Black color) located upstream of the 12-nucleotide tag sequence. The reads are filtered {{out if they}} do not have the expected 5-nucleotide sequence or have more than nine identical or ambiguous bases within each tag. The two 12-nucleotide tags at each end of reads are combined and moved to the read header. Two families of reads are formed that originate from the two strands of DNA. One family contains reads with αβ header originating from strand 1 and the second family contains reads with βα header originating from strand 2 (Figure 2). Then the reads are trimmed by removing the fixed 5 bp sequence and 4 error prone nucleotides located at the sites of ligation and end repair. The remaining reads are assembled to consensus sequences using single strand consensus sequences (SSCSs) assembly and duplex consensus sequences (DCSs) assembly.|$|E

500|$|Corrugated-waveguide filters, {{also called}} ridged-waveguide filters, {{consist of a}} number of ridges, or teeth, that {{periodically}} reduce the internal height of the waveguide as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> 10 and 11. [...] They are used in applications which simultaneously require a wide passband, good passband matching, and a wide stopband. [...] They are essentially low-pass designs (above the usual limitation of the cutoff frequency), unlike most other forms which are usually band-pass. [...] The distance between teeth is much smaller than the typical λ/4 distance between elements of other filter designs. [...] Typically, they are designed by the image parameter method with all ridges identical, but other classes of filter such as Chebyshev can be achieved in exchange for complexity of manufacture. [...] In the image design method the equivalent circuit of the ridges is modelled as a cascade of LC half sections. [...] The filter operates in the dominant TE10 mode, but spurious modes can be a problem when they are present. [...] In particular, there is little stopband attenuation of TE20 and TE30 modes.|$|E

2500|$|Recent studies provide {{evidence}} of the pathogenesis of HZE nuclei in the CNS. The authors {{of one of these}} studies [...] were the first to suggest neurodegeneration with HZE nuclei, as shown in figure 6-1(a). These studies demonstrate that HZE radiation led to the progressive loss of neuronal progenitor cells in the SGZ at doses of 1 to 3 Gy in a dosedependent manner. NCRP Report No. 153 [...] notes that “Mice were irradiated with 1 to 3 Gy of 12C or 56Fe-ions and 9 months later proliferating cells and immature neurons in the dentate SGZ were quantified. The results showed that reductions in these cells were dependent on the dose and LET. Loss of precursor cells was also associated with altered neurogenesis and a robust inflammatory response, as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figures</b> 6-1(a) and 6-1(b). These results indicate that high-LET radiation has a significant and long-lasting effect on the neurogenic population in the hippocampus that involves cell loss and changes in the microenvironment. The work has been confirmed by other studies. These investigators noted that these changes are consistent with those found in aged subjects, indicating that heavy-particle irradiation is a possible model for the study of aging.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Fanno flow {{model is}} often used {{in the design and}} {{analysis}} of nozzles. [...] In a nozzle, the converging or diverging area is modeled with isentropic flow, while the constant area section afterwards is modeled with Fanno flow. [...] For given upstream conditions at point 1 as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figures</b> 3 and 4, calculations can be made to determine the nozzle exit Mach number and the location of a normal shock in the constant area duct. [...] Point 2 labels the nozzle throat, where M= 1 if the flow is choked. [...] Point 3 labels the end of the nozzle where the flow transitions from isentropic to Fanno. [...] With a high enough initial pressure, supersonic flow can be maintained through the constant area duct, similar to the desired performance of a blowdown-type supersonic wind tunnel. [...] However, these figures show the shock wave before it has moved entirely through the duct. [...] If a shock wave is present, the flow transitions from the supersonic portion of the Fanno line to the subsonic portion before continuing towards M= 1. [...] The movement in Figure 4 is always from the left to the right in order to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to stress waves, Bellamy and Zajtchuck describe shear waves {{as a possible}} mechanism of indirect injuries in the WDMET data. They estimate that 10% of bone fractures in the data {{may be the result}} of indirect injuries, that is, bones fractured by the bullet passing close to the bone without a direct impact. A Chinese experiment is cited which provides a formula estimating how pressure magnitude decreases with distance. Together with the difference between strength of human bones and strength of the animal bones in the Chinese experiment, Bellamy and Zajtchuck use this formula to estimate that assault rifle rounds [...] "passing within a centimeter of a long bone might very well be capable of causing an indirect fracture." [...] (p.153) Bellamy and Zajtchuck suggest the fracture in Figures 4-46 and 4-47 is likely an indirect fracture of this type. Damage due to shear waves extends to even greater distances in abdominal injuries in the WDMET data. Bellamy and Zajtchuck write, [...] "The abdomen is one body region in which damage from indirect effects may be common."

60|$|Section 28. Another {{striking}} contrast, due to, or connected with, this {{plethora of}} yolk, is the differentiation of a yolk sac (= umbilical vesicle) {{and the development}} of two new structures, the amnion and allantois, in the fowl. If the student will compare Figure 10 of the frog, he will see that the developing tadpole encloses in its abdomen all the yolk provided for it. This is a physical impossibility in the fowl. In the fowl (Figure 2, Sheet 24) the enormous yolk (Y.) lies outside of the embryo, and, as the cells of the germinal area grow slowly over it, umbilical bloodvessels are developed to absorb and carry the material to the embryo. In the case of an embryo sinking in upon, as it absorbs, this mass of nutritive material, a necessity for some respiratory structure is evident. From the hinder end of the fowl's intestine, in a position corresponding to the so-called, urinary bladder of the frog, a solid outgrowth, the allantois, which speedily becomes hollow, appears. Early stages are <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figures</b> 1 and 2, Sheet 24 (al.); while the same thing is shown more diagrammatically on Sheet 23, Figure 6 (all.). This becomes at last a great hollow sac, which is applied closely to the porous shell, and the extent of which will be appreciated by looking at Figure 5, Sheet 24, where the allantois is shaded. Allantoic bloodvessels ramify thickly over its walls, and aeration occurs through the permeable shell.|$|E
