40|$|AbstractPurpose of the articlePurpose of {{the present}} article is to {{identify}} drawbacks {{in the field of}} customs statistics of Georgia and to formulate concrete steps for their correction. Methodology/methodsThe methods of induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis, statistical observation and grouping have been used in the research process. The aim of the scientific work is to determine the principles for improving the statistical registration of commodity at the customs in Georgia. ResultsCountries of origin are not yet completely reflected in the cargo-customs declaration at the Georgian customs; the field ``means of transport at the border'' in the cargo-customs declaration is not filled in; data on estimated market value of the means of transport in the databases of Service Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is not complete; detailed coding of imported vehicles is carried out incorrectly; the <b>simplified</b> <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> are not completely filled in with reference to countries, 11 -digit item coding and value. In terms of registration, certain problems are caused by the fact that a sender and a country of final destination are not always filled out in the declaration. Problems exist in producing foreign trade price indices, the issue being that he information on foreign trade statistics is classified according to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System while price indices are calculated according to the classification of types of economic activity on the 4 -digit level; in filling in declarations there are frequent errors related to registration of commodity code, weight and additional units of measurement. ConclusionsEmpirical data related to production of Foreign Trade Statistics are characterized with certain errors, as a part of foreign trade operations remains unregistered. It means that registered value of exports and imports does not fully correspond to the value of actual flows...|$|E

The transit formality requires exporters to preform <b>custom</b> <b>declaration</b> in the local custom and to do a custom transit in the port of departure. Such procedures aim to keep the export goods under custom control. Although custom transit indeed safeguards the goods on the way, it actually complicates the custom clearance formalities and increases the transaction cost of the international trade. Therefore, <b>simplifying</b> <b>custom</b> transit procedures could bring benefits to China export business, which contributes to approximately 12...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{targeted}} on {{the area}} of modernization of customs clearance in the EU and the Czech Republic {{is focused on the}} specification of the systems and procedures used in the modernization of customs clearance when the electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> is used. Mainly about the status of transition from the paper declaration to the electronic paperless <b>customs</b> <b>declaration,</b> not only in the Czech Republic but throughout the European Union. Assessment data is carried out primarily for the period between the years 2012 to 2014, in some cases, for better assessments, in the period between the years 2009 to 2014. The thesis is focused on the evaluation of the situation with modernisation the customs clearance in the Czech Republic and comparing the results between chosen EU member states and the Czech Republic. The usage of the electronic Entry Summary Declarations and Exit Summary Declarations have increased several times in last two years. Implementation of systems for lodgement and processing of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> for more effective and efficient control of goods within the EU member states has also very fast growing trend with very low error rate. The rate of electronically lodged <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> is reaching in most of the EU member states almost 100 %. Numbers of <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> lodged within the simplified procedures in chosen EU member states is more or less stable.

40|$|Government {{involvement}} {{is the main}} cause for the EDI acceptance in Southeast Asian countries (United Nation of Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific - UNESCAP, 1996). This is {{significantly different from the}} EDI developments in the western countries in which private sector involvement in EDI is substantial (UNESCAP, 1996). As an initial step to spur EDI implementation in private sector, the Malaysian Government has imposed all companies that engage in international trade to implement EDI by doing electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> through CIS (<b>Customs</b> Information System) DagangNet. For this, the Government also spent over RM 300 million to fully implement EDI nationwide (Star, 2003 December 3). Nevertheless, such implementation is not successful and it has been claimed that “EDI is not yet fully implemented even though it had been initiated since late 1990 s, besides electronic data is also still not recognized for legal <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> purposes even if it was meant for paperless and electronic customs declarations” (Star, 2003 December 3). To date, there are dual <b>customs</b> <b>declarations,</b> both electronic and manual, in practices where the sole typical electronic transaction is registration of the customs form (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11). This is in contrast with electronic <b>customs</b> <b>declarations</b> by other countries such as Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore where there is a full electronic declaration including electronic payment for declarations charges (Jimmy, 2005; Star, 2005 July 11; Chau, 2001) ...|$|R

5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other <b>customs</b> <b>declaration</b> forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an import declaration form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and <b>customs</b> <b>declaration.</b> For example, the form many require an Hs code (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage to clear goods through customs.|$|R

The research serves to confirm that introduction of trade facilitation measures is necessary for assisting Macedonian companies to compete more effectively in the international marketplace. 1...|$|R
