40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel of the 1 / 8 -scale model of the Brewster F 2 A {{airplane}} with full-span slotted flaps. The object of the tests was to determine the power-one static lateral and longitudinal stability of the complete model with a new wing which had a full-span slotted flap and a plain and <b>slot-lip</b> <b>aileron</b> for lateral control. Prepared at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley Field, Virginia. Originally issued as NACA as Memorandum Report (August 1941). NACA Wartime Report L- 707. Includes bibliographical references. Tests {{were made in}} the 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel of the 1 / 8 -scale model of the Brewster F 2 A airplane with full-span slotted flaps.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the undesirable delayed action, or lag, of the spoiler-type lateral control device {{led to the development}} of the NACA <b>slot-lip</b> <b>aileron.</b> The tests were made in the 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel with a 4 - by 8 -foot wing hinged at the tunnel jet boundary and taken of the motion of the control device under test and of the resulting wing motion. First, the lag, as affected by the fore-and-aft location of retractable ailerons or spoilers was determined. The lag was found to increase regularly as the spoiler was moved from the rear of the wing toward the front. Then a combination of spoilers and fixed slot was developed that, with the spoiler retracting into the forward part of the slot, reduced the time lag to a negligible value. In addition, an arrangement was developed using a hinged aileron-type flap as the upper portion, or lip, of a slot through the wing. This arrangement appears to be usable as a form of lateral control device that shows promise of giving improved control and stability at the high angles of attack through stall, with negligible lag, low control forces, and relatively simple construction...|$|E
40|$|The <b>slot-lip</b> <b>ailerons</b> {{developed}} by the NACA consist of a flap-type spoiler with an adjoining continuously open slot. The ailerons were developed in {{an investigation of the}} delayed response, or lag, of spoiler-type lateral controls. This report presents the results of tests of these <b>slot-lip</b> <b>ailerons</b> made on wing models in the 7 by 10 -foot wind tunnel, on a Fairchild 22 airplane in the full-scale wind tunnel and in flight, and on the Weick W 1 -A airplane in flight...|$|R
40|$|A large-chord NACA 23012 airfoil was tested. The airfoil {{extended}} completely {{across the}} test section, and two-dimensional flow was approximated. The model was {{fitted with a}} full-span slotted flap having a chord 25. 66 percent of the airfoil chord. The ailerons investigated extended over the entire span and each had a chord 10 percent of the airfoil chord. The types of ailerons tested were: retractable <b>ailerons,</b> <b>slot-lip</b> <b>ailerons</b> using {{the lip of the}} slot for ailerons, and plain ailerons on the trailing edge of the slotted flap. The data are presented in the form of curves of section lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients for the airfoil with flap deflected but with ailerons neutral, and of rolling-moment, yawing-moment, and hinge-moment coefficients calculated for a rectangular wing of aspect ratio 6 with a semi-span aileron and a full-span flap. For the ailerons investigated the data indicate that, from considerations of rolling and yawing moments produced and of stick forces desired, the retractable aileron is the most satisfactory means of lateral control for use with a full-span slotted flap...|$|R
5000|$|The main design {{criteria}} were {{set by the}} disposable nature of the aircraft's load and its rugged and hazardous working environment. The first required the load in its hopper to be placed at the aerodynamic center, about 25% chord; safety demanded a good view from the cockpit in all directions but particularly forwards, so the cockpit was placed high behind the hopper with the forward fuselage sloping downwards at 15°. The seat was designed to withstand 40g's [...] The cockpit was open but with two strong, curved longitudinal frames to ease any obstructions, cables and the like, safely over the pilot's head. The leading edges of the undercarriage legs were sharpened to cut through similar hazards. Good low-speed flight characteristics, even with a heavy load, were also essential, calling for a high-lift wing. The all-metal Ag-1 was a cantilever low wing monoplane with an unusually thick (thickness/chord 21%), constant chord wing, fitted with full span slotted flaps and <b>slot-lip</b> <b>ailerons.</b> [...] It had a short centre section with no dihedral and outer panels with 5° of dihedral. The legs of the fixed, conventional undercarriage, with wheels fitted with low pressure tyres, were mounted on this inner wing section, which also contained internal tanks, capacity 150 UG gal (125 Imp gal, 568 L) for crop spraying liquid. The wing tip tip to tip spray boom was contained within the wing profile.|$|R
40|$|Sectional {{characteristics}} of airfoil having retractable slotted flap with plain, <b>slot-lip,</b> or retractable <b>ailerons</b> are presented {{for a large}} range of aileron deflections. The analysis indicated that pitching moments produced by spoilers were less positive than those produced by plain flaps of equal effectiveness, also that pitching moments created by the spoiler increased less with the Mach number than similar moments produced by plain flaps. Positive values of pitching moment decreased as devices were located nearer airfoil leading edge...|$|R
