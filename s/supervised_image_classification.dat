40|$|<b>Supervised</b> <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> {{is based}} on {{assembling}} statistics between site-specific ground observations and remotely sensed measurements. If <b>supervised</b> <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> is applied {{within the context of}} a particular theme (e. g. vegetation, soil, lithology, land use), one is often confronted with extracting the statistical correlations from a hierarchically arranged network of taxonomic classes spatially abstracted and hierarchically generalized over a range of mapping scales. In practice, however, <b>supervised</b> <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> often appears to be based on a pragmatic approach, a priori categorizing the samples into classes from various levels or from a subset of the hierarchic network. Such approaches are suspect, since the sampling often appears to be biased towards maximizing the discrimination potential of the multivariate data set at cost of representing the categories identified by direct ground observation. The classification performance is, as a result, often assessed {{within the context of a}}rbitrarily defined class schemas that only partly correspond to the schemas obtained by field surveys. Clearly, to gain more insight in how supervised classifiers are behaving with respect to ground observations, sampling procedures are required that respect the hierarchy of the taxonomy obtained in ground surveys. Herein we report the results of classification experiment applied to gamma-ray spectrometry and aeromagnetic data where samples are extracted at ground stations for each level of a four-level hierarchically arranged class network of bedrock lithology. The number of classes in this network ranges from n = 2 for the highest level and to n = 14 for its lowest.

30|$|A primary tool used to {{identify}} the LSMA sites on the satellite imagery was an on-screen digitizing technique based on the physiognomic attributes of objects and their spatial relationships or associations (Campbell 2006). Examples of physiognomic attributes included shape, size, colour, texture, and pattern. Also, the digitizing experience benefited from spatial relationships or associations of different natural and artificial objects such as water sources and road networks. Prior to use of this technique, both unsupervised and <b>supervised</b> <b>image</b> <b>classifications</b> were tried. Both <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> techniques provided indistinct boundaries of LSMA sites and spectral confusion - common in areas of sparse vegetation cover due to high background reflection from the soil, {{as is the case}} in Butana - led to mislabeling of land classes.

Aim of this project {{was to develop a}} new monitoring approach for area-wide mapping on a stand level. This approach was based on the combination of numerical methods in vegetation ecology with imaging spectroscopy. The study took place in the FFH conservation area Murnauer Moos, Upper Bavaria. The imagery had been gathered using the imaging spectrometer HyMap™. In order to develop maps that include spatial information on vegetation types as well as on transitions, crisp field and <b>image</b> <b>classifications</b> were combined with fuzzy methods in field and image data analysis. With Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) ordination technique for the pre-processing of vegetation data and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression for extrapolation, we took account of occurring mixed stands and gradual vegetation transitions.

The cost and accuracy of using IKONOS imagery to map shallow-water marine environments is evaluated and compared directly to that using a suite of satellite and airborne instruments including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High-Resolution Visible (HRV) multispectral and panchromatic, and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Evaluations were conducted in the Turks and Caicos Islands which are ideally suited to aquatic remote sensing {{because of the large}} areas of clear, shallow water containing a range of different habitats. Over 600 field sites were surveyed and used to define habitat categories, <b>supervise</b> <b>image</b> <b>classification,</b> and make an independent assessment of thematic map accuracy.

40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} component in many supervised classifiers is {{the estimation of}} one or more covariance matrices, and the often low training sample count in <b>supervised</b> hyperspectral <b>image</b> <b>classification</b> yields the need for strong regularization when estimating such matrices. Often this regularization is accomplished through adding some kind of scaled regularization matrix, e. g. the identity matrix, to the sample covariance matrix. We introduce a framework for specifying and interpreting a broad range of such regularization matrices in the linear and quadratic discriminant analysis (LDA and QDA, respectively) classifier settings. A key component in the proposed framework is the relationship between regularization and linear dimensionality reduction. We show that the equivalent of the LDA or the QDA classifier in any linearly-reduced subspace can be reached by using an appropriate regularization matrix. Furthermore, several such regularization matrices can be added together forming more complex regularizers. We utilize this framework to build regularization matrices that incorporate multiscale spectral representations. Several realizations of such regularization matrices are discussed, and their performances when applied to QDA classifiers are tested on four hyperspectral data sets. Often the classifiers benefit from using the proposed regularization matrices.

We take several diverse image data sets—ranging from person detection to astronomical object classification to species recognition—and derive a set of multiple instance views from each of them. We then show via an extensive set of 10 × 10 stratified cross-validation experiments that MVMI, based on averaging predicted confidence scores, generally exceeds the performance of traditional single-view multi-instance learning, when using support vector machines and boosting as the underlying learning algorithms.
