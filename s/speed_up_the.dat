5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E

The game provides over 150 animal companions for users to collect; minigames allow players to take care of these pets. Its initial release was for the iOS platform.

5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's {{main task}} was to shift his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line incrementally towards Japan. When the P-38 Lightning arrived in the theater in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese A6M Zero. To <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended the range of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on the range of Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{began with}} an army of 13,000 men; 1,500 were {{reported}} missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. To <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> retreat, Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium; the number who died remains disputed, ranging {{from a low of}} 30 to a high of 580. He also brought out 1,000 wounded men. Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel matrix {{inversion}} algorithm, which <b>speeds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> corresponding {{step in the}} existing fast recursive algorithm for vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time architecture (V-BLAST) by 1. 67. Totally our improved recursive algorithm for V-BLAST <b>speeds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> existing recursive algorithm for V-BLAST by 1. 3. Furthermore, we develop an efficient recursive algorithm to implement the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector with optimal ordering for Groupwise Space-Time Block Coded system (G-STBC), by exploiting {{the properties of the}} Alamouti structure in the equivalent channel matrix for G-STBC. Our recursive algorithm for G-STBC <b>speeds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> low-complexity MMSE SIC algorithm with sub-optimal ordering for G-STBC by 2. 57 approximately. I...|$|R

It carried out emergency repairs of the barn in November 2009, without the owners' consent, under an Urgent Works Notice.

However, an oversight causes the destabilization and subsequent explosion of the rocket 40 seconds after liftoff, causing Watney to think about his seemingly inevitable death.|$|E

5|$|No {{news about}} the game was made {{available}} for 18 months after it was initially announced. Davis thought the game was announced too early, causing excitement for it to die down {{too far from the}} release date. The developers carried out focus tests during this period, and the gameplay was found to be too slow-paced compared to competitors such as Call of Duty. As a result, the team spent time to <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> game's action so that it would more closely match the narrative.|$|E
