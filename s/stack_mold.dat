40|$|Time {{consumption}} {{is the major}} drawback of many existing set-ups for permeability measurement. This drawback has prevented many researchers from studying the statistical distribution of experimentally obtained permeability values. To overcome this problem-while maintaining the necessary accuracy-an automated central injection rig for permeability identification called `PIERS set-up' (permeability identification using electrical resistance sensors) was developed. The PIERS set-up was used to characterize two typical glass fiber reinforcements. The test results demonstrated the presence of large scatter in the identified permeability values and hence the necessity to consider a statistical distribution of permeability values. The existence of a permeability distribution implies that {{a small number of}} measurements will not be sufficient to fully characterize the material. This paper discusses the necessary number of measurements to adequately characterize the statistical distribution and investigates the origins of the observed scatter. The paper also shows that the nesting of layers during <b>stacking</b> and <b>mold</b> closing is a major source of the observed variations in permeability values. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the study was to investigate this reaction at the high resolution possible with the Berkeley linear accelerator near the excitation threshold. The excitation curve was obtained by <b>stacking</b> specially <b>molded</b> polystyrene (composition C{sub n}H{sub n}) foils of high uniformity and bombarding them in the proton beam. The resultant activity was then counted on a Geiger counter in standard geometry. The resultant curve is shown in Figure 1. An immediately evident feature is the sharp threshold of the reaction. The second derivative curve, illustrated in Figure 2, of the excitation shows an RMS width of 270 kV, the theoretical straggling width due to the foils of 170 kv, and the remaining width in accordance with the energy spread of approximately {+-} 100 kv half width of the linear accelerator.

Analytical and finite element models were both performed to investigate the effects of compositional gradients, boundary conditions, and external loadings on flexural properties of nanocomposite beams. Close agreement was observed between analytical solutions, finite element analyses and experiment. The morphology of the fracture surfaces was examined using a scanning electron microscope.

40|$|Recently, {{unidirectional}} rigid gluten biocomposites {{have received}} attention because the glassy gluten matrix has comparable properties as an epoxy resin. This research proposes some possibilities to facilitate such biocomposites. The dry method is modiﬁed by using water exposed ﬁbers rather than dry ones.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} low {{velocity}} impact behavior of thermoplastic laminated structures based on thermoplastic polyurethane reinforced with woven glass fiber highlighting effects related to sample thickness and test temperature {{with the aim}} to verify their potential applications. Plaques obtained by film <b>stacking</b> and compression <b>molding</b> technologies are tested using an instrumented falling dart machine at room temperature, − 25 °C and − 50 °C. Impact results are reported in terms of typical load-deflection and energy-time curves, but also discussed {{with reference to the}} well known ductility index (DI) parameter. As expected, the cooling is reflected in an increased stiffness of tested specimens and their higher propensity to the damage. Increases of plate thickness and reductions of the test temperature lead to enhanced friction phenomena at the material-dart contact, responsible of significant deviations from well established semi-empirical models about the Hertz contact force and the penetration energy. Finally, no delamination phenomena seem to be verified for all investigated samples as supported by visual inspections of front and rear impacted areas...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{reinforcement}} for unidirectional natural fiber composites has been developed, where a paper layer is assembled {{with a layer of}} unidirectional flax yarns. The paper layer chemically and mechanically bonds to the loose yarns to maintain their alignment and enables better manipulability of the reinforcement during <b>stacking</b> in the <b>mold.</b> Unfortunately, the paper layer adversely affects the permeability of the whole reinforcement to liquid resin and thus limits the impregnation quality of the final part. In this paper, a technique is adopted to increase the impregnation performance by modifying the architecture of the fibrous network in the paper layer. In particular, a method has been developed to replace a proportion of the Kraft fibers by short flax fibers in the paper layer, in an attempt to open the structure and increase the paper permeability. Permeability measurements show a major improvement in global reinforcement permeability. Basic mechanical properties of resulting composites were also analysed. Results show a slight decrease in modulus and strength when the paper layer is present. This is compensated by an important reduction in variability. Furthermore, increasing the flax proportion in the paper layer limits the loss of mechanical properties, while reducing variability even further...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} herein an epidemiological {{investigation of}} {{the cause of a}} syndrome of congenital spinal stenosis (CSS) in four beef herds in western Canada. Three of the herds were affected with the syndrome in 1987, the fourth was affected in 1990. The prevalence of CSS in affected groups of calves varied from 29 % (16 / 55) to 100 % (14 / 14). All affected calves had congenital posterior paralysis or paresis; some calves also had {{one or more of the}} following: shortened limbs, forelimb varus deformities, superior brachygnathia, and a dome-shaped cranium. Affected calves showed focal premature closure of axial and appendicular metaphyseal growth plates. At three of the four farms most of the pregnant cows were affected with alopecia with or without pruritus in January, and 25 % of the cows in one herd died during the winter. The investigation indicated that CSS was associated with feeding moldy cereal straw to pregnant beef cows during the winter. At all four farms, the cereal straw bales were thoroughly soaked by rain prior to <b>stacking,</b> and obvious <b>mold</b> was present when they were broken open for feeding. Species of both Penicillium and Fusarium were abundant within the bales. The most likely cause of the disease was a fungal mycotoxicosis, although the mycotoxin responsible was not isolated...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, the fabrication, characterization, and {{modeling}} of functionally graded nanocomposites (FGNs) are presented. FGNs with phenolic matrix and synthetic graphite (SG) as nanofillers were fabricated using a combined powder <b>stacking</b> and compression <b>molding</b> techniques. Ball milling {{was used to}} homogeneously distribute nanofillers within the phenolic matrix. The process allowed FGNs with four different microstructure gradient patterns of the same geometry and SG content, as well as non-graded nanocomposites (NGNs), to be fabricated. The surface morphology of FGNs and SG distribution were examined. The transient thermal behavior of FGNs subjected to sudden temperature changes was numerically investigated to {{examine the effect of}} compositional patterns on the temperature gradient field in these materials. Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the FGN components were measured and used in finite element-based transient thermal analysis developed based on the experimental procedure. A controlled microstructure and composition was achieved in microscale. Thermomechanical and viscoelastic properties of nanocomposites were highly affected by the distribution patterns of SG within the matrix. The transient thermal analysis results showed that the transient time and temperature field in nanocomposite structures were highly influenced by the compositional gradient configurations. The FGN with a gradual decrease in reinforcing content from the exposed side to the other side had the lowest temperature gradient field (about 11 °C less than the other gradient patterns) and transient time (about 56 seconds less than the other gradient patterns) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve polymer thermal {{conductivity}} (TC), Ultem(TradeMark) 1000 was compounded with nano-fillers of carbon allotropes. Ultem(TradeMark) 1000 was selected since it is both solution and melt processable. As-received and modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), vapor grown carbon nanofibers (CNF) and expanded graphite (EG) were investigated. MWCNTs were modified by functionalizing the surface through oxidization with concentrated acids, mixing with an alkyl bromide, and addition of alkyl and phosphorus compounds after initial treatment with n-butyl lithium. Functionalization was performed to improve the TC compatibility between the resin and MWCNTs. It was postulated that this may provide an improved interface between the MWCNT and the polymer which would result in enhanced TC. The nano-fillers were mixed with Ultem(TradeMark) 1000 in the melt and in solution at concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 wt%. Ribbons were extruded from the blends to form samples where the nano-fillers were aligned to some degree in the extrusion direction. Samples were also fabricated by compression molding resulting in random orientation of the nano-fillers. Thermal properties of the samples were evaluated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA). Tensile properties of aligned samples were determined at room temperature. The specimens were cut from the ribbons in the extrusion direction; hence the nano-fillers are somewhat aligned {{in the direction of}} stress. Typically it was observed that melt mixed samples exhibited superior mechanical properties compared to solution mixed samples. As expected, increased filler loading led to increased modulus and decreased elongation with respect to the neat polymer. The degree of dispersion and alignment of the nano-fillers was determined by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM). HRSEM of the ribbons revealed that the MWCNTs and CNFs were predominantly aligned in the flow direction. The TC of the samples was measured using a Nanoflash(TradeMark) instrument. Since the MWCNTs and CNF are anisotropic, the TC was expected to be different in the longitudinal (parallel to the nanotube and fiber axis) and transverse (perpendicular to the nanotube and fiber axis) directions. The extruded ribbons provided samples for transverse TC measurements. However, to determine the TC in the longitudinal direction, the ribbons needed to be <b>stacked</b> and <b>molded</b> under 1. 7 MPa and 270 C. Samples were then obtained by cutting the molded block with a diamond saw. The largest TC improvement was achieved for aligned samples when the measurement was performed in the direction of MWCNT and CNF alignment (i. e. longitudinal axis). Unaligned samples also showed a significant improvement in TC and may be potentially useful in applications when {{it is not possible to}} align the nano-filler.

30|$|Charging of fungal spores and any {{potentially}} connected functions (e.g. {{in support}} for spores {{to serve as}} nuclei for raindrops; Elbert et al. 2007; Hassett et al. 2015) are understudied and generally little understood (Webster et al. 1988; Wargenau et al. 2011, 2013; Saar 2013; Saar and Parmasto 2014; Saar and Salm 2014). In line, practical use of charging of spores and spore behaviour in electric fields has so far only seldom been made of. However, guarding of bookshelves with an electric field screen has been tested to successfully protect old valuable books in library <b>stack</b> rooms against <b>mold</b> infection by airborne spores (Takikawa et al. 2014) and electrostatic dust collectors were applied in French archives to study their fungal allergenic potentials (Roussel et al. 2012). Spores in buildings and rooms distribute unevenly, among as factors behind by being influenced by electric and magnetic devices (Anaya et al. 2015, 2016). Knowledge on fungal spore distributions in buildings as in outside environments can come through application of electrostatic dust collectors (Normand et al. 2016) and electrostatic precipitators might be used (Han et al. 2011). An electrostatic nursery shelter and an ozone-generative electrostatic spore precipitator were reported to protect tomato plants in hydroponic culture and in open-window greenhouses against fungal pathogens (Shimizu et al. 2007; Kakutani et al. 2012; Takikawa et al. 2016) and an electrostatic spore collector {{has been applied to}} collect conidia of the barley pathogen Blumeria graminis (Moriura et al. 2006). While our experimental set-up here is simple and easy to apply by using electrostatic features intrinsic to the plastic lids of Petri-dishes to selectively collect basidiospores from mushrooms, our observations offer the possibility to also develop technically more sophisticated devices for basidiospore collection.|$|R

To access the final edited and published work see: [URL] development of an ion mobility spectrometer with an injection molded plastic drift tube made from carbon-loaded nylon and the cyclo-olefinpolymer Zeonex is described. Thermogravimetric assessment combined with headspace analysis by ion mobility spectrometry and gas chromatography−mass spectrometry indicated that Zeonex encapsulated carbon-loaded nylon {{could be used to}} fabricate a snap-together injection <b>molded</b> <b>stacked</b> ring drift tube, 4. 25 cm long that could be substituted for a conventional wire-wound heated ceramic drift tube of the same length into a high temperature ion mobility spectrometer. Temperature stability experiments indicated that such a combination of polymers produced stable water-based reactant ion peaks [(H 2 O) nH]+ up to a temperature of approximately 50 °C. Above this temperature, ammonia appeared to outgas, resulting in the production of [(H 2 O) n(NH 4) mH]+ type species before, at higher temperatures, the release of oligomeric entities suppressed resolved ion responses. Surface charging effects were also observed, and over a period of continuous operation of 4 h, these caused suppression of the signal intensity (1. 11 − 0. 954 V) and an apparent mobility shift in the observed responses (K 0 = 1. 86 − 1. 90 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1). Substituting nylon, a polymer with a significantly lower surface resistivity, for the Zeonex demonstrated how surface charging phenomena could be managed though control of surface resistivity in future polymer formulations.

40|$|Compared to the {{monolithic}} integration System-on-Chip, System-In-Package (SiP) allows e. g. an easier integration of very heterogeneous components. Nevertheless, {{there are a}} number of advantages in contrast to the 2 D solutions (signal paths, size/weight, etc). Whilst a PCB/MCM designer has several clear criteria to make a decision regarding substrate and interconnection technology (wiring density, number of layer, pad pitch), there is no clearly defined criteria for choosing optimal vertical SiP technique. The designer is faced with many different technological solutions (e. g. stacked wire bonded dies, circuitry on folded flex, soldered flipchip modules). The derivation of a practical parameter table from different technologies would simplify the geometry/technological decisions and also allow for SiP design tools. Within the 2, 5 D integration (vertically integrated layers) the physical design (PD) could be subdivided into two stages: 1. Global Layout, which can be abstracted away from any certain technology, 2. Detailed Layout/implementation, which is obviously based on definite technology. In analogy to PCB/MCM- and IC-design, both stages consist of three main steps: Partitioning, Placement and Routing. In the beginning of the PD, the net list and the component set are for the most part defined. The aim of global partitioning is to group the components and to allocate them on certain vertical layers. Global placement means the arrangement of layers in stack, and global routing is in this case the optimization of the electrical wiring/nets between the layers. These steps can be formulated as a mathematical problem with a number of objectives, such as e. g. floorplan/volume minimization for partitioning. Before starting the detailed layout, the technology for the stacking and vertical interconnection MUST be selected. The rare publications on the PD for 2, 5 D are targeting only one specific SiP technology. The contribution of presented work is the investigation of objective basics for this selection. There are no standardizations for vertical integrated SiPs. Based on primarily technological criteria, the classifications of 2, 5 D technologies by "Interconnects Technology" (Area, Periphery) or by "Integration Level" (Wafer-, Chip-, Module-Stack) have been presented. The abstract consideration of "technology-free" physical and electrical attributes results in other classification, which is more helpful for design purposes. The SiP as "System" aims not only at transferring all the components terminals outside the package. Thus there are connected/redistributed nets. Classification of four main technology groups in accordance to "Redistribution Level" is presented as follows: 1. No redistribution in vertical wiring possible (in this case it can be called vertical interconnect VIC), lower redistribution level in lateral wiring (represented mostly by wire bonded die stakes, e. g. Sharp), 2. No redistribution in VICs and high redistribution level in lateral wiring (solutions with functional layer on stacked modules, e. g. North), 3. Redistribution level in vertical and lateral wiring is approximately equal (solutions with components on the folded flexible substrate,e. g. Tessera), 4. Medium and approximately equal redistribution level in vertical und lateral wiring, (<b>stacked</b> and <b>molded</b> devices with connecting metallization on the sidewalls, 3 D Plus, Irvine). Considering the net complexity schema and being supported by essential parameters (partly presented in Fig. 1), a SiP designer can choose between four technology groups and start detailed layout targeting the chosen technology. Proposed parameters set is currently under development. Their interaction offers interesting objectives for investigations, e. g. dependence of VIC-Pitch and -Density on the Layer Gap (Fig. 2 : case study results for soldered modules). Further studies should embrace earlier system costs and size estimations, implementation of electrical and thermal simulation models...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{manufacturing}} is a {{vital part}} of aerospace manufacturing systems. Applying effective scheduling within these systems can cut the costs in aerospace companies significantly. These systems can be characterized as two-stage Hybrid Flow Shops (HFS) with identical, non-identical and unrelated parallel discrete-processing machines in the first stage and non-identical parallel batch-processing machines in the second stage. The first stage is normally the lay-up process in which the carbon fiber sheets are <b>stacked</b> on the <b>molds</b> (tools). Then, the parts are batched based on the compatibility of their cure recipe before going to the second stage into the autoclave for curing. Autoclaves require enormous capital investment and maximizing their utilization is of utmost importance. In this thesis, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to maximize the utilization of the resources in the second stage of this HFS. CPLEX, with an underlying branch and bound algorithm, is used to solve the model. The results show the high level of flexibility and computational efficiency of the proposed model when applied to small and medium-size problems. However, due to the NP-hardness of the problem, the MILP model fails to solve large problems (i. e. problems with more than 120 jobs as input) in reasonable CPU times. To solve the larger instances of the problem, a novel heuristic method along with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) are developed. The heuristic algorithm is designed based on a careful observation of the behavior of the MILP model for different problem sets. Moreover, it is enhanced by adding a number of proper dispatching rules. As its output, this heuristic algorithm generates eight initial feasible solutions which are then used as the initial population of the proposed GA. The GA improves the initial solutions obtained from the aforementioned heuristic through its stochastic iterations until it reaches the satisfactory near-optimal solutions. A novel crossover operator is introduced in this GA which is unique to the HFS of aerospace composite manufacturing systems. The proposed GA is proven to be very efficient when applied to large-size problems with up to 300 jobs. The results show the high quality of the solutions achieved by the GA when compared to the optimal solutions which are obtained from the MILP model.

40|$|Composites {{consisting}} of the same thermoplastic material for the matrix phase and reinforcement, the so-called ‘polymer unity composites’, are gaining increasing attention. These composites, typically those made from polypropylene (PP) and/or polyethylene (PE), possess distinct properties with potential unique applications. Unlike the conventional composites containing glass or carbon fibers embedded in polymer matrices, they can be easily recycled as they do not require the tedious process to separate the reinforcement fibers from the matrix before individual recycling. These composites can be called the ‘green composites’ as they are more environment-friendly than other coniposite materials in terms of ease of recycling. In the present study, the effects of various processing conditions, including different cooling rates and isothermal cooling, on the morphology and important mechanical properties of PP/PP composites {{consisting of}} homo-PP fibers and propylene-ethylene random copolymer matrix were characterized. The effect of service temperature was also evaluated. The interfacial adhesion was correlated {{to the degree of}} crystallinity, crystalline morphology and the bulk mechanical properties of the composite. Composite laminates of different cooling rates and thermal treatments were prepared using filming <b>stacking</b> and compression <b>molding</b> methods. The single filament fragmentation test was carried out to characterize the PP fibre-PP matrix interfacial adhesion. It is shown that the slow cooled samples had a higher interfacial shear strength (IFSS) than the fast cooled ones. It is shown that the tensile properties generally increased with decreasing cooling rate. The isothermal treatment also improved the tensile strength and modulus as the slow cooling rate did. This {{can be attributed to the}} change in the crystallinity induced by different thermal processes. A higher crystallinity in the slow cooled samples gives rise to a high tensile strength and modulus and a relative brittle fracture mechanism, whereas a lower crystallinity introduced by the fast cooling process results in a relatively high ductility with lower tensile properties. There were functionally similar variations in IFSS and tensile properties with respect to cooling rate. The Charpy impact test results indicate that the impact performance of the composites is highly dependent on the testing temperature. There was virtually no difference in impact fracture energy between the samples processed at different cooling rates when tested at room temperature. The sensitivity of cooling rate on impact fracture energy became significant when tested at sub-zero temperatures. The impact fracture energy were generally higher for the samples with slower cooling rates than the fast cooled samples...|$|R
