40|$|Abstract — FH {{communication}} is {{a branch of}} spread spectrum communication for its outstanding advantages of strong anti jamming and antimultipath fading. It is widely used in military and civilian applications for its well performances [9]. In FH communication system, FH (Frequency hopping) sequences are used to hop the frequencies for transmission and {{play an important role}} [6]. A new construction of frequency hopping (FH) sequenced are designated as quadratic prime codes by expanding the construct idea of prime codes to the extension Galois fields GF (P 2). More families of FH sequences with minimal hamming auto correlation and cross correlation properties are desired to improve the performance and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> system. Quadratic prime codes can provide P- 1 / 2 families of FH sequenced rather than one family for prime coded for certain prime number P, which is preferable to improve the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> system.

"Voice over IP is fast {{emerging}} as a strong contender to the traditional circuit-switched PSTN networks. Unlike the PSTN network, which requires dedicated lines, VoIP can share the network that is laid out to carry data traffic {{as well as other}} traffic categories. Securing VoIP and other real-time traffic is necessary considering the easy ways <b>of</b> hacking <b>communication</b> over internet. Most <b>of</b> the existing <b>security</b> solutions for VoIP such as IPSec, Secure Real Time Protocol (SRTP) and ZRTP use the standard symmetric encryption algorithms for encrypting voice traffic. In this thesis, the author proposes an alternate encryption scheme that uses PKI architecture for the initial authentication and key exchange, and encrypts the real-time traffic with a symmetric algorithm using a unique key for each packet. The proposed algorithm expected to be less complex compared to the traditional encryption schemes in addition to enhancing the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the <b>communication.</b> The performance <b>of</b> the proposed algorithm has been simulated by modifying libSRTP. The analysis carried out shows that the proposed scheme helps in improving the voice quality to a certain extent while maintaining the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the <b>communication...</b>|$|R
