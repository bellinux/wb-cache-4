5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E

25|$|Some resistors, {{particularly}} those made from semiconductors, exhibit photoconductivity, meaning that their resistance changes when light is <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> them.

25|$|A beam {{of light}} {{reflects}} off a mirror at an angle of reflection equal to its angle of incidence (if {{the size of a}} mirror is much larger than the wavelength of light). That is, if the {{beam of light}} is <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> a mirror's surface, at a ° angle vertically, then it reflects from the point of incidence at a ° angle from vertically in the opposite direction.

25|$|The {{electroscope}} is {{an important}} tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because {{the frequency of the}} light <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> the cap is above the cap's threshold frequency. The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope. However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the threshold value for the cap), then the leaf will never discharge, no matter how long one shines the low-frequency light at the cap.|$|E
25|$|Diwali or Deepavali is the Hindu {{festival of}} lights celebrated {{every year in}} autumn in the {{northern}} hemisphere (spring in southern hemisphere). It is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. One {{of the most popular}} festivals of Hinduism, it spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair. Its celebration includes millions of lights <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> housetops, outside doors and windows, around temples and other buildings in the communities and countries where it is observed. The festival preparations and rituals typically extend over a five-day period, but the main festival night of Diwali coincides with the dark night of the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartika in Bikram Sambat calendar (the month of Aippasi in Tamil Calendar), on the 15th of the month. In the Gregorian calendar, Diwali night falls between mid-October and mid-November.|$|E
500|$|The Magpie is {{an early}} example of Monet's {{investigation}} of colored shadows. In this piece, Monet makes use of the complementary colors of blue and yellow. The shadow produced by yellow sunlight <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> the snow gives {{the impression of a}} blue-violet color, the effect of simultaneous contrast. French Impressionists popularized the use of colored shadows, which went against the artistic convention of portraying shadows by darkening and desaturating the color. Colored shadows can be directly observed in nature, particularly in the type of snow scene presented by Monet. In his study of Impressionism, art historian John Rewald observed that artists used snowscapes to [...] "investigate the problem of shadows". The problem is summarized by Fred S. Kleiner in Gardner's Art Through the Ages: ...|$|E

500|$|The Tobacco Fund, {{set up in}} September 1914, was {{particularly}} successful. Public donors bought Southern Rhodesian tobacco, cigarettes and pipe tobacco to send to the British forces. This was intended not only to comfort the troops, but also to advertise the prospect of post-war emigration to Rhodesia. The labels on the tobacco tins depicted a map of Africa with the sun <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> Rhodesia, accompanied by the slogan [...] "The World's Great Sunspot". In a similar vein, [...] "Sunspot" [...] was the name given to the Rhodesian cigarettes that British soldiers received. During the war, British and colonial soldiery collectively chewed and smoked 59,955 two-ounce (57g) tins of donated Southern Rhodesian tobacco, 80,584 two-ounce tins of equivalent pipe tobacco, and 4,004,000 Sunspot cigarettes (in packs of 10).

500|$|The British Empire {{comprised}} the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or {{administered by the}} United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, {{it was the largest}} empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, [...] of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , [...] of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase [...] "the empire on which the sun never sets" [...] was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> at least one of its territories.|$|E
500|$|Light and {{darkness}} feature prominently in Psycho. The first shot after the intertitle is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters {{the office to}} steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness. Bright lights are also [...] "the ironic equivalent of darkness" [...] in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, [...] "the glaring white" [...] of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.|$|E

500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Takashi Hasegawa, who had written for multiple series entries since Tales of Eternia; Koki Matsumoto, who had written the scenario of Tales of Legendia; Hideo Baba, who had previously done work on Tales of Rebirth; and Takaaki Okuda, a newcomer to the series. The game's title, meant to be indicative of the games' theme of justice, was derived from [...] "Vesper", a name referring to the planet Venus. Its general meaning was to depict the protagonists and their ship as a newly-born star <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> the land, similar to Venus in the evening sky. The logo was also design to convey this, and the term [...] "Vesperia" [...] was used in-game for the party's airship. The game's main protagonist, Yuri Lowell, was created {{to be a more}} mature, evolved protagonist than Kyle Dunamis in Tales of Destiny 2 or Luke fon Fabre in Abyss. His role was to facilitate the growth of the other characters, and {{to have a sense of}} justice that did not take account of the law. Veteran Tales character designer, Kōsuke Fujishima, was brought in to design the main characters. Fujishima found designing Yuri difficult, while Flynn proved one of the easiest designs. One of the intentions for Flynn and Yuri was for their designs to contrast with each other. A main character not designed by Fujishima was Repede, who was designed by the art director Daigo Okumura.|$|E
500|$|The duality of Shiva's fearful and auspicious {{attributes}} {{appears in}} contrasted names. The name Rudra reflects Shiva's fearsome aspects. According to traditional etymologies, the Sanskrit name Rudra {{is derived from}} the root rud-, which means [...] "to cry, howl". Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form raudra, which means [...] "wild, of rudra nature", and translates the name Rudra as [...] "the wild one" [...] or [...] "the fierce god". R. K. Sharma follows this alternate etymology and translates the name as [...] "terrible". Hara is an important name that occurs three times in the Anushasanaparvan version of the Shiva sahasranama, where it is translated in different ways each time it occurs, following a commentorial tradition of not repeating an interpretation. Sharma translates the three as [...] "one who captivates", [...] "one who consolidates", and [...] "one who destroys". Kramrisch translates it as [...] "the ravisher". Another of Shiva's fearsome forms is as [...] "time" [...] and [...] "great time", which ultimately destroys all things. The name [...] appears in the Shiva Sahasranama, where it is translated by Ram Karan Sharma as [...] "(the Supreme Lord of) Time". Bhairava [...] "terrible" [...] or [...] "frightful" [...] is a fierce form associated with annihilation.In contrast, the name , [...] "beneficent" [...] or [...] "conferring happiness" [...] reflects his benign form. This name was adopted by the great Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara (c. 788–820), who is also known as Shankaracharya. The name [...] (Sanskrit: [...] swam-on its own; bhu-burn/shine) [...] "self-shining/ <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> its own", also reflects this benign aspect.|$|E
500|$|Making up {{for lost}} time during illness, he {{completed}} several significant works over the next few months, and exhibited eight paintings at the 1835 Summer Exhibition. These included works now considered among his most significant. The Bridge of Sighs, Venice was based on sketches made by Etty during his visit to that city in the early 1820s. It shows the aftermath of an execution, as two men haul the body away to be thrown into the sea; it was described as [...] "poetry on canvas" [...] by William Macready, who bought it from Etty. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball was the portrait of the daughters of Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn which Etty had begun in 1833. Etty had put far more work into this than was usual for a portrait, remarking to the Williams-Wynn family that he intended [...] "to make a fine work of Art as well as a resemblance". Showing Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary in elaborate Italian-style costumes, it was critically well received as evidence that Etty was able to paint a major work that did not rely on nudity, as well as demonstrating that Etty could paint on commission for the elite, leading to further commissions. The Warrior Arming was a study of Godfrey de Bouillon. painted to satisfy the then-current fad for medievalism. Etty had recently developed an interest in collecting pieces of armour, and The Warrior Arming is a technically adept study of the effects of lights from multiple sources <b>shining</b> <b>on</b> polished armour.|$|E
