There are, however, few quantitative data available for evaluation of the frequency and duration of such post-traumatic dysfunction.

40|$|The usual {{surgical}} {{approach to}} the lateral compartment of the knee joint can be very unsatisfactory, particularly when a cyst of the lateral <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilage</b> [lateral meniscus] is present. All authorities are agreed that complete excision of the cartilage is the treatment of choice for this condition, and most agree that removal is usually technically difficult. Some surgeons state the problem frankly (Bonnin 1953, Hertz 1955); others admit the difficulties when they advise multiple incisions to expose the cyst, or simple removal of the lateral <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilage,</b> leaving {{the periphery of the}} cyst to be gradually replaced by fibrous tissue. From 1947 to 1957, 362 knee arthrotomies were performed at Deer Lodge Hospital. In this series twenty-three patients with cystic degeneration of the cartilage were encountered, an incidence of 63 per cent. All the cysts were of the lateral cartilage, and all were treated by total excision of the cartilage. During the treatment of this series a direct {{approach to the}} lateral compartment of the knee was evolved.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{literature}} on chondromalacia of the patella shows that its etiology is ill understood. Most writers have been willing to accept injury as its cause without much question. I have long been interested in this problem, and for some years I have been in the habit, when excising a <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilage,</b> of carefully observing and recording the condition of the articular cartilage on the deep surface of the patella. In 196 cases of medial meniscectomy the number of patellae showing healthy articular cartilage was approximately equal to the number showing pathological change (Table I). This is a lower incidence of chondromalacia than that reported by many other writers. Wiles, Andrews and Devas (1956) stated that chondromalacia patellae “ often begins during the second decade, and by the age of thirty nearly everyone is affected. ” Owre (1936) examined 124 patellae at necropsy and found a high incidence of abnormal cartilage: of subjects over twenty years of age, ninety-seven out of 106 showed pathological changes. Thus it must be accepted that chondromalacia of the patella is far more common than is generally believed, because usually it does not cause symptoms...|$|E

40|$|The {{integrity}} of the <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilages</b> {{has proved to be}} the best safeguard against mechanical degenerative changes. One can postulate that restoring normal congruency between the femur and tibia with intact menisci would be the ideal solution to many mechanical knee problems. Several <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilages</b> have been transplanted with good functional results in medial and lateral compartmental meniscal disease. However, this form of chondroprotection in the load-bearing area of the femur and tibia can only be properly evaluated after 10 to 20 years of follow-up. In order to obtain functional results, meniscal allografts have to be incorporated in the knee joint by intimate meniscofemoral synovial bonding. The synovial fibroblasts must grow into the collagen meshwork of the meniscal allograft. Such ingrowth has been shown in freeze-dried and deep-frozen meniscal allografts. However, in a small number of transplants shrinking has been observed on repeat arthroscopy at 6 months. Satisfactory incorporation of meniscal allografts has been obtained with fresh allografts, but availability remains a problem when this method is used for meniscal substitution. For this reason viable meniscal allograft implantation was initiated in a series of 25 patients and the value of this method studied. The meniscal allograft can be kept in an adequate semisynthetic nutrient medium for approximately 2 - 3 weeks without apparent loss of viability, during which period the appropriate recipient can be selected and prepared, a thorough laboratory screening can be conducted, and the culture results and disease transmission factors can be evaluated. In this way, live transplant hazards can be avoided, resulting in a higher success rate...|$|R

An unusual finding was the occurrence of filamentous material in Golgi sacs and vesicles, and collagen fibrils within smooth membrane-bound tubular structures, apparently within the cells. Collagen fibrils forming fibres, fibre bundles and lamellae constituted the major component of the menisci. Protein-polysaccharide particles and associated fine filaments were found in the interfibrillary matrix and in the sparse territorial matrix adjacent to the chondrocytes.

40|$|A discoid medial {{cartilage}} must be uncommon; I {{have found}} reports {{of only two}} cases in the literature. Dwyer and Taylor described a torn discoid medial cartilage in 1945. This cartilage had a longitudinal split extending {{from front to back}} and another tear similar to the horizontal cleavage described in discoid lateral cartilages by Smillie (1946). In Smillie’s (bc. cit.) own case of a discoid medial cartilage there had also been a horizontal cleavage, and the cartilage showed cystic degeneration peripherally. Both these were of the “primitive” type in Smillie’s classification of discoid cartilages. CASE REPORTS Case 1 -A man aged twenty-four years complained of locking incidents in his right knee when getting up from a chair or from a squatting position. He recalled a fall a year before when he twisted the knee. He was not aware of locking until the next day. Clinically, there was a moderate effusion; there was no block to extension. The medial joint line was tender and pain was elicited medially by rotation of the tibia on the femur in both directions. A faint click was elicited only once. Radiographs of the knee were normal. At operation (Dr H. C. Palm) a discoid <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilage</b> was removed from the inner side of the joint (Fig. 1).

40|$|Synovectomy may be {{described}} as an operation {{for the removal of}} diseased synovial membrane from a joint which is the seat of an inflam-matory reaction. The operation is applicable to any of the joints of the extremities, but its use, perhaps unfortunately, has largely been limited to the knee. The purpose of the operation is to improve the integrity of a joint when there is reason to suppose that the continued presence of synovial inflammatory changes will add to the damage, or when {{it seems likely that the}} operation will increase the function of a joint and favorably influence the patient’s general health. The author’s original paper demonstrated the feasibility of removing large amounts of synoviai tissue, without operative complications or unfortunate later effects, in a series of fifteen synovectomies performed on eight patients with chronic atrophic arthritis. From clinical observa-tion it was evident that the operation was followed by a restoration of the synovial tissue or by the development of a substitute which was function-ally satisfactory. No one really knew what happened after the operation until Key made his brilliant report in 1925. He operated upon thirty-five rabbits and in each case removed the entire synovial membrane from the anterior compartment, including the infrapatellar fat pad and a part of the internal <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilage.</b> He was able to study twenty-four of these joints at varying postoperative periods and he found that the joint was approximately normal after sixty days. The new membrane had a more irregular fibrous groundwork than the original and was deficient in the subsynovial areolar tissue. This study of Key’s was so comprehensively carried out and so thoroughly reported as to provide assurance that synovectomy can be done with confidence that restitution of a serviceable membrane will promptly follow. A great deal of interest in arthritis has been manifested during the past fifteen years and this has been reflected in an enormous output of literature. Unfortunately much still remains to be learned in spite of important advances along many lines. As recently as January 1936...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of human meniscal allografting, menisci have been {{maintained}} viable in in vitro culture. The influence of long-term tissue culture on the extracellular matrix metabolism of the meniscus has been studied. Fetal calf serum (FCS) {{was used as a}} supplement for the growth factors necessary to maintain optimal meniscal cell metabolism. A series of <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilage</b> samples was cultured under serum-free conditions since foreign proteins could be responsible for immunological problems after eventual allografting. The proteoglycan metabolism in human menisci cultured in FCS-supplemented and in serum-free culture media was compared. To rule out any influence of topographical variations in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content on proteoglycan (PG) metabolism, GAG concentrations within the tissue were determined, and sulphate (35 S) incorporation was studied in tissue samples with a comparable biochemical composition. Sulphate incorporation was preserved when 20 % FCS was added to the nutrient medium. The meniscal tissue fibroblasts continued to produce 35 S-PG during 4 weeks of culture. The PG molecules were shown to consist of PG-aggregates, monomers and a low molecular-weight PG population. Newly synthesized GAG consisted of approximately 55 % chondroitin 4 - and 6 -sulphate and 33 % dermatan sulphate. In the presence of serum, 35 S incorporation in PG and in the PG-aggregate fraction significantly increased during the first 2 weeks and then decreased during the following 2 weeks of in vitro culture. Newly synthesized PG-aggregates were almost entirely accumulated in the tissue during these weeks. In the 3 rd week the values for this parameter decreased slightly. 35 S-PG synthesis dramatically declined after 4 weeks of in vitro culture. Catabolism probably resulted in increased proportions of 35 S-PG in the incubation media. In the absence of serum, 35 S-PG production also increased in the 2 nd week of culture. However, 35 S activity was almost exclusively found in small PG, and this material apparently diffused to the incubation media. Consequently, catabolism is higher, and the immobilization of 35 S-PG is poor when FCS is not added to the culture media. Our findings suggest that menisci are maintained in viable condition and may serve for allografting at least during 2 weeks of tissue cultur...|$|E
40|$|TEARS of the <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilages</b> of the {{knee-joint}} are {{a common}} disability in the Armed Forces. Almost all Royal Air Force patients operated on for removal of torn cartilages receive post-operative treatment at the Royal Air Force rehabilitation centres. During {{the last eight years}} over 1, 700 such patients have been treated at two Medical Rehabilitation Units, at Chessington and Collaton Cross. Although several series {{have been reported in the}} literature, notably by Smillie (1951), Bristow (1944), McMurray (1944), Henderson (1930), and MacAusland (1931), there are few published accounts of the important factors in post-operative rehabilitation. This paper is concerned mainly with an analysis of these factors. I N C I D E N C E OF TORN CARTILAGES Some 2, 500 patients are treated every year at the two centres, and about one-third of these are suffering from some form of knee disability. Of these patients with knee disorders, 30 % are undergoing rehabilitation following meniscectomy.

40|$|Background: The menisci (formerly called <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilages)</b> of {{the knee}} lie within the knee joint between the femur and tibia and {{somewhat}} adapt the tibial and femoral condyles to each other. The menisci are liable to injury resulting from twisting strains applied to flexed weight bearing knee. The mean annual incidence of meniscal tears is about 60 - 70 per 100, 000 with a male to female ratio ranging from 2. 5 : 1 to 4 : 1. The present study was conceived to provide valuable morphological data for preparing meniscal allograft for people of this region so that accurate matching {{can be done in}} meniscal transplantation. Methods: The study was carried out in 100 lateral menisci of adult human male cadavers with age ranging from 20 to 50 years. Distance between anterior and posterior horns of lateral meniscus, outer and inner border length, width and thickness at three points, namely anterior, middle and posterior one third was taken with the help of non-elastic thread and Vernier caliper. Written informed consent was taken from the relatives of the deceased. Results: Distance between the two horns of lateral meniscus, outer border and inner border length of right and left lateral meniscus were not significantly differently from each other. Width and thickness of lateral meniscus was highest in the middle part which was significantly different from other parts. Conclusions: In conclusion, width and thickness was highest in the middle third part of lateral menisci. Also, shapes of lateral menisci were different from others studies.

40|$|Scientists in polymer science are {{attempting}} to provide synthetic tissues that serve as alternative biomechanical role in the body, such as articular cartilage, <b>semilunar</b> <b>cartilage,</b> tendons, and ligaments. To effectively replace the natural tissues with artificial materials, {{a number of significant}} engineering challenges like suitable elastic modulus, high mechanical strength, appropriate water content, low surface friction and wear are to be solved. Hydrogels have provided most of these demands until now. an articular cartilage,that is a kind of hydrogel containing 70 % water exhibits little wear under a load as high as several to a hundred megapascals and millions of cycles {{with a wide range of}} sliding velocities. Gong and co-workers have reported a unique method of obtaining hydrogels with extremely high mechanical toughness which is a composition of two networks-a polyelectrolyte and a neutral polymer (double-network hydrogel). Later on a number hydrogels with different characteristics have been designed for different various purposes. Some of them show low friction and low wear properties which opens a new era of soft and wet materials as substitutes for articular cartilage and other tissues. Studies on the surface sliding friction of various types of bulk hydrogel revealed very rich and complex frictional behavior In previous studies on the friction of gels against solid substrates in water, a complicated velocity dependence of the frictional stress was observed, and the frictional behavior was strongly dependent on the interfacial interaction between the gel and the solid substrate. On a repulsive surface such as a negatively charged polyelectrolyte gel on a piece of glass that has negative charges on its surface in water, we observed a monotonic increase in the friction with velocity. On an adhesive substrate, we often observed a distinct friction transition with velocity. The transition behavior was influenced by various parameters such as the chemical combination of the gel and the substrate, the viscosity of the aqueous liquid, the elastic modulus of the gel, and the normal strain (pressure) applied on the gel. This friction transition in liquids appears to be similar to the elasto hydrodynamic transition observed for solid friction in liquids. Mechanistic models have been proposed to explain the friction transition for adhesive and non adhesive interfaces. However, different hydrogels have different mechanical strength, swelling degree and chemical composition. So, it was not possible to compare the frictional characteristics of adhesive and non adhesive interfaces on a same platform. To overcome this problem using zwitterionic hydrogels can be an effective solution, which can be made adhesive and non-adhesive by altering the pH. Moreover,the swelling and mechanical properties of polyelectrolytes are susceptible to ionicstrength and pH of the swelling medium. Recently zwitterionic hydrogel composed of poly carboxymethyl dimethyl (methacryloyloxy) ethanaminium, inner salt (PCDME) is designed, which can keep its swelling and mechanical properties unchanged over a wide range of pH and ionic strength. This provides us an excellent opportunity to study the friction with various ionic strength and pH as well as to understand the adhesive and non adhesive interface in a microscopic viewこの博士論文全文の閲覧方法については、以下のサイトをご参照ください。[URL]...|$|E
