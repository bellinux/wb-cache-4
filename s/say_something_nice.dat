500|$|The prize {{has been}} criticized: British {{biologist}} Richard Dawkins {{said in his}} book The God Delusion that the prize was given [...] "usually to a scientist who is prepared to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>nice</b> about religion". [...] Sean M. Carroll, a research associate in the Department of Physics at the California Institute of Technology, criticized his colleagues for taking Templeton research grants when they did not support Templeton's beliefs. [...] Martinus J. G. Veltman, the 1999 Nobel laureate in physics, suggested the prize [...] "bridg the gap between sense and nonsense".|$|E

2500|$|This was {{repeated}} by US conservative media (such as The Blaze and Fox Nation) {{in an attempt}} to discredit the Occupy movement.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new take on Windsor v. the United States, a case on {{everyone}} 2 ̆ 7 s mind as this issue goes to print given the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent grant of certiorari in the same-sex marriage cases. Be warned, though. Academics usually come to bury opinions, not to praise them, so I 2 ̆ 7 m stepping out of role by <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>nice</b> about a Supreme Court opinion. But I think there 2 ̆ 7 s a bit of mad genius in Windsor and that academics have been too quick to dismiss its insights...|$|R
50|$|At the BLOBBYs, {{the fake}} Wilhelmina shows up to present Betty, but Daniel, who {{after getting a}} pep talk from Amanda of all people, changes his mind {{and goes to the}} awards. As expected, he {{presents}} Betty with the award and gets pelted with burritos and glasses. When Betty gets up to accept the plaque, she asks Daniel to stay and <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>nice</b> about him, but before she can finish her speech, Betty ends up getting pelted with burritos and glasses along with Daniel and ends up fleeing together. The following day, both Daniel and Betty are talking to each other again and agree to bury the hatchet, with Daniel telling Betty that he has stepped up his game by doing the researching and interviewing the stories on his own with less help.|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, the {{musician}} Vinicius Gageiro Marques (signed to the label Luaka Bop) posted to RLLMUK under his screen and artist name of Yoñlu the message [...] "Quick, someone <b>say</b> <b>something</b> really <b>nice</b> about my songs before I decide to KILL MYSELF". Despite receiving messages of support, and postponing his plans as a result, Marques did not post again and it emerged {{that he had}} committed suicide a few weeks later.|$|R
40|$|A longstanding goal of chemists {{has been}} to deeply analyze {{fundamental}} molecular parameters, such as vibrational frequencies and electronic properties, and basic chemical interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, {{in order to better}} understand increasingly complex molecules and molecular clusters. A mixture of jet-cooled laser spectroscopic techniques and ab initio quantum chemical calculations is applied for this purpose on the chromophore 9 -hydroxy- 9 H-fluorene- 9 -carboxylic acid (9 FCA) and its gas phase hydrogen bound clusters with various ligands. Discovery and exploration of systems exhibiting conformational flexibility is of particular interest. A somewhat novel multiple conformer system produced by variations in binding partner conformation rather than variations in chromophore conformation was observed spectroscopically; other similar systems were found computationally but without full experimental confirmation. i Acknowledgements I’d like to thank my family, friends, advisor, lab-mates, house-mates, casual acquaintances, etc. I’ve run out of time to write this, but imagine I’m <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>nice</b> about you. I would if I had time to. Really...|$|R
5000|$|Marques {{had first}} {{been shown to}} be suicidal in May 2006, when he posted to a thread he made onto RLLMUK stating [...] "Quick, someone <b>say</b> <b>something</b> really <b>nice</b> about my songs before I decide to KILL MYSELF." [...] However, due to generous words of support, he decided to [...] "postpone" [...] his suicide, and he {{frequently}} mentioned killing himself soon after that on the thread whilst sharing his songs to others up until his death.|$|R
60|$|Any man can be praised--and rightly praised. If he only {{stands on}} two legs he does {{something}} a cow cannot do. If a rich man can manage to stand {{on two legs}} for a reasonable time, it is called self-control. If he has only one leg, it is called (with some truth) self-sacrifice. I could <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>nice</b> (and true) about every man I have ever met. Therefore, I do not doubt I could find something nice about Lyons or Selfridge if I searched for it. But I shall not. The nearest postman or cab-man will provide me with just the same brain of steel and heart of gold as these unlucky lucky men. But I do resent the whole age of patronage being revived under such absurd patrons; and all poets becoming court poets, under kings that have taken no oath, nor led us into any battle.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{the game}} was up, and she was glad, Grizel said to herself, {{as they made their}} melancholy pilgrimage of what had once been an enchanted land. But she felt that Tommy had been very forbearing to her, and that she did not deserve it. Undoubtedly he had ordered her about, but in so doing had he not been making half-pathetic sport of his old self--and was it with him that she was annoyed for ordering, or with herself for obeying? And why should she not obey, when it was all a jest? It was as if she still had some {{lingering}} fear of Tommy. Oh, she was ashamed of herself. She must <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>nice</b> to him at once. About what? About his book, of course. How base of her not to have done so already! but how good of him to have overlooked her silence on that great topic! ...|$|E
