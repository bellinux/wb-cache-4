50|$|In 2002, in an {{even more}} drastic intervention, was {{completely}} demolished and rebuilt the tower, a <b>section</b> of the <b>dome,</b> the choir and reusing much of the original features atrium, although major structural modifications were introduced.|$|R
50|$|The first {{projection}} {{shows the}} dome becoming a dull grey, with cracks and breaks forming on the dome. Suddenly, the dome seems to crumble {{and fall into}} nothingness. Then, a green grid appears at the top <b>section</b> of the <b>dome,</b> accompanied with a loud humming sound.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{style of}} gavit {{consists of an}} oblong vault supported by double arches, with an erdik (lantern) center. This form {{was replaced by a}} square room with four columns, divided into nine <b>sections</b> with a <b>dome</b> in the center. The last evolution consists of a gavit without columns and with arched ceilings.|$|R
40|$|The Tanais Palaeobay {{was located}} in the {{northern}} periphery of the eastern Paratethys Sea during the Late Miocene. New data from the Safianovo <b>section</b> (Rostov <b>Dome,</b> South-West of Russia) confirm that skeletal limestones (coquinites) of the Merzhanovskaja Formation belong to the Congeria (Andrusoviconcha) amygdaloides navicula Zone of the upper Upper Maeotian (the Maeotian is a regional chronostratigraphic unit of the Upper Miocene). Correlation of reference sections of these Upper Maeotian deposits within the Rostov Dome results in pattern of the palaeobay transgression, which was punctuated. The relative importance of local and global controls on this trangsression is not yet clear...|$|R
5|$|Cairano first {{documented}} work is from December 24, 1489 {{with his}} commission for {{the cycle of}} twelve statues of the Apostles to be installed in the first dome {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Brescia. The installation of Cairano's cycle is contemporaneous with Tamagnino's installation of the twelve angels in the lower <b>section</b> of the <b>dome.</b>|$|R
50|$|Geodesic domes may be {{constructed}} from concrete sections, or may {{be constructed}} of a lightweight foam {{with a layer of}} concrete applied over the top. The advantage of this method is that each <b>section</b> of the <b>dome</b> is small and easily handled. The layer of concrete applied to the outside bonds the dome into a semi-monolithic structure.|$|R
50|$|The Church of the Archangels was {{constructed}} {{at the behest}} of King Levan of Kakheti (r. 1520-1574) in 1565 and frescoed by 1577. It is a cruciform domed church built chiefly of stone. Its design marries traditional Georgian masonry with a local interpretation of the contemporary Iranian architectural taste. The building has three entrances, one facing west, one facing to the south, and the third facing to the north. The interior is crowned with a dome supported by the corners of the sanctuary and two basic piers. The façade is divided into three arched <b>sections.</b> The <b>dome</b> sits on an arcaded drum which is punctured by eight windows.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, over {{millions}} of years, the salt will pierce and break through the overlying sediment, first as a dome-shaped and then a mushroom-shaped - fully formed salt diapir. If the rising salt diapir breaches the surface, it can become a flowing salt glacier. In cross <b>section,</b> these large <b>domes</b> may be anywhere from 1 to 10 km across, and extend as deep as 6.5 km.|$|R
5000|$|Since nine is {{the last}} number in the decimal system, Bahá'ís believe it symbolizes {{perfection}} and completion. Nine is also {{the value of the}} word Bahá (Arabic for [...] "glory") in Abjad numerology. Thus, many elements of the building occur in groups of nine. For example, there are nine entrances to the auditorium, nine interior alcoves, nine <b>dome</b> <b>sections,</b> and nine fountains in the garden area.|$|R
50|$|Projecting {{from the}} hipped, {{corrugated}} iron roof, centrally over the principal {{room of the}} building is a large dome clad with a copper and zinc alloy, known as Muntz metal sheeting. The metal sheets have been laid radiating from the central metal lantern in twelve sections with border mouldings which define the <b>sections.</b> The <b>dome</b> rests on a substantial sandstone drum which is pierced with twelve regularly spaced oculi or round windows, every second and third ones of which are blind openings. These are divided by slender pilasters which expand outward toward their base to form buttressing elements. The pilasters seem to support an entablature which surrounds the crown of the drum.|$|R

This section would also require the Director, Missile Defense Agency to establish within MDA a program office for cooperative missile defense efforts on the Iron Dome system to ensure long-term cooperation on this program.|$|R
50|$|The {{first four}} {{sections}} of the church are stone. The dome and altar are brick, with limestone trim at the corners. There are four buttresses on each side. The 18th-century <b>section</b> of the <b>dome</b> was designed by Teodoro Ardemans, chief architect of Philip V.The cupola was built by Feliciano, Julian and Casimiro Cornejo, who built churches near Madrid, Toledo and Guadalajara {{in the second half}} of 18th century.|$|R
40|$|Embryogenic {{cultures}} {{were initiated}} and established and somatic embryos produced in Pinus patula using thin <b>sections</b> from the <b>dome</b> of the vegetative shoot apex. Factors affecting initiation, basal medium and plant growth regulators were investigated.

50|$|The Kara Koyunlu {{mausoleum}} has a decagonal plan. Each of the monument's façades {{extend from}} the base of the tower until midway up the dome. Architecturally, it is divided into three sections; a lower section with an entrance, a middle section with two windows and decorative elements, and an upper <b>section</b> consisting a <b>dome.</b> The main body of the tower is constructed of tuff stone, while brick was used as the underlying material for the construction of the dome.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} bays in its façade; the largest central one flanked by {{miniature}} minarets is {{the entrance to}} the prayer hall.

It has 12 lancet windows with yellow and green stained glass, and the 16 ribbed <b>sections</b> forming the <b>dome</b> are visible within the prayer hall.|$|R
25|$|On 7 December 2007, a {{fragment}} of a red chalk drawing of a <b>section</b> of the <b>dome</b> of the basilica, almost certainly by the hand of Michelangelo, was discovered in the Vatican archives. The drawing shows a small precisely drafted section of the plan of the entabulature above two of the radial columns of the cupola drum. Michelangelo {{is known to have}} destroyed thousands of his drawings before his death. The rare survival of this example is probably due to its fragmentary state and the fact that detailed mathematical calculations had been made {{over the top of the}} drawing.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{inscription}} {{on the south}} gate, Haremlik was completed by Halil Bey {{in the month of}} Sha'aban year 900 (April, 1495). Nevertheless, this date does not represent the completion date of the entire building. The section completed in 1495 was an attachment to another structure on the north side which was built earlier. Next to the Harem, there used to stand the Selamlık, where the government offices were located. The Selamlık was suffered from dilapidation and the only remains today are the <b>section</b> with the <b>dome</b> and the <b>section</b> thought to be the hamam.|$|R

40|$|The {{predicted}} slosh damping {{values from}} Loci-Stream-VOF agree with experimental data {{very well for}} all fill levels {{in the vicinity of}} the baffle. Grid refinement study is conducted and shows that the current predictions are grid independent. The increase of slosh damping due to the baffle is shown to arise from: a) surface breakup; b) cascade of energy from the low order slosh mode to higher modes; and c) recirculation inside liquid phase around baffle. The damping is a function of slosh amplitude, consistent with previous observation. Miles equation under predicts damping in the upper <b>dome</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R

50|$|Initial {{approaches}} to moving fulldome imagery used wide-angle lenses, both 35 and 70 mm film, but the expense and ungainly {{nature of the}} film medium prevented much progress; furthermore, film formats such as Omnimax did not cover the full two pi steradians of the dome surface, leaving a <b>section</b> of the <b>dome</b> blank (though, due to seating arrangements, {{that part of the}} dome was not seen by most viewers). Later {{approaches to}} fulldome utilized monochromatic vector graphics systems projected through a fisheye lens. Contemporary configurations employ raster video projectors, either singly or grouped together to cover the dome surface with full-color images and animations.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{detail is}} that windows {{associated}} with the round <b>sections</b> of the <b>dome</b> are larger than those {{associated with the}} edges. One of the edgy sections is where the entrance is located while the altar {{is located on the}} opposite end, a round section. The two other round and edgy sections to the sides are identical in features [...] Through the perforations in the lantern, sunlight illuminates the dome through an oculi. Francesco Borromini had a talisman with the shape of a flying bee installed in the roof of the lantern as this is a symbol of the family of Urban VIII Barberini who patronized the construction of Sant'Ivo.|$|R
40|$|Hardware and {{software}} for the world's most powerful launch vehicle for exploration is being welded, assembled, and tested today in high bays, clean rooms and test stands across the United States. NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) continued to make significant progress in 2014 with more planned for 2015, including firing tests of both main propulsion elements and the program Critical Design Review (CDR). Developed {{with the goals of}} safety, affordability, and sustainability, SLS will still deliver unmatched capability for human and robotic exploration. The initial Block 1 configuration will deliver more than 70 metric tons of payload to low Earth orbit (LEO). The evolved Block 2 design will deliver some 130 metric tons to LEO. Both designs offer enormous opportunity and flexibility for larger payloads, simplifying payload design as well as ground and on-orbit operations, shortening interplanetary transit times, and decreasing overall mission risk. Over the past year, every vehicle element has manufactured or tested hardware. An RS- 25 liquid propellant engine was hotfire-tested at NASA's Stennis Space Center, Miss. {{for the first time since}} 2009 exercising and validating the new engine controller, the renovated A- 1 test stand, and the test teams. Four RS- 25 s will power the SLS core stage. A qualification five-segment solid rocket motor incorporating several design, material, and process changes was scheduled to be test-fired in March at the prime contractor's facility in Utah. The booster also successfully completed its Critical Design Review (CDR) validating the planned design. All six major manufacturing tools for the core stage are in place at the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, and have been used to build numerous pieces of confidence, qualification, and even flight hardware, including barrel <b>sections,</b> <b>domes</b> and rings used to assemble the world's largest rocket stage. SLS Systems Engineering accomplished several key tasks including vehicle avionics software and hardware build and testing, scale model acoustic and base heating tests. Construction of the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) began. Advanced development provided a look into the future of SLS. Shell buckling knockdown factor testing refined decades-old design margins that added thousands of pounds to rocket payloads. Adaptive manufacturing and structured light scanning development promised to cut the cost and time associated with manufacturing and testing. This paper will provide an overview of the progress made over the past year and provide a glimpse of 2015 milestones and beyond on the way to the first launch in 2018...|$|R
50|$|Languishing in {{the bowels}} of the Block Arcade for nearly half a century, the four {{trumpeters}} who now perform on the hour originally paraded as Christmas minstrels who serenaded the wrapping of Christmas presents purchased at the Block during the festive season. Following months of planning, these minstrels have been brought back to life as eighteenth-century Italian musicians costumed by the Block's Master Tailor, Adriano Carbone. In their new setting above the Block's dome, they play their tune on the hour. Concurrently, clock hands have been installed in the original circular decorations, which face both sides of the western <b>section</b> of the <b>dome.</b> This provides visitors and tourists advance notice to view these musicians at work.|$|R
50|$|The {{monolithic}} dome, for {{a number}} of reasons, is very energy efficient. The spherical <b>sections</b> of the <b>dome</b> offer minimal surface area for the volume they contain, so there is less surface for heat transfer with the outside air. The one piece construction of the monolithic dome also eliminates many of the seams through which air can leak, though this is mitigated to some degree in residential domes by the addition of multiple doors and windows. By placing the insulating foam {{on the outside of the}} concrete shell, the concrete acts as a Thermal mass inside the building, reducing interior temperature fluctuations far more than the traditional home's insulation inside of a brick or stone veneer.|$|R
50|$|In 1940 {{the blast}} waves of Allied bombing blew {{part of the}} windows away. On 24 May 1944, a bomb of {{combustible}} liquids entered the roof lantern of the dome. The fire could not be extinguished at that unreachable <b>section</b> of the <b>dome.</b> So the lantern burnt out and collapsed into the main floor. Between 1949 and 1953 a temporary roof was built to enclose the building. On 9 May 1967 the then still undivided Evangelical Church of the Union decided a committee for {{the reconstruction of the}} Supreme Parish and Cathedral Church, then located in East Berlin. The government of the Eastern German Democratic Republic did not oppose the work of the committee due to the concomitant inflow of Deutsche Marks.|$|R
50|$|The new <b>sections</b> {{underneath}} the <b>dome,</b> mostly contained within a kauri-wood-panelled sphere approximately 30 m across, will add 900 m² of additional exhibition space, {{as well as}} a 700 people event centre under the dome roof with a 48 m wide free span, new areas for tour and school groups including an auditorium in the sphere-bowl with 200 seats, {{as well as a}} restaurant with 450 seats. The bowl, which is the internal centre-piece of the expansion, weighs 700 tonnes and is suspended free-hanging from trusses spanning over it from the elevator four shafts located around it. A new 204-space underground parking garage at the rear has also been constructed to help cover the high demand for parking in the Auckland Domain.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{northeast}} {{portion of}} the Paraná Sedimentary Basin is distinguished by structural highs as the known Pitanga Dome, an uplifted structure identified in the last century. It represents a geological and evolutionary evidence of the Paraná Sedimentary Basin and has undergone inspired studies and intense exploration surveys. This study consists of a gravimetric survey in the Pitanga Dome area, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The Bouguer gravity anomalies have been identified and related to the structural high, sedimentary thickness, and the basement morphology. Processing and enhancement techniques were used for forward modeling based on previous studies. The three models from profiles <b>sectioning</b> the <b>dome</b> have a sedimentary thickness varying from 200 to 1. 250 meters. The adopted methodology has provided important results determining that the Pitanga Dome can be understood through rational 3 D visualization. The area {{can be interpreted as}} an undulating basement with thinning of sedimentary rocks related to deep features (structures) in the crust/mantle limit (Moho uplift). This characteristic is confirmed by the sedimentary layer thickening present throughout the surrounding area. The results also offer important insights and support for further studies concerning the genesis and evolution of this and other uplifted structures of the Paraná Sedimentary Basin...|$|R
50|$|A cross section, also simply {{called a}} section, {{represents}} a vertical plane {{cut through the}} object, {{in the same way}} as a floor plan is a horizontal section viewed from the top. In the section view, everything cut by the section plane is shown as a bold line, often with a solid fill to show objects that are cut through, and anything seen beyond generally shown in a thinner line. Sections are used to describe the relationship between different levels of a building. In the Observatorium drawing illustrated here, the <b>section</b> shows the <b>dome</b> which can be seen from the outside, a second dome that can only be seen inside the building, and the way the space between the two accommodates a large astronomical telescope: relationships that would be difficult to understand from plans alone.|$|R
50|$|The Emperor of the Imperial Dalek faction {{features}} in Remembrance of the Daleks. During the serial it is revealed that it contains the Kaled Davros, {{rather than a}} Dalek mutant. With only his head and partial torso visible, he is carried in a life support casing similar in design to the TV21 comic version of the Dalek Emperor. The travel machine has no appendages. A translucent hexagonal panel is located centrally {{on the front of}} the dome, in a position approximating that where an eye stalk would be mounted on a standard Dalek casing. A strip-light is mounted vertically behind it, which scans from side to side when the Emperor speaks. The front upper <b>section</b> of the <b>dome</b> is shown to operate like a visor, retracting upward and to the rear to reveal Davros within.|$|R
50|$|The Palace was {{commissioned}} by King Faisal II of Iraq in the 1950s as the new official royal residence following his planned wedding to Egyptian Princess Sabiha Fazila Khanim Sultan. The architect was J Brian Cooper of Birmingham, renowned for his modernist designs. The architect's watercolour, drawn by Lawrence Wright, shows that the palace was originally designed to be only the central <b>section</b> under the <b>dome</b> with two wings. The rest of the building, extending out from these three sections, was added under Saddam Hussein, including large bronze portrait heads on the roof. The fountain {{in front of the}} palace was part of the original design. The King would never live in the palace, as he was assassinated before his wedding in the 1958 coup. The palace was thus renamed the Republican Palace.|$|R
5000|$|The LH2 tank is {{the bottom}} portion of the ET.
