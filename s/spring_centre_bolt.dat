40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a plan for {{reducing}} lead-times and increasing profit of <b>Centre</b> <b>bolt</b> product by using value stream mapping. The <b>Centre</b> <b>bolt</b> product manufacturer is inefficient because it produces products in large batch quantities and has poor product flow as operations being departmentalized and departments are very far away from each other due to this increase in lead-times could cause a loss in the market share to its competitors. The <b>Centre</b> <b>bolt</b> product manufacturer must reduce its lead-times in order to remain competitive and continue its growth by providing quality products in a timely manner. A study will be carried out using value stream mapping to determine areas of potential improvement on the plant floor. A current state map will be developed and analyzed the areas that have potential for improvement. A future state map will then be created to suggest ways to reduce lead-times and increase profit. The map will include lean manufacturing methods to reduce wastes in the system; increasing profit and reducing lead-times. Current state and future state of manufacturing of a firm are compared and witnessed: 50 percent reduction in lead time, 4 percent reduction in processing time, 58. 5 percent reduction in WIP and 22 percent reduction in manpower required to perform same amount of work...|$|R

50|$|The forward wing {{was divided}} into two half spans so that their angles of {{incidence}} could be altered together to control pitch or independently for roll. The semi-spans were built around main box spars with spruce spar caps and plywood webs. Forward of the spar the wings were ply skinned, forming a D-shaped torsion box. Ribs were built from spruce trellis work. There was a secondary spar behind the main one and an over-all fabric covering. A trim tab was positioned inboard on {{the trailing edge of}} each half-span. The rear wing was similarly constructed but fixed in place. A long trailing edge flap could be raised, but not lowered, to steepen descents. The tips carried triangular endplate fins fitted with horn balanced rudders, <b>spring</b> <b>centred</b> and only opening outwards.
