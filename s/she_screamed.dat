5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when <b>she</b> <b>screamed</b> in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E

Its story is {{inspired}} by a real event: during the winter of 1850–1851, four children were playing in the forest. One of them, Jon, was just one and a half. They met a bear and its cub. Jon crawled to the bear, who caressed him and fed him berries. When the toddler's mother arrived, <b>she</b> <b>screamed,</b> which made the bears flee. The little boy had thought that the bears were big black dogs.|$|E

25|$|On December 21, 2015, Cosby sued supermodel Beverly Johnson for defamation, {{claiming}} {{that she told}} a false story in a Vanity Fair article. This {{was the first time}} Cosby had sued a woman who has claimed assault without being sued himself first. Cosby's lawsuit accuses Johnson of lying about the incident in which she says Cosby spiked a cup of cappuccino with an unknown drug. Realizing what was happening, Johnson said <b>she</b> <b>screamed</b> and cursed at him several times before Cosby dragged her out and hailed a cab for her. (No sexual contact by Cosby was alleged in Johnson's version of the event.) Allegedly, she also repeated the story in subsequent interviews and in her memoirs, released on August 25, 2015.|$|E

25|$|Poirot {{arrives in}} the middle of the night. They tell him the {{sequence}} of events and their suspicions regarding Mrs. Vanderlyn. Investigating the grass leading off the terrace, Poirot confirms that there are no footprints, which means that someone in the house committed the theft and the papers are still there. He questions each person in turn. He understands that Leonie saw no ghost; <b>she</b> <b>screamed</b> because Reggie sneaked up on her to snatch a kiss. Poirot suggests to Lord Charles that he end the party so that his guests will leave the house. The next morning the guests begin to leave. Lady Julia believes that her son Reggie stole the plans since he is very short of money and was not in his room for a period the previous evening. She promises Poirot that they will be returned within twelve hours if no further action is taken. Poirot agrees to this and they all depart.|$|E
500|$|In his defence, Tabak {{claimed that}} the killing had not been sexually motivated, and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after <b>she</b> <b>screamed</b> {{when he tried to}} kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a [...] "flirty comment" [...] and invited him to drink with her. He said that after <b>she</b> <b>screamed</b> he held his hands over her mouth and around her neck to silence her. He denied {{suggestions}} of a struggle, claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and [...] "... for about 20 seconds".

This first incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist Eric Clapton, bass player Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards.

500|$|Aiello {{was also}} {{believed}} to have masterminded the murder of Pasqualino [...] "Patsy" [...] Lolordo, Lombardo's successor {{as head of the}} Unione, who was killed in his home on January 8, 1929. Police alleged that Aiello suggested a truce with Lolordo, and when Lolordo invited Aiello into his home for a toast of friendship, Aiello and two others shot him to death. When police later questioned Lolordo's widow, <b>she</b> <b>screamed</b> when she was shown a photo of Aiello, but refused to explain why she was afraid and would not answer questions about him. Capone focused his retaliation against Moran by organizing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, a hit that wiped out the Gusenberg brothers, decimated Moran's forces and resulted in the loss of a significant amount of Aiello's support. Shortly afterward Aiello persuaded Capone killers Albert Anselmi and John Scalise to betray their employer and convinced Joseph [...] "Hop Toad" [...] Giunta, the new head of the Unione Siciliana, to support Aiello in eliminating Capone and taking control of the North Side of Chicago following the departure of Bugs Moran. However, Capone learned of Aiello's plot in April 1929 and killed all three men.|$|E
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As <b>she</b> <b>screamed</b> for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E

Also in the series, and in French, Asher tells Jean-Claude that he chose Julianna as a human servant to secure Jean-Claude's love and companionship. Asher's servant was chosen to appeal to and keep Jean-Claude in Asher's life. Jean-Claude begged the High Council to save Asher in exchange for 100 years of servitude. Jean-Claude would rather Asher live and hate him than die. As Julianna burned, <b>she</b> <b>screamed</b> not for Asher, but for Jean-Claude to save her, up to the very last she believed he would rescue her.|$|E
