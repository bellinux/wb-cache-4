500|$|Ben Roberts, a <b>Senior</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>at</b> Alcon Entertainment, was {{interested}} in adapting Moore's previous comic, Echo, but the rights to {{it had already been}} sold.

500|$|According to Joe Flaherty, <b>senior</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>at</b> MFS Investment Management, [...] "the idea of risk parity {{goes back}} to the 1990s". In 1996, Bridgewater Associates {{launched}} a risk parity fund called the All Weather asset allocation strategy. [...] Although Bridgewater Associates was the first to bring a risk parity product to market, they did not coin the term. Instead the term [...] "risk parity" [...] was first used by Edward Qian, of PanAgora Asset Management, when he authored a white paper in 2005. In 2008 the name Risk Parity (short for Risk Premia Parity) was given to this portfolio investment category by Andrew Zaytsev at the investment consulting firm Alan Biller and Associates. Soon, the term was adopted by the asset management industry. In time, other firms such as Aquila Capital (2004), Northwater, Wellington, Invesco, First Quadrant, Putnam Investments, ATP (2006), PanAgora Asset Management (2006), BlackRock (2009 - formerly Barclays Global Investors), 1741 Asset Management (2009), Neuberger Berman (2009), AllianceBernstein (2010), AQR Capital Management (2010), Clifton Group (2011), Salient Partners (2012), Schroders (2012), Natixis Asset Management (2013) and Allianz Global Investors (2015) began establishing risk parity funds.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{the group and}} their exposure through the singles [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome" [...] helped Fear of a Black Planet exceed the sales of their previous two albums, Yo! Bum Rush the Show and It Takes a Nation of Million to Hold Us Back at the time, 500,000 and 1.1 million copies, respectively. The latter single's lyrics were initially viewed by religious groups and the media as anti-semitic upon its release. The album contributed to hip hop's commercial breakthrough {{at the beginning of}} the 1990s, despite its limited radio airplay. Its success made Public Enemy the top-selling act, both domestically and internationally, for Def Jam Recordings at the time. Ruben Rodriguez, Columbia's <b>senior</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>at</b> the time, said in one of the label's press releases, [...] "What's happening with Public Enemy is unbelievable. The album is selling across the board to all demographics and nationalities". In a December 1990 article, Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael Corcoran discussed Public Enemy's commercial success with the album and remarked that [...] "more than half of the 2 million fans who bought [...] are white".|$|E

Gorski worked for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) for nine years {{in a variety of}} capacities. [...] At first he was hired as a consultant to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York in January 2000. [...] At the time there was lots of talk in local op-ed pages about the prospects of him serving as Superintendent of Buffalo Public Schools. [...] He also consulted for the Upstate Medicare Division. [...] By December 2000, he had been hired as a Vice President of HealthNow. He eventually became a <b>senior</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>at</b> HealthNow overseeing government affairs and lobbying, which made him responsible for government health programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare, Family Health Plus and Child Health Plus and earned him a 2007 salary of $398,302. Previously, Gorski was HealthNow's vice president of policy and representation. [...] In February 2009 HealthNow laid off 17 employees, including Gorski and three other senior executives, during a restructuring.
