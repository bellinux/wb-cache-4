5|$|After {{graduating from}} Saydel High School in 1983, Robinson {{spent the summer}} {{deciding}} on her career path as {{she worked as a}} department store cashier. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> her father to help him promote local races. Robinson persuaded him to let her compete in racing, and started off at Toledo Speedway driving a 1976 International semi-tractor. She participated in a five-lap sprint race where she finished second after leading for four laps, and took third position in the feature event. After this Robinson began racing full-time, and won 30 feature races before moving to the super-speedway division in April 1984; she faced early resentment from her male competitors. In the same year, Robinson moved from Iowa to Pennsylvania. Lefty believed Robinson's presence helped to increase fans' interest. Robinson's father acted as her mentor although her mother was against her racing because she felt she would be hurt in a crash.|$|E

Kinne encountered Francisco Parades Ordoñez, a Mexican-born American citizen, at a bar that night and accompanied {{him back to his}} room in Hotel La Vada. According to Kinne's account, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> Ordoñez to see photographs he offered to show her, but he soon began to make sexual advances toward her and she was forced to fire her gun at him in an attempt to protect herself. Kinne maintained later that she had had no intention of killing or harming Ordoñez, and had intended only to frighten him, but her bullets struck him in the chest and killed him. Responding to the sound of gunfire, hotel employee Enrique Martinez Rueda entered the room. Kinne fired again and hit Rueda in the shoulder. Wounded, Rueda fled the room, locking Kinne inside, and called the police.|$|E

Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Maathai learned of a {{government}} plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, {{and give it to}} political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage. Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until 16 August 1999, when the president announced that he was banning all allocation of public land.|$|E

Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England {{at the age of}} 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt [...] "closer to betterness" [...] in parties, where she was exposed to recreational drugs. She started to consume them and she felt better with them for [...] "a few short hours". [...] "They make you feel better, so the minute the high wears off you want more. But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. [...] "More happiness, more power or freedom or love if you know that it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [...] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad—much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." [...] She further explained that she wanted to create an [...] "honest video that showed both [...] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire." [...] The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' Vevo and YouTube accounts.|$|E

"Her chief characteristics… were {{a strong}} will and a {{singularly}} straightforward habit {{of thought and}} action", wrote her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova, who recalled Olga's hot temper and her struggles to keep it under control. [...] "Admirable qualities in a woman, these same characteristics are often trying in childhood, and Olga {{as a little girl}} sometimes showed herself willful and even disobedient." [...] Olga idolized her father and wore a necklace with an icon of St. Nicholas on her chest. She, like her siblings, enjoyed games of tennis and swimming with her father during their summer holidays and often confided in him when <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> him on long walks. Though she also loved Alexandra, her relationship with her mother was somewhat strained during her adolescence and early adulthood. [...] "Olga is always most unamiable about every proposition, though may end by doing what I wish", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on March 13, 1916. [...] "And when I am severe — sulks me." [...] In another letter to Nicholas during World War I, Alexandra complained that Olga's grumpiness, bad humor and general reluctance to make an official visit to the hospital where she usually worked as a Red Cross nurse made things difficult. Olga also occasionally found her mother's attitude trying. Parlormaid Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ersberg told her niece that the Tsar paid closer attention to the children than Alexandra did and Alexandra often was ill with a migraine or quarreled with the servants. In 1913, Olga complained in a letter to her grandmother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna about her mother's invalidism. [...] "As usual her heart isn't well", Olga wrote. [...] "It's all so unpleasant." [...] Queen Marie of Romania, who met Olga and her sisters when they visited Romania on a state trip in 1914, commented in her memoirs that the girls were natural and confided in her when Alexandra wasn't present, but when she appeared [...] "they always seemed to be watching her every expression so as to be sure to act according to her desires." ...|$|E
