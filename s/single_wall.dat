These represented a variety of places throughout the Vulcan desert-like Forge. The remaining sets used were either standing sets, or those which had been constructed for the previous two episodes. The exceptions to that were two sets to represent scenes on board Commander Shran's Andorian vessel. The Andorian bridge set, which had been used previously in the series, had a <b>single</b> <b>wall</b> brought out of storage in order to appear as a backdrop for Shran when he appears on the Enterprise viewscreen.

5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a <b>single</b> <b>wall</b> by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
40|$|In {{building}} acoustical laboratories, {{the sound}} transmission loss of structures is typically measured {{by placing the}} structure in an aperture between two reverberant rooms. It is known that {{the location of the}} specimen in the aperture can affect the results due to the niche - or tunneling - effect. In this paper, a Wave Based Model is used to numerically investigate the tunneling effect in sound transmission loss determination of <b>single</b> and double <b>walls.</b> The field variables (plate displacements and sound pressures) are expanded in terms of structural and acoustic wave functions. The model is validated with experimental results of lightweight <b>single</b> <b>walls.</b> A parametric study for single and double glazing shows that the position of the wall in the opening can significantly influence sound transmission loss below coincidence. As for <b>single</b> <b>walls,</b> the sound transmission loss of double walls is minimal when placed {{in the center of the}} niche opening and maximal for the edge positions. The difference, however, is greater for double walls in the mid-frequency range, where sound transmission is highly dependent on the angle of incidence. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Villach – Apart {{from a few}} {{fragments}} of wall, tower and evidence for a moat at the NW corner of the defensive circuit, none of the walls or gates now survive. Merian’s plan of the town in 1649 and the prospect view of 1679 show extensive fortifications.There were six gate towers and a defended bridgehead across the river Drau. The bridgehead was walled with a further gate-tower and a bastion in front. The river Drau curves round Villach, and on the river frontage there was a <b>single</b> <b>wall,</b> but on the western and southern sides there was a secondary wall with a series round towers. In front of this secondary wall there was a wide moat fed by the Drau.|$|E
25|$|The {{western part}} of the Abbey (nave, side aisles, porch and west tower) was {{preserved}} as a parish church and the remaining buildings were either re-used or demolished. The building suffered severely from neglect after the Reformation. The lead from the roof was removed, leading to decay and eventual collapse. The Norman clerestory was still in existence in the 17th century but it was later taken down and the roof was rebuilt immediately above the triforium. Considerable portions of the monastic buildings were still standing in 1743 but most have since been demolished, particularly when Thomas Telford built his A5 road through the Abbey grounds c.1836, removing much of the remaining evidence of the monastic layout. The old refectory pulpit is still visible across the road from the church and a <b>single</b> <b>wall</b> of an Abbey building, now an integral part of another building, remains. In the late 19th century the possibility of the Abbey becoming a cathedral was again considered, but legislation to that effect, drafted in 1922, was defeated by one vote in the House of Lords in 1926.|$|E

25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} nanostructures, because each adsorbate molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold. The terminal group is then modified to attract a specific material like a particular nanoparticle, wire, ribbon, or other nanostructure. In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be nanostructures attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align <b>single</b> <b>wall</b> carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. Dip pen nanolithography was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was passivated with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The polar solvent that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces. The nanotubes thus line up with the MHA-ODT boundary. Using this technique Chad Mirkin, Schatz and their co-workers were able to make complex two-dimensional shapes, a representation of a shape created is shown to the right.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{exploration}} of Yodfat has revealed traces of habitation {{from the early}} Hellenistic Period (4th and 3rd centuries BCE) through Roman times, though the town reached its zenith in the 1st century CE, prior to the revolt, when it expanded from {{the summit of the}} hill to its southern plateau. The same excavations have also revealed two, perhaps three, phases of fortification. The first, a wall surrounding the summit, was dated to the early 1st century BCE and attributed to the Hasmonean kings who had at the time expanded their influence to the Galilee. These were later bolstered by an additional parallel wall, while a massive tower stood {{at the center of the}} site and a small one to the west. The final phase of fortification took place at the turn of the millennium, with the construction of a wall that encompassed both the summit and the southern plateau, an area of roughly 47 dunams (approx. 12 acres). On the accessible northern side of Yodfat this was composed of a case-mate wall, turning into a single solid wall enforced with a few towers beyond the summit. The <b>single</b> <b>wall</b> closely followed the topography of the hill and in some cases directly abutted or incorporated existing buildings, suggesting it was constructed in haste, during stressful times. These may have been the revolt-era fortifications Josephus attributes to himself.|$|E

500|$|The city first spread {{towards the}} {{uninhabited}} {{eastern part of}} the islet, which explains why the current name for the southeast part of the city, near St. John's Fortress, is called Pustijerna. The name [...] "Pustijerna" [...] comes from the Latin statement [...] "post terra", which means [...] "outside the town". In the 9th and 10th centuries, the defensive wall enclosed the eastern portion of the city. When the sea channel separating the city from mainland was filled with earth in the 11th century, the city merged with the settlement on land, and soon, a <b>single</b> <b>wall</b> was built around the area of the present-day city core.|$|E
500|$|The fountains use {{over one}} million LEDs. [...] The inner surface of each tower uses 147 smaller screens {{with a total of}} 264,480 LED points (each with two red, one blue and two green LEDs).

500|$|The Sea Walls were architecturally {{similar to}} the Theodosian Walls, but of simpler construction. They were formed by a <b>single</b> <b>wall,</b> {{considerably}} lower than the land walls, with inner circuits in {{the locations of the}} harbours. Enemy access to the walls facing the Golden Horn was prevented by the presence of a heavy chain or boom, installed by Emperor Leo III [...] (r. 717–741), supported by floating barrels and stretching across the mouth of the inlet. One end of this chain was fastened to the Tower of Eugenius, in the modern suburb of Sirkeci, and the other in Galata, to a large, square tower, the Kastellion, the basement of which was later turned into the Yeraltı (underground) Mosque. At the same time, on the Marmara coast, the city's defence was helped by strong currents, which made an attack by a fleet almost impossible. According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin, it was for this reason that the Fourth Crusade did not attack the city from this side.|$|E
