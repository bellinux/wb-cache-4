40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{was developed for}} evaluating the basic safety parameters of high power lithium <b>soluble</b> <b>cathode</b> cells. This approach consists of performing {{a series of tests}} on each cell model during the design, prototype and production phases. Abusive testing is performed in a facility where maximum protection is given to test personnel...|$|E
40|$|One {{solution}} for providing a truly independent power source is to package, within the critical subsystem element, a primary battery that can remain dormant for time periods {{as long as}} the mission life, which can be 10 - 15 years, maximum. When primary power from the spacecraft solar array/battery system is interrupted, the backup battery system, which is connected through a diode to the power input line, would automatically support the load to avoid a power interruption to the critical load for a time period long enough to ensure that ground control could access the satellite and correct the anomaly by sending appropriate commands to the spacecraft. Critical subsystems identified for the application are telemetry and command circuits, volatile computer memory, attitude control circuits, and some critical payloads. Due to volume packaging and weight restrictions that exist on most spacecraft, coupled with the long storage periods required, lithium cell technology was selected for the backup power source. Because of the high energy density (200 - 400 Wh/kg), long shelf life, and load capability, <b>soluble</b> <b>cathode</b> primary lithium technology was chosen. The most important lithium cell properties that require detail characterization for this application are capacity loss, shelf life, and the voltage delay mechanism. These are functions of storage time and temperature. During storage, a passive film builds up on the lithium electrode. The film protects the lithium electrode from progressive capacity decay but requires time to break down when a load is applied. This phenomenon results in a depressed voltage during the period of film breakdown which can last from fractions of a second to minutes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} room temperature lithium cells employing solutions of LiBCI 4 in POCI 3 and LiAIC 14 in SOC 12 as electrolytes and poly-tetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) -bonded carbon black electrodes as cathodes. A novel feature of these cells is that during discharge the solvents, i. e., POCI~ and SOC 12, are electrochemically reduced and behave as <b>soluble</b> <b>cathodes.</b> Sealed prototype cells were fabricated using a polyethylene-polyester laminated bag container. Based on total cell weight, a prototype cell yielded an experi-mental energy density of 244 W-hr/Ib for a 57 -hr discharge rate (20 mA con-stant current; 1 mA/cm ~ current density). The performance of these cells is also compared {{with the performance of}} prototype lithium-organic electro-lyte-graphite monofluoride and lithium-inorganic electrolyte-tetracarbon monofluoride cells. Recently, solutions of l i thium-inorganic salts (e. g., LiBCI~, LiA 1 C 14, etc.) in phosphorous oxychlorid...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of a moderate temperature Na battery was studied. This battery is {{to operate at}} a temperature {{in the range of}} 100 - 150 C. Two kinds of cathode were investigated: (1) a <b>soluble</b> S <b>cathode</b> consisting of a solution of Na 2 Sn in an organic solvent and (2) an insoluble S cathode consisting of a transition metal dichalcogenide in contact with a Na(+) ion conducting electrolyte. Four amide solvents, dimethyl acetamide, diethyl acetamide, N-methyl acetamide and acetamide, were investigated as possible solvents for the <b>soluble</b> S <b>cathode.</b> Results of stability and electrochemical studies using these solvents are presented. The dialkyl substituted amides were found to be superior. Although the alcohol 1, 3 -cyclohexanediol was found to be stable in the presence of Na 2 Sn at 130 C, its Na 2 Sn solutions did not appear to have suitable electrochemical properties...|$|R
40|$|Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) {{batteries}} are postulated as next-generation {{electrochemical energy storage}} devices due to their increased storage capabilities. However, challenges persist from the polysulfide-shuttle effect at the <b>cathode.</b> <b>Soluble</b> sulfur-based species in the cathode cross over to the lithium anode through the separator leading to fading capacity with cycling. This has spurred continuous effort by the scientific community to develop novel cathodes where sulfur species can affix better. A conductive nanostructured graphene network is a suitable candidate that {{can serve as a}} scaffold for holding sulfur nanoparticles. Here, a one-pot synthesis of chemically reduced graphene oxide networks prepared from easily accessible graphene oxide is demonstrated. The solution-based method simply allows for impregnation of the graphene oxide network with sulfur nanoparticles through a careful manipulation of pH of the chemical environment. Two routes were chosen for the precipitation of such sulfur nanoparticles: firstly, the dissolution of sulfur in sodium hydroxide into polysulfides followed by acidification and secondly, the acidification of sodium thiosulfate from alkaline media into sulfur nanoparticles. Both graphene oxide materials from the two routes were treated with sodium borohydride to achieve conductive graphene. The second route, with the sulfur nanoparticles derived from the acidification of sodium thiosulfate with chemically reduced graphene oxide, demonstrated favorable electrochemical behavior, showing promise as electrode material for Li-S batteries...|$|R
