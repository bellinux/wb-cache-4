The formula was tested by having subjects run on a force treadmill (which is a treadmill that contains a force plate to measure ground reaction forces (GRF)). Figure 1 shows approximately what the force plate readout looks like for the duration of three steps. While this equation has proved to be fairly accurate, the study was limited in the sense that data was collected by a force plate that only measured vertical GRF rather than horizontal GRF. This led some people to the false pretense that simply exerting a greater vertical (perpendicular) force to the ground would lead to greater acceleration, which is far from correct (See Morin studies below).|$|E

The PHA:works with councils to ensure smoking-related laws are enforced; funds a range of support to smokers who want to quit; educates young people to not start smoking, through programmes like 2 ̆ 7 Teenage Kicks 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Smokebusters 2 ̆ 7.

" It {{emphasized the importance}} of technology transfer as a driver of successful innovation to fuel economic growth, create jobs, and make U. S. industries more competitive in a global market. In response to this memorandum, NASA developed a 5 -year plan for accelerating its own technology transfer activities. This plan outlines key objectives for enhancing NASA's ability to increase the rate, volume, and quality of technology transfers to industry, academia, and other Government agencies. By doing so, we are increasing the economic impact and public benefit of Federal technology investments. In addition, NASA established technology transfer as a key element of one of its Agency High Priority Performance Goals: "Enable bold new missions and make new technologies available to Government agencies and U. S. industry. "What does this mean to you? In the broadest sense, NASA defines technology transfer as the utilization of NASA's technological assets- technologies, innovations, unique facilities and equipment, and technical expertise- by public and private sectors to benefit the Nation. So, if your job involves developing new technologies, writing new software, creating innovative ways to do business, performing research, or developing new technical capabilities, you could be contributing to Kennedy Space Center's (KSC) technology transfer activities by creating the technological assets that may one day be used by external partners. Furthermore, anytime you provide technical expertise to external partners, you're participating in technology transfer. The single most important <b>step</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> to support the technology transfer process is to report new technologies and innovations ro the Technology Transfer Office. This is the critical first step in fueling the technology transfer pipeline. This is also a requirement for all Federal employees (see NPD 2091. 1 B) and most NASA contractors. Detailed information on when, where, and how ro report new technology is provided on the following page. In addition, it's important that all detailed-oriented discussions about technology between NASA and external partners are documented or that they occur under formal agreements such as Space Act Agreements and Nondisclosure Agreements. Our office <b>can</b> assist <b>you</b> in putting these agreements into place, protecting NASA's interests, and providing the means to accurately measure the Agency's technology transfer activities.

Eating healthy food and being physically active are two of the most important <b>steps</b> that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> to improve your health. To help you do this, follow the Healthy Eating Guidelines, use the Food Pyramid Guide and the Physical Activity Guidelines. Healthy eating is about getting the correct amount of nutrients – protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals you need to maintain good health. Foods that contain the same type of nutrients are grouped together on each of the shelves of the Food Pyramid. This gives you a choice of different foods from which to choose a healthy diet. Following the Food Pyramid as a guide will help you get the right balance of nutritious foods within your calorie range. Studies show that we take in too many calories from foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt, on the Top Shelf of the Food Pyramid. They provide very little of the essential vitamins and minerals your body needs. Limiting these is essential for healthy eating. At different stages in your life you have different daily nutrient requirements. These depend on your age, whether you are male or female and how active you are. While the general number of servings for adults and children over 5 years of age is given for each shelf of the Food Pyramid, where there are different requirements, the recommended number of servings is highlighted underneath the Food Pyramid picture on pages 8, 10, 12 and 14.
