40|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reduction}} {{in the incidence of}} <b>serious</b> <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> in industry, the failures that do occur are attracting greater public concern. Some reports of inquiries into failures have included statements that engineers should be more broadly educated. Other reports appear to indicate the opposite. This paper is an attempt to review the evidence available from the inquiries of failures in order to define the implications for the education and training of engineers and of managers. ...|$|R
5|$|At 11:10, V./LG 1 Bf 110s {{took off}} in advance of a raid by KG 54, {{possibly}} to tempt RAF fighters into battle before the main assault, so the RAF {{would be out of}} position. The bombers' mission was cancelled. The order did not reach V./LG 1 who continued to their target area. The 23 Bf 110s continued to the target of Portland. They ran into No. 601 Squadron RAF Hurricanes and lost six Bf 110s destroyed and three damaged. Only one Hurricane was shot down and another damaged. A second source states only four Bf 110s were destroyed, whilst a third gives the loss of five destroyed and five damaged. The Zerstörergeschwader optimistically claimed 30 RAF fighters destroyed (in reality RAF fighter losses in aerial combat amounted to 13 throughout the entire day), for a loss of 13 Bf 110s. The morning's effort had been a fiasco. The attacks showed a <b>serious</b> German <b>technical</b> <b>failure</b> in air-to-air communication.|$|R
30|$|In 2004, the European Commission {{produced}} Railway Safety Directive 49 / 2004 /EC [3], {{in order}} to define Common Safety Targets (CSTs) and to improve, where possible, system safety levels. The Directive stipulates that Member States are duty-bound to conduct an independent investigation {{in order to}} improve rail safety and prevent accidents. In addition to serious accidents, the investigating body may conduct investigations into accidents and incidents which, under slightly different circumstances, could have resulted in more <b>serious</b> accidents, including <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> in structural rail sub-sections or interoperability components of the trans-European high-speed or conventional rail systems. The Railway Safety Directive 49 / 2004 /EC requires the safety of railway transport to be defined according to acceptable individual risks to LX users (Article 7, § 4 a) [3]. The Directive expects the development of procedures and methods for risk evaluation and assessment (Article 6, § 3 a). The CSTs define safety levels that must at least be reached in each Member State by different parts of the railway system and by the system as a whole. These CSTs are expressed as risk acceptance criteria for individual risks (passengers, maintenance staff including subcontractors, LX users and others, and unauthorized persons) and societal risks.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> of the Bravo pH test {{in a population}} with nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: Over {{the course of a}} year, we prospectively studied a population of 66 nonerosive reflux disease patients who received a Bravo pH test. The number and frequency of all <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> were documented, quantified and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients, {{with a mean age of}} 41. 7 years, were studied. <b>Technical</b> <b>failures</b> occurred in 15. 15 % of the sample. The most frequent failures were due to poor data reception (4. 5 %), early dislodgement (4. 5 %) and capsule removal (6. 1 %). CONCLUSION: The Bravo capsule pH test involves a low but non-negligible rate of technical problems, a fact that must always be considered by physicians...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAims: we aim from {{a review}} of our early and late {{experience}} of secondary intervention for <b>technical</b> <b>failures,</b> to examine and describe the impact of endovascular and open interventions. Methods: 108 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs) repaired endoluminally between 1995 - 2001 were analysed. In our early experience, during 1995 / 96 home made pre-expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts fixed with Palmaz stents were used (n = 26). In our later experience, 1997 / 2001 Talent (n = 70) or Zenith endografts (n = 12) were used. All cases underwent spiral CT at 5 days and 6 monthly intervals post-op. Angiography was performed when further intervention was intended. All <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> requiring intervention or not were studied. Results: there were 28 (26 %) <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> identified of which 14 of 26 (54 %) occurred in our early experience, and 14 of 86 (16 %) occurred in our later experience (p < 0. 05). Eleven in all required open conversion {{at the time of}} endovascular repair. Our study cohort were the remaining 17 cases requiring secondary intervention, seven were from our early experience and 10 from our later experience. There were 12 endoleaks, including two as a result of graft migration, two graft occlusions, two graft distortions and one graft infection. Overall 10 (66 %) <b>technical</b> <b>failures</b> were treated by endoluminal repair and seven (34 %) by open methods. However, in our later experience significantly more endoluminal techniques (80 %) were used (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: <b>technical</b> <b>failure</b> rates were significanlty higher in our earlier experience. Open repair, which was a feature of our early experience, has been avoided over the final 3 years. Instead, endoluminal techniques were used without further morbidity or mortality. Aneurysm rupture has not so far been experienced in this experience. Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg 26, 287 - 292 (2003...|$|R

25|$|In addition, {{the limited}} {{availability}} of recovery vehicles and spare parts meant that broken down tanks and other non-combat losses often {{could not be}} repaired.

The corps lost 201 T-26 tanks and all flame-throwing tanks and artillery tractors by 7 July 1941. A further 186 T-26 tanks were lost to <b>technical</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|R
