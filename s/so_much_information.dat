Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

Deriviere disclosed that players would not hear the main theme {{until the end of}} the game, given that it is scattered in pieces through the rest of the score to reflect the nature of the game and the story of Nilin. For his work, Deriviere was awarded the 2013 IFMCA award for Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media.

500|$|Straczynski viewed [...] "sitting {{down and}} ferreting out [...] story" [...] as {{a return to}} his journalistic roots. He also drew on his {{experience}} writing crime drama for the procedural elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> about the case {{that it was difficult}} to work out how to tell it. To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time—1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." [...] Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was {{the only person in the}} story without a hidden agenda, and it was her tenacity—as well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system—that had attracted him to the project. He said, [...] "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did." ...|$|E

Lon Grahnke of Chicago Sun-Times reacted positively toward the episode, {{calling it a}} [...] "stunning" [...] season finale. Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Gethsemane" [...] two stars out of four, noting that it [...] "withholds <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> that it barely qualifies as a complete episode". Vitaris felt that the large degree of ambiguity in the episode's script left the actors' performances [...] "curiously neutral", adding that the cast [...] "struggle manfully" [...] with the material. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+, noting that [...] "everything here has a ring of familiarity to it". Handlen felt that the episode's premise and ending were poorly executed, as [...] "trying to balance possible truths while maintaining the plausibility of both is incredibly difficult to pull off on a long-running show", adding that the episode [...] "comes down on the only {{side of the fence}} it really could" [...] given that [...] "there've been too many scenes of shape-changing bounty hunters and mystical alien healers to really let this idea play out know [...] in any real way". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, noting that while it [...] "attempts to do too much", it [...] "has a passion behind it which makes it gripping". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's cliffhanger ending, centering on the apparent death of Mulder, was too unbelievable, noting that it would be out of character for him to grow so disillusioned as to take his own life. In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Gethsemane" [...] (along with [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E

Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly ... Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been". James Verniere of The Boston Herald gave the film a B-, describing the work as a new genre of [...] "arthouse guerrilla nostalgia", while lamenting Che as the film version of Alberto Korda’s iconic 1960 photograph Guerrillero Heroico. In Verniere's view, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> was missing, that he recommended one first see The Motorcycle Diaries to fill in the background. In her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "With its lyrical beauty and strong performances, the film can be riveting. Its excessive length and rambling scenes also make it maddening. It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing". Anthony Lane, in his review for The New Yorker, wrote, [...] "for all the movie’s narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise—of an interest brilliantly explored. How else to explain one’s total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?" [...] Taking a more positive stance, film critic Chris Barsanti compared Che to a [...] "guerrilla take on Patton", calling it [...] "an exceptionally good" [...] war film, which rivaled The Battle of Algiers in its [...] "you-are-there sensibility". Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and addressed the film's length: [...] "You may wonder if the film is too long. I think there's a good reason for its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad".|$|E

Because a typical voter can only absorb <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> during a relevant election period, Stevens described [...] "unfair corporate influence" [...] as the potential to outspend others, to push others out of prime broadcasting spots and to dominate the [...] "marketplace of ideas".
