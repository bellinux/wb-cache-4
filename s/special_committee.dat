5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A <b>special</b> <b>committee</b> was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's {{vision of a}} grand {{national}} capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a <b>special</b> <b>committee</b> charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What {{became known as the}} McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E

5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a <b>special</b> <b>committee</b> convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
5|$|Despite these efforts, on 21February {{it became}} clear just how {{fundamentally}} opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in {{the unity of the}} church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a <b>special</b> <b>committee</b> for that purpose in March. However, on 15November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement {{with the rest of the}} Assembly to Parliament, and on 11December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.|$|E

5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the <b>Special</b> <b>Committee</b> on Aging.|$|E

The resulting Constitution of Massachusetts was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a <b>special</b> <b>committee,</b> then ratified by the people; and was also the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive – though restrained by an executive council – with a partial (two-thirds) veto, and a separate judicial branch.|$|E

It was further permitted to summon witnesses, examine records, and to investigate all state and local government organizations to recommend further mechanisms to affect efficiency and economy. White was appointed to the committee, which consisted of the speaker of the House of Delegates, the president of the West Virginia Senate, and two members from each house.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} (OPV) is an {{attenuated}} vaccine, {{produced by the}} passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a <b>special</b> <b>committee</b> on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E

40|$|Using an {{original}} data set gathered from filings with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, this Article tests the prevailing view in corporate law that <b>special</b> litigation <b>committees</b> invariably decide to dismiss shareholder derivative litigation. It demonstrates that (1) <b>special</b> litigation <b>committees</b> decide to pursue or settle claims much {{more frequently than}} heretofore recognized; (2) <b>special</b> litigation <b>committees</b> do not otherwise let defendants off the hook when pursuing or settling claims, {{in view of the}} financial recovery to the company in either scenario; (3) most shareholder claims subject to the authority of <b>special</b> litigation <b>committees</b> end up settled, not dismissed,- and (4) claims subject to the authority of a <b>special</b> litigation <b>committee</b> are resolved faster than standard derivative claims, indicating that the <b>special</b> litigation <b>committee</b> may serve as a form of alternative dispute resolution. Furthermore, the pattern of financial recoveries to companies suggests that <b>special</b> litigation <b>committees</b> may be more responsive to the merits of shareholder claims than has been recognized before. The view that <b>special</b> litigation <b>committees</b> behave too predictably has underwritten doubts about the ability of independent and disinterested directors to police conflict of interest transactions generally. The findings presented in this Article show that the prevailing view in the corporate law literature about <b>special</b> litigation <b>committee</b> behavior is an unsound basis for generalizing about how independent and disinterested directors behave...|$|R
