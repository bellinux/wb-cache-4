5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} <b>snarl,</b> and is blindfolded by a drooping cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|When first {{introduced}} {{to the rest of}} the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may <b>snarl</b> and bat the cubs away.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a <b>snarl</b> with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jazz, Sideswipe and Cliffjumper track Grimlock's {{signature}} to the Sea of Rust {{to locate}} {{him and his}} Lightning Strike Coalition Force composed of Slug, Sludge, <b>Snarl</b> and Swoop. After exploring the area and eliminating dozens of Decepticons, Jazz and Cliffjumper find Sludge's dead body and an enormous tower in a lake of Energon firing a bright beam into Cybertron's orbit. They find the Decepticon scientist Shockwave at the scene and discover it is a Space Bridge. Shockwave escapes the ensuing confrontation, and Cliffjumper becomes trapped, leaving Jazz to fight off the incoming Insecticon swarm. Cliffjumper overloads the tower, and he and Jazz are saved from the Tower's explosion by Sideswipe. They report back to Optimus, Ironhide, Ratchet and Perceptor.|$|E
5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, <b>snarl</b> call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.|$|E
25|$|There {{once was}} a fourth primary pantheon, the Eastern Pantheon, based on the Greek pantheon led by Zeus. These deities {{were killed by the}} <b>Snarl</b> and so had no role in the re-creation of the world; only people who are privy to the story of the <b>Snarl</b> have ever even heard of them.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{nothing in}} the {{exhibition}} exemplifies this better than Gottfried Helnwein's 'Mickey'. His portrait of Disney's favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious. His broad smile, encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more a <b>snarl</b> or leer. This is Mickey as Mr. Hyde, his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.|$|E
25|$|I {{watched his}} face, {{and it was}} as grave and serene as that of a man writing in his own library. He was the very {{embodiment}} of tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid the animal-like babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling <b>snarl</b> of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of nervousness or haste.|$|E
40|$|This article reports {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation on yarn <b>snarling</b> and balloon fluttering in ring spinning. Yarn <b>snarling</b> and balloon fluttering affect yarn breakage in ring spinning. The theoretical model has incorporated the tangential component of air drag on a ballooning yarn, which was ignored in previous models. The {{results show that}} yarn <b>snarling</b> happens in the balloon when the ratio of yarn length in the balloon to balloon height is greater than a specific value {{that depends on the}} yarn type and count. Yarn tension experiences an obvious change before and after yarn <b>snarling.</b> The balloon flutter appears between normal balloons while the balloon loops are changing. Fluttering balloon shapes that oscillate periodically between two and three loop configurations as yarn tension varies periodically have also been observed experimentally. <br /...|$|R

25|$|Information on {{fennec fox}} social {{behavior}} is mainly based on captive animals. The basic social unit {{is thought to}} be a mated pair and their offspring, and the young of the previous year are believed to remain in the family even after a new litter is born. Playing behavior is common, including among adults of the species. Fennec foxes make a variety of sounds, including barking, a purring sound similar to that of a domestic cat, and a <b>snarl</b> if threatened.|$|E
25|$|Redcloak (Goblin Cleric of the Dark One, Lawful Evil): Xykon's main ally, he is a {{high priest}} of his deity and {{commander}} of the goblinoids that serve as the lich's minions. He is motivated by concern for the goblin people and their poor lot in life, believing that harnessing {{the power of the}} <b>Snarl</b> will allow his god to bargain for a better place for all goblins. Unlike his boss, Redcloak is a patient planner and a competent leader, and has shown an inclination for scientific thought.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers <b>snarl,</b> growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E

25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a <b>snarl</b> and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.|$|E
25|$|In July 2001, NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration asked Whiting {{to search}} for the wreck of the U.S. Navy {{submarine}} , which sank 15 nautical miles (28km) off Cape May, New Jersey, in September 1920. Whiting, which had just completed a summer in port at Norfolk, Virginia, and was bound for Boston, Massachusetts, to conduct hydrographic survey operations in New England, paused off Cape May in late July 2001 {{to search for}} the wreck. Whitings survey department approached the project as it would any typical hydrographic survey. Information on snags – obstructions on the ocean bottom that <b>snarl</b> fishing nets and gear – that local recreational fishermen had reported and reports of possible locations of the wreck from divers that had visited it provided Whiting with possible targets for her search. After her crew had prepared a plan for a systematic search, Whiting moved from target cluster to target cluster, mapping the ocean bottom using sidescan sonar. After eight hours of searching, Whiting found the wreck of S-5 directly over one of the suspected targets, made a sonar image of the wreck, and recorded its exact location. Whiting then made several more passes over the wreck to acquire additional images of it at various angles before leaving the scene. NOAA donated the sonar data NOAAS Whiting gathered to the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, for archiving and display.|$|E
25|$|For {{display of}} {{extraordinary}} heroism {{in the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} during the diving operations in connection with the sinking in a depth of water 304 feet, of the U.S.S. F-4 with all on board, as a result of loss of depth control, which occurred off Honolulu, T.H., on 25 March 1915. On 17 April 1915, William F. Loughman, chief gunner's mate, U.S. Navy, who had descended to the wreck and had examined one of the wire hawsers attached to it, upon starting his ascent, and when at a depth of 250 feet beneath the surface of the water, had his lifeline and air hose so badly fouled by this hawser that he was unable to free himself; he could neither ascend nor descend. On account of the length of time that Loughman had already been subjected to the great pressure due to the depth of water, and of the uncertainty of the additional time he would have to be subjected to this pressure before he could be brought to the surface, it was imperative that steps be taken at once to clear him. Instantly, realizing the desperate case of his comrade, Crilley volunteered to go to his aid, immediately donned a diving suit and descended. After a lapse of time of 2 hours and 11 minutes, Crilley was brought to the surface, having by a superb exhibition of skill, coolness, endurance and fortitude, untangled the <b>snarl</b> of lines and cleared his imperiled comrade, so that he was brought, still alive, to the surface.|$|E
