40|$|Abstract. To {{carry out}} {{maintenance}} {{and assessment of}} reinforced concrete (RC) structures, {{a good understanding of}} the effect of the change in bond behaviour of reinforcement during service life is essential. Steel reinforcement is subjected to corrosion due to carbonation and chloride attack. The former ordinarily induces uniform corrosion, the latter induces generally localised corrosion at cracks level. The existence of cracks and the crack width affect the starting points of corrosion, as indicated by the results of the exposure test carried out by Shiessl et al. [1]. Corresponding techniques, such as non-destructive in-situ testing for concrete cover thickness, permeability and the positions of the reinforcing bars, are helpful to model the real behaviour. Cracked portion around the tensile reinforcement in a flexural member can be considered to be equivalent to a concrete member having a single reinforcement subjected to pull-out force at both ends. In this paper a damage process model is proposed based on <b>slip</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in order to evaluate the effective load capacity...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{tests have}} been carried out at 20, 650 and 850 °C over a range of {{frequencies}} on SRR- 99 single crystals under both pure mode I and mixed mode I/II loading conditions in vacuum at a stress-ratio of 0. 5. At low temperatures, predominantly slip band crack growth (which remained effectively in-plane) was observed, although the scale of the facets increased under mixed mode loading. At high temperatures mixed mode loading resulted in deflected co-operative <b>slip</b> <b>crack</b> growth along a direction that experienced the maximum opening mode (analogous to Stage II crack growth). Some pore cavitation and interlinking was observed at the highest temperatures and lowest frequencies. The effect of increased dwell time at 850 °C was to increase crack growth rates compared with the highest frequency test, although differences in the magnitude of these effects were seen for the two different loading conditions. The increased constraint experienced by the deflected crack offers a partial explanation for this...|$|E
40|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 3 rd period, which the author feels {{inclined}} to characterize as a overblown time, studies and reports much increased in several branches, geology, disaster science, civil engineering, soil mechanics and so on. Investigation efforts increased and experiments were repeated, and analysis became minute and acute. 　At the same time, in some cases, complicated and rather unpractical logics appeared in their opinions. Conception high, meaning obscure. In the geological field flow and emplacement mechanism of Ito pyroclastic flow of Aira caldera is reported and concerning the different pyroclastic flows in the Kokubu area and the neighbouring zone, some other members as S. Aramaki, R. Ota, and T. Tsuyuki publish their opinions. Tuffaceous and pumiceous sediments in Kakuto Basin were also investigated by some persons. Here they suffered from considerably big earthquake disasters of seismic intensity 5 - 6 in Feb. 1968. Many investigation data were obtained through these events. Formerly we had scarcely the data of Shirasu behaviour in seismic shock. 　These data well revealed a few secrets of Shirasu nature. The earthquake damages were found of various types as mountainside <b>slip,</b> <b>crack</b> and settlement of river banks, sand boiling, and destruction of structures &c. The auther picked up mainly Shirasu damage reports concerned. Shirasu in this environs is not original but there are Shirasu like sediments of tuffaceous materials and of Ito pumice flow poured into the past lake. They are weeker than usual Shirasu and this is the most reason that the damages, especially that of the mountainside were comparativly large for the seismic intensity. Cut cliffs were safer to the mountainside. As for the engineering department, studies on fill-up ground and reclamation works will become important, for seismic shock influece to disturbed Shirasu material is not made clear yet. The auther's rough introduction to the reports of Shirasu studies has now come to an end...|$|E

A bond-link element is used to account for {{the influence of}} the bond slip between the concrete and the reinforcing steel. Following a previous work, the writers treat crack spacing as a strain localization problem. A new numerical model for prediction of crack spacing in reinforced concrete is applied. It is assumed that the deformation pattern of crack spacing consumes the least energy among all kinematically admissible deformations, and the energy minimization approach is applied to predict crack spacing. To simplify the problem, a lattice model is used, in which the cracking process is represented by the damage of the concrete bar elements. The influence of the bond <b>slip</b> on the <b>cracking</b> patterns have been studied through three numerical examples.

The {{variables in the}} study were manufacturer (Marshall Industries Composites, Inc. [M 1] and Corrosion Proof Products/Hughes Brothers [M 2]), bar size (No. 5 and 6), cover (2 and 3 bar diameters), and embedment length (10 through 47 in.). Eighty-four inverted half-beam bond specimens were tested while monitoring load, loaded-end <b>slip,</b> free-end <b>slip,</b> <b>cracking,</b> and acoustic emissions on the embedded bar and concrete. Neither bar was recommended for immediate use as reinforcement in bridge decks. The M 1 rebar exhibited cracking and splitting along the outer coating of the bar which damaged bar deformations.

The M 2 rebar exhibited a smaller COV for tensile test bar failures and a similar ultimate load average when compared to the manufacturer's reported strength.

30|$|The crack {{nucleation}} under fatigue loading largely determines {{the resistance to}} HCF of Ti alloys (Nicholas 2006). Since yield strength is the indicative of the resistance to <b>slip</b> deformation inducing <b>crack</b> nucleation on smooth surface, it is therefore {{one of the most}} important parameters affecting the HCF resistance (Jung et al. 2014; Jeong et al. 2013). As in the case of tensile behavior, the microstructure can have a significant influence on the HCF resistance of Ti 64 alloy. For the mill-annealed Ti 64 specimen, smaller primary α grain tends to improve the HCF resistance since yield strength increases with decreasing primary α grain size. Higher applied stress is then required to initiate a crack in primary α grain by <b>slip</b> band <b>cracking</b> (Lucas and Konieczny 1971; Bowen and Stubbington 1973). The smaller primary α grain also induces higher density of α/α grain boundaries, which may increase the resistance to HCF by retarding the crack growth with the grain boundaries acting as microstructural barriers (Demulsant and Mendez 1995). For the β-annealed Ti 64 specimen, the microstructural factors affecting the HCF behavior include the sizes of colony, α platelet and prior β grain. Smaller sizes of colony and prior β grain in the β-annealed Ti 64 specimen increase the resistance to HCF by reducing effective slip length, as in the mill-annealed counterpart (Lütjering 1998; Ziaja et al. 2001; Lucas and Konieczny 1971; Bowen and Stubbington 1973; Demulsant and Mendez 1995). The narrower aligned α platelets within colonies can further suppress the <b>crack</b> initiation by <b>slip</b> band <b>cracking,</b> since the crack needs to cross through more of the β ribs in the aligned α platelets (Eylon and Pierce 1976; Bania et al. 1982; Ruppen et al. 1979). As in the mill-annealed Ti 64 specimen, colony boundaries and prior β grain boundaries in the β-annealed specimen can act as microstructural barriers for crack to grow, improving the resistance to HCF.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with some aspects of nonuniform stressing above a deep creeping portion of a fault zone prior to a large crust-breaking earthquake. The model that we use involves a <b>slipping</b> <b>crack,</b> representing the deeper, more stably sliding portions of the fault zone, which penetrates upward from depth and is blocked in the lower region of the seismogenic zone. When conditions are uniform along strike, the upward penetration at the crack front is by mode III in strike-slip fault zones but by mode II in thrust or normal fault zones. Two major results are reported. First, we analyze approximately, via a linear perturbation formulation, how a tectonic crack front encounters and ultimately shears through arrays of localized "asperities " that are distributed parallel to the crack front and have a toughness which is {{greater than that of}} adjoining segments of the fault zone. Using a fast Fourier transform based numerical procedure to simulate crack penetration into asperities, we find a notable difference between mode II and mode III crack fronts in that the former penetrates approximately twice as far between the asperities as the latter under the same loading level. This is interesting because observations of slip distribution in large earthquakes suggest that there is a significant aseismic component to the total slip budget in subduction zone earthquakes, which in contrast {{does not seem to be}} present in strike-slip zone earthquakes, and also that the surface sli...|$|R

40|$|An {{assessment}} {{of the effects of}} microstructure on room temperature fatigue crack initiation and short crack propagation in a Ni-base superalloy is presented. The assessment was carried out on microstructural variants of U 720 Li, including as-received U 720 Li, U 720 Li-LG (large grain variant) and U 720 Li-LP (large intragranular coherent ?? variant). Fatigue tests were carried out at room temperature using a 20 Hz sinusoidal cycling waveform on plain bend bars. Tests were conducted in 3 -point bend under load control with an R-ratio of 0. 1. A maximum load of 95 % ?y was used in all tests. Room temperature fatigue crack initiation was noted to occur due to <b>slip</b> band <b>cracking</b> and from porosity on or just beneath the surface in all materials. Crack propagation was noted to be highly faceted (due to planar <b>slip</b> band <b>cracking)</b> immediately after crack initiation followed by a transition to a flatter Stage II type crack path as crack length increases. U 720 Li-LP was noted to show the longest fatigue lifetime, followed by U 720 Li-LG while U 720 Li shows the shortest life. The longer lifetime of U 720 Li-LP was linked to a higher resistance to both fatigue crack initiation and short crack propagation. U 720 Li and U 720 Li-LG show approximately similar crack initiation resistance although U 720 Li-LG showed slightly improved short crack growth resistance. The observations have been rationalised in terms of the microstructural characteristics of the materials, and it is believed that larger grain size, larger coherent ?? precipitate size and higher volume fractions of both coherent and primary ?? precipitates will improve overall fatigue lifetimes in PM Ni-base alloys which exhibit planar slip characteristics at room temperature...|$|R
30|$|Because {{they did}} not suffer any cracking, the silver {{electrodes}} on the wrinkled structure showed good initial conduction properties and maintained these properties during repeated stretching processes. As shown in Fig.  4 f, these silver electrodes show negligible resistance change in the low-strain region. Therefore, using a sample with a pre-strain of 50  %, we performed a cycling test at 50  % of the maximum strain. The resistance increases slightly, from an initial resistance of 3.89  Ω to a final resistance of 4.74  Ω, after 300 stretching cycles. This result clearly shows that our structures can sustain their initial conductivity under repeated stretching conditions. During tensile processes, the Ag films do not <b>slip</b> or <b>crack,</b> leading to conductance stabilization, because of the strong adhesion between the silver film and the PDMS wrinkled grating structure.|$|R
