40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish a porcine <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> (pSGC) line and develop an in vitro culture system. Isolated total testicular cells (TTCs) from 5 -day-old porcine testes were primary cultured at 31, 34, and 37 °C. Although the time of colony appearance was delayed at 31 °C, strong alkaline phosphatase staining, expressions of pluripotency marker genes such as OCT 4, NANOG, and THY 1, and the gene expressions of the undifferentiated germ cell markers PLZF and protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5) were identified compared to 34 and 37 °C. Cell cycle analysis for both pSGC and feeder cells at the three temperatures revealed that more pSGCs were in the G 2 /M phase at 31 °C than 37 °C at the subculture stage. In vitro, pSGCs could stably maintain undifferentiated germ cell and stem cell characteristics for over 60 days during culture at 31 °C. Xenotransplantation of pSGCs to immune deficient mice demonstrated a successful colonization and localization on the seminiferous tubule basement membrane in the recipient testes. In conclusion, pSGCs from neonatal porcine were successfully established and cultured for long periods under a low temperature culture environment in vitro...|$|E
40|$|In mammals spaceflight {{influences}} spermatogenesis since <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, {{compared to}} synchronous controls, is lightly decreased in irradiated or flown rats. Moreover, {{changes of the}} plasmatic testosterone production was described either in flight rats, or in rats maintained in simulated microgravity conditions. The hormonal levels of the astronauts change {{as it has been}} previously described, including hormones involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis such as testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH). In microgravity conditions, human testosterone levels decreased whereas circulating LH levels increased. To study the effect of simulated microgravity on mammalian spermatogenesis we have utilized the Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) and we have cultured testicular fragments isolated from prepuberal rats in a chemically defined medium for three days under microgravity conditions. As control we have cultured the same amount of fragments at unit gravity. The morphology of the samples has been studied and the number of proliferating cells has been counted in control samples and in samples maintained in RCCS. The results indicate that the number of duplicating cells in the tubules was significantly increased in the microgravity-cultured fragments. The amount of testosterone secreted in the culture medium has been also evaluated and in RCCS samples the amount of the hormone was higher respect to the control samples...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSpermatogenesis is {{initiated}} by the interaction of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and somatic cells in seminiferous tubules. We used cDNA microarrays and representational difference analysis to identify genes that are expressed in the testis of the jsd/jsd mutant mouse, which contains only type A <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and Sertoli cells, {{but not in the}} testis of the W/Wv mutant mouse, where Sertoli <b>cells</b> but few <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are present. We isolated 20 known genes and 4 novel genes, including 2 genes encoding lipocalin family members (prostaglandin D synthetase and 24 p 3) and 2 tumor suppressors (protein tyrosine phosphatase TD 14 and Sui 1). All 24 of thesejsd/jsd-derived genes were highly expressed in the cryptorchid testis {{as well as in the}} jsd/jsd testis. This indicates that their selective expression is not directly caused by the as-yet-uncharacterized jsd gene product, but is rather correlated to the cessation of spermatogonial differentiation. In situ hybridization analysis and flow cytometric sorting followed by reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that these genes are expressed in both the <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and the somatic cells in the developing gonads and adult testes. As the mRNAs of these jsd/jsd-derived genes were barely detectable in the W/Wv testis, we propose that early <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> regulate the expression of a group of testicular genes...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} poor reproductive outcomes in type 1 diabetic males {{is not well}} understood. In light of new evidence that the Sertoli cells of the testis secrete insulin, it is currently unclear whether diabetic subfertility {{is the result of}} deficiency of pancreatic insulin, testicular insulin, or both. In this study, the Akita mouse diabetic model, which expresses a mutant, nonfunctional form of ins 2 in testes and pancreas, was used to distinguish between systemic and local effects of insulin deficiency on the process of spermatogenesis and fertility. We de-termined that Akita homozygous male mice are infertile and have reduced testis size and abnormal morphology. <b>Spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are still present but are unable to mature into sperma-tocytes and spermatids.

40|$|Background: {{congenital}} chromosome abnormalities {{are relatively}} common in our species and among structural abnormalities {{the most common}} class is balanced reciprocal translocations. Determining the parental origin of de novo balanced translocations may provide insights into how and when they arise. While {{there is a general}} paternal bias in the origin of non-recurrent unbalanced rearrangements, there are few data on parental origin of non-recurrent balanced rearrangements. Methods: the parental origin of a series of de novo balanced reciprocal translocations was determined using DNA from flow sorted derivative chromosomes and linkage analysis. Results: of 27 translocations, we found 26 to be of paternal origin and only one of maternal origin. We also found the paternally derived translocations to be associated with a significantly increased paternal age (p< 0. 008). Conclusion: our results suggest there is a very marked paternal bias in the origin of all non-recurrent reciprocal translocations and that they may arise during one of the numerous mitotic divisions that occur in the <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> prior to meiosi...|$|R
40|$|Species are {{becoming}} extinct {{at a rate}} 100 times the natural background rates. Considering all mammalian orders, 24 % of all Carnivora species are threatened. The goal of carnivore conservation is to reverse the decline in populations and to secure remaining populations {{in ways that will}} assure enduring public support. In this context, biotechnology is a tool with tremendous potential for assisting the conservation of endangered canid and felid species. As the first step for biotechnology development is the gamete obtainment, this review will discuss the potential of gamete recovery from non-domestic canids and felids, based on learning how to apply these procedures in the domestic carnivores. Thus, electroejaculation and obtaining both epidydimal spermatozoon and <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are indicated as techniques for male gametes recovery. In the female gametes retrieval, different methods for oocyte recovery from both antral and preantral follicles, and the possibility for ovarian tissue transplantation are discussed.

40|$|Spermatogenesis is {{a complex}} process of {{proliferation}} and differentiation during male <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development whereby undifferentiated <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> evolve into maturing spermatozoa. In this developmental process the interactions between different cell types are finely regulated, hence any disruption in these relationships leads to male infertility. The twitcher mouse, the murine model of Krabbe disease, is characterized by deficiency of galactosylceramidase, an enzyme also involved in the metabolism of the galactosyl-alkyl-acyl-glycerol, the precursor of sulfogalactosyl-alkyl-acyl-glycerol, the most abundant glycolipid in spermatozoa. Twitcher mice are sterile due to alterations of spermatogenesis resulting {{in the production of}} spermatozoa with abnormally swollen acrosomes and bent flagella, mainly at the midpiece–principal piece junction. The current study employs light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy to examine the defective spermiogenesis leading to the morphological abnormalities of mature sperm. This study reveals that alterations in <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development can be initially detected at the stage VIII and IX of spermatogenesis. The disrupted spermatogenetic process leads to a reduced number of elongating spermatids and spermatozoa in these mutant animals. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrates major acrosomal and chromatin condensation defects in the mutants. In addition, in twitcher mice, the epididymal architecture is impaired, with stereocilia of caput and corpus broken, detached and completely spread out into the lumen. These findings indicate that seminolipid expression is crucial for proper development of spermatocytes and spermatids and for their normal differentiation into mature spermatozoa.

40|$|S. M. S. N. L., and S. R. B. contributed {{equally to}} this study. Spermatogonial transplantation, {{developed}} {{in the past decade}} by Brinster and colleagues, is a fascinating and powerful technique utilized to investigate male reproductive biology, mainly the aspects related to spermatogenesis and the stem cell biology. This technique also offers tremendous potential for studies involving biotechnology, transgenic animals, and the preservation of the genetic stock of valuable animals or endangered species. Although <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation is well characterized for mammals, there is no study utilizing this approach for fish. Due to its fast growth, relative small size when it reaches sexual maturity, good adaptability to different environmental conditions and economical importance, the tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is an excellent experimental model. In the present study, we investigated the viability of adult tilapias as a recipient model for <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> transplantation in fish. For this purpose, all approaches utilized in the present study for spermatogonial transplantation, such as endogenous spermatogenesis depletion, obtention, selection and spermatonia labeling, and the transplantation through the common urogenital papilla, were standardized in our laboratory. The preliminary results found for the recipient tilapia testes, evaluated by light and fluorescence microscopy, showed the presence of PKH 26 labeled <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> cysts in the seminiferous tubules. These findings obtained, {{for the first time in}} fish, suggest that <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> can be successfully transplanted directly into the testis of this teleost. Therefore, tilapias might be utilized as an experimental model to investigate the <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> biology and the testis function in teleosts. Moreover, this technique could be also utilized as a potential approach for fish bioengineering, preservation of genetic stock of endangered fish species or fish strains carrying commercially valuable traits...|$|R
40|$|Domestication is a {{long-term}} process during which wild fish are acclimated to farming conditions and hopefully are reproduced over several generations, possibly using selective breeding. Preservation of the genetic diversity of the original population, together {{with that of the}} ongoing selection steps, is important for ecological and economical purposes. Cryobanking of reproductive cells is one answer to meet this need. In fish, however, only sperm can be cryopreserved as neither oocytes nor embryos are capable of handling the freeze-thawing stress. In this review, we explore to what extent diploid cells obtained from fin pieces can be used for the preservation of both parental genomes. The main parameters, which should be under control to ensure proper production of fin cells in culture and to enable cryopreservation of the material are described. After cryobanking of such non-reproductive cells, fish can be reconstructed using the nuclear transfer technology whose potentials and difficulties are discussed. The gametes produced by the fish reconstructed after somatic cells nuclear transfer are different to some extent from the gametes obtained after the direct transplantation of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> or <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> into host embryos or larvae. However, in some cases, only somatic cells can be obtained in quantities which would be compatible with strain restoration purposes. From the knowledge available today, it is reasonable to expect that nuclear transfer becomes available for fish reconstruction, even if restricted to high-tech biotechnology facilities. Therefore, cryobanking of fin somatic cells can be farsightedly considered for high-throughput diploid genome conservation...|$|R

40|$|CSIRO 2007 Immunohistology {{has been}} used to examine the {{distribution}} of certain components of the basement membrane (BM) associated with bovine <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that are located within the seminiferous tubules. Histology was performed on testis tissue from Brahman cattle (Bos indicus) of three different age groups: pre-pubescent (4 – 6 months), juvenile (8 – 10 months) and adult (18 – 24 months) animals. There were no major changes in the BM composition apparent between these three age groups, except for certain lectin staining. These data suggest that the predominant collagen type IV component may have an α 3 and α 4 composition, although other chains, including the α 5 and α 6 chains, were also present. Possibly the main laminin type present was laminin 121 (α 1 β 2 γ 1), although other variants were also present. Both nidogen- 1 and perlecan, which are normal BM components, were also found as part of the seminiferous tubule BM. Interstitial collagens, such as type I, III and VI collagens, were found in the peritubular space, but were not part of the BM itself, although type VI collagen was most visible in the peritubular zone adjacent to the tubules. Examination of the BM with a range of lectins gave strong staining for (glcNAc) 2 entities, weak positive staining for α-L-fuc, but little or no staining for α-galNAc and (glcNAc) 3 at all ages, whereas staining for α-gal, β-gal(1 → 3) galNAc and α-man showed developmental changes.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 As {{in vitro}} models play an {{increasingly}} important role in evaluation of potential developmental and reproductive toxicants, {{it is essential that}} we define how well these models can capture developmental stages and processes that are vulnerable to toxicant perturbation. In this research we evaluate two dynamic in vitro models: a primary co-culture of neonatal rat testis and a human progenitor cell model of neuronal differentiation. Longterm viability, morphological characteristics, and expression of cell type- and stage-specific proteins in in vitro cultures were characterized by live/dead cell staining, immunofluorescent imaging, and western blotting. We then defined a framework for quantifying dynamic changes in pathways through time in normal development in vivo. Gene expression and pathway dynamics distilled from microarray data were used to anchor the in vitro models to in vivo developmental processes. Striking similarities were found between in vivo and in vitro models in gene expression for key pathways associated with each developmental process. Basic characterization revealed that testicular co-cultures survive up to 21 days in culture and contain <b>spermatogonial</b> <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, form tube-like structures in vitro and actively produce testosterone through the first week in culture. Pathway analysis of gene expression data through time reveals that the testicular co-culture captures key developmental processes that can be targeted by male reproductive toxicants, including Sertoli cell and Leydig cell differentiation, testosterone production, immune activity, signal transduction, tube formation, and tight junction formation. Basic characterization of differentiating neural progenitor cells indicates that the cells survive and differentiate through 21 days in culture, increasingly expressing protein associated with differentiated neurons, adopting neuronal morphology and forming complex neural networks. Pathway analysis reveals that differentiating neural progenitor cells successfully capture differentiation towards a forebrain identity, expressing receptors associated with specific neuronal subtypes. In addition to identifying processes that are clearly captured in vitro, we also define the limits of these models by identifying gene expression dynamics found only in vitro or only in vivo. By further defining the domain of applicability for each of these in vitro models, we can help to ensure that these models are used effectively and appropriately for identification of potential chemical hazards...|$|R

40|$|Spermatogenesis is {{characterized}} by the succession in time and space of specific <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> associations (stages). There can be a single stage (e. g., rodents and some macaques) or more than one stage (e. g., chimpanzee and human) per tubular cross section. We analyzed the organization of the seminiferous epithelium and quantified testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> production and apoptosis in a New World primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Tubule cross sections contained more than one stage, and the human six-stage system could be applied to marmoset spermatogenesis. Stereological (optical disector) analysis (n = 5) revealed high spermatogenic efficiency during meiosis and no loss of spermatids during spermiogenesis. The conversion of type A to type B spermatogonia was several-fold higher than that reported for other primates. Highest apoptotic rates were found for S-phase cells (20 %) and 4 C cells (15 %) by flow cytometric analysis (n = 6 animals); histological analysis confirmed <b>spermatogonial</b> apoptosis. Haploid <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis was < 2 %. Marmoset spermatogenesis is very efficient and involves substantial spermatogonial proliferation.

40|$|Seminoma and non-seminoma tumours {{increasingly}} {{occur within}} the western population. These tumours originate from {{carcinoma in situ}} (CIS) cells, which arise from dysfunctional gonocytes. CXCL 12 and its receptors, CXCR 4 and CXCR 7, have been implicated in migration, proliferation and survival of gonocytes and their precursors and progeny, primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells respectively. We previously found evidence that several miRNA molecules predicted to modulate CXCR 4 signalling are differentially expressed during the differentiation of gonocytes into spermatogonia in mice. Bioinformatic analysis predicted these miRNA to modulate CXCR 4 signalling, leading us to hypothesize that CXCL 12 -mediated CXCR 4 signalling {{is involved in the}} disrupted differentiation of gonocytes that underpins CIS formation. Indeed, we detected CXCL 12 in Sertoli cells of normal human testis, and relatively high expression in tumour stroma with concomitant weak staining in dispersed tumour cells. In contrast, CXCR 4 was expressed in <b>spermatogonial</b> and meiotic <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> of normal testis and in the majority of tumour cells. Quantitative RT-PCR identified elevated CXCR 4 transcript levels in seminoma compared with normal testis and to non-seminoma, potentially reflecting the higher proportion of dysfunctional <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> within seminomas. In the normal testis, expression of CXCR 4 downstream signalling molecules phospho-MEK 1 / 2 and phospho-ERK 1 / 2 correlated with CXCR 4 /CXCL 12 expression. Strikingly, this correlation was absent in seminoma and non-seminoma samples, suggesting that CXCL 12 signalling is disrupted. Proliferation rate and cell survival were not altered by CXCL 12 in either seminoma (TCam- 2) or non-seminoma (833 ke) cell lines. However, CXCL 12 exposure induced TCam- 2 cell invasion though simulated basement membrane, while in contrast, we provide the novel evidence that CXCR 4 -expressing non-seminoma cell lines 833 ke and NTera 2 /D 1 do not invade in response to CXCL 12. These findings indicate that CXCL 12 expression in the human testis may selectively influence seminoma migration and metastasis, correlating with its importance in gonocyte and spermatogonial stem cell biology...|$|R

Investigating possible functions of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development, we found that E-cadherin-mediated adhesion may stimulate the motility of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Moreover, treatment of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> cultured on STO cell monolayers with an anti-E-cadherin antibody caused a significant decrease in their number and markedly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> becomes sexually dimorphic during gonadal sex differentiation, although the underlying dynamics {{of this are}} not well understood in vertebrates. By tracing GFP-labeled <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo and analyzing the germ cell-depleted mutant, zenzai, we show that the proliferation and differentiation of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are regulated in a sexually dimorphic manner in the teleost fish medaka. In the undifferentiated gonads, <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> resume proliferation by slow intermittent division (type I), producing isolated daughter <b>cells.</b> While <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the male gonads continue this mode of proliferation, some <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> fractions in the female gonads initiate two to four rounds of continuous division (type II), forming cysts of four, eight, or sixteen cells, which subsequently enter meiosis synchronously.

This argues that slow intermittent division is essential for the maintenance of <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The proliferation and differentiation of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are thus important components of gonadal sex differentiation in vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{limited number}} of in vivo <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> poses an {{impediment}} to genome-wide studies. Here, we applied a small-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) method on purified mouse fetal <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to generate genome-wide maps of four histone modifications (H 3 K 4 me 3, H 3 K 27 me 3, H 3 K 27 ac, and H 2 BK 20 ac). Comparison of active chromatin state between somatic, embryonic stem, and <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> revealed promoters and enhancers needed for stem <b>cell</b> maintenance and <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development. We found the nuclear receptor Nr 5 a 2 motif to be enriched at a subset of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> cis-regulatory regions, and our results implicate Nr 5 a 2 in <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> biology. Interestingly, in <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> the H 3 K 27 me 3 histone modification occurs more frequently at regions that are enriched for retrotransposons and MHC genes, indicating that these loci are specifically silenced in <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> Together, our study provides genome-wide histone modification maps of in vivo <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and reveals the molecular chromatin signatures of <b>germ</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila, {{the sex of}} <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is {{determined}} by cell-autonomous and inductive signals. XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> autonomously enter spermatogenesis when developing in a female host. In contrast, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> non-autonomously become spermatogenic when developing in a male host. In first instar larvae with two X chromosomes, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> enter the female or the male pathway depending on {{the presence or absence}} of transformer (tra) activity in the surrounding soma. In somatic cells, the product of tra regulates the expression of the gene double sex (dsx) which can form a male-specific or a female-specific product. In dsx mutant larvae, XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> develop abnormally, with a seemingly intersexual phenotype. This indicates that female-specific somatic dsx products feminize XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> and male-specific somatic dsx products masculinize XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> The results show that tra and dsx control early inductive signals that determine the sex of XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and that somatic signals also affect the development of XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that develop in pseudomales lacking the sex-determining function of Sxl are spermatogenic. If, however, female-specific tra functions are expressed in these animals, XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> become oogenic. Furthermore, transplanted XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> can become oogenic and form eggs in XY animals that express the female-specific function of tra. Therefore, TRA product present in somatic cells of XY animals or in animals lacking the sex-determining function of Sxl, is sufficient to support developing XX <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> through oogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{survival}} and directionality of migration {{are controlled by}} two lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP), wunen (wun) and wunen- 2 (wun 2). wun wun 2 double mutant analysis reveals that the two genes, hereafter collectively called wunens, act redundantly in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> We find that wunens mediate <b>germ</b> cell-germ <b>cell</b> repulsion and that this repulsion is necessary for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> dispersal and proper transepithelial migration {{at the onset of}} migration and for the equal sorting of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> between the two embryonic gonads during their migration. We propose that this dispersal function optimizes adult fecundity by assuring maximal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> occupancy of both gonads. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for wunens in <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> survival can be eliminated by blocking <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> migration.

40|$|This {{workshop}} {{reviewed the}} current science to inform and recommend the best evidence-based approaches {{on the use}} of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> genotoxicity tests. The workshop questions and key outcomes were as follows. (1) Do genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays in somatic <b>cells</b> predict <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> effects? Limited data suggest that somatic cell tests detect most <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagens, but there are strong concerns that dictate caution in drawing conclusions. (2) Should <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tests be done, and when? If there is evidence that a chemical or its metabolite(s) will not reach target <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> or gonadal tissue, {{it is not necessary to}} conduct <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tests, notwithstanding somatic outcomes. However, it was recommended that negative somatic cell mutagens with clear evidence for gonadal exposure and evidence of toxicity in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> could be considered for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagenicity testing. For somatic mutagens that are known to reach the gonadal compartments and expose <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> the chemical could be assumed to be a <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagen without further testing. Nevertheless, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> mutagenicity testing would be needed for quantitative risk assessment. (3) What new assays should be implemented and how? There is an immediate need for research on the application of whole genome sequencing in heritable mutation analysis in humans and animals, and integration of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> assays with somatic cell genotoxicity tests. Focus should be on environmental exposures that can cause de novo mutations, particularly newly recognized types of genomic changes. Mutational events, which may occur by exposure of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> during embryonic development, should also be investigated. Finally, where there are indications of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> toxicity in repeat dose or reproductive toxicology tests, consideration should be given to leveraging those studies to inform of possible <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> genotoxicity.

40|$|Mammalian {{spermatogenesis}} is a dinamic {{and rather}} complex process which provides mature spermatozoa starting from staminal spermatogonia. However, {{not all the}} proliferating <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> will complete the differentiation program {{and the presence of}} apoptotic <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the testis of healthy and fertile individuals is a common observation. Although the causes for this physiological cell death are still largely unknown, the apoptosis of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> appears to accomplish two important functions: a) adeguate the number of proliferating <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to that of the supporting Sertoli cells; b) remove those <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> affected by differentiation problems. In addition, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis may be induced by a variety of pathological conditions or in response to noxious environmental stimuli, able to interfere with the <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation program. Thus, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis may be considered as the final step of a quality control system which identifies unfit <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> and eliminates them. Up to date, our informations regarding the cellular mechanisms responsible for the activation of the apoptotic pathways in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> are still very poor.

40|$|AbstractThe initial {{cohort of}} {{mammalian}} gametes is {{established by the}} proliferation of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in the early embryo. Primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> first appear in extraembyronic tissues and subsequently migrate to the developing gonad. Soon after they arrive in the gonad, the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> cease dividing and undertake sexually dimorphic patterns of development. Male <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> arrest mitotically, while female <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> directly enter meiotic prophase I. These sex-specific differentiation events are imposed upon a group of sex-common differentiation events that are shared by XX and XY <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b> We have studied the appearance of GCNA 1, a postmigratory sex-common <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> marker, in cultures of premigratory <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to investigate how this differentiation program is regulated. Cultures in which proliferation was either inhibited or stimulated displayed a similar extent of differentiation as controls, suggesting that some differentiation events {{are the result of}} a cell-intrinsic program and are independent of cell proliferation. We also found that GCNA 1 expression was accelerated by agents which promote DNA demethylation or histone acetylation. These results suggest that genomic demethylation of proliferative phase primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> is a mechanism by which <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> maturation is coordinated...|$|R
40|$|The {{leading cause}} of {{infertility}} in men and women is quantitative and qualitative defects in human <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> (oocyte and sperm) development. Yet, {{it has not been}} possible to examine the unique developmental genetics of human <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> formation and differentiation due to inaccessibility of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> during fetal development. Although several studies have shown that <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> can be differentiated from mouse and human embryonic stem <b>cells,</b> human <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> differentiated in these studies generally did not develop beyond the earliest stages 1 - 8. Here we used a <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> reporter to quantitate and isolate primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> derived from both male and female hESCs. Then, by silencing and overexpressing genes that encode germ cell-specific cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins (not transcription factors), we modulated human <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> formation and developmental progression. We observed that human DAZL (Deleted in AZoospermia-Like) functions in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> formation, whereas closely-related genes, DAZ and BOULE, promote later stages of meiosis and development of haploid gametes. These results are significant to the generation of gametes for future basic science and potential clinical applications.

The temporal correlation between disappearance of nuclear Dolichos biflorus agglutinin positivity and colonisation of the gonadal ridges, may be explained by a change in the functional status of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> nuclear glycoconjugates in relation with the onset of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{development}} uses programmed {{cell death}} to remove abnormal, misplaced or excess cells. Precise control {{of this process is}} essential to maintain the continuity and integrity of the germline, and to prevent <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> from colonizing locations other than the gonads. Through careful analyses of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> distribution in developing Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we show that normal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> development involves extensive {{programmed cell death}} during stages 10 - 12 of embryogenesis. This <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death is mediated by Drosophila p 53 (p 53). Mutations in p 53 result in excess primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that are ectopic to the gonads. Initial movements of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> appear normal, and wild-type numbers of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> populate the gonads, indicating that p 53 is required for <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death, but not migration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a loss-of-function phenotype for Drosophila p 53 in a non-sensitized background. The p 53 phenotype is remarkably similar to that of outsiders (out) mutants. Here, we show that the out gene encodes a putative monocarboxylate transporter. Mutations in p 53 and out show nonallelic noncomplementation. Interestingly, overexpression of p 53 in primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> of out mutant embryos partially suppresses the out <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> death phenotype, suggesting that p 53 functions in <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> either downstream of out or in a closely linked pathway. These findings inform models in which signaling between p 53 and cellular metabolism are integrated to regulate programmed cell death decisions...|$|R
