40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes SVM+BiHMM, {{a hybrid}} {{statistic}} model of metadata extraction based on SVM (support vector machine) and BiHMM (bigram HMM (hidden Markov model)). The BiHMM model modifies the HMM model with both Bigram <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> and position information of words, {{by means of}} distinguishing the beginning emitting probability from the inner emitting probability. First, the rule based extractor segments documents into line-blocks. Second, the SVM classifier tags the blocks into metadata elements. Finally, the SVM+BiHMM model {{is built based on}} the BiHMM model, with the emitting probability adjusted by the Sigmoid function of SVM score, and the transition probability trained by Bigram HMM. The SVM classifier benefits from the structure patterns of document line data while the Bigram HMM considers both words ’ Bigram <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> and position information, so the complementary SVM+BiHMM outperforms HMM, BiHMM, and SVM methods in the experiments on the same task.

40|$|The {{significant}} problem {{of this paper}} is how we convey spatial information to represent concrete meaning of mental imagery. For replying the above problem, we are developing a spatial information structure called “Intention Structure”. Intention structure is used to represent some spatial experience of a particular person and awareness of the aura into some spatial depicts at that physical place. The meaning of “intention” is implied into a <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> when a navigator moves and gazes something in a place. This <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> can be described into two ways of spatial representation: one is the action of human body including “moving the body” and “moving the head”, another is converting the visual information into spatial memories through the behaviour of gaze, including “the sight focus” and “the snapshot glancei. Otherwise, we also consider the limitation of topology at that physical place. Based on the above ideas, we use XML technologies in Java language to represent spatial data of intention structure for the describable usages of invisible information. we implemented this idea on a project of spatial analysis with Taiwanese traditional garden, the Lin family garden in Banciao, Taipei County, Taiwan. ...|$|E

40|$|Software plays a {{significant}} role in society. It penetrates every field such as telecommunications, public administration, cooperation management, etc. In a software development life cycle (abbr., SDLC), software testing is a key phase. It accounts for a large part of software development costs. This is a consequence of testing being performed late in an improvised and impromptu way under the discretion of project managers. Continual testing as proposed by the extreme programming approach advocates that automated testing be performed in the early phases of the SDLC. Automation helps avoid disorderly and unsystematic progress of testing tasks and assignments. This thesis presents an approach for the generation of test cases from use cases [...] -a form of requirements used in the early phases of the SDLC. We first needed a way to combine related use cases in order to infer system-level test cases spawning over several use cases. We developed an approach to infer use case <b>sequential</b> <b>relations</b> based on a comparison of pre-conditions and post-conditions. This approach offers the benefit of obtaining use case <b>sequential</b> <b>relations</b> without solely relying on the traditional UML use case relationships (i. e., include, extend and generalization). It helps to avoid the functional decomposition of use cases. We then propose an automated approach for die generation of test scenarios, a step toward complete and concrete test cases. Test scenarios are generated using depth-first traversal of control flow-based state machines obtained from use cases. The construction of these control flow-based state machines considers traditional UML use case relationships as well as inferred <b>sequential</b> <b>relations.</b> Depth-first traversal of control flow-based state machines is controlled by a coverage criterion inspired from traditional white-box code coverage...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify sources of both intra- and intersubject variability in the formation of symmetry. In Experiment 1, samples and correct comparison stimuli were selected according to three levels of presumed sequential dependence: (a) letters in alphabetical order (high sequential dependence), (b) letters in alphabetical order, but skipping every other letter (moderate sequential dependence), and (c) Greek letters (no sequential dependence). The subjects were assigned to three groups, starting with a specific level of sequential dependence, and proceeding with ascending or descending levels of sequentiality. The results showed that both stimulus material and task order influenced the probability of responding in accordance with symmetry versus responding in accordance with the <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> during the tests.

40|$|Although {{researchers}} have often {{focused on the}} victims of aggression, the detrimental effects of engaging in aggression and/or displaying symptoms of externalizing disorders have been clearly identified in children and adolescents. Longstanding consequences of externalizing problems include internalizing difficulties such as depression. There is an increasing interest in identifying the direction of effect and understand whether externalizing problems precede internalizing problems, vice-versa, or whether they share a bi-directional relation. However, {{the study of the}} temporal sequence between aggression, externalizing disorders, and internalizing disorders in children and adolescents has yielded inconsistent findings. The <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> between externalizing and internalizing difficulties in children and adolescents was examined in this dissertation consisting of three studies. In Study 1, the moderating role of worry in the relation between aggression and depression was examined. The sample consisted of girls nominated as either relationally or physically aggressive by their peers. Results indicated that worry exacerbated the risk of reporting elevated depressive symptoms concurrently and one year later for physically aggressive girls. In Study 2, three competing hypotheses on the longitudinal relation between aggression and depression were compared. Findings from this study supported the hypothesis that symptoms of depression are preceded by aggressive behaviour. Additionally, it was found that engaging in physical aggression predicted depressive symptoms for girls but not for boys. The results of the first two studies suggest that for girls, engaging in non-normative forms of aggression is associated with greater mental health problems. In Study 3, the temporal relation between symptoms of externalizing disorders, namely oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, and symptoms of depression was examined. Results provided support that the progressive relation between symptoms of externalizing and internalizing disorders was bi-directional. In summary, although it seems that engaging in externalizing behaviour, such as aggression, predicts symptoms of depression, findings from the third study suggest that the <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> between symptoms of externalizing problems, {{which may or may not}} include aggressive behaviour, and symptoms of depression seem to share a reciprocal relation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the mother-infant {{interaction}} process by the lag sequential analysis. The examination of the lag <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> between mother and infant behaviors was carried out using conditional probability. To compare the magnitude of concurrent mother's and infant's behaviors such as visual, tactile, and vocal behaviors, a new method using conditional frequency percentage as an index of the lag sequential analysis on mother-infant interaction was designed. By this method, the lag <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> between mother and infant behaviors for both one pair and several pairs could be examined. The subjects were 13 pairs of mother-infant aged 3 months, participating in 'Tokyo Study projects'. They were classified into two categories according to the degree of interactions, high activity group(7 pairs) and low activity group(6 pairs). One of the pairs belonging to the low activity group was subjected to the lag sequential analysis of motherinfant interaction at the age of 8, 12 months. The observational data on mother-infant interaction at each month(3, 8, 12 months) were obtained by home visits conducted as a part of 'Tokyo Study Projects' in 1977 - 1979. The main results were as follows. 1) The lag sequential relations on visual and vocal behaviors between mother and infant were different from that of their tactile behaviors. 2) In high activity pairs, following the initiation, the receptor tends to return and continue the same modal behavior. 3) In the low activity pairs, the receptor tends to return but soon stop the behavior. 4) At 3 months, most of the mother-infant interactions were carried out through tactile behaviors. 5) Although, at 3 months, mother's and infant's vocal behaviors didn't occur as many as their visual and tactile behaviors, active interactions between mother and infant followed teir mutual vocal behaviors. 6) The amount of mother-infant vocal interactions gradually increased during the first year of life and patterns of the lag sequential relations of these interactions differed also in each period(3, 8, 12 months) ...|$|E

Different from the traditional HMM, which only uses word frequency, this model also considers both words ’ bigram <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> and position information in text fields.

With more demands on sharing a video or other data, especially for mobile applications in an Internet-based Mobile Ad Hoc Network, considering the relations among data items in cooperative caching becomes more important than before. However, most of the existing works do not consider these inherent relations among data items, such as the logical, temporal, or spatial relations. In this paper, we present a novel solution, Gossip-based Cooperative Caching (GosCC) to address the cache placement problem, and consider the <b>sequential</b> <b>relation</b> among data items. Each mobile node stores the IDs of data items cached locally and the ID of the data item in use into its progress report.

To improve the user experience, GosCC aims to provide users with an uninterrupted data access service.

However, the excessive pursuit of accuracy in weather prediction makes some of the “accurate” prediction results meaningless and the numerical prediction model is often complex and time-consuming. By adapting this novel model to a precipitation prediction problem, we make the predicted outcomes of precipitation more accurate and the prediction methods simpler than by using the complex numerical forecasting model that would occupy large computation resources, be time-consuming and which has a low predictive accuracy rate. Accordingly, we achieve more accurate predictive precipitation results than by using traditional artificial neural networks that have low predictive accuracy...|$|R

Antisocial behavior was sequentially comorbid with substance use and police problems: 31 % of youths who had reported antisocial behavior at baseline reported police problems or drug use at wave 2. These models can prove instrumental in answering the persistent questions about possible <b>sequential</b> <b>relations</b> among problem behaviors. adolescent; comorbidity; logistic models; regression analysis; residence characteristics; risk-taking; social envi-ronment; transition probabilit...|$|R
40|$|Statistical Machine Translation {{has been}} shown to beneﬁt from complex {{linguistic}} structures. However, previous work mainly focuses on sequences and trees. In this thesis, we build dependency graphs which are constructed from dependency trees and uniformly represent both dependency <b>relations</b> and <b>sequential</b> <b>relations,</b> including bigram relations and sibling relations. We propose translation models to translate these graphs into target strings and conduct experiments on Chinese [...] English and German [...] English translation tasks. As a motivation, we ﬁrstly present a pseudo forest-to-string model which improves a dependency tree-to-string model by dependency decomposition. The decomposition takes sibling relations into consideration which results in more rules being used and thus a higher phrase coverage. Experiments show that such decomposition is beneﬁcial to translation performance. Integrating phrasal rules further improves our model. Then, we propose a segmentational graph-based translation model. It segments graphs into subgraphs and generates translations from left to right by combining translations of these subgraphs. The graphs explicitly combine dependency relations and bigram relations. In experiments, the graph-based model outperforms both the phrase-based model and treelet-based model. In addition, we improve this model by using a graph segmentation model to take source context into consideration. Furthermore, inspired by using tree grammars to translate trees, we propose recursive graph-based translation models by using graph grammars. An edge replacement grammar is used to translate dependency-edge graphs which are converted from dependency trees by labeling edges to naturally take sibling relations into consideration. A node replacement grammar is used to translate dependency-sibling graphs which explicitly add sibling links to dependency trees. Experiments show that our models are signiﬁcantly better than the hierarchical phrase-based model...|$|R
30|$|Thompson (1967) {{analyzes}} {{the organization in}} terms of uncertainty and technology or work flows of pooled, <b>sequential,</b> and reciprocal <b>relations.</b> Miles and Snow (1978) analyze the design problem in terms of structure and process and develop a typology of four organizational prototypes based on a particular choice of strategy. Lawrence and Lorsch (1967) use the concept’s differentiation and integration, which are similar to structure and coordination, and develop a contingency theory based on the particular type of environment. These approaches are single-contingency theories.|$|R
