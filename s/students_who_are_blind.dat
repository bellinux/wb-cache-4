40|$|Matsumoto and Ekman's Japanese and Caucasian facial {{expressions}} of emotion (JACFEE) {{have been tried}} in many countries including China. Consistent results from these nominal (or categorical) studies have been shown that the perception accuracies of Anger, Disgust, Happiness and Sadness are high, and that of Contempt is low, and those of Fear and Surprise are mixed. We have hypothesized that a principal component analysis (PCA) on the perceived intensity alone might offer a scalar (dimensional) classification of emotion. We therefore invited 200 Chinese university <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> to the JACFEE nominal classification, to rate the emotion intensities displayed by each poser. Happiness received the highest intensity score, and Contempt the lowest. PCA results produced seven scalar factors of emotion which corresponded well to the nominal ones. Picture loadings on the target emotions demonstrated that Contempt emerged as an independent factor, similarly to Anger, Disgust, Happiness and Sadness. However, picture loadings in regard to Fear and Surprise were mixed up, which still leaves the question open how to separate the two emotions efficiently. Nevertheless, our study has been demonstrated the validity of JACFEE in Chinese culture, and suggests a modification of the picture clusters, especially those of Fear and Surprise. 5 page(s...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{legislation}} {{took effect}} in December 2006, that requires educational publishers in the K-12 education industry {{to provide a}} National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS). In essence, educational publishers must provide an inclusive experience to those <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind.</b> If {{they are unable to}} provide this experience, they are required to provide the digital content source files to a clearing house that will convert the materials into an accessible experience for the student. The TUI has the promise of enabling the publishers to maintain control of their content while providing an inclusive, tactile, or Braille experience to students who are visually impaired. Further, using a Braille approach may serve to help enhance Braille literacy while meeting the mandates of NIMAS.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present review is to examine the {{criticism}} of full inclusion that has been put forth in the United States by an organization for people who are blind and by {{teachers of students with visual}} disabilities, in order to investigate the implications of these criticisms. The organization for people who are blind criticized full inclusion on the grounds that there has been a lack of understanding of blindness-specific skills and, in the methods of teaching these skills (including separated settings), due significance had not been given to the emotional and social meaning of peer interactions for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> and their role as a member of society, and that the methods required for assisting them to attain social status have been treated as unimportant. <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> have been faced with isolation, poor training, and insufficient participation for society, although they have benefited from long-term education in an inclusive education system. A full inclusion setting definitely ought to be beneficial for students with mild mental retardation and learning disabilities; however, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> have failed to benefit from similar options, because they have not learned such matters as blindness-specific skills that they would have acquired ideally in a separate educational setting...|$|E

40|$|Eight {{years after}} its publication, McManus and Thomas offer a re-evaluation of the eye-centering {{tendency}} in portraits through {{the history of art}} (Tyler 1998 a). The points that they raise are certainly worth consideration, but some were addressed in the original study. Other issues may be addressed with an analysis of the two-dimensional distribution of all eye positions in portraits. I also report an independent experiment of active head placements by a group of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> to the hypothesis, which is a more direct test than the passive judgment between two preselected eye positions offered in the critique. But I first take up the point that there have been very few citations of the original publication. It is noteworthy that the influence of an article in this sphere of analysis is not necessarily reflected in its number of citations. For example, the issue that almost always comes up in connection with the eye-centering is the way the eyes seem to follow the viewer in certain portraits, published by William Wollaston in the Philosophical Trans-actions of the Royal Society of London in 1824. This seminal paper has, however, been cited by only one scientific publication despite the passage of nearly two centuries. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} care theory literature, {{especially the}} work of Nel Noddings, to identify strategies to enhance MSE use {{in the education of}} students with disabilities. Care starts at home where the child learns to 'care-about' through the experience of being 'cared-for' and continues into education. Care is both an essential need and a deep-seated want making it both a pre-condition 'for' education and a key ingredient 'in' education. Caring educators therefore work closely with families to promote high quality home care throughout the student's education. Four key components of a caring education are: 'modelling, dialogue, practice and confirmation'. Modelling for student imitation, learning and development must take into account the experience of the student, for example modelling for a <b>student</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>blind</b> must <b>be</b> non-visual. Similarly for dialogue to be successful it must be informed by the student's ability to communicate, and practice requires student participation. A caring educator builds a caring relationship with the student by paying sympathetic attention to accurately read the student. Reflection on this information makes it possible for the caring educator to respond in helpful and hopeful ways that encourage the student to discern a 'better self'. In this way the caring educator matches student intention with confirmation...|$|R

Consequently, they are especially penalized when the information being searched is hidden un-der multiple layers of indirections.

40|$|The {{arrival of}} a <b>student</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>Blind</b> in the School of Systems Engineering at the University of Reading has made it an {{interesting}} and challenging year for all. Visually impaired students have already graduated from other Schools of the University and the School of Systems Engineering has seen three students with visual impairment graduate recently with good degrees. These students could access materials - and do assessments - essentially by means of enlargement and judicious choice of options. The new student had previously been supported by a specialist college. She is a proficient typist and also a user of both Braille and JAWS screen reader, and she is doing a joint course in Cybernetics and Computer Science. The course requires mathematics which itself includes graphs, and also many diagrams including numerous circuit diagrams. The University bought proven equipment such as a scanner to process books into speech or Braille, and screen reading software {{as well as a}} specialist machine for producing tactile diagrams for educational use. Clearly it is also important that the student can access assessments and examinations and present answers for marking or feedback (by sighted staff). So the School also used innovative in-house tactile methods to represent diagrams.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{qualitative}} research methodology {{was used to}} investigate the educational experiences of five former students with vision impairment (VI) in PNG who received specialist services during their schooling. The participants were purposively chosen to provide the widest possible range of information (for example: three female, two male; one with low vision, four functionally blind; with each participant from a different geographical region of PNG). Semi-structured 60 -minute one-to-one interviews were employed to explore whether suitable accommodations and modifications were made for the students and to assess {{whether or not they}} thought they received an inclusive and an appropriate education. The semi-structured questionnaire was developed to allow respondents to freely express their own opinions. Each interview was conducted in the participant's own natural environment and in their preferred language, i. e., either English or Tok Pisin (Talk Pidgin). Results indicate a difference in quality of service for former <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> functionally <b>blind</b> compared to that provided for the student with low vision.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the potential relationship of accessible hands-on science learning experiences {{to the development of}} positive beliefs concerning one’s capacity to function in the sciences and motivation to consider science as a college major and career. Findings from Likert survey items given before and after engaging in accessible hands-on science laboratories show that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> or had low vision (BLV) were more likely to agree with the following items after engaging in accessible science experiences: 1) I plan on enrolling as a science major in college; 2) My educational experiences, so far, have given me the confidence that I need to decide on majoring in an area of science in college and then a career in science; 3) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently perform a lab activity in (on) ______; 4) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently start data collection during a lab activity in ______; 5) I feel that I have the skills needed to independently stop data collection on a lab activity in ______; 6) I was actively involved in data collection during the______ lab. The Likert survey findings are consistent with the notion that accessible science activities may foster the development of self-beliefs that one has the capacity to independently function in scientific domains, which may promote an inclination to consider scientific pursuits. Insufficient accessible science learning experiences may contribute to the underrepresentation of individuals with disabilities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Providing accessible science learning activities may help to increase both the number of individuals who have disabilities and diversity in the STEM fields...|$|R
