5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem of}} how exactly Anna would save Elsa at the film's climax was solved by story artist John Ripa. At the story meeting where Ripa pitched his take on the story, the {{response}} was silence until Lasseter said, [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before," [...] which {{was followed by a}} standing ovation.|$|E
500|$|Tory Christman, {{a critic}} of Scientology and former Scientologist from 1969 to 2000, stated she disapproved of illegal tactics but felt {{encouraged}} by the new influx of critics of Scientology. Christman told Morning Edition: [...] "It feels like we've been out in this desert, fighting this group one-on-one by ourselves, {{and all of a}} sudden this huge army came up with not only tons of people, thousands of people, but better tools..." [...] Scientology critic Arnaldo Lerma told the St. Petersburg Times he was impressed by a video of a protest against Scientology which took place in Orlando, Florida: [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before. This is incredible. I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it on a Web cam." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before?" [...] he asked. He was a shrewd man, the horse-dealer, and {{really wanted to}} know what was the matter with the negro.|$|R
5000|$|I {{was cutting}} {{the grass and}} it came in {{screaming}} over my head. I felt the impact. The whole ground shook and the whole area was full of fire. I could never imagine I would <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> here.|$|R
500|$|In {{the other}} semi-final, Maguire ended O'Sullivan's 14-match unbeaten {{run with a}} 6–1 victory to earn {{a place in the}} final against Higgins. Maguire made century breaks in the first two frames, {{becoming}} the first player to make five consecutive century breaks (including the three made in his previous match). Maguire won the third on the pink after O'Sullivan missed the yellow. O'Sullivan won the next with a break of 51, before Maguire made a break of 71 in each of the final two frames. After the match, O'Sullivan—who had won all three previous encounters against Maguire—said, [...] "I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> on a snooker table before... He's a great player, probably {{the best in the world}} at the moment", and even before the match, O'Sullivan had described Maguire as [...] "of the young ones, definitely the best". The defeat meant that Reardon lost the £100 bet he placed at 150–1 that O'Sullivan would win all eight of the season's ranking events.|$|E
2500|$|White people [...] {{standing}} in wonder. Their eyes were open, they were listening. Openness and nothing on guard—I {{saw that in}} everybody. I {{was so happy to}} see that in the white people that they could listen and take in and respect and believe {{in the words of a}} black person. I had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed for}} Mojo {{magazine}} the band {{said the most}} amazing sight at Live Aid was to see the audience clapping to [...] "Radio Ga Ga". Brian May stated: [...] "I'd never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{in my life and}} it wasn't calculated either. We understood our audience and played to them but that was one of those weird accidents because of the (music) video. I remember thinking 'oh great, they've picked it up' and then I thought 'this is not a Queen audience'. This is a general audience who've bought tickets before they even knew we were on the bill. And they all did it. How did they know? Nobody told them to do it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Blatchford was {{impressed}} by the cleanliness and efficiency in Germany: [...] "You don't <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in Germany. I thought to myself, is this how we are preparing to fight for the existence of our Empire? What use will these ragged, famished spectres be when we have our backs to the wall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Let me {{tell you}} one thing. I'd sooner feed mush and milk to feebs than milk cows with the frost on the ground. Mrs. Bopp was scared to let me play with her children. And I was scared, too. They used to make faces at me when nobody was looking, and call me [...] "Looney." [...] Everybody called me Looney Tom. And the other boys in the {{neighbourhood}} threw rocks at me. You never <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in the Home here. The feebs are better behaved.|$|R

If he would publish his {{accounts}} half-yearly in the Rufford Gazette, honestly showing how much he had lost by his system, how much capital had been misapplied, and how much labour wasted, he might serve as an example, like the pictures of 'The Idle Apprentice.' I don't see that he can do any other good,--unless it be to the estimable gentleman who is allowed to occupy the pretty house. I don't think you'd <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> model farm in our country, Sir." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wham!'s tour of China in April 1985, {{the first}} visit to China by a Western popular music act, {{generated}} worldwide media coverage, much of it centred on Michael. Before Wham!'s appearance in China, many kinds of music in the country were forbidden. The audience included members of the Chinese government, and Chinese television presenter, Kan Lijun, who was the on stage host, spoke of Wham!'s historic performance; [...] "No-one had ever <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before. All the young people were amazed and everybody was tapping their feet. Of course the police weren't happy and they were scared there would be riots." [...] The tour was documented by film director Lindsay Anderson and producer Martin Lewis in their film Foreign Skies: Wham! In China.|$|E
2500|$|During the French Enlightenment, {{there was}} a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual {{enticement}} or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy's 1771 play The True Mother (La Vraie Mère), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: [...] "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?" [...] Nearly a century later, also in France, {{a man from the}} provinces who attended a Court ball at the Tuileries in Paris in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: [...] "I haven't <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> since I was weaned!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{agreed the}} play was {{extremely}} unusual. [...] The Austin American-Statesman {{said that it was}} one of the most bizarre moments of an odd college football season. [...] Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune said, [...] "I've been watching football since Jon Arnett and Ernie Zampese were playing for USC, and I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It was as if Jessee wanted it for a souvenir. Carpenter should have autographed it." [...] Dennis Erickson said, [...] "It's the most unusual play I've seen in college football." [...] Former San Diego Charger Hank Bauer was asked if he had ever seen a similar play; he replied, [...] "Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. [...] At any level." [...] Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman said it was “one of the most bizarre plays in bowl history – let's just say the only thing missing was the Stanford band”. The game’s replay official, Bob Patrick, explained afterwards that in such a bizarre circumstance, the officials have the right to award whatever penalty they feel is equitable.|$|E
5000|$|After the match, Vince McMahon said to Foley, [...] "You have no {{idea how}} much I {{appreciate}} what you have just done for this company, but I never want to <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> again." [...] He also made mention in the book of a rather humorous exchange he and Undertaker had while being checked out more thoroughly by Dr. Pettit in the backstage area. Foley, still somewhat dazed from the concussion he sustained, turned to the Undertaker and asked [...] "Did I use the thumbtacks?", which was a staple of a number of Foleys early matches. The Undertaker looked at him and rather sternly replied [...] "Look at your arm, Mick!", at which point Foley discovered a significant number of thumbtacks still lodged in his arm.|$|R
5000|$|What {{happened}} {{remains a}} mystery. Southall and the officials {{believed they had}} been cheated. But {{another member of the}} team, Jack Lauterwasser did not believe it then and never changed his mind. [...] "I couldn't <b>see</b> where <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> could have happened. It seemed to me {{that it would have been}} impossible to go off-course," [...] he said.|$|R
5000|$|However Bendlin's {{clinical}} assistant, Lyubov Romanowa, who {{herself had}} seen many deformities in children stated that [...] "they had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this", and <b>that</b> {{she believed that}} it was [...] "not of human origin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I've traded {{there for}} {{fourteen}} voyages, and I have never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> chest before. That's worth {{a pile of}} money, just as it stands. But it's so heavy, that surely {{there must be something}} valuable inside it. Don't you think we ought to open it and see?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{contrast}} of Heyst's quiet, polished manner gave her special delight and {{filled her with}} admiration. She had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before. If she had, perhaps, known kindness in her life, she had never met the forms of simple courtesy. She was interested by it as a very novel experience, not very intelligible, but distinctly pleasurable.|$|E
6000|$|... “Such {{a charming}} {{lady in a}} grey silk dress and a hand as white as snow. She looked at me through such funny glasses {{on the end of}} a long handle. A very great lady but her voice was as kind as the voice of a saint. I have never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> She made me feel so timid.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Commenting on {{the goal}} at the time, Manchester United's manager Sir Alex Ferguson stated,"I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it, <b>that's</b> for sure. Absolutely stunning. Unbelievable. The {{thing about that}} goal is that Nani's goal will be {{completely}} forgotten {{and it was a}} fantastic goal. His first touch takes it around the defender and he rolled it into the net. It was an unbelievable goal but no-one in their right sense will even talk about it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} <b>see</b> a child <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{in this world}} before?" [...] she would say, holding it out to them. [...] "Isn't it a {{wonderful}} baby? You never saw a child with legs <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I know. Nurse says he's the most extraordinary baby she ever attended. Bless him!" ...|$|R
60|$|Aunt Olivia {{dropped her}} sewing and stood up. I have never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> the {{transformation}} <b>that</b> came over her. It was so thorough and sudden {{as to be}} almost uncanny. The old maid vanished completely, and in her place was a woman, full to the lips with primitive emotion and pain.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard had {{traveled}} since morning along a ridge of fells {{when he sat}} down beside the water and contentedly filled his pipe. On the one hand, a wall of crags high above was growing black against the evening light, and the stream, clear as crystal, came boiling down among great boulders. But the young man had wandered through many a grander and more savage scene of rocky desolation, and it impressed him less than the green valley in front of him. He had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> either on the Pacific slope or in Western Canada.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before!" [...] {{said the}} judge. [...] "Wilson, I {{am going to}} confess now, that I wasn't quite able to believe in that leg business, and had a {{suspicion}} {{that it was a}} put-up convenience between those twins; and when Count Angelo fainted I thought I saw the whole scheme--thought it was pretext No. 1, and would be followed by others till twelve o'clock should arrive, and Luigi would get off with all the credit of seeming to want to fight and yet not have to fight, after all. But I was mistaken. His pluck proved it. He's a brave fellow and did want to fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some swimmer, that boy, some swimmer," [...] he praised. [...] "Nothing chicken-hearted about him.--Say, I {{only know}} tank-swimmin', an' bay-swimmin', but now I'm goin' to learn ocean-swimmin'. If I {{could do that}} I'd be so proud you couldn't come within forty feet of me. Why, Saxon, honest to God, I'd sooner do what he done than own a thousan' farms. Oh, I can swim, too, I'm tellin' you, like a fish--I swum, one Sunday, from the Narrow Gauge Pier to Sessions' Basin, an' that's miles--but I never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> guy in the swimmin' line. An' I'm not goin' to leave this beach until he comes back.--All by his lonely out there in a {{mountain}} sea, think of it! He's got his nerve all right, all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' I don't want to <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it again. <b>That</b> cat'd bunched back an' down till {{it had all}} of {{six feet}} slack in its body. An' Rocky's stick four inches long. The cat got him. You couldn't see one from t'other. No chance to shoot. It was Harry, in the end, that got his knife into the panther's jugular." ...|$|R
25|$|In May 2009, a guest {{was stabbed}} {{critically}} by another guest. The Executive Director of Saint Francis House, Karen LaFrazia, {{said that this}} was a very rare occurrence and that in her tenure of more than a decade, she had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this and <b>that</b> the environment is safe and a haven for many hundreds of people every day. The people involved in the incident were not regular guests of Saint Francis House.|$|R
60|$|Next evening Wyllard {{sat with}} Mrs. Radcliffe {{in a big}} low-ceilinged room at Garside Scar, looking about him with quiet interest. He had now and then spent {{a day or two}} in huge Western hotels, but he had never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> quite <b>like</b> <b>that</b> room. The sheer {{physical}} comfort of its arrangements appealed to him, but after all he was not one who had ever studied his bodily ease very much, and what he regarded as the chaste refinement of its adornment had a deeper effect. Though he had lived for the most part in the bush and on the prairie, he had been endued with or had somehow acquired an artistic susceptibility.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I {{lifted a}} smoke, {{and heard the}} barking of the dogs--Indian dogs--and came into camp. There must have been five hundred of them, proper Indians at that, and I could see by the jerking-frames that the fall hunting had been good. And then I met her--Lucy. That was her name. Sign language--that was all we could talk with, till they {{led me to a}} big fly--you know, half a tent, open on the one side where a campfire burned. It was all of moose-skins, this fly--moose-skins, smoke-cured, hand-rubbed, and golden-brown. Under it {{everything}} was neat and orderly as no Indian camp ever was. The bed was laid on fresh spruce boughs. There were furs galore, and on top of all was a robe of swanskins--white swan-skins--I have never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> robe. And on top of it, sitting cross-legged, was Lucy. She was nut-brown. I have called her a girl. But she was not. She was a woman, a nut-brown woman, an Amazon, a full-blooded, full-bodied woman, and royal ripe. And her eyes were blue.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} had tea, quietly and gallantly tête-à-tête in his drawing-room, he {{asked her if she}} {{would like to see the}} other rooms of the house. She thanked him, and he showed her the {{substantial}} oak dining-room, and the little room with medical works and a revolving chair, which he called his study: then the kitchen and the pantry, the housekeeper looking askance; then upstairs to his bedroom, which was very fine with old mahogany tall-boys and silver candle-sticks on the dressing-table, and brushes with green ivory backs, and a hygienic white bed and straw mats: then the visitors' bedroom corresponding, with its old satin-wood furniture and cream-coloured chairs with large, pale-blue cushions, and a pale carpet with reddish wreaths. Very nice, lovely, awfully nice, I do like that, isn't that beautiful, I've never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that!</b> came the gratifying fireworks of admiration from Alvina. And he smiled and gloated. But in her mind she was thinking of Manchester House, and how dark and horrible it was, how she hated it, but how it had impressed Ciccio and Geoffrey, how they would have loved to feel themselves masters of it, and how done in the eye they were. She smiled to herself rather grimly. For this afternoon she was feeling unaccountably uneasy and wistful, yearning into the distance again: a trick she thought she had happily lost.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, the {{hardness}} of her heart. She {{tried to}} be tender with me. She is awful. I said to her, ‘Rita, have you sold your soul to the Devil?’ and she shouted like a fiend: ‘For happiness! Ha, ha, ha!’ She threw herself backwards on that couch in your room and laughed and laughed and laughed as if I had been tickling her, and she drummed {{on the floor with}} the heels of her shoes. She is possessed. Oh, my dear innocent young Monsieur, you have never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> That wicked girl who serves her rushed in with a tiny glass bottle and put it to her nose; but I had a mind to run out and fetch the priest from the church where I go to early mass. Such a nice, stout, severe man. But that false, cheating creature (I am sure she is robbing our Rita from morning to night), she talked to our Rita very low and quieted her down. I am sure I don’t know what she said. She must be leagued with the devil. And then she asked me if I would go down and make a cup of chocolate for her Madame. Madame—that’s our Rita. Madame! It seems they were going off directly to Paris and her Madame had had nothing to eat since the morning of the day before. Fancy me being ordered to make chocolate for our Rita! However, the poor thing looked so exhausted and white-faced that I went. Ah! the devil can give you an awful shake up if he likes.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m an old man, an’ I’ve seen a {{good many}} rows in my time, but I’ve never <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> the one <b>that</b> ’appened then.

50|$|Dickens {{wrote about}} pigs {{wandering}} {{up and down}} the city streets. Miriamsays she is thankful we don’t <b>see</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> today, as a woman walksby with a pet pot-bellied pig on a leash. Dickens talked about the colors of women’s clothing, men’s whiskers, and the general hubbub of New York traffic as the camera shows what those look like in the 21st century. Tour guide Michael Emyrs shows Miriam where the Park Theater stood on Park Row. This is where the famous Boz Ball took place on Valentine’s Day, 1842.3,000 people in full dress attended. It was the social event of thedecade. Mr Emyrs shows Miriam some music written for the Boz Ball that had beenthought to be lost. He also shows her where Five Points, Manhattan was (about where Baxter Street meetsWorth Street) and where the Tombs stood. (Just north of Foley Square where theDept. of Health building is). There is nothing remaining of Five Pointstoday. The TV shows some wonderful images of what these areas looked like.The movie The Gangs of New York accurately recreated Five Points for theirset. Miriam visits the modern Tombs, just a few blocks north of the original,at White and Centre Streets. Captain Helmie, who is in charge, gives her aguided tour. Miriam comments that it is much as she expected it to be. The cells are almost like a low-end hotel room. There is a basketball court on the roof of theTombs. Miriam thinks it is almost cruel that the inmates have a magnificentview of Manhattan but they can’t go out to enjoy the Big Apple.|$|R
