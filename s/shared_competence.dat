40|$|Abstract. The author's {{aim is to}} {{construct}} and validate empirically a theoretical model that allows performance and competitiveness in firms located in industrial districts to be explained. From the strategic perspective adopted, economic revenues are explained by three types of advantage: shared advantages, competitive advantages, and comparative advantages. Neither integration in the district, nor its attraction due to the <b>shared</b> <b>competences</b> within it, are significant predictors of performance. Empirical results indicate that organisational performance is largely explained by the joint effect of firm distinctive competences and cluster-shared competences. It was {{also found that the}} greater the degree of a firm's embeddedness in an industrial district, the greater the effect of its distinctive competences on organisational performance. This evidence suggests that firms which are better endowed with resources and capabilities find the development of sustainable competitive advantages easier when they locate in industrial clusters, as they are more capable of capitalising on the potential for economic rents that these clusters offer. Therefore, the internal heterogeneity of the cluster stems from the different patterns of appropriation of <b>shared</b> <b>competences.</b> In addition, firm embeddedness in an industrial district is also revealed as a moderating variable in the relationship between <b>shared</b> <b>competences</b> and global performance/average return on assets, explained by the positive effects of the participation in models, values, and knowledge flows circulating within the cluster...|$|R

From a dataset of 952 Spanish firms and 35 industrial districts, we provide empirical evidence that industrial districts are spaces with dense networks {{of information and knowledge}} transfer, inter-personnel relationships and a strong specialised stock of human capital, which are accessible and shared by all firms embedded in such a district. However, we explain the complementarity between district and firm-specific capacities in order to develop the notion of absorptive capacity, by indicating that the diffusion of <b>shared</b> <b>competences</b> is neither easy nor direct and that it requires a firm's internal learning effort to better absorb localised knowledge spillovers. Results enable us to shed new light on how firms' knowledge creation and diffusion processes benefit from these external knowledge flows.

Exclusive Community competence established by the Treaty is not recognized as being subject to subsidiarity.

In this paper, I consider the same motive in the so-called genre literature. This label, referring to science fiction, fantasy and horror, is used to display the criteria that the form of cultural communication we commonly call "literature" has to fulfill in order to be subject to valid anthropological analysis and interpretation. Starting from the premise that – if we aspire to meaningful conclusions – the subject of research must be shared, or common, I have studied the genre usage of the mentioned motive in the communicational sense both in the context of New England’s literary tradition and sci-fi, fantasy and horror as such. The conclusions support some premises of anthropological theory: the necessity of existence of certain communicational resources common to individual creators and their audience, and the necessity of <b>shared</b> <b>competence</b> for the use of those resources...|$|E

40|$|On 14 July 2005 Sweden proposed, {{within the}} {{framework}} of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), to add a new group of POPs (perfluoroctane sulfonates, PFOS) to those already covered by the Convention. Discussions had taken place within the Council and its Working Party on International Environmental Issues and with the Commission over the substances to be proposed by the EU and its Member States for listing under both the Stockholm Convention and the Aarhus Protocol to the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution, but it had not at this stage been agreed at EU level to include PFOS among those to be proposed. The Commission took the view that this unilateral act by Sweden was a breach of its duty of loyal cooperation under Article 10 EC (now Article 4 (3) TEU) and brought an action before the Court of Justice, which found that Sweden had indeed failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 10 EC. The case concerns the joint participation of the EU and its Member States in multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and carries implications for mixed agreements more generally. To what extent is Member State action within the structures established by an MEA constrained – as a matter of EU law – by the fact that it participates not only in its own right but also as a Member State of the EU? What does the duty of loyal cooperation require of the Member States participating under <b>shared</b> <b>competence</b> in a mixed agreement alongside the Union? If they are required to act only by way of common Union position does this not come perilously close to the position under exclusive Union competence? How is a ‘concerted Union action’ defined and how might it be identified, if a formal Council decision is not required? How much time should a Member State allow for the internal decision-making within the EU to bear fruit? Apart from these issues relating to the management of <b>shared</b> <b>competence,</b> this case also prompts some reflections on policy coherence within the Union: on the coherence between internal and external EU environmental policy; on coherence between environmental protection and other EU policy objectives, including development cooperation; and on the impact of Union policy choices on a Member State’s policy priorities...|$|E
40|$|Major natural {{disasters}} are events where day-to-day governance activities are disrupted {{and a large}} range of different actors – governmental and non-governmental – are required to (re) act. Given the inherently chaotic nature of disaster events, and the diverse groups responding to their attendant impacts, clarity about how authority and responsibility are allocated across key disaster management actors is essential. This raises numerous pertinent questions: Are there areas of <b>shared</b> <b>competence</b> between different disaster management actors? Is there a need for them to act in common? Is credible cooperation feasible? Can responsibilities be allocated in a clear and effective manner?

The objective of the paper is to synthesise what is known and to, thereby, provoke greater conversation and research of responsibilities during disaster events in Australia and beyond.
