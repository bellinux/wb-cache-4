5|$|Lemur {{research}} {{during the}} 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and <b>specimen</b> <b>collection.</b> Although field observations trickled in from early explorers, modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior {{did not begin}} in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by political instability and turmoil on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s and have greatly increased the understanding of these primates. Research facilities like the Duke Lemur Center have provided research opportunities under more controlled settings. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and human evolution. However, many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting. Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests, illegal logging, widespread poverty, and political instability hinder and undermine conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that—as of 2013—up to 90% of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25years.|$|E

[...] The spores showed considerable damage {{from both the}} fossilization process and the subsequent weathering and <b>specimen</b> <b>collection.</b> [...] They also displayed distinct halos in the amber, possibly from gas or liquid leaching out, or a reaction in the spores that prevented the resin from turning to amber. [...] Even so, enough remained to make some observations about spore morphology. [...] The basidiospores are broadly elliptic to oval, measuring approximately 7.3 by 4.7μm, and each shows a distinct hilar appendage.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} known <b>specimen</b> <b>collection</b> of B.cuneata {{was made}} by Julia Wells some time before 1880. What would later become the type specimen for the species was collected by Western Australian botanist and Banksia expert Alex George on 20 November 1971, from Badjaling Nature Reserve, about [...] east of Quairading, at [...] The species was finally published by George nearly a decade later, in his 1981 monograph [...] "The genus Banksia L.f.

500|$|The {{first known}} botanical <b>specimen</b> <b>{{collection}}</b> of A.obovatus {{was made by}} Scottish surgeon and naturalist Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791. However, this collection {{did not result in}} publication of the species. Other early collections include a specimen collected by Scottish botanist Robert Brown during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound in December 1801 and January 1802; and, thirteen months later, King George Sound specimens collected by Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour, botanist to Nicolas Baudin's voyage of exploration, and [...] "gardener's boy" [...] Antoine Guichenot. In his notes on vegetation published in the official account of the expedition, Leschenault writes: ...|$|E
500|$|The next known {{collection}} was in December 1801, during {{the visit of}} HMS Investigator to King George Sound. Little is known of the circumstances of this collection, other than what is written on the specimen label: [...] "King Georges Sound Decr 1801". The specimen is credited to Robert Brown, but gardener Peter Good and the botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer also contributed to Brown's <b>specimen</b> <b>collection,</b> often without attribution. A more precise date and location cannot be given, as neither Brown nor Good mentions the collection in his diary. Bauer did not publish an illustration of the species and his original field sketches are lost, but William Westall appears to have incorporated it into two of his field sketches, and certainly included it in the foreground {{of one of the}} oil paintings that he later worked up for the Admiralty.|$|E

500|$|The {{first known}} <b>specimen</b> <b>collection</b> of B.grossa {{was made by}} {{botanist}} Fred W. Humphreys in 1965. Alex George has expressed surprise {{that it was not}} collected by earlier visitors to the area, speculating that [...] "perhaps they were diverted by its similarity to B.leptophylla and B.sphaerocarpa." [...] George formally described the species in his 1981 monograph [...] "The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)", based on a specimen collected by him on the Brand Highway, 76km north of Regans Ford, on 14 May 1969. He placed it in subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike; section Oncostylis because its styles are hooked; and the resurrected series Abietinae, which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. It was placed in phyletic order between B.micrantha and B.leptophylla. The specific epithet is from the Latin grossus ("coarse") and refers to the leaves, flowers and fruit, all of which George observed were more coarse than other members of B.ser. Abietinae.|$|E
500|$|The next {{collection}} {{was made in}} December 1801, when King George Sound was visited by HMS Investigator {{under the command of}} Matthew Flinders. On board were botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, and gardener Peter Good. All three men gathered material for Brown's <b>specimen</b> <b>collection,</b> including specimens of B.sessilis, although neither Brown's nor Good's diary can be used to assign a precise location or date for their discovery of the species. Good also made a separate seed collection, which included B.sessilis, and the species was drawn by Bauer. Like nearly all of his field drawings of Proteaceae, Bauer's original field sketch of B.sessilis was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945. A painting based on the drawing survives, however, at the Natural History Museum in London. : parrot bush | work = DigitalCollections: Pictures | publisher = National Library of Australia | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an11944457 | accessdate = 12 October 2007}} ...|$|E
2500|$|Per the Handbook of Correctional Mental Health, [...] "No {{definitive}} or {{objective test}} {{is available to}} confirm or refute the presence of paruresis. The absence of prior treatment {{or the ability to}} void in some social situations but not in others does not rule it out. Although modalities associated with the treatment of social phobias help some individuals, no universally effective medication or other treatment exists. Coercive interventions, such as forcing fluids while observing a person with paruresis, are ineffective and can cause serious medical complications. Alternatives to observed urine <b>specimen</b> <b>collection</b> for individuals who self-report paruresis include unobserved collections in a dry room, testing of hair specimens, sweat testing with a patch, and blood testing ('Test for Drugs of Abuse' 2002).

2500|$|The Court did {{not simply}} take {{the city and}} the {{hospital}} at their word that their motivations were beneficent; rather, the Court examined all the evidence available to determine whether the special needs advanced were divorced from the generalized interest in law enforcement. [...] For example, in Railway Executives, the need to discover the cause of railway accidents justified the drug testing, and in Acton it was the need to promote a drug-free school environment. [...] In this case, however, the very reason for the policy was to use the threat of arrest to motivate the women to abstain from using cocaine. [...] This fact was evident from the fact that police and prosecutors assisted the hospital staff in developing <b>specimen</b> <b>collection</b> and chain-of-custody procedures, the nature of possible criminal charges to which the patients would be subject, and how the police would be notified and the arrests would be accomplished. [...] "While the ultimate goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment and off of drugs, the immediate objective of the searches was to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes in order to reach that goal." [...] Because the MUSC plan used the threat of arrest as the means to accomplish its overall goal of inducing pregnant women to abstain from using cocaine, [...] "this case simply does not fit within the closely guarded category of 'special needs.'" [...] The mere fact that the hospital may have had benevolent motives cannot justify departing from the protections of the Fourth Amendment, {{especially in light of the}} heavy involvement of law enforcement with the hospital's program.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{currently}} {{an epidemic of}} XDR-TB South Africa. [...] The outbreak was first reported as a cluster of 53 patients in a rural hospital in KwaZulu-Natal of whom 52 died. What was particularly worrying was that the mean survival from sputum <b>specimen</b> <b>collection</b> to death was only 16 days and {{that the majority of}} patients had never previously received treatment for tuberculosis. [...] This is the epidemic for which the acronym XDR-TB was first used, although TB strains that fulfil the current definition have been identified retrospectively, this was the largest group of linked cases ever found. [...] Since the initial report in September 2006, cases have now been reported in most provinces in South Africa. As of 16 March 2007, there were 314 cases reported, with 215 deaths. [...] It is clear that the spread of this strain of TB is closely associated with a high prevalence of HIV and poor infection control; in other countries where XDR-TB strains have arisen, drug-resistance has arisen from mismanagement of cases or poor patient compliance with drug treatment instead of being transmitted from person to person. [...] This strain of TB does not respond to any of the drugs currently available in South Africa for first- or second-line treatment. [...] It is now clear that the problem has been around for much longer than health department officials have suggested, and is far more extensive. [...] By 23 November 2006, 303 cases of XDR-TB had been reported, of which 263 were in KwaZulu-Natal. [...] Serious thought has been put to isolation procedures that may deny some patients their human rights, but which may be necessary to prevent further spread of this strain of TB.|$|E
