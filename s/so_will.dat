5|$|When {{entering}} and exiting at {{the same}} station, users are normally charged a minimum fare ($2.15 / $1.75). However since July 1, 2016 users have had a 15 minute grace period to exit the station; those who do <b>so</b> <b>will</b> receive a rebate of the amount paid as an autoload to their SmarTrip card.|$|E
5|$|At Will Bloom’s wedding party, {{his father}} Edward recalls the day Will was born, {{claiming}} he caught an enormous catfish using his wedding ring as bait. Will, having heard these stories all his life, believes {{them to be}} lies and falls out with his father. Three years later, Edward is stricken with cancer, <b>so</b> <b>Will</b> and his pregnant French wife Joséphine return to his childhood home in Alabama {{to spend time with}} his father. Edward’s life is told through flashbacks, beginning with his encounter with a witch in his hometown, Ashton. She shows him his death but he reacts to it without fear. As he grows into adulthood, he finds his home too confining, and sets out into the world with a misunderstood giant, Karl, who has come to town with a traveling circus.|$|E

6000|$|Indeed, Essie and Ellie were <b>so</b> <b>willing</b> {{to go off}} {{to their}} lessons every morning, that their mother often thought it could not be all right, and that the progress, which they {{undoubtedly}} made, must be by some superficial trick; but as their father had <b>so</b> <b>willed</b> it, she submitted to the present arrangement, deciding that [...] "poor Caroline was just able to teach little children." ...|$|R

5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form on {{the side}} of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies. When the subtropical ridge shifts due to El Niño, <b>so</b> <b>will</b> the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years. During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the subtropical ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler mysteriously {{appears to}} Donna to warn her of these events, but never reveals her {{identity}} to Donna. Rose's advice saves Donna {{and her family}} from the destruction of London. Sometime later, Rose appears again and tells her that she needs Donna to come with her, but that doing <b>so</b> <b>will</b> result in Donna dying. Donna refuses, and Rose tells her {{that she will be}} back in three weeks. Three weeks later, Donna and Wilfred are using his telescope when they realise that the stars are disappearing from the sky. Rose appears and Donna is now convinced to go with her. Rose takes her to UNIT and explains that the stars are going out in every universe, and the fabric of reality is collapsing, allowing Rose to travel between universes. Rose implores to Donna that the Doctor {{is the only one who}} can stop it.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins to {{duplicate}} herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there {{is one way to}} stop the game, but doing <b>so</b> <b>will</b> erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we see that in the control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E

5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and <b>so</b> <b>will</b> be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
5|$|This {{alone is}} not enough to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and <b>so</b> <b>will</b> be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Walter and Walternate (Noble) {{start the}} Machine {{equipment}} to overload, {{which will take}} several minutes, after which they can pull the power and deactivate the Machine. Lee states to Peter (Joshua Jackson) {{that he will be}} staying in the parallel universe, where he feels at home, reflecting a previous conversation Peter had with Lee about staying with Olivia in the prime universe. Walter and Walternate have a heartfelt discussion over Peter, and Walter expresses concern that if the bridge disappears, <b>so</b> <b>will</b> Peter. The other Fringe members say their goodbyes to their counterparts. Eventually, the Machine is overloaded and deactivated, and the parallel universe aspects of the room disappear; Walter is pleased to see Peter remains.|$|E

5|$|Like its predecessors, {{the game}} {{features}} some role-playing elements. Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points {{can then be}} spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. Doing <b>so</b> <b>will</b> give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call in support and back-up {{from members of the}} Golden Path. Players can also gain experience by collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and prayer wheels. There is also an Arena mode, in which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and <b>so</b> <b>will</b> the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|While the 741 was {{historically}} used in {{audio and}} other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare {{because of the}} improved noise performance of more modern op-amps.

25|$|In {{the first}} round, every team starts at rank of 2.
