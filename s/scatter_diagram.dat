40|$|In this paper, we will {{consider}} <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{in the context of}} infinite-derivative theories. First, we examine a finite-order higher-derivative scalar field theory and find that we cannot eliminate the external momentum divergences of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> in the regime of large external momenta. Then, we employ an infinite-derivative scalar toy model and obtain that the external momentum dependence of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> is convergent as the external momenta become very large. In order to eliminate the external momentum divergences, one has to dress the bare vertices of the <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> by considering renormalised propagator and vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices. Finally, we investigate <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{in the context of a}} scalar toy model which is inspired by a ghost-free and singularity-free infinite-derivative theory of gravity, where we conclude that infinite derivatives can eliminate the external momentum divergences of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> and make the <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> convergent in the ultraviolet.

40|$|<b>Scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{arose in}} the context of mirror symmetry, but a special class of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> (the cluster <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams)</b> were {{recently}} developed to prove key structural results on cluster algebras. This paper studies <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> from a combinatorial and discrete-geometric point of view. We show that a consistent <b>scattering</b> <b>diagram</b> with minimal support cuts the ambient space into a complete fan. We give a simple derivation of the function attached to the limiting wall of a rank- 2 cluster <b>scattering</b> <b>diagram</b> of affine type. In the skew-symmetric rank- 2 affine case, this recovers a formula due to Reineke. In the same case, we point out that the generating function for signed Narayana numbers appears in a role analogous to a cluster variable. In acyclic finite type, cluster scattering fans are known to coincide with Cambrian fans because both coincide with the g-vector fan. Here, we construct <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> of acyclic finite type from Cambrian fans and sortable elements, with a simple direct proof. The paper includes two brief expositions of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams,</b> one largely following the conventions of Gross, Hacking, Keel, and Kontsevich, and the other (related by a global transpose) more compatible with the conventions of Fomin and Zelevinsky.
