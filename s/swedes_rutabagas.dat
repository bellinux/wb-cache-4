50|$|Lanttulaatikko or swede {{casserole}} is a <b>swede</b> (<b>rutabaga)</b> casserole that is {{a traditional}} Christmas dish of Finland. It is usually served with a few other casseroles at the Christmas table {{as a side dish}} to ham, fish or other meats.|$|R
50|$|Smalahove is a {{traditional}} dish, usually eaten around and before Christmas time, made from a sheep's head. The skin and fleece of the head is torched, the brain removed, and the head is salted, sometimes smoked, and dried. The head is boiled for about 3 hours and served with mashed <b>swede</b> (<b>rutabaga)</b> and potatoes.|$|R

40|$|We {{have made}} a study by {{isothermal}} calorimetry of the heat production response of root and tuber tissue to wounding. Samples with different surface to volume ratios were prepared from carrots, potatoes and <b>swedes</b> (<b>rutabaga)</b> and the overall metabolic heat was measured in closed glass ampoules in a TAM Air isothermal calorimeter. The evaluation was made by assuming that a certain heat production rate per volume tissue {{was associated with the}} normal metabolic activity, and that another heat production rate per surface area was associated with the wound response. The results showed that the wound response part was high; in some cases almost half the heat came from the wound response and not from the ordinary metabolic activity. Measurements such as the ones shown here can be used to understand the effect of wound-induced metabolism in produce quality changes and packaging design...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{reasons for}} waxing are to prevent water loss (making {{up for the}} removal in washing of the natural waxes in fruits that have them, {{particularly}} citrus but also, for example, apples) and thus retard shrinkage and spoilage, and to improve appearance. Dyes may be added to further enhance appearance, and sometimes fungicides. Fruits were waxed to cause fermentation {{as early as the}} 12th or the 13th century; commercial producers began waxing citrus to extend shelf life in the 1920s and 1930s. Aesthetics - consumer preference for shiny fruit - has since become the main reason. In addition to fruit, some vegetables can usefully be waxed, such as cassava; vegetables commonly waxed include cucumbers, <b>swedes</b> or <b>rutabagas</b> and green tomatoes. A distinction may be made between storage wax, pack-out wax (for immediate sale) and high-shine wax (for optimum attractiveness).|$|R
5000|$|Suppengrün [...] means soup {{greens in}} German, and the Dutch {{equivalent}} is soepgroente. Soup greens usually {{come in a}} bundle and consists of a leek, a carrot, {{and a piece of}} celeriac. It may also contain parsley, thyme, celery leaves, <b>rutabaga</b> (<b>swede),</b> parsley root, and onions. The mix depends on regional traditions, as well as individual recipes. The vegetables used are cold-climate roots and bulbs with long shelf lives. Suppengrün act as herbs and impart hearty, strong flavors to the soup or sauce, providing a foil for other strong tasting ingredients such as dried peas and beans or pot roast. Large chunks of vegetables are slow cooked to make flavorful soups and stocks, and are discarded when the vegetables have given up most of their flavor. Finely chopped Suppengrün are browned in fat and used as a basis for a finished sauce. The vegetables may also be cooked long enough until they fall apart, and may become part of the sauce or pureed to form the sauce.|$|R
