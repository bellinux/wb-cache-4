5000|$|The 6th hole is a par 4 which {{parallels}} the 3rd hole, and {{provides an excellent}} view of the course and clubhouse. Out of bounds comes into play on the right. A <b>straight</b> <b>tee</b> shot downhill will leave a short approach shot into a green which can be receptive to shots played short of the green. Bunkers are located short left and just right of the green, and a water hazard is just over the green.|$|E
40|$|As {{the world}} {{population}} increases, the demand increases for quality drinking water. The harvesting of rainwater {{has the potential}} to assist in alleviating pressures on current water supplies and storm water drainage systems. Diversion of a portion of the collected water away from storage is a technique used to improve harvested rainwater water quality prior to storage. Six configurations of a downspout first flush diverter were constructed and tested in the laboratory. The configurations of diverters were evaluated for their affinity to allow diverted water in the diverter chamber to interact with the flow of water to storage. Experiments were conducted at flow rates ranging from 0. 76 L/min to 113. 56 L/min. This range of flow rates adequately represents a wide range of common storm intensity patterns across the United States to which downspout first flush diverters are subjected. The diverter chamber to downspout transition fittings tested on a 10. 16 cm diameter diverter chamber, upward and downward oriented sanitary and <b>straight</b> <b>tee,</b> do not {{have a significant impact on}} the mean difference in initial and final total dissolved solids concentrations observed at multiple sample ports. No statistical difference was observed when comparing upward and downward oriented sanitary tees used as diverter chambers to downspout transition fittings on 10. 16 and 15. 24 cm diverter chambers. Utilizing a <b>straight</b> <b>tee</b> as a transition fitting with a floating ball, acting as a barrier between water collected in the diverter chamber of a downspout first flush diverter and the flow passing through the transition fitting, limited diverted water from interacting with the subsequent flow of harvested rainwater. There is not a significant difference between the use of a downspout first flush diverter with diverter chamber diameters of 10. 16 and 15. 24 cm utilizing upward and downward oriented sanitary tees as downspout to diverter chamber transition fittings. Tests at flow rates less than or equal to 12. 11 L/min exhibited limited changes in total dissolved solids concentrations in the downspout first flush diverters with 15. 24 cm diameter diverter chambers. Tests at flow rates less than or equal to 1. 51 L/min exhibited limited changes in total dissolved solids concentrations in the downspout first flush diverters with 10. 16 cm diameter diverter chambers. The diverter chamber drain flow rate and volume impacts the observed differences in initial and final TDS concentrations at all sample ports on the diverter chamber of a downspout first flush diverter regardless of flow rate. The diverter chamber drain flow rate impacts the flow rate of water entering the diverter chamber through the transition fitting...|$|E

This 3.668 km long layout included one of {{the corners of the}} original Kolmnurk as well as two, shortened, <b>straights</b> on Nurme <b>tee</b> and Haapsalu maantee. There was also a new section introduced consisting another public road and a short purpose build section.|$|R

This kind of pipes needs of suitable mathematical formulation providing performances, in terms of pressure drop and flow-rate. To this aim in this work a methodology based both on experimental tests and on theoretical approach was carried out.

2500|$|Norman had a {{bold and}} {{aggressive}} style of play. He {{is widely regarded}} as one of the best drivers of the golf ball in his era, and perhaps the greatest in golf history. In the fourteen seasons between 1984 and 1997, Norman finished in the top 20 in total driving on the PGA Tour twelve times and in the top 6 nine times (including first in 1988, 1989, and 1993). [...] When driving long and <b>straight</b> off the <b>tee</b> with a persimmon (wood) clubhead in his prime, Norman intimidated many of his fellow professionals. His high ball flight enabled him to carry the ball very long distances. In 2009, Nick Price said: [...] "The best driver I ever saw was Greg Norman." ...|$|R
60|$|Gossett {{turned and}} {{addressed}} his ball again. Then he swung. The club tipped the ball, and it rolled sluggishly {{for a couple}} of feet. Archibald approached the tee. Now there were moments when Archibald could drive quite decently. He always applied a considerable amount of muscular force to his efforts. It was in that direction, as a rule, he erred. On this occasion, whether inspired by his rival's failure or merely favoured by chance, he connected with his ball at precisely the right moment. It flew from the <b>tee,</b> <b>straight,</b> hard, and low, struck the ground near the green, bounded on and finally rocked to within a foot of the hole. No such long ball had been driven on the Cape Pleasant links since their foundation.|$|R
40|$|Unreinforced branch {{connections}} are a typical component of steel pipelines, designed and manufactured {{according to the}} piping code standards of reference. These joints are constructed welding together two straight pipes at different angles respect to their axis and the Stress Intensification Factors (SIFs) of the welded area are readily available from the standards for stress analysis purposes. Nevertheless, branches manufactured using elbows are occasionally encountered during Fitness-For-Service evaluations of the older carbon-steel pipelines conveying fluids at low pressure and room temperature. In the present paper the SIFs for these peculiar joints were determined using FEA and compared with those obtained by FEA and by code for the classic 90 ◦unreinforced branch connections manufactured with <b>straight</b> pipes. 42 <b>tees</b> were considered in the analysis with diameter...|$|R
