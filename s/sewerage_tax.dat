25|$|In areas {{served by}} public companies, as of 2015, the {{residential}} minimum charge was JD5.22/quarter {{for water and}} sewerage. This corresponds to an average water tariff of JD0.14/m3 and a sewer tariff of JD0.04/m3 for 18m3 per quarter. For a consumption level of 36m3 per quarter the average water and sewer tariff was JD0.24/m3 and JD0.14/m3 respectively. The tariff for each next m3 increases until it reaches JD1.92/m3 and JD1.11/m3 respectively for water and sewerage at a consumption of more than 122 m3/quarter. Tariffs for non-residential customers were JD1.30/m3 and 0,87 m3 respectively above a consumption of 6 m3/quarter, independently {{of the level of}} consumption. There is also a <b>sewerage</b> <b>tax</b> that is set at 3% of the assessed property value, which is charged in addition to the sewer tariff. Despite rising property values the <b>sewerage</b> <b>tax</b> revenue has remained constant for many years at JD15m per year, representing less than 10% of water revenues.|$|E
40|$|Sewerage system (cloaca), {{which implies}} any cavity through which waste water flows, has in Roman law a special legal {{protection}} {{due to its}} importance for public health preservation and safety of citizens. In Praetorian Edict, two interdicts are envisaged; one prohibitory, by which private sewerage system is protected and one restitutory, by which public sewerage system is protected. It is possible that a restitutory interdict about private sewerage system existed. By the public sewerage interdict, a person who blocks or damages public sewerage is ordered to restore everything to previous state. By the private sewerage interdict, anyone is forbidden to obstruct a person who wants to repair sewerage that leads from his building through neighboring buildings. By lawyers' interpretations, the application of this interdict is expanded to all realty, {{as well as a}} situation of building a new sewerage system. Moreover, it is envisaged by Praetorian edict that against a person who builds or repairs sewerage neither interdict uti possidetis can be filed. Similarly, by lawyers' interpretations, application of operis novi nuntiatio is prevented against a person who repairs or cleans sewerage system if interruption of work could cause danger. Law developed in the direction that enabled unobstructed maintenance and building of sewerage system through neighboring realty, especially if danger of effusion existed. The only limitations were comprised in the obligation of compensation of damages to third parties, and in certain obligations of public law character: obligation to obtain consent of magistrate when building a new sewerage and duty to pay <b>sewerage</b> <b>tax</b> (cloacarium) ...|$|E
5000|$|This finding came {{despite the}} EPA's {{previous}} assertion that all PBT organic pollutants of concern had been banned from {{production in the}} 1970s and hence these could be ignored in risk assessment. In 2007 toxic PCBs were detected in Milorganite, donated to the City of Milwaukee and subsequently applied on city parkland. [...] The cost to the Milwaukee Metropolitan <b>Sewerage</b> District and <b>tax</b> payers was estimated as $4.7 million. The source of the PCBs was later determined to be a shuttered die-casting facility. The PCBs {{made their way to}} the treatment plant via sewer lines years after the facility stopped operation. PCBs were banned from commerce in the US in the mid-1970s. The United States Geological Survey analyzed in 2014 nine different consumer products containing biosolids as a main ingredient for 87 organic chemicals found in cleaners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. These analysis detected 55 of the 87 organic chemicals measured in at least one of the nine biosolid samples, with as many as 45 chemicals found in a single sample.|$|R
