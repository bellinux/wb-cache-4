5|$|There {{is also a}} woodland, {{a former}} Forestry Commission plantation, planted around 1960 in the {{north-eastern}} corner of the park on a small hill, which contains a circular folly tower, of three storeys, in the centre. The tower, built from red sandstone, is believed to date to the late 18th century. The northern side is considerably more eroded by the weather than the southern side. The tower is marginally wider at the base and has no internal floor structure, but contains holes for floor joists and <b>stair</b> <b>treads.</b> There are four windows on the ground floors and narrower windows higher up.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of smaller {{applications}} for buildings and traffic-related uses. Building components include stone used as veneer (exterior), ashlar, or other shapes. Veneer is a non load-bearing facing of stone attached to a backing of an ornamental nature, although it also protects and insulates. Ashlar is a square block of stone, often brick-sized, for facing of walls (primarily exterior). The other shapes are rectangular blocks used for <b>stair</b> <b>treads,</b> sills, and coping (coping is sometimes nonrectangular). The shapes subject to foot traffic will usually have an abrasive finish such as honed or sandblasted. The stone is mostly limestone, but often is quartz-based stone (sandstone), or even marble or granite. Roofing slate is a thin-split shingle-sized piece of slate, and when in place forms the most permanent kind of roof; slate is also used as countertops and flooring tile. Traffic-related stone is that which is used for curbing (vehicular) and flagstone (pedestrian). Curbing is thin stone slabs used along streets or highways to maintain the integrity of sidewalks and borders. Flagstone is a shallow naturally irregular-edged slab of stone, sometimes sawed into a rectangular shape, used as paving (almost always pedestrian). [...] For curbing, the stone is almost always granite, and for flagstone the stone is almost always quartz-based stone (sandstone or quartzite).|$|E

50|$|Where {{there is}} {{insufficient}} {{space for the}} full run length of normal <b>stairs,</b> alternating <b>tread</b> <b>stairs</b> may be used. Alternating <b>tread</b> <b>stairs</b> allow for a safe forward-facing descent of very steep <b>stairs.</b> The <b>treads</b> are designed such that they alternate between treads for each foot: one step is wide on the left side; {{the next step is}} wide on the right side. There is insufficient space on the narrow portion of the step for the other foot to stand, hence the person must always use the correct foot on the correct step. The slope of alternating <b>tread</b> <b>stairs</b> can be as high as 65 degrees as opposed to standard stairs which are almost always less than 45 degrees. The advantage of alternating <b>tread</b> <b>stairs</b> is that people can descend face forward. The only other alternative in such short spaces would be a ladder which requires backward-facing descent. Alternating <b>tread</b> <b>stairs</b> may not be safe for small children, the elderly or the physically challenged. Building codes typically classify them as ladders and will only allow them where ladders are allowed, usually basement or attic utility or storage areas not frequently accessed.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{states have}} {{introduced}} laws and mandates that require new staircase construction {{to include an}} abrasive surface or <b>stair</b> <b>tread</b> {{to minimize the risk}} of stairway related incidents.

50|$|The {{image on}} the right {{illustrates}} the space efficiency gained by an alternating <b>tread</b> <b>stair.</b> The alternating <b>tread</b> <b>stair</b> appears in the image's center, with green-colored <b>treads.</b> The alternating <b>stair</b> requires one unit of space per step: {{the same as the}} half-width step on its left, and half as much as the full-width stair on its right. Thus, the horizontal distance between steps is in this case reduced by a factor of two, reducing the size of each step.|$|R
