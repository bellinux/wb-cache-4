25|$|As a {{response}} to India’s nuclear test conducted 18 May 1974, the United States adopted more restrictive policies regulating the transfer of nuclear fuel and related technologies to different countries, including Brazil. In addition to suspending USAEC contracts of uranium supply, U.S. officials also pressed the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) Supply Agency to cease all transfers of <b>special</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> to Brazil. Likewise, the U.S. pushed West Germany to remove ultracentrifugation technology from its agreement with Brazil and tried to craft a complementary safeguards agreement with the IAEA.|$|E

2500|$|On September 30, 2009, the NNSA {{announced}} that about {{two thirds of}} the <b>special</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> (e.g., plutonium) at LLNL requiring the highest level of security protection had been removed from LLNL. The move was part of NNSA's efforts initiated in October 2006 to consolidate <b>special</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> at five sites by 2012, with significantly reduced square footage at those sites by 2017. The federally mandated project intends to improve security and reduce security costs, and is part of NNSA's overall effort to transform the Cold War era [...] "nuclear weapons" [...] enterprise into a 21st-century [...] "nuclear security" [...] enterprise. The original date to remove all high-security nuclear material from LLNL, based on equipment capability and capacity, was 2014. NNSA and LLNL developed a timeline to remove this material as early as possible, accelerating the target completion date to 2012.|$|E

40|$|One {{objective}} of nuclear forensics {{is to identify}} the source of interdicted <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> {{in order to help}} ensure the safety and security of <b>special</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> Since 1995, The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported at least 16 different cases involving the illegal possession and transportation of either plutonium or enriched uranium. A non-invasive assay capable of identifying whether a person of interest has been exposed to <b>special</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials,</b> either environmentally or occupationally, would greatly aid in an investigation of the suspected handling and transport of enriched uranium or plutonium. Human hair and nail are used as effective biomonitors for exposure and intake of numerous trace-elements and potential toxins. The {{objective of}} this work was to investigate the hypothesis that the isotopic ratio composition of U and Pu in human hair and nail are reflective of exposure to <b>special</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> Fingernail, toenail, and hair samples were collected from volunteers from national labs (Idaho, Oakridge, LLNL, Y- 12) who self-reported exposure to either U or Pu, under the purview of a DOE CENTRAL IRB and control samples were collected from individuals living in the Columbia, MO region who had no exposure to enriched or depleted uranium or plutonium. Both the concentration and U and Pu isotopic composition was determined using the analytical procedure developed as part of this work. Average uranium recovery was 105 4 percent. 242 Pu recovery ranged from 65 - 101 percent. Both 235 U and 236 U isotope ratios indicated exposure to <b>special</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> in several occupationally exposed volunteers. 234 U isotope ratios were not correlated between controls or exposed workers. Additionally, concentration measurements for 238 U were not correlated with either controls or exposures. Four volunteers had measurable amounts of 239 Pu in their hair, nails, or toenails...|$|R
