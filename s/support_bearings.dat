50|$|Lobe {{pumps are}} similar to {{external}} gear pumps in operation in that fluid flows around {{the interior of the}} casing. Unlike external gear pumps, however, the lobes do not make contact. Lobe contact is prevented by external timing gears located in the gearbox. Pump shaft <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> are located in the gearbox, and since the bearings are out of the pumped liquid, pressure is limited by bearing location and shaft deflection.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{when the}} driving and driven shafts are at equal angles {{with respect to}} the {{intermediate}} shaft, if these angles are greater than zero, oscillating moments are applied to the three shafts as they rotate. These tend to bend them in a direction perpendicular to the common plane of the shafts. This applies forces to the <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> and can cause [...] "launch shudder" [...] in rear wheel drive vehicles. The intermediate shaft will also have a sinusoidal component to its angular velocity, which contributes to vibration and stresses.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, {{in the case}} of the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes, LPS was removed to lower than 0.020  ng mL- 1 at pH  5.3, 7.0, and 8.0 and to 0.039  ng mL- 1 at pH  4.3 with a {{quantitative}} recovery of protein. In the case of DEAE-Sepharose CL- 6 B and histidine-immobilized agarose (Table  2), concentrations of LPS in the recovered solution were higher than those in the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes. Since the removal of LPS to lower than the detection limit is usually required for pharmaceutical applications, the above removal ability of the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes can be an advantage in practical use.|$|R

50|$|Circulator pumps {{as used in}} {{hydronic}} {{systems are}} usually electrically powered centrifugal pumps. As used in homes, they are often small, sealed, and rated {{at a fraction of}} a horsepower, but in commercial applications they range in size up to many horsepower and the electric motor is usually separated from the pump body by some form of mechanical coupling. The sealed units used in home applications often have the motor rotor, pump impeller, and <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> combined and sealed within the water circuit. This avoids one of the principal challenges faced by the larger, two-part pumps: maintaining a water-tight seal {{at the point where the}} pump drive shaft enters the pump body.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{theoretical}} {{investigation is}} undertaken {{to evaluate the}} effects of a number of <b>support</b> <b>bearings,</b> bearing settings and preload on the system natural frequencies and amplitudes of vibration of a spindle assembly supported by angular contact ball-bearings. The paper presents a generalized system of non-linear second-order ordinary differential equations for analysing multi-support spindle–bearing assemblies. The ball to raceway contacts are described by the Hertzian equation representing the non-linear elastic deformation of the rolling elements. The results show how signicant frequencies and amplitudes vary with number of <b>support</b> <b>bearings,</b> orientations and preload...|$|E
40|$|Discussed is a {{magnetic}} bearing {{which was designed}} and tested in a flexible rotor both as <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> and as a vibration controller. The design of the bearing is described {{and the effect of}} control circuit bandwidth determined. Both stiffness and damping coefficients were measured and calculated for the bearing with good agreement. The bearings were then placed in a single mass rotor as <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> and the machine run through two critical speeds. Measurements were made of the vibration response in plain bushings and magnetic bearings. Comparisons were also made of the theoretical calculations with the measured peak unbalance response speeds. Finally, runs were made with the magnetic bearing used as a vibration controller...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel cylindrical-shaped Flexure-based Electromagnetic Linear Actuator (FELA) that exhibits predictable and re-configurable open-loop positioning resolution. By combining contactless Lorentz-force actuation and frictionless flexure-based <b>supporting</b> <b>bearings,</b> it produces high repeatable motion and sub-micron positioning resolution. In this paper, the design concept of this cylindrical-shaped FELA will be introduced. It {{focuses on the}} modeling of the flexure-based <b>supporting</b> <b>bearings,</b> the thermal modeling of the electromagnetic module, and the unique characteristics of FELA, i. e., predictable and reconfigurable open-loop positioning resolution. A prototype was developed to evaluate the performance and demonstrate these unique characteristics of this new class of nanopositioning actuator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  10, the <b>bearing</b> <b>support</b> {{stiffness}} has certain {{influence on the}} natural frequencies, except for the first order. When the <b>bearing</b> <b>support</b> stiffness is less than 1  ×  108 N/m, the natural frequencies increase obviously {{with the increase in}} <b>bearing</b> <b>support</b> stiffness, especially the fifth order; when the <b>bearing</b> <b>support</b> stiffness is greater than 1  ×  108 N/m, the sixth- and seventh-order natural frequencies increase significantly. Modal transition phenomenon occurs in the fifth- and sixth-order natural frequencies when <b>bearing</b> <b>support</b> stiffness is 1  ×  108 N/m, which should be avoided in the optimization design of system.|$|R
30|$|Two primary bearing {{types are}} needed: three wing <b>support</b> <b>{{bearings}}</b> per wing, {{and a number}} of multi-rotational bearings along the bearing yoke for the bearer bars that support the rails. In each case, the bearings need to accommodate motion in several directions.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of high speed rotating machinery {{plays an important}} role in the modern world. In the design of complex mechanical components and rotating machines, such as turbines, compressors, electrical machines, centrifuges or machine tool spindles, systematic analysis of dynamic behavior is needed. The {{dynamics of}} a rotor can be highly influenced by the design of <b>support</b> <b>bearings,</b> since, the critical speeds and the magnitude of vibration responses are dependent on the stiffness and damping characteristics of the bearings. To have the precise knowledge of the dynamics of rotor-bearing systems, it is very much essential to use the correct values of stiffness and damping coefficients of the <b>support</b> <b>bearings.</b> Hertzian contact theory is used to model the force- deformation relationship, also by using matlab software an attempt is made to find the solutions which will result in various plot...|$|E

30|$|Polymeric lipid {{membranes}} of N-octadecylchitosan, {{which consists}} of 70  mol% of 2 -(octadecylamino)- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, 17  mol% of 2 -amino- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, and 13  mol% of 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, were covalently immobilized to carboxylated porous supports composed of chitosan and used for the adsorption of pyrogenic lipopolysaccharide. When human serum albumin solution, including 5  mg mL- 1 of albumin and 5.6  ng mL- 1 of lipopolysaccharide, was passed through a column packed with the resulting porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes assembled in nanoscale, lipopolysaccharide was removed to as low as a detection limit of 0.020  ng mL- 1 with a quantitative recovery of protein. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} directly N-octadecylated porous supports having cationic and hydrophobic ligands which are not assembled as lipid membranes, lipopolysaccharide could not be removed to the detection limit and protein recovery was lower than the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes. The difference above as well as difference from conventional adsorbents suggested that the selectivity was attributable to an interaction between the cationic lipid membranes of N-octadecylchitosan and lipopolysaccharide as well as protein. The porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes were stable in 0.5  M NaOH and 0.1  M HCl at ambient temperature. Considering the confirmed excellent selectivity and chemical stability, their practical use as separation media in the pharmaceutical manufacturing can be expected.|$|R
30|$|The bearer bar <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> {{must allow}} for {{rotation}} about all three axes, {{with the largest}} motions likely about the longitudinal axis of the bridge. They must also accommodate some transverse displacement, which occurs as the wings rotate. Although this displacement is nominally a second-order effect, it is nonetheless large enough that provision must be made for it.|$|E
30|$|The {{height of}} the track above the <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> {{introduces}} small discontinuities in {{the slope of the}} rails at the ends of the CESuRa assembly. The use of lower-profile wings and bearer bars reduces those discontinuities, but their lower stiffness increases deflections due to the passage of rail vehicles. Therefore, there is a balance to be drawn.|$|E
40|$|Torsional {{vibrations}} of reciprocating engines arise due to {{the application}} of periodic combustion forces in the cylinder and the associated inertial forces of rotating Abstract: This paper presents a detailed multi-body numerical nonlinear dynamic model of a single cylinder internal combustion engine. The model comprises all rigid body inertial members, <b>support</b> <b>bearings,</b> joints, couplers, and connections between the various engine components, as well as means of vibration damping. The detailed model is parameterized, thus enabling virtual prototype testing of various engine designs, as well as allowing the engine designer {{to carry out a}} comprehensive noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) investigation of engine performance. This new approach in engine design reduces the conceptual design-to-development cycle time and removes the need for extensive engine testing, which accounts for a considerable cost in engine design and development process. The model incorporates the simultaneous solution of large displacement dynamics of engine components, infinitesimal vibrations of <b>support</b> <b>bearings,</b> and the trapped air-fuel cylinder transient pressures.

30|$|Specific {{interaction}} for LPS of the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes {{seems to}} be useful in a forthcoming issue. Antibody drugs with superior efficacy have been developed intensively {{in the last few}} decades. However, since they are produced by mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary, their cost is very expensive and needs to be reduced. For this issue, intensive researches have been continued for production of antibody drugs using microorganisms such as E. coli[17]. Although protein A chromatography is useful to recover antibody drugs from preparations, further chromatography is necessary to obtain the required purity for their clinical use. It is likely that production of antibody drugs by E. coli leads to a further requirement of selective removal of LPS. Considering the selectivity for LPS of the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes, their application for purification of antibody drugs is interesting.|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{earthquake}} loading {{is normally}} regarded {{not as important}} as its horizontal components and are not explicitly considered in many seismic design codes. However, some previous severe near-fault earthquakes reveal that the vertical ground motion component can be much larger than the horizontal components and may cause serious damage to the bridge structures. This paper theoretically investigates the vertical pounding responses of a two-span continuous bridge subjected to the severe near-fault vertical ground motions. The bridge is simplified as a continuous beam-spring-rod model. The structural wave effect and the vertical pounding between the bridge girder and the <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> are considered, and the theoretical solutions of bridge seismic responses are derived from the expansion of transient wave functions as a series of eigenfunctions. The effects of vertical earthquake and vertical pounding on the bridge bearing, girder and pier are investigated. The numerical results show that the severe vertical earthquake loading may cause the bridge girder to separate from the <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> and hence result in vertical poundings between them when they are in contact again. These vertical poundings can significantly alter the seismic responses of the bridge structure and may cause severe damage to the bridge components such as bridge girder, <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> and bridge pier. Neglecting the influence of vertical earthquake loading may lead to inaccurate estimation of seismic responses of bridge structures, especially when they are subjected to near-fault earthquake with relatively large vertical motion...|$|R

The ball bearings had flattened and softened considerably. Microstructure {{of the inner}} rings and the balls indicate exposure to austenitising temperature. The outer ring has suffered considerable tempering. The wear on the bearings was preferentially on one side. These indicate that the bearing failure initially {{may be due to}} misalignmen...|$|E
30|$|The three wing <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> at A, B, {{and along}} the line AC are {{sufficient}} to support the wing. Because the wing rotates relative to the transition span about line BC, a fourth bearing could be located along that line. However, three bearings are sufficient for equilibrium, and use of four renders the system statically indeterminate and the individual support reactions sensitive to thermally induced deformations and slight inaccuracies in installation. Thus, three bearings are recommended.|$|E
