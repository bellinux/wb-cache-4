25|$|Bonsai are {{carefully}} styled to maintain miniaturization, to suggest age, {{and to meet}} the artist's aesthetic goals. Tree styling also occurs in a larger scale in other practices like topiary and niwaki. In bonsai, however, the artist has close control over every feature of the tree, because it is small and (in its container) easily moved and worked on. The greater scale of full-sized trees means that styling them may be restricted to pruning and shaping the exterior volume once per growing season, never pruning within the canopy nor bending and forming individual branches. In contrast, in a bonsai being prepared for display, each leaf or needle {{may be subject to}} decision regarding pruning or retention, and every branch and twig may be formed and wired into place each year. Given these differences in <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>purpose,</b> bonsai styling uses a number of styling techniques either unique to bonsai or (if used in other forms of plant cultivation) applied in ways particularly suitable to meet the goals of bonsai development.|$|E

Our analysis reveals that country-specific characteristics such as corporate governance, firm ownership, and the nature and quality of the legal system still have a relevant impact on the level and structure of directors’ pay...|$|R

This {{may be the result of}} the social consequences of economic transition. While improving benefits for marginalized groups are met with little public support, general benefits, according to public opinion, should be increased. Measures to improve human capital and flexibility in the labor market are supported by the majority opinion as well. The Czech population also prefers to combine collective (social) protection with private supplementary insurance. redistribution; social justice; private and public insurance...|$|R

40|$|This report, {{part of a}} {{research}} series on roles of participants in high school change, focuses on activities of school district office personnel. Interview and observational data were gathered in nine states. Following a discussion of relevant literature, study findings are presented in five categories: description of regular jobs and roles of district office personnel, role of personnel in the change process, description of strategies used by personnel in charge, and perceptions of office personnel by others. A subsequent section reports on life in the district office. Findings are consistent with previous studies.

40|$|The sociotechnical {{context for}} {{learning}} and education is dynamic and makes great demands on those trying to seize the opportunities presented by emerging technologies. The goal {{of this paper is}} to explore certain theories for our plans and actions in technology-enabled learning. Although presented as a successor to previous learning theories, connectivism alone is insufficient to inform learning and its support by technology in an internetworked world. However, because of its presence in massive open online courses (MOOCs), connectivism is influential in the practice of those who take these courses and who wish to apply it in teaching and learning. Thus connectivism is perceived as relevant by its practitioners but as lacking in rigour by its critics. Five scenarios of change are presented with frameworks of different theories to explore the variety of approaches educators can take in the contexts for change and their associated research/evaluation. I argue that the choice of which theories to use depends on the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>purposes</b> of the intervention, the funding available to resource the research/evaluation, and the experience and philosophical stances of the researchers/practitioners...|$|R
