50|$|The {{family of}} Naveed Butt claim that {{messages}} sent {{to them by}} the Pakistani Intelligence state unless he (Naveed <b>Butt)</b> <b>stops</b> his political work and call for the Khilafah in Pakistan he would be killed and his body dumped somewhere.|$|R
60|$|Then Lancey <b>stopped,</b> let the <b>butt</b> of {{his rifle}} drop, {{leaned against the}} corner of a burning house, and drew his left hand across his brow. Some passing Russians clapped him on the back and cheered as they ran on to {{continue}} the bloody work of ameliorating the condition of the Bulgarian Christians.|$|R
50|$|The {{soldiers}} would {{fire at the}} <b>stop</b> <b>butt</b> from four large earth mounds spaced out across the hillside to the east. These mounds are approximately 91.5 metres apart. These mounds remain, as do some dug-in concreted pits {{on the top of}} these banks.|$|E
50|$|At the {{south-east}} {{end of the}} range, {{opposite the}} gallery, is the large late 19th-century/early 20th century <b>stop</b> <b>butt.</b> This measures approximately 100 metres in length and 30 metres wide. On the opposite side is the markers' gallery, which survives in a reasonable condition. It was {{the location of the}} machinery operating the raising and lowering of the targets, and this was achieved with the use of cables and pulleys using a Hythe pattern target frame. The range had firing points on earth and stone mounds at 100 yard intervals from 200 yards to 600 yards, with an additional lane of fire to the north-east, firing from 800 yards. The soldiers would fire at the <b>stop</b> <b>butt</b> from the positions. However these have since been destroyed with only the 200 yard mound surviving.|$|E
50|$|The range {{became a}} {{scheduled}} monument in October 2015. The {{majority of the}} site remains in good condition. The {{main part of the}} site features the monumental stone <b>stop</b> <b>butt.</b> The sloping back stop is infilled with earth and stone. This was the receiving end, where shots were fired into the bank. The rifle range remains on the private property of Portland Port Ltd, and has not been opened to the public. However it can be seen from surrounding coastal paths.|$|E
60|$|As he stood, bent nearly double, {{his back}} was toward the billygoat, which in their {{interest}} and excitement the soldiers were holding in a careless manner. Before any could <b>stop</b> him, he <b>butted</b> his Majesty so furiously that the King soared far {{into the air and}} tumbled in a heap among the benches, where he lay moaning and groaning.|$|R
25|$|Thornlea also {{boasts a}} {{thriving}} artistic community, with many prominent Canadian musicians among its alumni, including the groups The Philosopher Kings, Prozzak, By Divine Right, Kick <b>Butt!</b> <b>Stop</b> Smoking, hHead, Flutterboard, Hayden, and Moxy Früvous. Some {{of its more}} active extracurricular organizations are arts-oriented, {{in addition to other}} influential athletics-oriented organizations, two prominent ones being the Drama Club and the Music Council. The two organizations have been known to collaborate on intra-scholastic events and concerts. Notable quasi-annual examples of such events are known as Thornstock, and An Evening of the Arts. The Thornlea Lights Sets Sound (TLSS) committee also plays an instrumental role in the organization and orchestration of the school's extracurricular activities, as it is accountable for the technical work that many of the aforementioned events necessitate: for instance, the operation of audio-visual equipment, stage set-ups, mechanical labour and assistance, and so on.|$|R
500|$|Despite the near-loss, Camacho said, [...] "I am {{satisfied}} with our performance. The players worked well {{and he had}} many chances to score." [...] The following Wednesday, Benfica hosted Celtic for matchday three of the Champions League. They continued struggling to convert goal opportunities, hitting the goal post twice in quick succession before finally breaking Celtic's defence with an 87th-minute winning goal by Cardozo. Camacho praised his players for not giving up and staying calm under pressure. On 28 October, Benfica hosted Marítimo for the Primeira Liga. Although Kanú scored first for Marítimo in the eighth minute, Cardozo evened the score ten minutes later. Marítimo {{had an opportunity to}} regain the lead when Quim incurred a penalty and was sent off but his replacement, Hans-Jörg <b>Butt,</b> <b>stopped</b> the penalty kick. In the second half, Adu scored the winning goal for ten-men Benfica in the 87th minute. Camacho said about teams like Marítimo, [...] "We have to change our mentality and never relax, because for teams like Marítimo or Vitória de Setúbal, their 'Champions League' is facing Benfica." [...] On the last day of October, Benfica visited the Estádio do Bonfim for their second game against Vitória de Setúbal, and the remodelled team led at half-time. During the second half Setúbal, pushing hard, scored twice to knock Benfica out of the League Cup. Camacho said, [...] "We were eliminated because they were better. It was a fair loss." ...|$|R
50|$|Within the {{perimeter}} of the rifle range are two remaining concrete sentry posts, possibly of mid 20th-century origin, where lookouts would warn away walkers when shooting was taking place. One is located almost adjacent to the range site, whilst the other is located further south. The posts remain in good condition. A 1960s tin-corrugated observation post also remains above the range, on the clifftop. There are two World War II pillboxes within the range's perimeter. Both structures are in good condition, although overgrown. One sits next to the adjacent sentry lookout, whilst the other is located on a banking against the <b>stop</b> <b>butt</b> structure.|$|E
50|$|The East Weare Rifle Range {{was built}} between 1889 and 1903, on {{additional}} land the war department had to purchase. Constructed using huge ramps {{of earth and}} stone, the range's large <b>stop</b> <b>butt</b> structure had been built by the 1920s, out of Portland Stone. The range was built {{as part of a}} general development of the naval base and its training provisions, where it was used to train naval and other military service personnel, often stationed at East Weare Camp. The rifle range was built in close proximity to Portland's railway line, which the construction of had commenced in 1888. The line opened in 1900, and due to the closeness between the range and the line, red flags would be hoisted during firing sessions, meaning all railway employees were prohibited from entering the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the site remains in good condition. The {{main part of the}} site features the monumental brick <b>stop</b> <b>butt,</b> estimated to be 55 metres long by 15.5 metres wide and around 9.2 metres high. This structure is supported by nineteen buttresses on the north side and six buttresses on both the east and west sides. The back stop is infilled with earth, gravel and sand to form a sloping bank facing South. This was the receiving end, where shots were fired into the bank. On {{the opposite side of the}} butt is the markers' gallery, which still holds the rusting machinery that once operated the raising and lowering of the targets, as well as remains of seat supports. The gallery consists of twelve target frames, (using the Hythe pattern), and associated winding mechanisms, housed in a concrete, earth-covered bunker. This section was built of cantilevered concrete sections on a brick wall, and allowed the range operators to raise and lower targets, patch shot holes and signal adjustments to firing points, where necessary. A now-roofless building is located at the eastern side of the gallery which once served as the target store and workshop.|$|E
5000|$|October {{began with}} the club hosting Shakhtar Donetsk in a 1-0 loss to Mircea Lucescu's team on a goal by Jádson. After the game Camacho said, [...] "We played some decent {{football}} and although at times we had five, six, seven men in the area, the ball refused to go in." [...] On 7 October, Benfica visited the Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa to play União de Leiria. Despite conceding an early goal, the partnership of Cardozo and Nuno Gomes was successful; Gomes scored twice to give Benfica the three points. After a two-week break for international matches, Benfica's season resumed on 20 October with a League Cup match against Vitória de Setúbal. Camacho made many changes in the starting eleven, which nearly cost him the game. A 12th-minute Setúbal goal was not matched until the 94th minute, by Freddy Adu.Despite the near-loss, Camacho said, [...] "I am satisfied with our performance.

[...] November's first game was at the Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game a few minutes later for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1-0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6-1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we did in this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|R
40|$|Shooting ranges {{represent}} about 10 % of polluted {{sites in}} Switzerland. This pollution, mainly consisting of lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb), can spread {{into the local}} groundwater, wildlife, and plants. In this study, shooting range <b>stop</b> <b>butt</b> soils (elevated soil mount behind the target) of 3 sites (Versoix, Cartigny and Nyon, Western Switzerland) were investigated for metal contamination and culturable lead-resistant bacteria in contaminated soils. The ICP-MS analysis of surface <b>stop</b> <b>butt</b> soils (0 - 5 cm) indicated high metal concentrations especially for Pb and Sb; e. g. the Pb concentration ranging from [61, 135 to 395, 651], [23, 821 to 201, 268] and [120 to 27, 517] mg kg- 1 in the soil from the sites of Versoix, Cartigny and Nyon, respectively. Molecular analysis of 16 S rRNA gene demonstrates the presence of bacteria from diverse classes: Flavobacteriia, α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacilli that exhibited high Pb MIC value from 1, 036 to 2, 694 mg kg- 1. The isolated strains could {{be the subject of}} further studies to evaluate their role in bioremediation of lead contaminated soil...|$|E
