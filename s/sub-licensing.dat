5|$|With TVA Sports {{becoming}} the national French rightsholder in the 2014–15 season through a <b>sub-licensing</b> agreement with Sportsnet, RDS subsequently announced a 12-year deal to maintain regional rights to Canadiens games not shown on TVA Sports. As a result, games on RDS are blacked out outside the Canadiens' home market of Quebec, Atlantic Canada {{and parts of}} Eastern Ontario shared with the Ottawa Senators. At least 22 Canadiens games per season (primarily through its Saturday night La super soirée LNH), including all playoff games, are televised nationally by TVA Sports.|$|E

25|$|On November 26, 2013, Bettman and NHL {{announced}} that it had sold twelve seasons' worth of exclusive Canadian national broadcast rights to Rogers Media, who would broadcast games across its numerous platforms, including Sportsnet, Sportsnet One, and City, from at a price of C$5.2 billion. Hockey Night in Canada would continue on the CBC {{for the next four}} seasons, but under a <b>sub-licensing</b> deal the public broadcaster would give Rogers free airtime to air the broadcasts. CBC would be allotted time during the broadcasts to promote its other programming. These moves left Bell Media and its TSN networks shut out of NHL broadcasts except for its regional properties.|$|E
25|$|In Germany {{the public}} {{broadcasters}} ARD and ZDF showed all 32 tournament games live. Across Europe, all games were available on Eurosport in 34 countries and territories. In the United States, ESPN and ESPN2 {{served as the}} official English-language broadcaster, while Univision carried coverage in Spanish. In Canada, CBC Television and Sportsnet broadcast the tournament; the event {{was the first in}} a <b>sub-licensing</b> partnership for FIFA tournaments between the two networks. In the United Kingdom, the games of the English national team were shown live by BBC Red Button and the BBC Sport website. The final was shown live on BBC Three. SBS held the broadcasting rights for Australia, while Al Jazeera broadcast matches in the Middle East and North Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{copyright}} law of 1993 also contained, {{similar to other}} European {{copyright law}}s, contract provisions regulating the transfer of copyrights. Contracts {{have to be in}} writing, except for contracts about the use of a work in a periodical, which may be concluded orally. Shrink-wrap licenses for software are allowed. The law distinguishes between exclusive and non-exclusive transfers of rights. Only patrimonial rights can be transferred, but not moral rights, the resale right, or the right to remuneration for home-copying. In any contract, only those rights explicitly mentioned are transferred, and a transfer is only considered exclusive if the contract explicitly says so. Any contract must specify for which uses the rights on a work are transferred, for which term this transfer is valid, for which territory it applies, and it must define the remuneration the author receives. If no term is specified, an author may revoke the contract after five years with six months notice. If the territory in unspecified, the contract applies only to the territory of the Russian Federation. The remuneration must in general be given {{as a percentage of the}} gross income (sale price) generated by the use of the work, if the contract does not contain a remuneration clause, government-defined minimum schedules apply. The law prohibits the transfer of rights on future works or for future methods of exploitations. Unless the contract explicitly includes a <b>sub-licensing</b> permission, a licensee may not transfer some or all of the licensed rights to a third party.|$|E

2500|$|Rogers' use of CBC's {{television}} stations {{as part of}} the deal also received criticism from other broadcasters and advocacy groups. They argued that Rogers' <b>sub-licensing</b> deal would harm the broadcaster's viability due to its inability to collect further advertising revenue from its most popular program. The Globe and Mail wrote that CBC's <b>sub-licensing</b> deal also effectively [...] "handcuffs" [...] the public broadcaster during the playoffs, as CBC would not have significant ad revenue of its own for several weeks due to the almost nightly games being played. During Rogers' request for a separate network license for Hockey Night in Canada, the CRTC received interventions asking them to require that Rogers provide additional financial compensation to the CBC for airing its content. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre and the Council of Senior Citizens' Organizations of British Columbia also argued that the agreement was not in the public interest, as it meant only to leverage the Hockey Night brand and legacy {{as part of the}} transition to Rogers as the national rightsholder. The CRTC ruled against these interventions, arguing that the agreement allowed CBC to continue filling a large portion of its schedule with programming that would have been otherwise displaced by the complete loss of NHL content, at little to no cost.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, CBC {{president}} Hubert Lacroix, {{who was in}} Montreal, {{was invited}} to an afternoon conference call with Neil McEneaney, Orridge, deputy commissioner Bill Daly, NHL chief operating officer John Collins, Bettman, and Pelley, in which CBC staff learned of the deal, but also of a proposal by Pelley for them to partner. [...] Pelley, Moore, and senior vice-president of media sales Jack Tomik met with Orridge, McEneany, and CBC lawyer Jacques Gaboury in Toronto to begin negotiating a <b>sub-licensing</b> arrangement for Saturday night games. After several additional days of negotiations at a local hotel, a near-final proposal was completed on the Sunday, November 24, for presentation to Lacroix and the CBC's twelve-person board of directors the next day.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>sub-licensing</b> {{deal was}} {{initially}} announced as lasting for four years; CBC staff described the agreement {{as a means}} of providing a [...] "structured exit from hockey" [...] in the event that Rogers does not extend the agreement. The deal was also considered a low-cost means of allowing CBC to maintain a level of major sports output in the lead-up to future Olympic Games and the 2015 Pan-American Games, whose rights are owned outright by CBC. In the case of the Olympics, CBC's coverage is sub-licensed to Rogers and Bell Media networks under a similar time-brokerage and production subsidization arrangement. In 2017, The Globe and Mail reported that the CBC and Rogers had quietly invoked an option to extend the agreement into a fifth season, while Moore stated that he wished to extend the partnership further.|$|E

2500|$|In Pacquiao's {{native country}} of the Philippines, Solar Entertainment held {{broadcast}} rights to the fight, reportedly paying $10 million (PHP 440 million). The telecast was made available via commercial free pay-per-view on the television providers Cignal and SkyCable, and at the locations of theatre chain SM Cinema and the Mall of Asia Arena. Unlike previous Pacquiao fights, whose free-to-air rights were held by GMA Network {{as part of a}} <b>sub-licensing</b> arrangement, a [...] "slightly-delayed" [...] telecast of the fight was simulcast by Solar Sports, GMA, and the rival commercial networks ABS-CBN and TV5. Solar Sports president Wilson Tieng said that Pacquiao personally requested the joint broadcast due to its historic nature, and that [...] "everybody agreed to set aside all their differences {{to make sure that this}} will become the biggest event ever in Philippine television history." [...] GMA held exclusive radio rights to the fight.|$|E
2500|$|CBC President Hubert T. Lacroix, in notifying CBC {{employees}} of the deal in an internal memo, noted that the new <b>sub-licensing</b> arrangement with Rogers [...] "may not be the ideal scenario [...] but, {{it is the right}} outcome for Canadian hockey fans", as it allowed the NHL and the Hockey Night in Canada brand to remain on CBC and be made available to a wider audience with minimal cost to the public broadcaster, which has gone through reductions in funding in recent years. [...] Lacroix, in his memo, believed that CBC's non-hockey content would remain well-promoted on the new Hockey Night, and that being shut out of the package entirely would have been a major blow to the CBC's prestige. In turn, CBC announced in April 2014 that it would cut a total of 657 jobs across its divisions, and no longer pursue broadcast rights to professional sporting events. The loss of Hockey Night was cited as a factor to the budget cuts, but was also credited to the performance of CBC's entertainment programming.|$|E
2500|$|On November 26, 2013, Rogers Communications {{publicly}} {{announced its}} 12-year deal {{to become the}} exclusive national rightsholder for the National Hockey League beginning in the 2014–15 season. Valued at $5.2 billion over {{the length of the}} contract, and covering television and digital rights to the league (national French rights were sub-licensed to Quebecor Media for TVA Sports), the value of the contract surpasses the league's most recent U.S. rights deal with NBC by more than double. Under the contract, Rogers paid $150 million upfront, and will make annual payments beginning at $300 million, escalating to $500 million {{over the life of the}} contract. As part of the deal, Rogers also took over Canadian distribution of the NHL Centre Ice and GameCentre Live services. Rogers Media president Keith Pelley emphasized the increased amount and accessibility of NHL content that Rogers planned to offer under the deal, stating that [...] "Canadians will have more games, more content and more choice than they've ever had before." [...] Also of note was Rogers' plans to maintain the long-running Hockey Night in Canada on CBC through a <b>sub-licensing</b> agreement with the league's previous broadcast television rightsholder, but also extend the brand by airing Hockey Night games across its own networks alongside CBC.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2009, Hasbro filed {{a lawsuit}} against Atari, {{claiming}} Atari had breached their Dungeons & Dragons licensing agreement when Atari sold its European distribution business to Namco Bandai Partners. Atari was accused of <b>sub-licensing</b> part of its exclusive D rights to Namco Bandai Partners without authorization. Hasbro also alleged Namco Bandai had obtained Hasbro's confidential information about D from Atari, and that Namco Bandai had posed as a D publisher for digital games previously published by Atari. In addition, the plaintiff claimed Atari had sold at least four of its subsidiaries actively engaged in D licensed activities to Namco Bandai while denying any relationship between itself and Namco Bandai with respect to D. Atari claimed Hasbro tried to unfairly take back rights granted to Atari, and has sought to resolve the matter without cooperation from Hasbro. On August 15, 2011, Wizards of the Coast, Hasbro, and Atari announced the settlement and resolution of the complaint against Atari and the counterclaims filed by Atari against Hasbro. As part of the settlement, digital licensing rights for D were returned to Hasbro. Atari would continue to develop and market several games under license from Hasbro and Wizards, including [...] and Heroes of Neverwinter for Facebook. In addition, {{as a result of the}} sales of Cryptic Studio to Perfect World Entertainment Inc., the release date of the Neverwinter video game was delayed to late 2012.|$|E
