40|$|In this study, gaseous {{emissions}} and particles are measured during <b>start-up</b> and stop <b>periods</b> for an over-fed boiler and an under-fed boiler. Both gaseous and particulate matter emissions are continuously {{measured in the}} laboratory. The measurement of {{gaseous emissions}} includes oxygen (O 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide and (NO). The emissions rates are calculated from measured emissions concentrations and flue gas flow. The behaviours of the boilers during <b>start-up</b> and stop <b>periods</b> are analysed and the emissions are characterised in terms of CO, NO, TOC and particles (PM 2. 5 mass and number). The duration of the characterised periods vary between two boilers due to the difference in type of ignition and combustion control. The under-fed boiler B produces higher emissions during <b>start-up</b> <b>periods</b> than the over-fed boiler A. More hydrocarbon and particles are emitted by the under-fed boiler during stop periods.

Deteriorated performances in biomass settling and nutrient removal during start-up have however often been reported. The effect of wash-out dynamics was investigated on bacterial selection, biomass settling behavior, and metabolic activities during the formation of early-stage granules from activated sludge of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) over <b>start-up</b> <b>periods</b> of maximum 60 days. Five bubble-column sequencing batch reactors were operated with feast-famine regimes consisting of rapid pulse or slow anaerobic feeding followed by aerobic starvation. Slow-settling fluffy granules were formed when an insufficient superficial air velocity (SAV; 1. 8 cm s- 1) was applied, when the inoculation sludge was taken from a WWTP removing organic matter only, or when reactors were operated at 30 &# 176;C. Fast-settling dense granules were obtained with 4. 0 cm s- 1 SAV, or when the inoculation sludge was taken from a WWTP removing all nutrients biologically. However, only carbon was aerobically removed during start-up. Fluffy granules and dense granules were displaying distinct predominant phylotypes, namely filamentous Burkholderiales affiliates and Zoogloea relatives, respectively. The latter were predominant in dense granules independently from the feeding regime. A combination of insufficient solid retention time and of leakage of acetate into the aeration phase during intensive biomass wash-out was the cause for the proliferation of Zoogloea spp. in dense granules, and for the deterioration of BNR performances. It is however not certain that Zoogloea-like organisms are essential in granule formation. Optimal operation conditions should be elucidated for maintaining a balance between organisms with granulation propensity and nutrient removing organisms in order to form granules with BNR activities in short <b>start-up</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R

In order to minimize the production loss caused by maintenance, the maintenance has to be carefully scheduled. To obtain an optimal maintenance strategy for a whole production site, the maintenance schedules of the production and utility plant have to be tackled simultaneously considering site-wide utility and material balances. However, the interconnections between production and utility system make the scheduling problem become very complex and difficult. In this paper, a multi-period mixed integer linear programming model, Site Model, is proposed {{as an aid to}} optimize short-term site-wide maintenance schedule.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a self-inoculated upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating raw sewage has been studied. The results suggest {{two types of}} start-up periods. During the first 6 weeks of operation, the reactor achieved a removal efficiency of up to 65 % of total chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 73 % of suspended solids. During this primary <b>start-up</b> <b>period,</b> the removal of organic matter was mainly due to interception in the reactor. The second <b>start-up</b> <b>period</b> expressed by biogas release was reached after 14 weeks. An intermediary period between these two start-up periods was characterized by a slight drop of pH and increase of volatile fatty acid in the effluent. The long time to reach the second <b>start-up</b> <b>period</b> seemed {{to be responsible for}} the large discrepancy between removed COD and recovered biogas (107 mL/g COD removed). it is thus suggested that process optimization should focus on shortening the time needed to reach the second <b>start-up</b> <b>period.</b> A model that represents a possible description of the process {{dynamics of}} self-inoculated UASB reactors is proposed...|$|E

Thereafter, a continual drop was experienced, eventually resulting in system acidification. With the lactate units, the pH dropped to 6. 5 by Day 2, with a subsequent climb unit the pH-stabilised around 6. 7 to 6. 9. The volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles of all the units showed an increase of acetic and propionic acids, with the latter at the highest concentration during the first 5 d, corresponding to the decrease in pH. An increase in granulation was observed for the glucose (354 %) and lactate (559 %) units, but no granulation increase was found for the sucrose units. The increase in granule formation indicated that granulation may be enhanced in batch systems over a shorter period and that the granulation process is facilitated by a rapid drop in pH at the start, resulting from the major increase in propionic and acetic acids, followed by a subsequent increase and stabilisation in pH, and an increase followed by a steady decrease in propionic and acetic acid concentration until the formation stabilised.

On the basis of prototype bench tests and from vehicle tests, the additional power requirements and module size for operation of the membrane during the initial period of the cold-phase, FTP- 75 cycle were evaluated. A prototype membrane module (27 in. long, 3 in. in diameter) supplying about 23 % oxygen-enriched air in the engine intake only during the initial <b>start-up</b> and warm-up <b>periods</b> of a 2. 5 -L FFV requires additional power (blower) of less than one horsepower. With advances in air separation membranes to develop compact modules, oxygen enrichment of combustion air {{has the potential of}} becoming a more practical technique for controlling exhaust emissions from light-duty vehicles...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} a CO 2 capture {{system based}} on calcium looping, designed for power plants that operate with very low capacity factors and large load fluctuations, including shut-down and <b>start-up</b> <b>periods.</b> This {{can be achieved by}} decoupling the operation of the carbonator and calciner reactors and connecting them to piles filled with CaO or CaCO 3. When the power plant enters into operation, calcined solids are fed into the carbonator to provide the necessary flow of CaO for capturing CO 2 and storing the carbonated solids. An oxy-CFB calciner designed to have a modest thermal capacity and operate continuously refills the CaO pile. Mass and energy balances of the entire system, combined with state-of-the-art performance criteria for reactor design, have been solved to identify suitable operating windows. An analysis of the effect of the CaO reactivity of the material stored in the piles indicates that temperatures of around 500 – 600 °C in the carbonator are compatible with the storage of solids at low temperature (< 250 °C). This, together with the low inherent cost of the material, allows large piles of stored material. Electricity costs between 0. 13 – 0. 15 per kWhe are possible for the system proposed in contrast to standard CaL systems where the cost would increase to above 0. 19 per kWhe when forced to operate at low capacity. The proposed concept could be integrated into existing power plants operating as back-ups in renewable energy systems in preference to other CO 2 capture technologies that are heavily penalized when forced to operate under low capacity factors.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis is undertaken between a baseline PV/Batt system, meeting a dynamic load profile, and systems hybridised with supplementary combustion-based prime movers such as Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) or Micro Gas Turbines (MGTs) of 30 – 65 kW rating. This study sheds light {{for the first}} time on a number of research questions not addressed in earlier studies. The main contributions of the work are namely to: (i) analyse the effects of the start-up threshold and the type of supplementary prime mover on the Cost of Energy (COE, $/kW h), lifetime CO 2 emissions, and (unrecovered) waste heat for a specified reliability (Loss of Power Supply Probability-LPSP); (ii) investigate the effects of including the transient <b>start-up</b> <b>periods</b> of prime movers on systems sizing; and (iii) look into the effects of using two smaller sized (tandem) supplementary prime movers versus a single larger one on the operational characteristics. The research also analyses (iv) the effects of the methods used (e. g. temporal resolution of simulations, Genetic Algorithm (GA) population size) on the COE, lifetime CO 2 emissions, and (unrecovered) waste heat. The results of this study indicate that PV/Batt and PV/Batt/ICE systems have comparable COEs but are preferable to PV/Batt/MGT. The minimum starting thresholds of supplementary devices (ICE or MGT) have significant effects on renewable energy penetration, genset running hours, waste heat generation, and Life Cycle Emission (LCE, kg CO 2 -eq/yr), but insignificant effects on the COE. The results also show that the transient start-up of supplementary devices has a negligible influence on overall system sizing. The COE resulting from the use of larger capacity prime movers (60 kW ICE or 65 kW MGT) is comparable to deploying two smaller capacity prime movers (30 kW) but results in higher renewable energy penetration, an improved duty factor with lower LCEs. Additionally, the COE increases slightly (2 ∼ 5 %) when the models run at 15 min temporal resolution compared to 60 min...|$|R
