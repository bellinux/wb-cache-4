The exact role of the <b>soluble</b> <b>antigens</b> in the virus synthetic process has been under investigation. Indirect evidence suggests that the <b>soluble</b> <b>antigens</b> represent virus-structural protein subunits produced in large excess of the amount utilized for synthesis of infectious virus (3, 4). A rigorous confirmation of this hypothesis requires evidence that the virus particle contains antigens which are identical with the <b>soluble</b> <b>antigens.</b> It is the purpose of this communication to present data which indicate that the antigens of type 5 adenovirus particles are immunologically and physically identical with the <b>soluble</b> <b>antigens</b> produced in mammalian cells infected by this agent...|$|R

50|$|Even if mature self-reacting B {{cells were}} to survive intact, they would very rarely be activated. This is because B cells need co-stimulatory signals from T cells {{as well as}} the {{presence}} of its recognized antigen to proliferate and produce antibodies (Peripheral tolerance).

30|$|Dendritic cells (DCs), {{the major}} {{professional}} antigen-presenting cells (APCs), {{play a critical}} role in cell-mediated adaptive immunity in which immunological memory is generated after a primary response to a specific antigen, and this memory leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that antigen [9, 10]. In addition, DCs can promote the presentation of exogenous antigens by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), a process called cross-presentation, and then activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [11]. <b>Soluble</b> <b>antigens</b> destined for cross-presentation are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and then transferred to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation and peptide loading. Conventional DC vaccines lead to a moderate immune response due to the relatively unsatisfactory transport of <b>soluble</b> <b>antigens.</b> Therefore, nanoadjuvants have been explored as carriers of <b>soluble</b> <b>antigens</b> to enhance cross-presentation in DCs in many research studies [12 â 14].|$|R

The results indicated a significant correlation between skin reactivity and in vitro tests with <b>soluble</b> <b>antigens</b> and that, of the in vitro tests used, lymphocyte transformation correlated better with skin test than LIF production.

None was more suitable than crude V-Z antigen for serodifferentiation of V-Z virus and HSV infections. The envelope antigen, cell membrane antigen, and the <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen</b> prepared by density gradient centrifugation showed little reactivity with sera from varicella and HSV infections, but gave high antibody titers with sera from zoster infections, suggesting that a secondary V-Z virus infection is required to produce an antibody response to these subunit antigens.

40|$|Further {{evidence}} implicating murine leukemia-like {{virus in}} the disorders of NZB mice was afforded by {{a study of}} antigens associated with murine leukemia virus (MuLV). MuLV group antigens were prevalent in extracts of spleen, kidney, and, to a lesser extent, thymus throughout {{a substantial portion of}} the life span of NZB mice as well as in extracts of lymphomas and sarcomas indigenous to the strain. G (Gross) <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen,</b> type-specific antigen, was first detected in plasma of untreated NZB mice at 3 months of age. G <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen</b> production increased thereafter in line with age, with 50 % of reactions becoming positive at 5. 3 months and 100 % at 7 to 9 months. From months 3 to 9, the time-response curve for positive conversion of direct antiglobulin (Coombs) tests in untreated NZB mice corresponded closely to that for G <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen</b> production. Beyond the 9 th month, G <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen</b> underwent elimination from the plasma of NZB mice, with positive reactions reduced to 50 % at 13. 3 months and to 0 % at 18 months. G natural antibody was first detected in the serum of NZB mice at about 10 months of age and increased thereafter in line with age. The curves for G antibody production and G <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen</b> elimination bore a reciprocal relation to each other with crossover at 50 % response occurring at 13. 3 months. Significant proteinuria, a functional manifestation of membranous glomerulonephritis, became increasingly prevalent in female NZB mice as G <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen</b> was eliminated from plasma. Cumulative mortality of female NZB mice, mainly attributable to renal glomerular disease, increased in phase with G antibody production. MuLV group antigens were identified in the glomerular lesions by the immunofluorescence method. Positive conversion of direct antiglobulin tests was significantly delayed by vaccinating baby NZB mice with formaldehyde-inactivated cell-free filtrates of older NZB mouse spleens. The plasmas of vaccinated NZB mice with negative direct antiglobulin reactions at 4 to 7 months were likewise negative when tested for G <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen.</b> The 50 % response time for G antibody production in the vaccinated NZB mice occurred at 7. 3 months, that is, 6 months earlier than in untreated NZB mice. The collective findings implicate murine leukemia-like virus in the etiology of autoimmune hemolytic disease and membranous glomerulonephritis, as well as malignant lymphoma, of NZB mice and suggest that virus-specified cell-surface and <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen</b> is a factor in the immunopathogenesis of the renal disease and possibly also the autoimmune hemolytic disease...|$|E

40|$|Guinea pigs {{which were}} {{injected}} with either whole bacilli or purified soluble glycerol teichoic acid (GTA) usually exhibited {{a rise in}} hemolysin titer to GTA-coated erythrocytes. The only exceptions were those animals having high baseline titers of natural anti-GTA antibodies. Rats yielded better responses than guinea pigs and produced significantly higher responses to the <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen</b> than to the cellular GTA. Rats reared on a GTA-free diet were predominantly free of natural antibodies to GTA and furnished a more clear-cut model for assaying immune responses. Using this model, it was shown that adsorption of GTA to homologous erythrocytes before injection resulted in poor responses, suggesting that such spontaneous adsorption {{does not account for}} the good responses to <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen.</b> In GTA-deprived rats, positive skin tests were induced only with bacilli, whereas migration inhibitory factor was induced with both bacilli and <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen.</b> Hemolytic plaques in immunized rats were increased over controls with both kinds of immunogen, but the GTA-deprived rats responded better than conventional ones, and hemolytic plaque responses to bacilli were better than those to <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen.</b> This reversal of the serum hemolysin results may be due to delayed suppression by soluble GTA or to antibody cycling. The guinea pig data, combined with results from GTA-deprived rats, suggest that high antibody levels resulted in depressed antibody synthesis, perhaps because antibody cycling was initiated. No evidence was found to explain the superior responses to <b>soluble</b> <b>antigen,</b> but it did not seem related to formation of immune complexes or adsorption to erythrocyte membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{products}} of autolysis on Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona was investigated in bovine kidney tissues and urine inoculated with this organism.

On the other hand, leptospires were detectable by dark-field microscopy and fluorescent-antibody test 38 days after addition to urine. The rate of destruction proceeded less rapidly in tissues stored at 4 degrees C. Under the conditions of this study, <b>soluble</b> leptospiral <b>antigen</b> levels decreased less rapidly than did the number of detectable leptospires. Similarly, breakdown of leptospires, demonstrated by dark-field microscopy and fluorescent-antibody test, progressed during the first 5 days after inoculation of urine, when levels of <b>soluble</b> leptospiral <b>antigen</b> remained constant.
