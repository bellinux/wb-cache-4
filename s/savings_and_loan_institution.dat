5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>institution</b> that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E

50|$|Western Savings and Loans {{eventually}} became a $6 billion <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>institution.</b> Western shared {{a position on the}} list of the nation's 100 largest savings and loans with other Arizona-based institutions — MeraBank was number 27 on the list, Western came in at 37th, Great American was 67th, and Pima was 82nd. But in 1989, Western Savings moved into second place — not for its size, but for the amount of its losses, with a $1.06 billion net deficit, following a substantial but smaller loss the previous year. Western Savings was taken over by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal depositor for {{the savings and loan crisis}} bailout in June 1989. In June 1990, Bank of America paid the Resolution Trust Corporation $81 million for Western Savings' $3.5 billion in deposits in 60 branches in Arizona and one branch in Salt Lake City, Utah, and converted the thrift into commercial bank called Bank of America Arizona.

40|$|After {{hundreds}} of <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>institutions</b> became insolvent in the 1980 s, Congress enacted the Federal Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, {{which was designed}} to provide affordable mortgage financing to low and moderate income individuals, and to dispose of the assets of the failed <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>institutions.</b> Among the powers granted by FIRREA to the FDIC was the ability to disaffirm or repudiate leases held by insolvent institutions if those leases are deemed burdensome. In 2 ̆ 2 Resolution Trust Corp. v.

While protections for low and moderate income tenants are appropriate, the language of FIRREA does not preclude Federal preemption of regulations as they are applied to high income tenants. By disallowing preemption with respect to this class of leases, the 2 ̆ 2 Diamond 2 ̆ 2 decision undermines the goals of FIRREA by preventing the FDIC from maximizing the net present value of the assets of failed financial institutions...|$|R
