25|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>modification</b> of nanocellulose is {{currently}} receiving {{a large amount}} of attention. Nanocellulose displays a high concentration of hydroxyl groups at the surface which can be reacted. However, hydrogen bonding strongly affects the reactivity of the surface hydroxyl groups. In addition, impurities at the surface of nanocellulose such as glucosidic and lignin fragments need to be removed before <b>surface</b> <b>modification</b> to obtain acceptable reproducibility between different batches.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene Petri {{dishes and}} other {{laboratory}} containers such as test tubes and microplates {{play an important}} role in biomedical research and science. For these uses, articles are almost always made by injection molding, and often sterilised post-molding, either by irradiation or by treatment with ethylene oxide. Post-mold <b>surface</b> <b>modification,</b> usually with oxygen-rich plasmas, is often done to introduce polar groups. Much of modern biomedical research relies on the use of such products; they therefore play a critical role in pharmaceutical research.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid adverse {{side-effects}} from the possible presence of surfactants, an alternative casting process can be used involving a frit compression method that did not {{require the use of}} surfactants or <b>surface</b> <b>modification.</b> The dimensions can be controlled through the size of the syringe housing and through the mass of carbon nanotubes added. Their thicknesses are typically much larger than surfactant-cast buckypaper and have been synthesized from 120 μm up to 650 μm; whilst no nomenclature system exists to govern thicknesses for samples to be classified as paper, samples with thicknesses greater than 500 μm are referred to as buckydiscs. The frit compression method allows rapid casting of buckypaper and buckydiscs with recovery of the casting solvent and control over the 2D and 3D geometry.|$|E

Considering the presence of SiO and SiOH (known to adsorb cationic dyes and inhibit anionic dye adsorption), the structure of MCM- 41 is negatively charged [14]. The importance of interaction between MCM- 41 and safranin (a large positively charged dye) was examined in a previous study [15].

40|$|Some handaxes, {{for example}} the handaxe from Anderen, show strong partial {{rounding}} of the tips. For this phenomenon various explanations have been offered. The rounding could be use-wear or the result of partial exposure to natural processes. A substantial collection of French handaxes is studied to resolve this issue. A method is developed to distinguish use-wear from rounding produced by various natural processes on weathered flints. Microscopic observations reveal that the attributes of the rounding do not fit within any of the current hypotheses. Instead the small pits that are characteristic of the rounded surfaces show a correlation with other <b>surface</b> <b>modifications</b> of and substances on flint. A review of literature in addition to microbiological research show these <b>surface</b> <b>modifications</b> and substances, like friction gloss and surface erosion, {{to be caused by}} micro-organisms.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{introduce}} a novel polymer platform based on off-stoichiometry thiol–enes (OSTEs), aiming {{to bridge the gap}} between research prototyping and commercial production of microfluidic devices. The polymers are based on the versatile UV-curable thiol–ene chemistry but takes advantage of off-stoichiometry ratios to enable important features for a prototyping system, such as one-step <b>surface</b> <b>modifications,</b> tuneable mechanical properties and leakage free sealing through direct UV-bonding. The platform exhibits many similarities with PDMS, such as rapid prototyping and uncomplicated processing but can at the same time mirror the mechanical and chemical properties of both PDMS as well as commercial grade thermoplastics. The OSTE-prepolymer can be cast using standard SU- 8 on silicon masters and a table-top UV-lamp, the <b>surface</b> <b>modifications</b> are precisely grafted using a stencil mask and the bonding requires only a single UV-exposure.

30|$|Figure 1 a {{shows the}} {{evolution}} of the sheet resistance of 220 -nm Si membranes in dry air for the two <b>surface</b> <b>modifications.</b> The data points are averages of several samples.

The HF treatment reduces the sheet resistance by more than two orders of magnitude compared to samples with the native-oxide termination (gray band). The sheet resistance increases slowly with time as the surface oxidizes gradually to form electrically active interface traps that deplete free carriers. This behavior is consistent with the results in Ref [1].|$|R

40|$|<b>Surface</b> {{chemical}} <b>modifications</b> {{are presented}} for supporting primary neurons in culture. The initial substrates for culture were glass and gold. The <b>surface</b> <b>modifications</b> {{were based on}} self assembled monolayer (SAM) approaches. Glass surfaces were initially modified by silanisation with either 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) or 3 -aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane (APDES), to present amino-terminated surfaces. Gold surfaces were initially modified by thiol SAMs of either 11 -amino- 1 -undecanethiol (AUT) or a peptide fragment of laminin (PA 22 - 2), to present an amino- or peptide-terminated surface respectively. The amine-terminated surfaces of both glass and gold were subject to further modification. A heterobifunctional linker, containing a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer, was used to couple the peptide PA 22 - 2 to the amino-terminated <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>modifications</b> were characterised using WCA, XPS and ToF-SIMS. The heterobifunctional linker bound homogeneously across the AUT SAM surface, however the linker was not distributed evenly on either of the amino silanisations of glass. Primary neurons from dissociated embryonic rat hippocampi were cultured on the modified glass and gold surfaces. The cell viability was measured during a 3 week long culture using calcein and ethidium homodimer fluorescence. Neuronal cell cultures were viable on all the gold <b>surface</b> <b>modifications.</b> The only viable glass surface was a control surface of adsorbed poly-l-lysine (PLL) on glass. Cell viability on the AUT and the Peptide-PEG-AUT modified gold surfaces was equivalent to the PLL coated glass. Inclusion of the PEG linker reduced protein adsorption from the media to the peptide modified gold surface, allowing cells to recognise the peptide rather than an adsorbed protein layer and improving their viability.
