Commonly, HMD occurs in preterm infants with surfactant deficiency because of lung immaturity. Lung maturity test could be performed using biochemical, biophysical, and amniotic fluid turbidity test. Objective To find out HMD prevalence {{and the value of}} <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> and lamellar body concentration in diagnosing HMD in preterm infants. Methods This was a cross-sectional study carried out at Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung on preterm infants born during October- December 2001. The <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> was performed using gastric fluid and amniotic fluid while the lamellar body concentration was per- formed using amniotic fluid. Results During the 3 -month period, 571 infants were born, of 64 (11. 2 %) preterm infants, only 41 (64 %) fulfilled the inclusion crite- ria; among those preterm infants, 14 (34 %) suffered from respira- tory distress and 7 suffered from HMD (prevalence 17 %). All HMD cases occurred in infants less than 32 weeks for gestational age. In 7 preterm infants with HMD, the <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> of gastric fluid ob- tained by lavage showed negative results in 3 and + 1 in 4 infants; while the <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> of amniotic fluid revealed negative result in 5 and + 1 in 2 infants. Lamellar body concentration of amniotic fluid was ≤ 18, 000 /ml in all HMD infants. Among three infants less than 32 weeks for gestational age who did not suffer from HMD, + 1 <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> of gastric fluid was found in 2 infants and + 2 in 1 infant; while <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> of amniotic fluid showed negative result in 1 infant and + 1 in 2; the lamellar body concentration of amniotic fluid was ≤ 18, 000 /ml in 2 infants and > 18, 000 /ml in 1 infant.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} sensitivity and specificity of the mastoid vibration test in patients who had suffered an attack of vestibular neuritis. Results were compared with the caloric test and two bedside tests of vestibular function (head <b>shaking</b> <b>test</b> and head thrust test). Results are reported in 28 patients who had a residual vestibular deficit 6 months after acute neuritis and in 25 healthy subjects. Mastoid vibration nystagmus was evoked in 21 patients but not in controls. In these patients, mastoid vibration test had a sensitivity of 75 % and specificity of 100 %. Since one patient had inverted mastoid vibration nystagmus, specificity of identification on the pathological side was 95 %. Sensitivity of the test increased with increasing severity of the vestibular lesion. Indeed, mastoid vibration nystagmus was induced in 93 % of patients with caloric paralysis and in 58 % of those with caloric paresis. Nystagmus could usually be modulated or elicited by stimulation of either mastoid. In the few patients in whom mastoid vibration nystagmus was elicited only from one side, or when there was a clear difference in intensity of the nystagmus induced on the two sides, the stimulated side was more often the affected side. Four patients still showed spontaneous nystagmus. The caloric test was abnormal in 26 / 28 patients (93 %) with paralysis in 16 and paresis in 12; 71 % of patients had a head shaking induced nystagmus: 64 % had an asymmetrical response in head thrust test. In conclusion, mastoid vibration test was overall more sensitive than head thrust test. Mastoid vibration test was slightly less sensitive than head <b>shaking</b> <b>test</b> in patients with severe residual deficit and more sensitive in patients with partial deficit. Mastoid vibration test, a valid, low cost clinical screening test for rapid detection of asymmetrical vestibular function, does not cause patient discomfort.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> setup, testing procedure, data acquisition and reduction process, and the <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> results. The first {{objective of the}} <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> is to identify the modal properties of the hub inplane motions. The prediction of the ground resonance for the rotor-support system is {{a crucial part of}} the risk reduction process in rotor testing. Such analysis requires the structural properties of the hub modes as input. In particular, ground resonance is an aeromechanic instability that can occur during the frequency-crossings of the inplane hub and blade motions. Since the frequency of the blade inplane mode varies with the rotor rotational speed, the frequency-crossings define the critical speed ranges in rotor operation. Ground resonance depends on the level of damping of the blade inplane 2 modes as well as the damping of the hub modes, which in turn depends on the structural properties of the stand support system. Several configurations of the wind tunnel setup were shake-tested to identify a ground resonance-safe test configuration. The second objective of the <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> is to perform a dynamic calibration of the rotor balance. Accurate measurement of the rotor vibratory hub loads is crucial in the development of rotor systems and has remained one of the major challenges in rotorcraft testing (refs. 1 [...] 4). In the MDART test setup, a five-component rotor balance installed below the rotor hub in the nonrotating system measures both the steady and the vibratory rotor hub loads. Since the measured vibratory hub loads are modulated by the dynamics of the rotor balance and the model support system, the results of the dynamic calibration identify the transfer functions relating to the actual applied vibratory hub loads and the balance readings.

The nonlinear magnetic-spring configuration is employed for gen-erating sufficient power from hand shaking of irregular and low-frequency vibrations.

From the hand <b>shaking</b> <b>test,</b> it is found that a longer tube length and a shorter winding coil width could induce a higher power generation. The optimized device of tube length of 66 mm and winding coil width of 10 mm has achieved maximum power outputs of 568. 66 µW at the hand shaking acceleration of 1 g and frequency of 6. 7 Hz, which corresponds to the power density of 90. 67 µW/cm 3. Further improvement of the device has been achieved by increasing the coil length to 40 m.

Existence and extent of conductive hearing loss or confIrmation of tympanic membrane perforation by tympanometry can help a great deal. Also, some new results about the site of perforation and the middle ear volume influence on conductive hearing loss may help have a better insight into chronic suppurative otitis media. Assessing the sense of balance may show dysfunctions with not yet necessarily permanent damage: perilymphatic fistula and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Unilateral or bilateral damage may be diagnosed with appropriate tests of vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) : spontaneous nystagmus, head impulse test, head <b>shaking</b> <b>test.</b> These bedside tests do not require bulky, expensive equipment for stimulus delivery or special equipment for recording nystagmus. In addition, their significance is their ability to provide enough information without performing caloric testing which is contraindicated in chronic suppurative otitis media...|$|E
30|$|Such joints play an {{important}} role in the mechanical performance of traditional wooden framework buildings. This is verified by a <b>shaking</b> table <b>test</b> for buildings. Suzuki and Maeno [1], for example, conducted a full-scale <b>shaking</b> table <b>test</b> and static test and clarified the importance of Nuki joint (crisscross joint connecting columns and beams) for the mechanical performance of buildings. Furthermore, Wang et al. [2] performed a half-scale <b>shaking</b> table <b>test</b> for a Chinese traditional wooden building to show the importance of the energy absorption capacity of mortise–tenon joints for the mechanical performance of buildings.|$|R

The 'NASA/AEFA' <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> configuration was tested for modal frequencies and shapes and compared with its NASTRAN finite element model counterpart to give correlative results. Based upon previous findings, significant differences in modal data existed and were attributed to assumptions regarding the influence of secondary structure contributions in the preliminary NASTRAN modeling. An analysis of an updated finite element model including several secondary structural additions has confirmed that the inclusion of specific secondary components produces {{a significant effect on}} modal frequency and free-response shapes and improves correlations at lower frequencies with <b>shake</b> <b>test</b> data...|$|R
