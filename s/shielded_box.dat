During the spacecraft level tests, additional concerns where raised about potential harm to the Advanced Land Imager (ALI).

The SQUID sensor is a washer-type pick-up coil with 200  μm ×  200  μm, which has an inner hole of 30 μm ×  30  μm. The SQUID microscope can operate up to 4  days on 10  L of liquid He.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{electromagnetic}} interference regulation, the radiated emission from {{device under test}} such as electronic devices must be carefully manipulated and accurately characterized. Instead of resorting to the direct far-field measurement, in this paper, a novel approach is proposed to model the radiated emission from electronic devices placed in shielding enclosures by using the near electric field only. Based on the Schelkkunoff’s equivalence principle and Raleigh–Carson reciprocity theorem, only the tangential components of the electric field over the ventilation slots and apertures of the shielding enclosure are sufficient to obtain the radiated emissions outside the <b>shielding</b> <b>box</b> if {{the inside of the}} shielding enclosure was filled with perfectly electric conductor (PEC). In order to efficiently model wideband emission, the time-domain sampling scheme is employed. Due to the lack of analytical Green’s function for arbitrary PEC boxes, the radiated emission must be obtained via the full-wave numerical methods by considering the total radiated emission as the superposition between the direct radiation from the equivalent magnetic currents in free space and the scattered field generated by the PEC <b>shielding</b> <b>box.</b> In this study, the state-of-the-art discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method is utilized, which has the flexibility to model irregular geometries, keep high-order accuracy, and more importantly involves only local operations.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{studied the}} {{worst-case}} radiated radiofrequency (RF) susceptibility of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) {{based on the}} electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements of a current standard for cardiac defibrillators, IEC 60601 - 2 - 4. Square wave modulation was used to mimic cardiac physiological frequencies of 1 - 3 Hz. Deviations from the IEC standard were a lower frequency limit of 30 MHz to explore frequencies where the patient-connected leads could resonate. Also testing up to 20 V/m was performed. We tested AEDs with ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib) and normal sinus rhythm signals on the patient leads to enable testing for false negatives (inappropriate "no shock advised" by the AED). Methods We performed radiated exposures in a 10 meter anechoic chamber using two broadband antennas to generate E fields in the 30 - 2500 MHz frequency range at 1 % frequency steps. An AED patient simulator was housed in a <b>shielded</b> <b>box</b> and delivered normal and fibrillation waveforms to the AED's patient leads. We developed a technique to screen ECG waveforms stored in each AED for electromagnetic interference at all frequencies without waiting for the long cycle times between analyses (normally 20 to over 200 s). Results Five of the seven AEDs tested were susceptible to RF interference, primarily at frequencies below 80 MHz. Some induced errors could cause AEDs to malfunction and effectively inhibit operator prompts to deliver a shock to a patient experiencing lethal fibrillation. Failures occurred in some AEDs exposed to E fields between 3 V/m and 20 V/m, in the 38 - 50 MHz range. These occurred when the patient simulator was delivering a V-Fib waveform to the AED. Also, we found {{it is not possible}} to test modern battery-only-operated AEDs for EMI using a patient simulator if the IEC 60601 - 2 - 4 defibrillator standard's simulated patient load is used. Conclusions AEDs experienced potentially life-threatening false-negative failures from radiated RF, primarily below the lower frequency limit of present AED standards. Field strengths causing failures were at levels as low as 3 V/m at frequencies below 80 MHz where resonance of the patient leads and the AED input circuitry occurred. This plus problems with the standard's' prescribed patient load make changes to the standard necessary. </p...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a high-resolution scanning {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) microscope for imaging the magnetic field of geological samples at room temperature. In this paper, we provide details about the scanning SQUID microscope system, including the magnetically <b>shielded</b> <b>box</b> (MSB), the XYZ stage, data acquisition by the system, and initial evaluation of the system. The background noise in a two-layered PC permalloy MSB is approximately 40 – 50 pT. The long-term drift of the system is approximately ? 1 nT, which can be reduced by drift correction for each measurement line. The stroke of the XYZ stage is 100 mm × 100 mm with an accuracy of ~ 10 µm, which was confirmed by laser interferometry. A SQUID chip has a pick-up area of 200 ?m × 200 ?m with an inner hole of 30 ?m × 30 ?m. The sensitivity is 722. 6 nT/V. The flux-locked loop has four gains, i. e., × 1, × 10, × 100, and × 500. An analog-to-digital converter allows analog voltage input in the range of about ± 7. 5 V in 0. 6 -mV steps. The maximum dynamic range is approximately ± 5400 nT, and the minimum digitizable magnetic field is ~ 0. 9 pT. The sensor-to-sample distance is measured with a precision line current, which gives the minimum of ~ 200 µm. Considering the size of pick-up coil, sensor-to-sample distance, and the accuracy of XYZ stage, spacial resolution of the system is ~ 200 µm. We developed the software used to measure the sensor-to-sample distance with line scan data, and the software to acquire data and control the XYZ stage for scanning. We also demonstrate the registration of the magnetic image relative to the optical image by using a pair of point sources placed on the corners of a sample holder outside of a thin section placed {{in the middle of the}} sample holder. Considering the minimum noise estimate of the current system, the theoretical detection limit of a single magnetic dipole is ~ 1 × 10 ? 14 Am 2.
