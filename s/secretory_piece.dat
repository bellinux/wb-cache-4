40|$|We {{have shown}} that in bovine {{colostrum}} and saliva there is a secretory IgA with a sedimentation, coefficient of 11 S and a <b>secretory</b> <b>piece,</b> previously unknown and comparable with the 11 S IgA described in human and rabbit external secretions. These secretory IgA contain molecules of 7 S IgA with an additional protein segment called the transport or <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> 1 - 5. Furthermore, the free form of the <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> is identified in bovine colostrum and also in mature milk which contains very little IgA...|$|E

Only the polymeric IgA {{and not the}} monomeric forms, nor paraproteins of IgG or IgD classes, were found to bind free <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> in vitro. This property was not dependent on the subclass or the light chain type of the tested paraproteins.

40|$|Free <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> (FSP) was {{studied in}} the sputum of {{patients}} with chronic bronchitis. The concentrations were higher both {{in the presence of}} infection and when greater quantities of total <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> were present compared to the amount of 11 S IgA. A significant inverse correlation was found between the amount of FSP and 11 S IgA in the individual samples when standardized for their total <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> content (2 P less than 0. 01). This suggests that the amount of FSP in any sample is partly dependent upon the amount of 11 S IgA. The techniques employed offer a method {{for the study of the}} secretory IgA system in biological fluids. The preliminary results suggest that the secretory IgA system is independent of the systemic IgA system...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to describe the histological and histochemical structures of the prostate gland during different seasons of the year. The experiment was carried out on the prostate gland of 24 sexually mature apparently healthy male donkeys (5 to 7 years) distributed over the four seasons of the year. The prostate gland was enveloped externally by a thick fibromuscular capsule. Fibromuscular septa arose from the deep aspect of the capsule dividing the prostate into variable numbers of lobules of different sizes and shapes. Each prostatic lobe was made up of compound tubuloalveolar glands and duct system. The <b>secretory</b> end <b>pieces</b> were lined with principal secretory cells with occasional few basal ones. The principal cells varied from columnar to cuboidal in shape, depending upon the studied season. The principal cells showed PAS-positive reactivity. Seasonal variations were observed in the height of the principal cell lining the <b>secretory</b> end <b>pieces,</b> in the interstitial tissue/glandular tissue ratio, and in the PAS reactivity in the principal cells. In conclusion, the prostate gland of donkey appeared more active during spring. This reactivity decreased during other seasons of the year. Minimal reactivity was recorded during winter...|$|R
40|$|Discrepancies in the {{terminology}} {{of the major}} human salivary glands often appear in anatomical textbooks and tend to adversely affect student's learning experience in Microscopic Anatomy. The main culprit is the inconsistent description of the morphology of these glands <b>secretory</b> end <b>pieces</b> where “acinus” and “alveolus” are used interchangeably. The correct terminology originated from Malpighi (1687), repeated by Kölliker (1854), {{but over the years}} has been misinterpreted by prominent authors {{as a result of the}} nature of specimen preparation. This commentary is based on etymology, current standard light microscopy, research studies and consultation with experts. The overall objective of this publication is to recommend that textbooks should endeavour to modify the relevant descriptions about this terminology in their future editions. The most appropriate terminology for the major human salivary glands would be: (1) the parotid gland, entirely serous, should be called compound acinar glands; (2) the submandibular glands are mixed glands; their serous components are compound acinar while some of the mucinous areas are tubular with serous, crescents or demilunes, as acinar end pieces hence they should be named compound tubuloacinar glands; (3) the sublingual glands, mainly mucous glands with tubular shape, with small acinar end pieces that are serous crescents thence they should be called compound tubuloacinar glands...|$|R

40|$|Human {{antibodies}} which {{react in}} a haemagglutination system with secretory IgA, but not serum IgA, {{were found in}} serum from 14 per cent of normal subjects, 8 per cent of patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases and over 50 per cent of subjects with either peptic ulcer or alcoholic cirrhosis. The specificity of these reactions for secretory IgA was confirmed in inhibition experiments using a panel of immunoglobulin proteins. The anti-secretory piece factors in two sera were found by zone electrophoresis and sucrose density gradient experiments to have physical characteristics most compatible with IgG and IgA proteins, respectively. Further characterization of the specificity of these anti-secretory IgA factors, using a panel of colostral IgA proteins from individual mothers and isolated <b>secretory</b> <b>piece,</b> demonstrated {{a high degree of}} variability in antigenic specificity for secretory IgA. In three of five sera tested, the reaction was specific for components in isolated <b>secretory</b> <b>piece.</b> Inhibition studies using products of peptic digestion of colostral IgA suggest that <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> is attached to the Fc fragment of the molecule and that digestion releases at least some <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> molecules relatively intact.

40|$|The {{important}} biological role {{of saliva}} in maintaining of the homeostasis {{of the oral}} cavity environment, preventing infection and tooth decay is widely accepted. Salivary glands insufficiency may violate the balance between health and disease. Clinical data indicated that the destruction, agenesis and aplasia of salivary gland commonly followed with hypo salivation, low salivary flow, which resulted in severe caries and periodontal disease. Salivary gland dysfunction also frequently found in preterm and low birth weight newborns. But the information about structural background of abnormal salivation in early childhood is still limited. A presence of any correlation between salivary glands’ structural development and intrauterine restrictions of fetal growth (IUGR) is unclear. The aim of {{present study was to}} determine morphological and morphometric peculiarities of human parotid gland in case of IUGR at late gestation.   Material and methods Parotid glands of twenty human fetuses 20 - 22 weeks of gestation with diagnosed IUGR from late abortions material were compared with ten fetal glands in cases of induced abortions due to psychological reasons (control group). Tissue samples were immersion-fixed in 10 % buffered formalin solution, embedded in paraffin wax.   Histological slides were stained routinely with hematoxylin & eosin, with Van Gieson's Stain.   Microscopical examination was performed on magnification x 40 and x 100. Stereometric study by point count method at magnification x 40 allowed finding out volume fractions (VF) of gland’s parenchyma and stroma. VF of lobule’s components (gland’s wall, gland’s lumen, duct’s wall, duct’s lumen, vessels, intralobular connective tissue) were registered at magnification x 100. Morphometry of the secretory portion of the parotid gland was conducted on the Zeiss microscope {{with the help of the}} AxioVision Rel. 4. 8 program. The mature (differentiated) end pieces were measured, including their area (in mkm 2), width, height, perimeter (all in mkm). Similar measurements were done in the foci of immature secretory ends of a gland. Additionally the mean height of the epithelial cells layer within the mature <b>secretory</b> end <b>pieces</b> was measured. The differences were analyzed by methods of mathematical statistics using the software Microsoft Excel; data was compared with control measurements by Student’s t-test. Results The results of present research have shown the delayed differentiation of fetal parotid gland’s parenchymal components in case of IUGR. The parenchymal VF did not reach control values.   Furthermore, VF of lobule’s components was also decreased. Ducts lumens appeared to be significantly narrower than at physiological gestation. Interlobular and intralobular connective tissue stroma, in contrast to the controls, occupied vast areas, and their volume fraction was increased. Deficit of the parenchymal components of the gland was enhanced by slower maturation of glands.   In cases with IUGR, differentiated glands occupied smaller area, with reduced width, height and perimeter. Epithelium lining the differentiated glands is characterized by significantly lower height compared to the control group. Delayed differentiation resulted in  higher proportion of immature glands. Their area, width, height and perimeter increased. IUGR was also accompanied with a variety of pathological changes. Conclusion Present evidences suggest that IUGR leads to impaired growth and maturation of the parotid gland. Structural immaturity and lack of differentiated parenchymal elements of the organ may form the basis of its secretory function’s lesion. The finding tends to support the hypothesis that the mechanism behind the increased risk of dental pathology in preterm, low birth weight and retarded children is centred at structural and functional immaturity of salivary gland. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sera and saliva {{from nine}} adult {{subjects}} with acquired agammaglobulinaemia and from two {{individuals with a}} selective absence of γA were studied for γA and secretory γA content. In all subjects, except for one (B.

However, when tested by quantitative complement fixation, a small amount of serum γA was detected. Chromatographic separation and subsequent immunological testing of saliva B.

Severity of sinopulmonary infections in these subjects did not correlate with {{the presence or absence of}} secretory γA. These observations further substantiate that the production of serum and secretory γA is controlled by similar mechanisms, and that a quantitative defect in secretory γA production does not by itself account for the presence of sinopulmonary disease...|$|E

Samples were collected from 90 healthy volunteers, 202 subjects submitted to vasectomy for contraceptive purposes, tested at various intervals after surgery, and 725 patients grouped according to selected andrological disorders. Results may be summarized as follows. In normal subjects IgG and IgA were constantly present (mean values +/- SD: 8. 14 +/- 2. 82 mg/dl; 1. 91 +/- 1. 03 mg/dl, respectively) while IgM were detected in trace amounts (from 0. 7 to 3. 3 mg/dl) in 10 % of subjects, and negligible or absent in the remaining subjects. In vasectomized subjects IgG and IgA showed a significant increase only in the first 3 months after vasectomy, probably due to surgery. In andrological patients Ig showed an increase in cases with antisperm antibodies (A b) and in those with infections of genital tract and positive semen culture. On the basis of these findings and the <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> assay data the importance appears to be stressed of the local immunocompetent system at least in some andrological diseases...|$|E

40|$|IgA {{separated}} from colostrum, and IgA from serum {{of patients with}} cirrhosis of the liver were digested with pepsin at pH 4. 1. The IgA M-components segregated into two groups {{on the basis of}} their relative rates of peptic digestion. Serum and colostral IgA were di-gested at a total rate intermediate to that of the two groups of IgA myeloma proteins. It appeared, how-ever, that colostral IgA may have been initially more resistant to peptic digestion than serum IgA. The variability in the rate of peptic digestion was not re-lated to electrophoretic mobility, light-chain type, or IgA subclass. Experimental conditions related to en-zyme to substrate ratio or to the pH of the reaction mixture did not appear to explain the differences found. These findings indicate that (a) two groups of IgA proteins can be distinguished on the basis of suscepti-bility to proteolysis with pepsin, and (b) <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> confers, at most, only a minor increase in stability to the IgA molecule against the digestive action of pepsin...|$|E
40|$|Radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were {{developed}} to selectively quantitate class-specific antibodies to purified hemagglutinins (HA) of type A influenza virus in nasal secretions. Rabbit anti-human <b>secretory</b> <b>piece</b> of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and rabbit anti-human IgG were used as second antibodies. A third antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG, was incorporated into the system to separate immune complexes formed between iodinated HA, nasal wash test specimen, and second antibody. The utilization of this reagent avoided the need for large quantities of IgA and IgG antibody-negative carrier secretions. Nasal was specimens obtained from 14 adults immunized with an inactivated type A influenza virus vaccine were evaluated by RIP and viral neutralization assays. Significant homologous postvaccination secretory IgA and IgG antibody levels were demonstrable in 13 (93 %) of individuals by RIP, whereas only 5 (36 %) exhibited rises by viral neutralization tests.

40|$|Eight mutant {{hybridoma}} {{lines are}} described, which synthesize short immunoglobulin mu chains. Four internal deletions were mapped by Southern blot analysis. They are shown to remove DNA from either part {{or all of}} the first, and first and second, constant mu exons. The sizes of the deletions range between 0. 6 and 5 kb, leaving an equal or unequal number of splice signals. Shorter mu RNA of one size was found irrespective of whether an exon was completely or only partially deleted. These results preclude exclusive 3 ' (constant region) to 5 ' (variable region) directional splicing of the mu RNA. No important signals seem to reside in the deleted DNA stretches affecting the transcription or the correct RNA splicing of the remaining exons. The internal mu protein deletions revealed unusual covalent light chain attachment demonstrating functional homology between the first (normally used) and fourth mu constant domain. The other mu protein deletions (10, 11, and 12 kd) involved neither gross DNA nor RNA lesions and are considered to be due to premature chain termination. Since secretion is found in most of the mutant IgM-producing lines, no single one of the four mu constant domains (including the C-terminal one which contains the so-called <b>secretory</b> <b>piece)</b> is necessary for secretion...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{a number}} of {{properties}} of the pathological γA-proteins in the first four cases of the recently recognized alpha-chain disease demonstrate that, as in γ-heavy-chain disease, the abnormal protein is devoid of light chains and represents a portion of the α-heavy chain related to the Fc-fragment. In two patients, serum electrophoresis showed a broad abnormal band, whereas in the two others the pathological protein was not noticeable on the electrophoretic pattern. The diagnosis of α-chain disease can be established without purification of the protein by immuno-electrophoresis and gel diffusion experiments using selected antisera to γA and a reference α-chain disease protein. All four proteins belonged to the α 1 -subclass, displayed electrophoretic heterogeneity, and showed a strong tendency to polymerize. The polymers occurred in vivo and were held together both by disulfide bonds and by strong noncovalent forces. Two of the three purified proteins had a very high carbohydrate content. The abnormal protein was always found in concentrated urines in variable but generally low amounts.

40|$|Contrary to {{expectation}} chickens did {{not readily}} elicit antibodies to IgA dimers when untreated human colostrum {{was used as}} antigen. When colostrum was fractionated {{by means of a}} column of 8 % granulated agarose equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7. 2, a major and a minor fraction were obtained. The major or ' 1 st fraction' consisted of two components with sedimentation coefficients of 10. 9 S and 14. 1 S, respectively. The minor or ' 2 nd fraction' consisted of components of S values ranging from 2 to 6 and small amounts of 10. 9 and 14. 1 S material. When chickens were immunized with the ' 1 st fraction' antibodies to dimeric IgA were produced. When the ' 1 st and 2 nd fractions' of the column were remixed and used for immunization of chickens, the immune response was poor as when the chickens were injected with untreated colostrum. An immuno-depressing agent in colostrum was indicated. When rabbits were immunized with clarified human colostrum, antibodies against five antigens were elicited, one of the antigens being dimeric IgA. The immuno-depressing agent is therefore not universal. The purified agent suppressed antibody formation in chickens against the haemocyanin of Jasus lalandii. The 'activity' is therefore not specific for IgA and the remaining four antigens in human colostrum. The purified component is a glyco-protein with a hexose content in excess of 10 %. The derivatized sugars prepared from it were shown by gas liquid chromatography to be an equimolar mixture of galactose, mannose and fucose. The molecular weight (Mr) of the purified component was found to be 72, 000 by sedimentation and diffusion and 80, 000 by SDS page using Mr reference standards.

40|$|Mesangial {{deposition}} of IgA {{is found in}} about 20 % of adult patients with idiopathic glomerular disease in France. The deposition involves the mesangium of every glomerulus and persists during the whole course of the nephropathy. We therefore {{believe it to be}} the hallmark of the disease in these patients [1, 2]. Mesangial IgA does not contain <b>secretory</b> <b>piece,</b> and it is usually accompanied by some IgG, IgM has been found by some observers [3, 4], but not by ourselves. C 3 is present without Clq or C 4 [4, 5], suggesting activation of the complement system by the alternate pathway [6], This is further supported by the demonstration of properdin [4, 7]. In our experience, however, the {{deposition of}} properdin is much less conspicuous than in acute glomerulonephritis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. By light microscopy, the kidney usually has the appearance of focal proliferative glomerulonephritis but, with thin sections and good trichrome stains, it is often possible to see some fibrinoid deposits in the mesangium of even those glomeruli which show no focal changes. Mild diffuse mesangial hypercellularity is present in some cases, and sometimes the focal changes may be similar to those observed in focal glomerulosclerosis. In advanced cases, interstitial and arteriolar changes become prominent, and without the help of immunofluorescence microscopy, these cases may be misdiagnosed as interstitial nephritis or nephrosclerosis even by experienced pathologists. With the electron microscope, electron-dense deposits are seen in the mesangium of every glomerulus. Silver impregnation may be necessary to clearly distinguish the deposits from the basement membrane and the mesangial matrix. There may sometimes be a slight extension of the deposits to the subendothelial areas. The cytoplasm of mesangial cells is usually richer in organelles than usual but no evidence of phagocytosis of the deposits by these cells can be demonstrated. In adult patients, the disease is usually manifested by light proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. In one-half of the cases, macroscopic hematuria occurs either as a single episode or as recurrent attacks. Gross hematuria is usually precipitated by an upper respiratory tract infection or strenuous exercise. It may be accompanied by loin pain and dysuria. In some patients proteinuria is heavier, and occasionally the nephrotic syndrome may develop. Hematuria and proteinuria may disappear for variable periods of time, but renal biopsy specimens obtained during periods of clinical remission have shown that the mesangial deposits persist. The course of the disease in most adult patients is long-standing but its clinical expression is mild, with little evidence of progression over decades. Nevertheless, hypertension and renal insufficiency may occur. Terminal renal failure eventually develops in about one case in five, and unfortunately we know of no way to predict which patient will follow this course. There is no relationship between the amount of mesangial deposition, which usually remains fairly constant in a given patient, and the severity of the disease. In the child, the mesangial deposition of IgA accounts for about 10 % of cases of glomerular disease. It nearly always presents as recurrent hematuria [8, 9]; renal tissue often looks normal by light microscopy. The prognosis of recurrent hematuria in children is generally considered to be good, and it is therefore of note that the disease began during childhood in several patients of this report. In most patients, with mesangial deposition of IgA, the serum concentration of IgA is high, but in some patients, it may be normal or even low. The serum concentrations of IgG, IgM and C 3 are normal or slightly elevated. There are still no clues as to the etiology of this disease...|$|E
