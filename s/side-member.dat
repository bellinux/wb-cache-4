5000|$|Steering: {{the width}} of the engine necessitated {{mounting}} the worm and sector reduction box on the scuttle. From there a coupling lever dropped to a bell-crank pivoted on the chassis <b>side-member.</b> A normal drag-link ran to the front axle.|$|E
50|$|Rackham {{had worked}} for AEC in the pre-World War I period. He was {{involved}} in the design of London General's B-Type bus, under Frank Searle and then George Green. During World War I he and Green worked on the Tank along with other gifted engineers such as Walter Wilson. After the war Rackham moved to the United States and under Green was chief designer for John Hertz's Yellow Coach Company, one of the leading bus-builders in the States. Rackham, under Green's direction, evolved a range of fast, relatively light chassis with powerful engines and a trademark of frames gracefully swept with elegantly varying <b>side-member</b> depth. The Y and Z models also had off-set underslung worm rear-axles and six-cylinder overhead-camshaft (OHC) petrol engines; OHC was not generally known in UK buses at the time, and six-cylinder engines likewise.|$|E
30|$|The full capacity, {{the maximum}} {{displacement}} and the maximum {{velocity of the}} shaking table were ± 9.6  kN, ± 50  mm and 590  mm/s, respectively. The timber main-member of a specimen was supported tightly on the steel base (A) in Fig.  1 [1]. The plywood <b>side-member,</b> on the other hand, was fixed to the steel base (B) in the same figure. The steel base (B) with removable steel plates bolted onto it, which gave a mass of 202  kg in total [1], was placed {{on a pair of}} sliding rails to allow the smooth motion of mass free from the shaking table. The input acceleration at the timber main-member and the responsive acceleration at the plywood <b>side-member</b> were measured using strain gauge accelerometers with a capacity of 2  G. The relative slip between the <b>side-member</b> and the main-member was measured using a displacement transducer with a 50  mm stroke. The acceleration on the shaking table was also monitored to verify the firm fixing of the timber main-member onto the shaking table. In this study, a band-limited white-noise wave was generated as follows. A frequency range from 1.0 to 8.0  Hz was adopted considering the responsive characteristics of the nailed plywood-timber joints under harmonic waves [1] and the general distribution of base shear spectra of most seismic waves [6, 7]. A flat white-noise wave of this frequency range was substituted with a composite wave of discrete frequency components of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0  Hz. These frequency components with an even acceleration were integrated into a composite wave assuming quasi random phases so as to generate peak accelerations of 165  gal (cm/s 2) (0.17  G), 330  gal (cm/s 2) (0.34  G) and 495  gal (cm/s 2) (0.51  G) [4]. The products of these maximum accelerations and the given mass of 202  kg were equivalent to one-third, two-thirds and three-thirds of the control static maximum load, which were determined to be 333, 667 and 1000  N in the previous study [1].|$|E
30|$|Specimens were {{assembled}} using S-P-F 204 lumber [8] as {{the main}} and <b>side-members</b> and 15 -mm thick karamatsu (Larix kaempferi) plywood of 2 nd grade standardized by JAS [9]. The main-members, the <b>side-members</b> and the plywood were divided among the joint types so that the average and the standard deviation of member density of each joint type had similar values. The average wood density of the main-members and the <b>side-members</b> was 462  kg/m 3 (standard deviation 34.4  kg/m 3) and its average moisture content was 10.3 % (standard deviation 0.30 %). The average density of the plywood panels was 506  kg/m 3 (standard deviation 26.3  kg/m 3) and its average moisture content was 8.75 % (standard deviation 0.62 %).|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of the supplier, a special high tensile steel alloy was {{developed}} to lighten the frame. Tubular and channel section cross members were bolted to the frame <b>side-members.</b> Spring hanger brackets were also bolted to the frame, utilizing the cross members where possible. Cummins and Perkins diesel engines were used.|$|R
30|$|For each testing condition, 6 {{specimens}} were shaken in {{the direction}} parallel to both the grains of the timber main-members and the surface veneers of the plywood <b>side-members.</b> The specimens were first shaken for 20  s in consideration for effective duration of principal earthquake motion [4, 8] and then kept stationary for 20  s. This intermittent shake was repeated up to five times if clear failures were not found.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, Leyland began {{experimenting with}} ideas for a rear-engined {{double-decker}} bus. A prototype was built, {{with a body}} by Saunders-Roe, to the maximum permitted width of 7 ft. It was fitted with a turbocharged version of the Leyland O.350 engine, which was transversely mounted {{at the rear of}} the sub-frame. The chassis was a platform-type frame of steel and light alloy with deep stressed <b>side-members.</b> An automatic clutch and self change gearbox were also fitted. The vehicle was designated the PDR1 (R for [...] "Rear-engined").|$|R
50|$|The Lowlander was a type Leyland did {{not really}} want to build and it never {{attained}} the sales forecast for it: which should have reached over 450 rather than 274 by 1967. By 1966 SBG had decided that they could live with a rear-engined double decker {{in the form of}} the Daimler Fleetline, taking 640 from 1963 to 1980. Aside from the over-produced frame components (most of those not newly built into chassis went for scrap, although Luton had to take some <b>side-members</b> as spares because neglect of the rear suspension on some of their buses caused frame-cracking) the only unique assembly was the rear-axle, and with some revisions to the layout of components that became a key part of the low-height Atlanteans, types PDR1/2 and PDR1/3 built from 1964 to 1971. The Lowlander was the last Albion-designed double-decker, and the penultimate Albion design of bus for UK operation.|$|R
