The ice shelf is now 40% the size of its previous minimum stable extent. In 2015 a study concluded that the remaining Larsen B ice-shelf will disintegrate {{by the end of the}} decade, based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area.

500|$|The rapid thinning, {{acceleration}} and retreat of Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq glaciers in Greenland, all in close association with one another, suggests a common triggering mechanism, such as enhanced <b>surface</b> <b>melting</b> due to regional climate warming or {{a change in}} forces at the glacier front. The enhanced melting leading to lubrication of the glacier base has been observed to cause a small seasonal velocity increase {{and the release of}} meltwater lakes has also led to only small short term accelerations. The significant accelerations noted on the three largest glaciers began at the calving front and propagated inland and are not seasonal in nature. Thus, the primary source of outlet glacier acceleration widely observed on small and large calving glaciers in Greenland is driven by changes in dynamic forces at the glacier front, not enhanced meltwater lubrication. [...] This was termed the Jakobshavns Effect by Terence Hughes at the University of Maine in 1986. Indeed, a study published in 2015 on glacial underwater topography at 3 sites found cavities, due to warm subglacial water intrusion, which has been identified as a possible dominant force for ablation (surface erosion). Thus, suggests ocean temperature controls ice sheet surface runoff at specific sites. These findings also show that models underestimate the sensitivity of Greenland glaciers to ocean warming and resulting ice sheet runoff. Hence, without better modelling, new observations suggest that past projections of sea level rise attribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet require upward revision.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{acceleration}} in <b>surface</b> <b>melt</b> on the Greenland {{ice sheet}} (GrIS) has occurred concurrently with a rapidly warming Arctic {{and has been}} connected to persistent, anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns over Greenland. To identify synoptic setups favoring enhanced GrIS <b>surface</b> <b>melt</b> and their decadal changes, we develop a summer Arctic synoptic climatology by employing self-organizing maps. These are applied to daily 500 hPa geopotential height fields obtained from the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications reanalysis, 1979 - 2014. Particular circulation regimes are related to meteorological conditions and GrIS <b>surface</b> <b>melt</b> estimated with outputs from the Modle Atmosphrique Rgional. Our results demonstrate that the largest positive melt anomalies occur in concert with positive height anomalies near Greenland associated with wind, temperature, and humidity patterns indicative of strong meridional transport of heat and moisture. We find an increased frequency in a 500 hPa ridge over Greenland coinciding with a 63 % increase in GrIS melt between the 1979 - 1988 and 2005 - 2014 periods, with 75. 0 % of <b>surface</b> <b>melt</b> changes attributed to thermodynamics, 17 % to dynamics, and 8. 0 % to a combination. We also confirm that the 2007 - 2012 time period has the largest dynamic forcing relative of any period but also demonstrate that increased surface energy fluxes, temperature, and moisture separate from dynamic changes contributed more to melt even during this period.

After 1997 the glacier began to accelerate and thin rapidly, reaching an average velocity of [...] per day in the terminus region. It also thinned at a rate of up to [...] per year and retreated [...] in six years. Jakobshavn has afterwards slowed to near its pre-1997 speed, with the terminus retreat still occurring. On Jakobshavn the acceleration began at the calving front and spread up-glacier [...] in 1997 and up to [...] inland by 2003.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily land-surface temperature (LST), MODIS daily snow albedo, and a special diurnal melt product derived from QuikSCAT (QS) scatterometer data, are all effective in measuring the evolution of melt on the ice sheet.
