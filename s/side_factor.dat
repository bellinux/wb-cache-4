In the Sydney industrial property market, no growth of the rents and marginal growth of the land values in real terms has been seen between 1976 to 1996. It means that the overall return from an investment in industrial property is achieved largely from initial yield and current rental incomes, rather than rental growth and capital appreciation. The trends of real growth of industrial rents and land values have a similar cycle, but different magnitude (a or s) of fluctuation.

The main distinguishing {{features of this}} negotiating system are: 1) designing a real-world inspired basket of negotiation strategies (i.e., negotiation_strategy_basket) which contains negotiation strategies in names Pressuring strategy, Relaxing strategy and Normal concession strategy, 2) introducing a new mathematical model to determine the critical condition of the cloud negotiation market and 3) designing flexible negotiator agents of types cloud resource broker (CRB) and cloud resource provider (CRP) who are equipped with a new Fuzzy Negotiation Strategy Selection Decision System (FNSSDS) {{which is used to}} determine the amount of α (i.e., coefficient of price changing based on the adopted strategy). α reflects the critical condition of the cloud negotiation market and is determined based on the factors in names competitors’ <b>side</b> <b>factor</b> (ComSF_t^A), trading opponents’ <b>side</b> <b>factor</b> (TOpSF_t^A) and local power of a negotiator in the trading market factor (LPowF_t^A).|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} to mention that, {{the main part}} of our idea is FNSSA (Fuzzy Negotiation Strategy Selection System) that is {{designed}} to calculate α (i.e., coefficient of price changing). All the computations required for calculating the amount of α are done by ConA (Consulting Agent) which is designed in the cloud marketplace. The customers and providers who participate in the cloud marketplace are served by the amount of α (that is calculated by ConA). In addition, and according to our explanations in “Fuzzy Negotiation Strategy Selection Decision System (FNSSDS)” section, the computation complexity of FNSSA is low. This is because, the triangle membership functions are designed and also by introducing three inputs for fuzzy system in names: 1) competitors’ <b>side</b> <b>factor</b> (ComSF_t^A), 2) Trading opponents’ <b>side</b> <b>factor</b> (TOpSF_t^A), and 3) Local Power in the trading market factor (LPowF_t^A) the curse of dimensionality is overcomed. As a result, there is not much computation overhead due to determination of α by adopting FNSSA in a cloud marketplace where benefits from high computing power.|$|E

This article considers how extradition {{and other forms of}} rendition might be utilized to ensure the transfer of an undesirable alien, particularly one who is excluded from refugee status, to the ICC or to a third state. In undertaking this analysis, the article also has regard to those cases where the undesirability of an individual only comes to light through an extradition request after refugee status was already granted to her or him. In this context, states have three sets of overlapping obligations: the ICC Statute or extradition treaties require states to surrender certain individuals; international refugee law and international human rights law require states to protect those within their jurisdiction from refoulement; international refugee law further imposes an obligation to exclude from non-refoulement, those who are deemed unworthy based on certain types of criminal activity.

This study examined the influence of demand <b>side</b> <b>factors</b> on IPTp coverage. Methods Data were collected using a household survey from 1307 women who were delivered of a live baby within the one-year period preceding the study and through an exit poll from 146 women attending antenatal clinics (ANC). Data analysis examined coverage based on the national and WHO guidelines for IPTp delivery which differ with regards to use of IPTp {{in the last month}} of pregnancy. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were undertaken to further explain demand side constraints to coverage. Results From the household survey, 96. 1 % of respondents attended ANC, with most having five or more visits. Overall IPTp coverage for the first and second doses was 13. 7 % and 7. 3 % respectively.

40|$|The study {{observes that}} {{although}} there has been an improvement in outreach activity in the banking sector, the achievement in respect of financial inclusion is not significant in West Bengal. An index of financial inclusion (IFI) has been developed in the study using data on three dimensions of financial inclusion. It is revealed from the index that Kolkata district leads with the highest value of IFI, while rest of the districts show a very low level of financial inclusion. This implies that the State has to {{go a long way in}} achieving financial inclusion. Apart from this computation, a survey has also been conducted in the state in order to gauge the financial inclusion in rural Bengal and the results reveal that around 38 per cent of the respondents do not have sufficient income to open a savings account in the bank. It is also revealed that moneylenders are still a dominant source of rural finance despite wide presence of banks in rural areas. It is also observed that although various measures have been undertaken for financial inclusion in the State, the success is not found to be significant. However, only supply <b>side</b> <b>factor</b> is not responsible for the financial exclusion. Demand side factors are also equally responsible for this exclusion. Thus there is a need to solve both these problems with the help of appropriate policies. A whole-hearted effort is called for from all the corners of the society, viz., bankers, beneficiaries and regulators in order to make financial inclusion more meaningful and effective. ...|$|E

As a lot of information about ionizing radiation, its sources, radioactivity, radio-biologically important quantities, mechanisms of effects, molecular and cellular changes and biodosimetric methods as such falls under the topic, the theoretical part of diploma project is dedicated to such information. In the practical part, {{evaluation of the}} number and kind of micro-nuclei with set groups of persons is carried out. These groups of persons are particularly exposed to ? radiation. They are employees of spa Lázně Jáchymov, former miners from already closed uranium mines in Příbram and current miners from uranium mines GEAM o. z. Dolní Rožínka. These selected persons are divided according to their workplaces into two groups, i. e. a group of persons without cancer occurrence in the family and a group of persons with occurrence of cancer in their families. The numbers of bi-nuclei cells without micro-nuclei and with micro-nuclei and the kinds of micro-nuclei were determined with all these persons using fluorescence microscope.

Two additional principles contribute to a more exact conceptual placement of FRPs.

On the other hand, a systemic component describes how and to what extent FRPs oppose the ambitions of the societal system and its principal agents (i.e. traditional parties and existing elites). This notion of goal differentiation to criticise, yet remain loyal to the existing system can be described by another core characteristic of FRPs, namely populism [73].|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to re-examine the {{structural}} origins of international crude oil price fluctuation. Design/methodology/approach – The paper establishes a structural vector autoregression model based on the generalized supply and demand analysis of crude oil price fluctuation and performance the structural decomposition of price shocks with impulse response analysis of those factors. Findings – It is found that four kinds of structural shocks derived from the generalized supply and demand analysis are the essential determinants of crude oil prices fluctuation. On one hand, similar to Kilian's results, the supply side shocks – both the exogenous geopolitical ones and other oil supply shocks have little influence. Whereas, the demand side shocks – both the aggregate demand shock and the oil market specific demand shock have prominent effects. On the other hand, with the expanded sample range, it is found that the dynamic characteristic of the impulse response of oil price to demand <b>side</b> <b>factors</b> is not only incompatible with the basic economic theory, but also clashes with Kilian's statement based upon his research. It is conjured that the incompatibility comes from the ignorance of the finer decomposition of demand <b>side</b> <b>factors.</b> To decompose those demand <b>side</b> <b>factors</b> further, the US dollar liquidity was added into the model. The results show that the impact of US dollar liquidity on the fluctuation of oil prices cannot be ignored. The argument that ascribes the soaring international crude oil price to China's economic growth lacks theoretical and empirical evidence.
