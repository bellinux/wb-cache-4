40|$|Objective. Because limited data {{currently}} {{support the}} clinical utility of peripherally expressed biomarkers in guiding treatment decisions {{for patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis, the search has turned to the disease tissue. The strategic aim of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) synovitis working group {{over the years has}} been to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic synovial biomarkers. A critical step in this process is to refine and validate minimally invasive, technically simple, robust techniques to sample synovial tissue, for use both in clinical trials and routine clinical practice. The objective of the synovitis working group (SWG) at OMERACT 12 (2014) was to examine whether recently developed ultrasound (US) -guided <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> techniques could be validated according to the OMERACT filter for future clinical use recommendation. Methods. The SWG examined whether current data reporting US-guided <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> of both large and small joints addressed the OMERACT filters of truth, discrimination, and feasibility. Results. There are currently limited data examining the performance of US-guided <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy,</b> mainly from observational studies. Thus, it remains critical to evaluate its performance, within the clinical trials context, against the current gold standard of arthroscopic biopsy, with particular reference to: (1) synovial tissue yield, (2) capacity to determine treatment response as measured by a validated synovial biomarker, and (3) tolerability of the procedure. Conclusion. We summarize the discrete work packages agreed to as requirements to validate US-guided <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> and therefore lead to a global consensus on the use of <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> for research and clinical practic...|$|E

40|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA) is {{an inflammatory}} arthritis whose pathogenesis is poorly understood; it {{is characterized by}} bone erosions and new bone formation. The diagnosis of PsA is mainly clinical and diagnostic biomarkers are not yet available. The aim of this work was to clarify {{some aspects of the}} disease pathogenesis and to identify specific gene signatures in paired peripheral blood cells (PBC) and <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> of patients with PsA. Moreover, we tried to identify biomarkers {{that can be used in}} clinical practice. PBC and <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> of 10 patients with PsA were used to study gene expression using Affymetrix arrays. The expression values were validated by Q-PCR, FACS analysis and by the detection of soluble mediators. <b>Synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> of patients showed a modulation of approximately 200 genes when compared to the biopsies of healthy donors. Among the differentially expressed genes we observed the upregulation of Th 17 related genes and of type I interferon (IFN) inducible genes. FACS analysis confirmed the Th 17 polarization. Moreover, the synovial trascriptome shows gene clusters (bone remodeling, angiogenesis and inflammation) involved in the pathogenesis of PsA. Interestingly 90 genes are modulated in both compartments (PBC and synovium) suggesting that signature pathways in PBC mirror those of the inflamed synovium. Finally the osteoactivin gene was upregulared in both PBC and <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> and this finding was confirmed by the detection of high levels of osteoactivin in PsA sera but not in other inflammatory arthritides. We describe the first analysis of the trancriptome in paired synovial tissue and PBC of patients with PsA.

RESULTS: According to high-density microarray data, several molecular pathways are differentially expressed in patients with RA, SA and OA: T and B cell activation, chromatin remodelling, RAS GTPase activation and extracellular matrix regulation. Strikingly, disease activity (DAS 28 -CRP) has a significant influence on gene expression patterns in RA samples. Using the low-density assays, samples from patients with OA are easily discriminated from RA and SA samples. However, overlapping molecular patterns are found, in particular between RA and SA biopsies.

40|$|Objective. Serial <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> {{samples are}} {{increasingly}} being used {{for the evaluation of}} novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Most studies have used tissues from knee biopsies, but technical improvements have made serial small joint arthroscopy feasible as well. Theoretically, there could be differences in the features of synovial inflammation between various joints as a result of mechanical factors, differences in innervation, and other factors. We therefore undertook this study to compare the cell infiltrate in paired <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples from inflamed knee joints and paired inflamed small joints of patients with RA. Methods. Nine RA patients with both an inflamed knee joint and an inflamed small joint (wrist or metacarpophalangeal joint) underwent an arthroscopic <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> of both joints on the same day. Multiple biopsy specimens were collected and stained for macrophages, T cells, plasma cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes, and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) by immunohistochemistry.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Synovitis is {{a common}} feature of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the pattern of joint involvement differs in each disease. This study was undertaken to investigate the global gene expression profiles in <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> tissue from the swollen knees of untreated SLE patients (n = 6), RA patients (n = 7), and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (n = 6). METHODS: <b>Synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples {{were obtained from the}} affected knees of patients in the 3 groups by needle arthroscopy. Half of the material was used for extraction of total RNA, amplification of complementary RNA, and high-density oligonucleotide spotted hybridization arrays. On the remaining tissue samples, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical experiments were performed to confirm the microarray data. RESULTS: SLE <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> tissue displayed a significant down-regulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis and a significant up-regulation of interferon-inducible (IFI) genes. Real-time RT-PCR experiments confirmed the up-regulation of selected IFI genes (IFI 27, IFI 44, and IFI 44 L) in the SLE synovial tissue. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that 3 molecules involved in ECM regulation, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 2, latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 2, and fibroblast activation protein alpha, were significantly down-regulated in SLE synovium. In contrast, immunostaining for IFI 27, Toll-like receptor 4, and STAT- 1 resulted in higher quantitative scores in SLE synovial tissue, which could be attributed {{to the fact that the}} RA samples had a large population of inflammatory cell infiltrates that were negative for these markers.

40|$|Introduction: This work {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} {{the production of}} inflammatory and pro- and anti-angiogenic factors by normal/reactive (N/R) or inflammatory (I) areas of the osteoarthritic synovial membrane. The effects of interleukin (IL) - 1 β and chondroitin sulfate (CS) on the expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors by synovial fibroblasts cells (SFC) were also studied. Methods: Biopsies from N/R or from I areas of osteoarthritic synovial membrane were collected {{at the time of}} surgery. The inflammatory status of the synovial membrane was characterized by the surgeon according to macroscopic criteria, including the synovial vascularization, the villi formation and the hypertrophic aspect of the tissue. We assessed the expression of CD 45, von Willebrand factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antigen by immunohistochemistry in both N/R and I biopsies. The production of IL- 6, - 8, VEGF and thrombospondin (TSP) - 1 by N/R or I synovial cells was quantified by ELISA. SFC were cultured in the absence or in the presence of IL- 1 β (1 ng/ml) and with or without CS (10, 50, 200 μg/ml). Gene expression of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 2 and angiopoietin (ang) - 1) and anti-angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (VEGI), TSP- 1 and - 2) were determined by real time RT-PCR. Production of VEGI and TSP- 1 was also estimated by ELISA. Results: Immunohistochemistry showed the increase of lymphocyte infiltration, vascular density and VEGF expression in I compared to N/R <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies.</b> <b>Synovial</b> cells from I areas produced more IL- 6, IL- 8 and VEGF but less TSP- 1 than cells isolated from N/R <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies.</b> The expression of pro-angiogenic factors by SFC was stimulated by IL- 1 β. A time dependent regulation of the expression of anti-angiogenic factor genes was observed. IL- 1 β stimulated the expression of anti-angiogenic factor genes but inhibited it after 24 h. CS reversed the inhibitory effect of IL- 1 β on anti-angiogenic factors, VEGI and TSP- 1. Conclusions: We demonstrated that <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> from I areas expressed a pro-angiogenic phenotype. IL- 1 β induced an imbalance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors in SFC and CS tended to normalize this IL- 1 β-induced imbalance, providing a new possible mechanism of action of this drug. © 2012 Lambert et al.; licensee BioMed Central Lt...|$|R

METHODS: Paired <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples were obtained at T 0 and T 12 from the affected knee of TCZ-treated RA patients and MTX-treated RA patients. Gene expression studies were performed using GeneChip Human Genome U 133 Plus 2. 0 microarrays, and confirmatory quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed on selected transcripts. The effects of TCZ and MTX on synovial cell populations and histologic characteristics were assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Gene expression studies showed that blockade of the interleukin- 6 receptor (IL- 6 R) gene (IL 6 R) using TCZ induced {{a significant decrease in}} the expression of numerous chemokine and T cell activation genes in the RA synovium. These effects strongly correlated with the molecular effects of MTX and RTX therapy on RA synovial tissue, but differed from the molecular changes induced by ADA (decreased expression of genes involved in cell proliferation). CONCLUSION: The molecular similarities between the effects of TCZ, RTX, and MTX therapies in the RA synovium indicate that B cell- and IL- 6 -dependent pathways play synergistic roles in the pathogenesis of the disease, in particular through activation of T cell responses. Moreover, these results open perspectives for the individualization of therapeutic decisions, based on a better knowledge of the synovial molecular effects of each type of RA therapy...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{endogenous}} steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) {{has been}} reported {{to play a role in}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DHEA is metabolized by the P 450 enzyme CYP 7 B into 7 alpha-OH-DHEA, which has immunostimulating properties. This study was undertaken to investigate the putative role of CYP 7 B in arthritis using murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), an interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) -dependent model. Methods. DBA/ 1 J mice were immunized and administered a booster with type II collagen. The presence of 7 alpha-OH-DHEA was determined in both arthritic and nonarthritic joints and the serum of CIA mice by radioimmunoassay. CYP 7 B messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was analyzed in <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples, and in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) isolated from these <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the regulatory role of IL- 1 beta on CYP 7 B activity in FLS was determined using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Results. In knee joint <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> samples from arthritic mice, 7 alpha-OH-DHEA levels were 5 -fold higher than in nonarthritic mice. Elevated levels of 7 alpha-OH-DHEA were accompanied by an increase in CYP 7 B mRNA expression and were positively correlated with disease severity. In serum, no differences in 7 alpha-OH-DHEA levels were observed between arthritic and nonarthritic mice. Incubation of FLS with IL- 1 beta resulted in a dose-dependent increase in 7 alpha-OH-DHEA formation. In addition, IL- 1 beta enhanced CYP 7 B mRNA and CYP 7 B protein levels in FLS. Conclusion. Disease progression in CIA is correlated with enhanced CYP 7 B activity, which leads to locally enhanced 7 alpha-OH-DHEA levels. Elevated IL- 1 beta levels within the arthritic joint may regulate this increase in CYP 7 B activity...|$|E
30|$|<b>Synovial</b> <b>biopsy</b> {{was done}} in 6 cases. Consistent {{findings}} included nodular infiltrate of plump histiocytes with abundant finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and multinucleated giant cells, and usually PAS positivity, diastase-resistant. Other finding noted cells with CD 68 immunoreactivity, which failed to stain with S 100 or CD 1 a (Hiramanek et al. 2002). One case mentioned that there was villous hypertrophic synovitis. Some degree of fibrosis was also noted in one case (Sakamoto et al. 2002).|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{response}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients to treatment with neutralising antibodies to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is highly variable. The underlying mechanism for therapy responsiveness is currently unknown. We therefore evaluated {{the relationship between}} baseline molecular profiles of synovial tissues from RA patients and the clinical response to treatment with infliximab. Methods: <b>Synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> were obtained by arthroscopy from 18 RA patients with active disease (28 joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) >= 3. 2) before initiation of treatment with infliximab. All patients were on stable methotrexate treatment. Clinical response at 16 weeks {{was defined as a}} reduction in DAS 28 of >= 1. 2, non-response as reduction in DAS 28 < 1. 2. Large-scale gene expression profiling using microarrays was performed on synovial tissue samples. To identify biological processes in <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> that could discriminate between responders and non-responders, we performed pathway analysis on the expression profiles. Results: A total of 12 patients responded to therapy, while 6 patients failed to fulfil the response criteria. We identified several biological processes, related to inflammation, which were up-regulated in patients who responded to therapy, compared to those who did not show clinical improvement. Conclusion: These results indicate that patients {{with a high level of}} tissue inflammation are more likely to benefit from anti-TNF alpha treatmen...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To use contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion {{harmonic}} B-mode sonography {{to assess}} the acoustic enhancement of the synovial area of the knee; and to compare the data with the histological vessel density. METHODS: Eleven patients eligible for a knee arthroscopy were studied. Acoustic quantification {{was carried out by}} a digital image analysis program that detects the time-dependent increase [intensity (time) = k x time + C] of gray-level intensity in all the pixels of a specific region of interest (ROI) following intravenous injection of the microbubble contrast agent sulfur hexafluoride. Echo-guided <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> were carried out in the same ROI. Synovial vessel areas were quantified after Factor VIII immunostaining of <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> using an automated digital image analysis. RESULTS: Significant (p 0. 01 (r = 0. 93) and k(max) values (r = 0. 79), as well as between the 2 latter parameters (r = 0. 72). The histological vessel density and the 2 acoustic parameters were also significantly correlated with the logarithm of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0. 77, r = 0. 87, r = 0. 67, respectively) and with log C-reactive protein serum concentration (r = 0. 69, r = 0. 83, r = 0. 62, respectively). CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion harmonic B-mode sonography coupled with an appropriate data analysis method is a new tool to identify and quantify vessel density in knee synovitis.

40|$|Background: In the spondyloarthropathies, the {{underlying}} molecular and cellular pathways driving disease are poorly understood. By undertaking {{a study in}} knee <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies</b> from spondyloarthropathy (SpA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients we aimed to elucidate dysregulated genes and pathways. Methods RNA was extracted from six SpA, two AS, three osteoarthritis (OA) and four normal control knee <b>synovial</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Whole genome expression profiling was undertaken using the Illumina DASL system, which assays 24000 cDNA probes. Differentially expressed candidate genes were then validated using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Results: Four hundred and sixteen differentially expressed genes were identified that clearly delineated between AS/SpA and control groups. Pathway analysis showed altered gene-expression in oxidoreductase activity, B-cell associated, matrix catabolic, and metabolic pathways. Altered «myogene» profiling was also identified. The inflammatory mediator, MMP 3, was strongly upregulated (5 -fold) in AS/SpA samples and the Wnt pathway inhibitors DKK 3 (2. 7 -fold) and Kremen 1 (1. 5 -fold) were downregulated. Conclusions: Altered expression profiling in SpA and AS samples demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is associated with both systemic inflammation {{as well as local}} tissue alterations that may underlie tissue damaging modelling and remodelling outcomes. This supports the hypothesis that initial systemic inflammation in spondyloarthropathies transfers to and persists in the local joint environment, and might subsequently mediate changes in genes directly involved in the destructive tissue remodelling...|$|R
