5000|$|The generational order: The second {{approach}} {{centers on}} <b>socio-structural</b> and socio-theoretical questions concerning social equality and social order in a society, which categorizes their members {{by age and}} segregates them in many respects (rights, deeds, economical participation, ascribed needs etc.). These issues can be summarized under the overall concept of the generational order. Thus the categorization of societal members by age {{is far from being}} an innocent representation of natural distinctions, but rather a social construction of such a [...] "natural truth". It is, therefore, a relevant component of social order and deeply connected to other dimensions of social inequality.Social and economic changes and socio-political interventions thus become central topics in childhood sociology. The analysis of these issues has increased awareness of the generational inequality of societies.|$|E
50|$|Having worked {{within the}} fields of socialization, family {{research}} and history of sociology, Heckmann {{began to focus on}} migration and integration research with his habilitation (The Federal Republic: A country of immigration?, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart, 1981). <b>Socio-structural</b> analysis evidenced a status of belonging of the so-called guest workers; in addition historical and internationally comparative analysis demonstrated that Germany had been transformed into a country of immigration. Conceptual and theoretical works of Heckmann contribute to a theory of minorities, to the concept of ethnic colony, to the dimensional analysis of integration processes and to the theory of prejudice as both attitude and ideology. Much of this found in his book “Ethnische Minderheiten, Volk und Nation. Soziologie inter-ethnischer Beziehungen (Enke 1992). Since the foundation of the efms, Heckman has led numerous empirical research as well as practice-oriented projects. The efms’s projects mainly concern migration theory, migration statistics, migration politics, citizenship, urban and educational integration, studies on discrimination as well as evaluations of implemented policies and measures (for more information, please visit efms.de).

50|$|Prof. Mlinar {{finished}} high school in Ljubljana and graduated from the Ljubljana Faculty of Law in 1958. As a postgraduate student, he studied sociology at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade. In 1960, he became assistant professor in sociology at the Faculty of Law (Ljubljana) and earned his PhD there in 1967. From 1963 to 1968, {{he worked as a}} researcher at the Institute of Sociology and Philosophy. He joined the Faculty of Social Sciences in 1968, first as an associate professor and from 1974 as a full professor until his retirement in 1997. Between 1974 and 1976, he was dean of the faculty. As a researcher, Mlinar founded the Centre for Spatial Sociology. In this way conceived field of sociology is also pursued in the interdisciplinary studies of spatial, urban and landscape planning.Professor Mlinar was elected an associate member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SASA) in 1981 and a full member in 1987. He was head of the Department of Social Sciences, and the secretary of the first Section for Historical and Social Sciences.Professor Mlinar was the first in Slovenia and internationally to conceive the research and lecturing of spatial sociology. He considered it in the broader context of the multi-level interpretations of <b>socio-structural</b> change and the role of actors in it. In doing so, Mlinar integrated and transcended the frameworks of urban and rural sociology, local self-government and regional research, revealing the regularities of social change, particularly in terms of individualisation and socialisation processes, globalisation and informatisation. He studied the dynamics of the interpenetration and exclusion of opposites, transcending the outdated notions of the zero-sum game logic, e.g. between local and global, between homogenisation and diversification, and de-territorialisation and re-territorialisation etc. He interpreted social transformation as the freeing up of actors and their overcoming of divisions arising from spatial, temporal, sectoral and hierarchical organisation. He explored changes in the spatial organisation of public and private life, with a focus on the genuine sphere {{of the life of the}} inhabitants’ actual participation, influence and contacts in space. With Henry Teune, he co-authored The Developmental Logic of Social Systems (1978) which Encyclopædia Britannica listed among the ˝grand theories˝ concerning social development in the context of centuries of change.|$|E
40|$|High {{and rising}} levels of crime plague post-apartheid South Africa. A common {{explanation}} for these high crime rates relates the country’s unique socio-political past {{to a system}} of ineffective social control mechanisms that suggest high levels of social disorganisation within certain communities. Other explanations emphasise the presence of disaffected youths and deprivation, as well as the rapid immigration of people from neighbouring African countries into South Africa. I examined a number of these <b>socio-structural</b> explanations of crime on contact crime rates in the city of Tshwane, South Africa. The findings are largely consistent with the social disorganisation theory, as well as with what has previously been suggested in local literature. In order to supplement these preliminary findings, the effects of the same <b>socio-structural</b> explanations on contact crime rates were determined for predominantly Black, White, and ‘Mixed’ (containing a mix of both Black and White residents) suburbs using spatial regression models. Evidence from these analyses suggests that the effects of the various <b>socio-structural</b> explanations do not appear to traverse racial lines. Rather, the findings suggest non-uniformity in terms {{of the extent to which}} the various <b>socio-structural</b> factors impact contact crime rates based on race...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} classic work by Lipset & Rokkan (1967) <b>socio-structural</b> {{characteristics}} have been routinely considered {{as predictors of}} party choice. More recently, however, {{research has shown that}} the predictive power of social cleavages, as captured by <b>socio-structural</b> variables, is declining (Franklin et al. 1990, Knutsen 2004). As a consequence, much recent work has focused on value or ideological orientations in order to explain party choice (van der Eijk et al. 2005). We revisit this argument and compare the predictive ability of an ideological (general Left-Right orientations) and a <b>socio-structural</b> (age, gender, occupation and religiosity) model of party choice. For our analysis we use multinomial regressions to compare the explanatory power of the two models as well as descriptive inference through non-parametric tools to identify general trends.

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} project examines {{the relationships between}} <b>socio-structural</b> factors and risky behaviors among various ethnic American groups. We explored two research questions: (1) Whether <b>socio-structural</b> variables such as income inequality and mortality were related to increased engagement in future-discounting behaviors regardless of ethnic group; and (2) Whether differences in future discounting behavior exist at all, and if so, on which outcome variables. Methods included a thorough compilation of research findings in which data from regression analyses were reviewed with respect to predictor and outcome variables in order to summarize previous finding. There were no constant predictor variables found throughout the literature. Some research found the <b>socio-structural</b> correlates to be significant while others found the opposite. There was also a difference in discounting {{by the age of}} the participant but this finding only applied to one of the studies reviewed. This project is an important step in understanding the factors that influence engagement in highrisk future-discounting behaviors instead of focusing solely on the behaviors themselves...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Stereotype Content Model (SCM) posits two {{fundamental}} dimensions of intergroup perception, warmth and competence, predicted by <b>socio-structural</b> dimensions {{of competition and}} status, respectively. However, the SCM has been challenged on claiming perceived competition as the <b>socio-structural</b> dimension that predicts perceived warmth. The current research improves by broadening warmth’s predictor (competition) to include both realistic and symbolic threat from Integrated Threat Theory (Study 1). We also measure two components of the warmth dimension: sociability and morality. Study 2 tests new items to measure both threat and warmth. The new threat items significantly improve prediction of warmth, compared with standard SCM items. Morality and sociability correlate highly and do not differ much in their predictability by competition/threat...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} {{the relevance of}} two theoretical approaches, <b>socio-structural</b> resources theory and the functional analysis of behaviour theory, to understand volunteer behaviour of older adults. The aims {{of this study were}} to ascertain whether volunteering is associated with greater wellbeing in older Australians; to identify whether volunteers and non-volunteers differ in their <b>socio-structural</b> resources; to explore older adults&# 039; motivations for volunteering, and to investigate the relationship between motivation and connectedness, incorporating perceived appreciation and respect by the organisation and the community. For this purpose, 140 individuals (91 female and 49 males) aged 55 years and over participated in the study. Of this number 85 were volunteers and 55 were non-volunteers. Contrary to our prediction, wellbeing did not differ between volunteers and non-volunteers. The relationship status was the only <b>socio-structural</b> variable found to differ between volunteers and non-volunteers, with volunteers more likely to be single than in an intimate relationship. As predicted, the most important motivation for volunteering was to express personal values while the least important motivation was to gain career-related experience. Also as predicted, a positive relationship was noted between the value motive for volunteering and connectedness. The implications of understanding motives for volunteering for the recruitment and retention of older adults are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the upward trend of divorce rates in West Germany {{since the middle}} of the 1930 s by testing hypotheses on the changing <b>socio-structural</b> composition of marriage cohorts and on changes of the divorce behavior of different <b>socio-structural</b> subgroups.

Empirical analyses use data from the German Life History Study (GLHS) and are based on six West German marriage cohorts between 1936 and 2005. The increasing divorce rates could not be explained by compositional or behavioral effects. Alternative explanations of historical trends of divorce rates are discussed...|$|E

A sample of 148 couples with young children completed extensive questionnaires. As hypothesized, couples’ paid work strategy moderated gender differences in the salience and centrality of parental and work identities. Whereas significant differences in identities were found between stay-at-home mothers and their breadwinning husbands, no differences were found among dual-earner couples. Moreover, men’s work identity centrality increased when they had more and younger children, whereas women’s work identity centrality decreased. Finally, men’s parental identity centrality increased with their income, whereas women’s parental identity centrality decreased the more they earned. These findings attest to the importance of examining differences within as well as between genders, by taking into account the interactive effects of gender with other <b>socio-structural</b> characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} predictions from evolutionary and <b>socio-structural</b> {{perspectives on}} {{sex differences in}} mate selection criteria on a sample of 127 respondents from Serbia. The respondents, mainly college students, were asked to assess the degree of un/desirability of sixty behavioural and personality traits in a potential mate, on the 7 -point Likert type scale. The sexes strongly agree in general ranking of the traits ' desirability. The obtained statistically significant differences tend to favour the evolutionary interpretation. The largest differences are in the perceived desirability of thinness, strength, fearfulness, self-pity, fragility, aggressiveness, and beauty. Males perceived all these traits as more desirable (or less undesirable) than females, except that females valued strength more positively. Male respondents are less troubled by negative character traits of a potential partner, while females are less concerned with a partner’s physical appearance. The higher status of women correlated positively with their concern with a mate's potential socio-economic status, contrary {{to the prediction of}} the <b>socio-structural</b> model...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} and explains the gender disparity in health despite rapid modernization in South Korea where {{the social structure}} is still based on traditional gender relations. A nationally representative sample of 2897 men and 3286 women aged 25 - 64 from the 2001 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was analyzed. Health indicators included self rated health and chronic disease. Age-adjusted prevalence was computed according to a gender and odds ratios (OR) derived from logistic regression. Percentage changes in OR by inclusion of determinant variables (<b>socio-structural,</b> psychosocial, and behavioral) into the base logistic regression model were used to estimate the contributions to the gender gap in two morbidity measures. Results showed a substantial female excess in ill-health in both measures, revealing an increasing disparity in the older age group. Group-specific age-adjusted prevalence of ill-health showed an inverse relationship to socioeconomic position. When adjusting for each determinant, employment status, education, and depression contributed the greatest to the gender gap. After adjusting for all suggested determinants, 78 % for self rated health and 86 % for chronic disease in excess OR could be explained. After stratifying for age, the full model provided a complete explanation for the female excess in chronic illness, but for self rated health a female excess was still evident for the younger age group. <b>Socio-structural</b> factors {{played a crucial role}} in accounting for female excess in ill-health. This result calls for greater attention to gender-based health inequality stemming from <b>socio-structural</b> determinants in South Korea.

40|$|Despite the {{presence}} of high impact interventions to improve infant and young child feeding, only about 52 % of mothers in Ethiopia exclusively breastfeed their child {{for the first six}} months after delivery. Although the decision to breastfeed a child is ultimately that of the mother, this decision could be influenced by a variety of factors including social-cognitive ones. The objectives of the study were to describe the breastfeeding behaviour of primiparous mothers during their prenatal period in terms of intentions/goals, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and <b>socio-structural</b> factors and assess their exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) practices as well as identify the social-cognitive predictors of EBF practices among these mothers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A prospective follow up health facility-based study with quantitative methods was used with a sample of 233 primiparous women. Both structured and semi-structured questions were used for collection of data. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 was used for data analysis. Findings at the 95 % confidence interval and P-value of 5 % were reported as statistically significant. 39. 1 % (n = 59) of the respondents were found to have high breastfeeding self-efficacy, 51. 4 % (n = 71) have good breastfeeding outcome expectancies, and 6. 5 % (n = 9) respondents had supportive breastfeeding <b>socio-structural</b> factors. Bivariate correlation analysis showed positive and statistically significant correlation between each of breastfeeding self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, and <b>socio-structural</b> factors, with EBF practice.
