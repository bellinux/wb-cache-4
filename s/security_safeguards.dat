2500|$|The Final Rule on Security Standards {{was issued}} on February 20, 2003. It took effect on April 21, 2003 with a {{compliance}} date of April 21, 2005 for most covered entities and April 21, 2006 for [...] "small plans". The Security Rule complements the Privacy Rule. While the Privacy Rule pertains to all Protected Health Information (PHI) including paper and electronic, the Security Rule deals specifically with Electronic Protected Health Information (EPHI). It lays out {{three types of}} <b>security</b> <b>safeguards</b> required for compliance: administrative, physical, and technical. For each of these types, the Rule identifies various security standards, and for each standard, it names both required and addressable implementation specifications. Required specifications must be adopted and administered as dictated by the Rule. Addressable specifications are more flexible. Individual covered entities can evaluate their own situation and determine {{the best way to}} implement addressable specifications. Some privacy advocates have argued that this [...] "flexibility" [...] may provide too much latitude to covered entities. The standards and specifications are as follows: ...|$|E

This environment includes users themselves, networks, devices, all software, processes,information in storage or transit, applications, services, and systems that can be connected directly or indirectly to networks. The principal objective {{is to reduce the}} risks, including prevention or mitigation of cyber-attacks.

Legitimate handlers of controlled substances subject to regulatory investigation include drug manufacturers, distributors (wholesalers), importers and exporters, and narcotic treatment programs, which are those programs primarily designed to furnish methadone to narcotic addicts as part of a program of addiction treatment.|$|E

Mobile phones and tablets are used for collection, reporting, and analysis of data in near real time. However, these mobile devices are commonly used for personal activities, as well, leaving them more vulnerable to security risks {{that could lead to}} data breaches. Without proper <b>security</b> <b>safeguards,</b> this personal use could jeopardize the quality, security, and confidentiality of health data.|$|E
50|$|Although these general {{foreign policy}} goals were {{apparently}} conceived {{in terms of}} priorities, the emphasis and ranking of the priorities have changed over time in response to domestic and international stimuli. After Mikhail Gorbachev became general Secretary of the Communist Party in 1985, for instance, some Western analysts discerned in the ranking of priorities a possible de-emphasis of Soviet support for national liberation movements. Although the emphasis and ranking of priorities were subject to change, two basic goals of Soviet foreign policy remained constant: national <b>security</b> (<b>safeguarding</b> Communist Party rule through internal control {{and the maintenance of}} adequate military forces) and, since the late 1940s, influence over Eastern Europe.|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} this model is that, in {{developing}} information assurance systems, organizations must consider the interconnectedness of all the different factors that impact them. To devise a robust information assurance program, one must consider not only the security goals of the program (see below), but also how these goals relate specifically to the various states in which information can reside in a system and {{the full range of}} available <b>security</b> <b>safeguards</b> that must be considered in the design. The McCumber model helps one to remember to consider all important design aspects without becoming too focused on any one in particular (i.e., relying exclusively on technical controls at the expense of requisite policies and end-user training).|$|E
