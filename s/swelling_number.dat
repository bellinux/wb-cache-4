5000|$|... 853 AD {{marks the}} first officially {{verified}} documentation of the Contarini in the Republic of Venice, with Andrea Contarini named in the testament of Orso Partecipazio, son of Giovanni I Participazio. According to manuscripts in the Biblioteca Marciana and the family archives the Contarini claim direct descent of the Roman gens Aurelii Cottae through Publius Aurelius Cotta, son of Marcus Aurelius Cotta (consul in 74 BC and maternal uncle of Julius Caesar), who transferred his family to Padua. His grandson, Lucius Aurelius Cotta was elected prefect of the Reno; {{the area around the}} [...] Reno near Bologna. His first and second son and his male grandchildren continued in this position and added the cognomen Reno, becoming Cotta Reno or Cottareno. The last person to register Cottareno was Marcus Aurelius Cottareno in Padua in 290 AD and subsequently the family name was written as Contareno, or Contarini in [...] Venetian (both the Latin and [...] Venetian denomination of the family name have been used interchangeably since).In 338 AD Marcus Aurelius Contareno (or Marco Aurelio Contarini in Venetian), prefect of [...] Concordia under Constantine I, was the first Contarini to permanently move his residence to the Venetian area. In 425 another Marcus Aurelius Contarini took part in the third Consular Triumvirate of Rialto, following the invasions of the Goths under Alaric I, who from 402 pillaged the rich provinces of Istria and Venetia and sacked Rome in 410. From the outset the affairs of the early exiles in the islands of the Venetian lagoon were managed by Roman Consuls elected at Padua, including the Contarini. Following the invasion by the Huns of Attila in 452 and the destruction of the large Roman cities of Padua and Aquileia, the islands became a more permanent refuge for the <b>swelling</b> <b>number</b> of exiles. [...] In 466 the exiles decided upon a form of self-government through the annual election of Tribunes, who ultimately in 539 came under Byzantine rule through the Exarch of Ravenna, forming a loose association of islands with its capital in Eraclea. According to tradition, in 697 under the guidance of the Patriarch of Grado, twelve Tribunes ruling the Byzantine district of Venice elected the first Doge in Eraclea, forming the independent Republic of Venice. One of these Tribunes was Marcus Aurelius Contarini. Twentieth century studies, however, cast doubt on the historicity of the first Doge Paolo Luccio Anafesto and his successor Doge Marcello Tegalliano, suggesting that only following the murder of the Byzantine viceroy Paul Exarch of Ravenna, did the inhabitants of the islands chose their first Doge, Orso Ipato from Eraclea. Whoever was historically the first, the Contarini family has since the earliest Venetian chronicles been associated with the birth of the Republic and election of the first Doge. They formed part of the 'duodecim nobiliorum proles Venetiarum' (or the 'twelve noblest families of Venice'), and the 12 apostolic families, the oldest and most prestigious of the 247 patrician families in the Great Council following the Serrata of 1297. As the first inhabitants in the lagoon came from what were provinces of Rome in the 5th century, the Rialto initially being governed by a Consular Triumvirate elected at Padua and subsequently by Tribunes who were elected from among the most prominent members in their former Roman communes, it is not uncommon among the oldest Venetian patrician families to find Roman ancestry (e.g. Quirini descended from gens Sulpicii Quirini, Marcello descended from gens Claudii Marcelli), families who often kept their praenomina traditions and preserved their genealogy. The older branch Aurelli Cottae of the gens Aurelia came to prominence with the election of Gaius Aurelius Cotta as consul in 252 BC and again in 248 BC during the First Punic War and by the time Publius Aurelius Cotta moved to Padua four of his patrilineal ancestors, including his father, had achieved consulship in the Roman Republic.|$|E
40|$|A {{dilatometer}} type apparatus {{has been}} used to measure the swelling pressure developed in a small coal sample during carbonisation at constant volume. A standard test procedure is outlined and the apparatus specified. Two types of results are given. In the first no corrections are made for effects not associated with the coal. These results, characteristic of the apparatus and standard test conditions, {{can be used as a}} quantitative measure of the swelling properties of coals, and are reproducible to ± 5 %. In the second set of results elimination of such effects is attempted. The values so obtained are for the pressure at a point in a coal change throughout carbonisation. These results show that swelling pressure occurs at lower temperatures than the associated property of volume increase, and is not due to volatile evolution through the plastic coal as the latter property is. The temperatures at which the maximum swelling occurs is rank dependent and has a range 200 - 350 °C in the rank range investigated. The magnitude of this maximum swelling pressure also increases with rank. It is also know that considerable shrinkage occurs in the coal sample after the maximum swelling pressure is developed. The results are correlated with the BSS 1016 Crucible Swelling Test Scale and experimental data is extrapolated in an attempt to obtain equivalent <b>swelling</b> <b>number</b> values for the arbitrary 9 ⁺, 9 ⁺⁺, 9 ⁺⁺⁺ designations at present used for high-swelling New Zealand coals. Values of 11 ½, 13 ½, 16 ½ respectively are predicted. Prediction of equivalent swelling numbers is also made using a percentage swelling – ultimate analysis formula. Similar values are obtained. The correlations show swelling properties to have a second order dependence on <b>swelling</b> <b>number.</b> The results before correction for extraneous efforts show an exponential dependence on <b>swelling</b> <b>number...</b>|$|E
