5|$|The F-22 {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The Raptor's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of aerodynamic drag from external stores. The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's structural weight.|$|E
25|$|February 10: Heavy air {{activity}} continues {{over the}} battlezone. During the morning, the FAP sends in A-37Bs and Sukhoi Su-22 to strike Ecuadorian positions. The FAE steps in. At 12:42, the Ecuadorian radars pick up five enemy targets approaching {{for another round}} of attacks. Two FAE Mirage F.1JAs and two IAI Kfir C.2s are sent to intercept the incoming aircraft. In the ensuing action an A-37B <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> is shot down by a Kfir and two Peruvian Sukhoi Su-22s were claimed to be shot down by the Ecuadorian Mirage F1 respectively. Peru, however, denied that the two Sukhoi Su-22s were shot down by Mirages, stating that one was struck by Ecuadorian anti-aircraft artillery during a low flying ground-attack mission, and the second because of an engine fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the M.52 was cylindrical and, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was constructed of high tensile steel with light-alloy covering. The fuselage had the minimum cross-section allowable around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle-like arrangement placed over the upper area around it. The engine was positioned with its center of gravity coincident with that of the aircraft and the wings were attached to the main structure just aft of the engine. The use of a shock cone in the nose was another key design choice; the inlet cone slowed incoming air to the subsonic speeds determined by the engine, but with lower losses than a <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> pitot intake. A retractable tricycle undercarriage was used. The nose wheel was positioned close to the pilot's feet and the main wheels were fitted onto the main fuselage, folding out under the wings when deployed.|$|E

500|$|The Sea Harrier is a <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{designed}} to fill strike, reconnaissance and fighter roles. [...] It features a single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine with two intakes and four vectorable nozzles. It has two landing gear on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear on the wings. The Sea Harrier {{is equipped with}} four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying weapons and external fuel tanks. Use of the ski jump allowed the aircraft to take off from a short flight deck with a heavier loadout than otherwise possible, although it can also take off like a conventional loaded fighter without thrust vectoring from a normal airport runway.|$|E
500|$|German {{research}} {{during the}} Second World War had shown {{the onset of}} wave drag was greatly reduced by using airfoils that varied in curvature as gradually as possible. This suggested the use of thinner airfoils with much longer chord than designers would have used on <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft.</b> These designs were impractical because they left little internal room in the wing for armament or fuel. However, they also discovered {{it was possible to}} [...] "trick" [...] the airflow into the same behaviour if a conventional thicker airfoil was used swept rearward at a sharp angle, creating a swept-wing. This provided many of the advantages of a thinner airfoil while also retaining the internal space needed for strength and fuel storage. Another advantage was that the wings were clear of the supersonic shock wave generated by the nose of the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Concorde had {{considerable}} difficulties {{that led to}} its dismal sales performance. Costs had spiralled during development to more than six times the original projections, arriving at a unit cost of £23million in 1977 (equivalent to £ million in [...] ). Its sonic boom made travelling supersonic over land impossible without causing complaints from citizens. World events had also dampened Concorde sales prospects, the 1973-74 stock market crash and the 1973 oil crisis had made many airlines cautious about aircraft with high fuel consumption rates; and new wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, had recently made <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> significantly more efficient and presented a low-risk option for airlines. While carrying a full load, Concorde achieved 15.8 passenger miles per gallon of fuel, while the Boeing 707 reached 33.3pm/g, the Boeing 747 46.4pm/g, and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 53.6pm/g. An emerging trend in the industry in favour of cheaper airline tickets had also caused airlines such as Qantas to question Concorde's market suitability.|$|E

A weapon such as the M43 would have been best used against hard, high-value intelligence targets, in hostage or prisoner rescue situations, or in any other situation where friendly forces and enemy forces occupied the same area.|$|E
50|$|The Machmeter is, on <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{a warning}} indicator. <b>Subsonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> must not fly {{faster than a}} {{specific}} percentage {{of the speed of}} sound.

50|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} SURA rocket, the SURA 80R, was developed by Hispano-Suiza in the 1960s. In 1971 Oerlikon-Buhrle took over the military division of Hispano-Suiza and redesignated the SURA 80R, the SURA-FL, and further developed the SURA-FL which is the current SURA-D. The SNORA rockets can be fired from either a supersonic or <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The SURA-D though, is limited to <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Modern combat {{aircraft}} accomplish {{this in a}} variety of ways, through design of the inlet. The inlet sits upstream of the compressor and has a strong influence on engine net thrust. A well-designed inlet straightens out the flow, and feeds the compressor with low-turbulence air at a relatively constant speed and volume. This is not difficult to achieve in <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as passenger jets, which do not perform high-speed, high-G maneuvers that lead to turbulent airflow. Inlets on <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> are simple and shorter, and are basically an opening designed to minimize drag.|$|E

50|$|A <b>subsonic</b> <b>{{aircraft}}</b> is {{an aircraft}} {{with a maximum}} speed less {{than the speed of}} sound (Mach 1).

40|$|The {{turbulent}} {{boundary layer}} (TBL) {{is one of the}} dominant noise sources in high <b>subsonic</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> Especially in modern aircrafts, where common materials for fuselages are currently substituted by carbon-fiber-reinforced-plastics (CFRP), it is essential to avoid a decrease of passenger comfort {{as a result of an}} inferior transmission loss of the new materials.

These systems consist of a control unit and surface mounted actuators and sensors. Structural vibrations of the panel are measured by the sensors and filtered by the control unit to estimate the radiated sound power in the far field. The transfer path from actuators over the structure to the sensors is called the controlled plant.
