25|$|France, Luxembourg, {{and most}} of the Eastern Bloc along with their {{overseas}} territories opted for SECAM. SECAM was a popular choice in countries with a lot of hilly terrain, and technologically backward countries with a very large installed base of monochrome equipment, since the greater ruggedness of the <b>SECAM</b> <b>signal</b> could cope much better with poorly maintained equipment. However, for many countries the decision was more down to politics than technical merit.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that it is often possible to record SECAM video on an unmodified PAL VCR, thus creating MESECAM tapes, which can be played back in color through another PAL VCR into a SECAM TV. Basic PAL VCRs work better for this, ones that are more sophisticated detect the <b>SECAM</b> <b>signal</b> as [...] "not-PAL" [...] and refuse to record it in color.|$|E

5000|$|... "Native" [...] SECAM {{recording}} {{was originally}} devised for machines sold for the French market. At a later stage, countries where both PAL and <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals</b> were available (notably the Middle East, hence the Acronym [...] "Middle East SECAM"), developed a cheap method of converting PAL video machines to record <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals</b> also using the PAL circuitry. A tape produced by this method is not compatible with [...] "native" [...] SECAM tapes as produced by VCRs in the French market. It will play {{in black and white}} only, the color is lost. So the world is left with two different incompatible standards for recording SECAM on video cassette.|$|R
50|$|Another {{explanation}} for the Eastern European adoption of SECAM, led by the Soviet Union, is that the Russians had extremely long distribution lines between broadcasting stations and transmitters. Long co-axial cables or microwave links can cause amplitude and phase variations, which do not affect <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chrominance is {{represented}} by the U-V color plane in PAL and <b>SECAM</b> video <b>signals,</b> and by the I-Q color plane in NTSC.|$|R
50|$|Regarding early (analog) videodiscs, the {{established}} Laserdisc standard supported only NTSC and PAL. However, a different optical disc format, the Thomson transmissive optical disc made a brief {{appearance on the}} market. At some point, it used a modified <b>SECAM</b> <b>signal</b> (single FM subcarrier at 3.6 MHz). The media's flexible and transmissive material allowed for direct access to both sides without flipping the disc, a concept that reappeared in multi-layered DVDs about fifteen years later.|$|E
50|$|In general, modern {{professional}} equipment is now all-digital, and uses component-based digital interconnects such as CCIR 601 {{to eliminate the}} need for any analog processing prior to the final modulation of the analog signal for broadcast. However, large installed bases of analog {{professional equipment}} still exist, particularly in third world countries. In most cases all processing within the TV-station is PAL and on the output line a PAL to SECAM transcoder is used before feeding the transmitter. This is because switchers and effect mixers can easily handle PAL (or NTSC) but the <b>SECAM</b> <b>signal</b> can't be mixed in the same way due to the frequency modulation of the color information.|$|E
50|$|Currently, Russia {{uses the}} DVB-T {{standard}} with MPEG-4 encoding for the limited experimental broadcasting and cable networks, majority of TV broadcasting still {{being done in}} the old analogue SECAM standard. The Ministry of Communication, however, pledged to switch to the DVB-T2 as the transmitting centers are gradually upgraded, and plans to abandon analogue broadcast by 2015. Several pilot broadcasting centers in some regions are already online and simulcasting in DVB-T2 SD and <b>SECAM</b> <b>signal</b> since February 2010, with more to go. Only one channel pack with eight to ten main national radio and TV channels (Channel One, Rossiya 1/2/K/24, NTV, Radio Mayak, Radio Rossii etc.) are available today, with more planned to be added as the digital TV network is expanded.|$|E
50|$|One serious {{drawback}} for studio work is {{that the}} addition of two <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals</b> does not yield valid colour information, due to its use of frequency modulation. It was necessary to demodulate the FM and handle it as AM for proper mixing, before finally remodulating as FM, {{at the cost of}} some added complexity and signal degradation. In its later years, this was no longer a problem, due to the wider use of component and digital equipment.|$|R
50|$|MESECAM is {{a method}} of {{recording}} <b>SECAM</b> color <b>signals</b> onto VHS or Betamax video tape. It should not {{be mistaken for a}} broadcast standard.|$|R
5000|$|Although being a workaround, MESECAM is {{much more}} {{widespread}} than [...] "native" [...] SECAM. It {{has been the only}} method of recording <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals</b> to VHS in almost all countries that ever used SECAM, including as mentioned the Middle East and all countries in Eastern Europe. [...] "Native" [...] SECAM recording (marketing term: [...] "SECAM-West") is only used in France and adjacent countries. Most VHS machines advertised as [...] "SECAM capable" [...] outside France can be expected to be of the MESECAM variety only.|$|R
50|$|Unlike PAL or NTSC, analog SECAM {{programming}} cannot {{easily be}} edited in its native analog form. Because it uses frequency modulation, SECAM is not linear {{with respect to}} the input image (this is also what protects it against signal distortion), so electrically mixing two (synchronized) SECAM signals does not yield a valid <b>SECAM</b> <b>signal,</b> unlike with analog PAL or NTSC. For this reason, to mix two SECAM signals, they must be demodulated, the demodulated signals mixed, and are remodulated again. Hence, post-production is often done in PAL, or in component formats, with the result encoded or transcoded into SECAM at the point of transmission. Reducing the costs of running television stations is one reason for some countries' recent switchovers to PAL.|$|E
50|$|For 625 {{scan line}} systems (PAL and <b>SECAM),</b> the <b>signal</b> {{is placed in}} line 23. It begins with a run-in code and start code {{followed}} by 14 bits of information.|$|R
50|$|Recently {{manufactured}} PAL television receivers can typically decode all {{of these}} systems except, in some cases, PAL-M and PAL-N. Many of receivers can also receive Eastern European and Middle Eastern SECAM, though rarely French-broadcast SECAM (because France used a quasi-unique positive video modulation, system L) unless they are manufactured for the French market. They will correctly display plain CVBS or S-video <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals.</b> Many can also accept baseband NTSC-M, such as from a VCR or game console, and RF modulated NTSC with a PAL standard audio subcarrier (i.e., from a modulator), though not usually broadcast NTSC (as its 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier is not supported). Many sets also support NTSC with a 4.43 MHz subcarrier.|$|R
5000|$|DVDs {{are also}} {{formatted}} {{for use on}} two conflicting regional television systems: 480i/60 Hz and 576i/50 Hz, which in analog contexts are {{often referred to as}} 525/60 (NTSC) and 625/50 (PAL/SECAM) respectively. Strictly speaking, PAL and SECAM are analog color television signal formats which have no relevance in the digital domain (as evident in the conflation of PAL and SECAM, which are actually two distinct analog color systems). However, the DVD system was originally designed to encode the information necessary to reproduce signals in these formats, and the terms continue to be used (incorrectly) as a method of identifying refresh rates and vertical resolution. However, an [...] "NTSC", [...] "PAL" [...] or [...] "SECAM" [...] DVD player that has one or more analog composite video output (baseband or modulated) will only produce NTSC, PAL or <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals,</b> respectively, from those outputs, and may only play DVDs identified with the corresponding format.|$|R
25|$|A {{drawback}} of SECAM {{for production}} is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals</b> {{are not really}} possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple fade to black is trivial in NTSC and PAL: you just reduce the signal level until it is zero. However, in SECAM the color difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the fade-to-black is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that comb filtering, allowing better color separation, is not possible in TV receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback {{in the early days}} of SECAM as such filters did not become readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the problem}} of phase errors {{in the real world}} became well known after the {{introduction}} of NTSC, the later PAL and SECAM color television standards attempted to correct for them. PAL uses the same color modulation scheme as NTSC but averages the received color information over adjacent scan lines, resulting in reduced color detail but canceling out small to moderate phase errors. (Severe phase errors result in picture grain and loss of color saturation in the PAL scheme.) SECAM uses a different modulation scheme that does not rely on the phase of the color signal. Because of this the amplitude of the color signal (color saturation) is unaffected as well. Because SECAM only broadcasts half the color information on each line, the color resolution is halved just like in the PAL system. Most TV sets designed for these later standards lack tint controls, as PAL and SECAM are not supposed to experience the problems a tint control would correct. (This leaves the viewer unable to correct for color errors originating at the transmission site, however.) Multistandard sets have tint controls for NTSC viewing, but the controls are inoperative when watching PAL or <b>SECAM</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Zoran became {{better known}} through PC video {{products}} incorporating Motion JPEG technology, which until 2001 were a significant contributor to Zoran's revenues. The ZR3606x and ZR3650x (with USB interface) family of devices was {{widely used in}} PC-based video capture and editing devices. Zoran also offered digital audio products such as the ZR38601, a single-chip digital audio processor designed to support the PC and home theater digital speaker market. Zoran also offered to third parties chip design IP (intellectual property) cores for decoding and encoding NTSC, PAL or <b>SECAM</b> television <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{signals are}} much more {{important}} to compatibility than the color sub carriers are. They differ by AM or FM sound modulation, signal polarization, relative frequencies within the channel, bandwidth, etc. For example, a PAL D/K TV set {{will be able to}} receive a <b>SECAM</b> D/K <b>signal</b> (although in black and white), while it {{will not be able to}} decode the sound of a PAL B/G signal. So even before SECAM came to Eastern European countries, most viewers (other than those in East Germany and Yugoslavia) could not have received Western programs. This, along with language issues, meant that in most countries monochrome-only reception did not pose a significant problem for the authorities.|$|R
50|$|Most TVs {{currently}} sold in SECAM countries support both SECAM and PAL, {{and more}} recently composite video NTSC as well (though not usually broadcast NTSC, that is, they cannot accept a broadcast signal from an antenna). Although the older analog camcorders (VHS, VHS-C) were produced in SECAM versions, none of the 8 mm or Hi-band models (S-VHS, S-VHS-C, and Hi-8) recorded it directly. Camcorders and VCRs of these standards sold in SECAM countries are internally PAL. They use an internal SECAM to PAL converter for recording of broadcast TV transmitted in SECAM. The result could be converted back to SECAM in some models; most people buying such expensive equipment would have a multistandard TV set and as such would not need a conversion. Digital camcorders or DVD players (with the exception of some early models) do not accept or output a <b>SECAM</b> analog <b>signal.</b> However, this is of dwindling importance: since 1980 most European domestic video equipment uses French-originated SCART connectors, allowing the transmission of RGB signals between devices. This eliminates the legacy of PAL, SECAM, and NTSC color sub carrier standards.|$|R

50|$|In 4:2:0, the {{horizontal}} sampling is doubled compared to 4:1:1, {{but as the}} Cb and Cr channels are only sampled on each alternate line in this scheme, the vertical resolution is halved. The data rate is thus the same. This fits reasonably well with the PAL color encoding system since this has only half the vertical chrominance resolution of NTSC. It would also fit extremely well with the SECAM color encoding system since like that format, 4:2:0 only stores and transmits one color channel per line (the other channel being recovered from the previous line).
