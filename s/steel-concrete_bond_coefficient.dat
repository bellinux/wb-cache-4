40|$|Institution of Engineers Australia, 2015. In {{reinforced}} concrete structures, reinforcement corrosion induces concrete cracking {{and leads to}} a reduction in both the steel cross-section and the <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> strength and ultimately affects the development length. In this paper, a new correction factor is proposed to calculate the development length of {{reinforced concrete}} structures prone to corrosion. A scalar bond damage parameter is introduced to relate bond strength reduction to corrosion. The new model agrees well with all experimental results found in the literature. The bond damage parameter is further used as a correction factor modifying the AS 3600 provisions for the development length of reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures located in a saline environment.

The lightweight concrete was obtained by substituting part of the traditional coarse aggregates with beads of expanded polystyrene (EPS). The addition of EPS in the concrete mix could influence the bond behaviour with steel reinforcing bars, albeit the same strength of a normal concrete is reached. After different mixtures of normal and lightweight concrete with EPS have been tested in order to check the influence of several parameters on the compressive strength, two mixtures of lightweight concrete with EPS and one of normalweight concrete were finally prepared for carrying out the bond tests.

By addition of fibers to SCC, bar reinforcement can be replaced {{and the performance of}} concrete structures improved. The variation of the bond strength along the flowing path for the different mixes was evaluated. The <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> adequacy was evaluated based on normalized bond strength. The results showed that the bond strength was reduced due to Portland cement replacement with dolomite powder. The addition of either silica fume or fly ash positively hindered further degradation as the dolomite powder content increased. The SCC specimens were cast without applying compaction, whereas the specimens of normal concrete were cast by conventional practice with substantial compaction and vibration. The results showed that SCC specimens generated higher bond to reinforcing bars than normal concrete specimens and the correlation between bond strength and compressive strength of NC is more consistent...|$|R
40|$|Bond {{behaviour}} between {{concrete and}} reinforcing bars was observed under elevated temperatures. Five different concrete compositions were used. Hundred five pull-out specimens (Ø 120 mm, 100 mm) were prepared. After removing the specimens from the formwork, they were stored {{in water for}} seven days then kept at laboratory conditions until testing. The specimens were 28 days old by testing. After heating up the specimens, they were kept for two hours at these maximum temperatures (20 °C, 150 °C, 300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 800 °C). Specimens were then cooled down in laboratory conditions. Finally the specimens were tested at room temperature. In order to check the compressive strength standard cubes were cast, cured, and heat treated, then tested to compressive strength.

40|$|The {{strength}} of steel-reinforced concrete greatly {{depends on the}} adequacy of the bond between concrete and steel reinforcement and this can be impaired by the surface condition of reinforcing steel. Oil on the surface of steel reinforcement has been mentioned to potentially have an adverse effect on <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bonding</b> action and consequently structural performance, but this effect remains to be buttressed empirically. This study thus considered the effect of the surface condition of deformed mild steel bar on the bond strength and the flexural {{strength of}} steel-reinforced concrete, with the surface condition being engine oil coating. Bond and flexural test involving concrete embedded with steel bars coated with engine oil and un-coated steel bars (i. e. bars not coated with engine oil) revealed that engine oil coating considerably reduces the bond and flexural strength of reinforced concrete. Steel reinforcement during storage and installation should thus be protected from contamination by oiling agents...|$|R

By expansion of filaments to SCC, bar fortification can be supplanted and the execution of concrete structures made strides. The variety of the bond quality along the streaming way for the diverse blends was assessed. The <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> sufficiency was assessed in light of standardized bond quality. The outcomes demonstrated that the security quality was decreased because of Portland bond supplanting with dolomite powder. The expansion of either silica rage or fly fiery remains decidedly impeded further corruption as the dolomite powder content expanded. The SCC examples were cast without applying compaction, though the examples of ordinary concrete were cast by customary practice with generous compaction and vibration. The outcomes demonstrated that SCC examples created higher security to fortifying bars than ordinary concrete examples and the relationship between's security quality and compressive quality of NC is more predictable...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} on ring-confined concrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns were carried out to investigate the enhanced uni-axial behaviour of CFST columns in terms of Poisson's ratio, uni-axial strength and elastic stiffness. External confinement {{in the form of}} steel rings was advocated to restrict the lateral dilation of CFST columns in order to maintain an intact <b>steel-concrete</b> interface <b>bonding</b> arising from the difference in the Poisson ratios of steel and concrete. To study the effectiveness of the external ring confinement, uni-axial loading tests were carried out on 5 CFST column specimens with and without rings. All the specimens were tested under uni-axial compression in a 5, 000 kN testing machine. From the test results obtained, it is evident that: (1) The external rings could improve the uni-axial strength and stiffness of the CFST columns; (2) The Poisson's ratio of ring-confined CFST columns is smaller than that of the unconfined CFST columns; (3) The Poisson's ratio of the ring-confined CFST columns are all smaller than or close to 0. 2, which is the commonly accepted Poisson's ratio of concrete.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} shock vibration test method {{was employed to}} {{study the effects of}} shock vibration on steel-fibrereinforced concrete so as to explore the possibility of improving the shock vibration resistance of concrete. In total, 21 batches of concrete with steel fibre contents ranging from 0 to 4 % were cast and subjected to the shock vibration test at ages of 12 h, 1 day and 7 days. The results revealed that the effectiveness of adding steel fibres to alleviate the short-term damage caused by shock vibration (in terms of immediate reduction in ultrasonic pulse velocity) was quite low, especially for shock vibration applied at an early age. However, the effectiveness of adding steel fibres to mitigate the long-term damage caused by shock vibration (in terms of reduction in 28 -day direct tensile strength) turned out to be much higher for shock vibration applied at age within 1 day than at later age. One probable reason is that, even after vibration damage had been caused, the continuing development of the <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> while the concrete was still young could restore part of the reduced tensile strength. Finally, a new set of shock vibration control limits for steel fibre reinforced concrete was established. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{modeling}} of reinforced concrete structures has {{taken advantage of}} the increasing progress on Computational Mechanics, in such way that complex phenomena, such as cracking and crushing, creep, reinforcement yielding, <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> loss, can be modeled in a reasonable realistic way, using the proper set of numerical and computational resources. Among several options, the ones based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) allow complex analysis simulations of reinforced concrete structures, including the interaction of different nonlinear effects. This paper deals with the nonlinear finite element analysis of the bond-slip between reinforcing steel and concrete, taking into account an experimental study previously performed. The FEM analysis presented uses a combination of resources where the material behavior of concrete is described by the Microplane Constitutive Model, and an embedded reinforcement model is used to represent steel inside the concrete and take into account the effect of bond-slip. The FEM models were created using the INSANE (INteractive Structural ANalysis Environment) computational system, open source software that has a set of FEM tools for nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures.

The concrete was produced utilizing lightweight oil palm shell (OPS), which is a waste material from the palm oil industry as well as manufactured sand, which is obtained from the processing of quarry waste, to replace conventional materials as coarse and fine aggregate in the concrete, respectively. In addition, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) was utilized at 20 % cement replacement level to reduce the cement content in the OPS concrete (OPSC) as to further encourage the environmental-sustainability of the concrete. In the experimental study, selected properties such as the mechanical, permeation and structural properties of the OPSC were compared with those of conventional normal weight concrete (NWC) of equal targeted strength grade. While the performance of the mechanical properties such as splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the OPSC were inferior compared to NWC, the OPSC exhibited improved permeation properties such as the water absorption and sorptivity. The investigation of the structural properties such as the <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> behavior as well as the flexural performance of reinforced concrete beam also demonstrated that the OPSC could behave similarly as NWC. The experimental results obtained in this study thus indicate the possibility of utilizing such concrete as a viable alternative for conventional NWC for practical applications...|$|R

The proposed numerical strategy {{has the ability to}} reproduce many of the well-known (undesirable) mechanical effects induced by corrosion processes in the embedded steel bars, as for example: expansion of the reinforcements due to the corrosion product accumulation, damage and cracking patterns distribution in the surrounding concrete, degradation of <b>steel–concrete</b> <b>bond</b> stress transfer, net area reduction in the reinforcements and, mainly, the influence of all these mentioned mechanisms on the structural load carrying capacity predictions. At the numerical level, each component of the RC structure is represented by means of a suitable FE formulation.

Two different (and coupled) mesoscopic analyzes are considered in order to describe the main physical phenomena that govern the problem: (i) an analysis at the cross section level and (ii) an analysis at the structural member level.

This study focused on assessing the validity of the Nebraska Department of Roads’ (NDOR) reinforced concrete encasement retrofit for corroded steel HP piles. Experiments were designed and conducted to test the capacity of the NDOR retrofit and evaluate failure limit states. Two pile locations were considered: abutment and pile bent. For each location there was a non-deteriorated, deteriorated, and retrofitted case. These cases represented the pile at key stages during its life. NDOR’s concrete encasement retrofit provided the required stability and composite action to return the pile to full capacity. The key finding of the experimental study was a greater than anticipated <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> stress. The bond stress observed was three times greater than the nominal recommended by AISC. A computational study was also conducted to investigate sensitivities and alternative configurations, such as geometric alterations, material properties, and reinforcement. The computational study emphasized the load transfer mechanism’s dependence on the type of load applied. Piles governed by axial compression with relatively minor moment were observed to be more sensitive to bond. The moment dominated loads required more surface to surface pressure transfer or bearing.

To investigate influence of inadequate grouting on corrosion ofprestressing steel, an accelerated corrosion tests by external current was carried out in this study. Further, loading tests were also conducted to investigate the behavior of post-tensioned concrete beams deteriorated by corrosion of prestressing steel. In the test, the grouts were injected into the ducts with different grout level of 33 %, 66 % and 100 % respectively. The results of accelerated corrosion tests show that the cracks occurred faster with the increasing of grout level. It is confirmed that the grout plays {{a crucial role in the}} corrosion protection of the prestressing steel. The results of loading test show that, as the degree of corrosion crack became severe, failure mode of the beams shifted from flexural failure to bond splitting and ultimate loading capacity decreased from 10 % to 30 %. The reduction of the loading capacity might be due to reducing of <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> and concrete rigidity by severe corrosion cracks. For the beam with applied current time of 30 days, the failure load decreased 82 %. The weight loss of prestressing steel was 26 % for this beam. It is concluded that adequate grouting is necessary to protect prestressing steel deteriorated by corrosion. Furthermore, since the corrosion cracks occurred faster if the rate of filling grout is high, the measuring of sheath's corrosion is needed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCorrosion {{of steel}} in {{reinforced}} concrete leads to several major defects. Firstly, {{a reduction in}} the cross-sectional area of the reinforcement and in its ductility results in premature bar failure. Secondly, the expansion of the corrosion products causes concrete cracking and <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond</b> deterioration and also affects the bending stiffness of the reinforced concrete members, causing {{a reduction in the}} overall load-bearing capacity of the reinforced concrete beams. This paper investigates the validity of a repair technique using Near Surface Mounted (NSM) carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) rods to restore the mechanical performance of corrosion-damaged RC beams. In the NSM technique, the CFRP rods are placed inside pre-cut grooves and are bonded to the concrete with epoxy adhesive. Experimental results were obtained on two beams: a corroded beam that had been exposed to natural corrosion for 25 years and a control beam, (both are 3 m long) repaired in bending only. Each beam was repaired with one 6 -mm-diameter NSM CFRP rod. The beams were tested in a three-point bending test up to failure. Overall stiffness and crack maps were studied before and after the repair. Ultimate capacity, ductility and failure mode were also reviewed. Finally some comparisons were made between repaired and non-repaired beams in order to assess the effectiveness of the NSM technique. The experimental results showed that the NSM technique improved the overall characteristics (ultimate load capacity and stiffness) of the control and corroded beams and allowed sufficient ductility to be restored to the repaired corroded elements, thus restoring the safety margin, despite the non-classical mode of failure that occurred in the corroded beam, with the separation of the concrete cover due to corrosion products...|$|R

Carbonation damage is a fur- ther important degradation mechanism. The internal consequences of corrosion are the modification of the steel behavior and degradation of the <b>steel-concrete</b> <b>bond.</b> This work is devoted to the influence of the controlled corrosion on the adherence between steel and concrete. A new geometry of specimen has been designed to: (i) avoid the lateral confining stresses that appear during the classical pullout tests and (ii) permit to impose a known confinement for the study of its influence on the behavior of the interface. Five specimens with different levels of corrosion have been tested in this contribution. Reinforcing bars embedded in concrete were submitted to accelerated corrosion using an external current source. The magnitude of corrosion was measured using both Faraday's law and the weight loss method. The level of corrosion varied from 0 % to 0. 76 %. The geometry of the specimens allowed us to take series of digital pictures during the tests, which were analyzed using a digital image correlation, the procedure named COR- RELILMT. The results of pullout tests proposed in this contribution indicate that: (i) levels of corrosion that are less than 0. 4 % of weight loss improves the bond stress and (ii) levels of corrosion resulting in more than 0. 4 % of weight loss lead to a reduction of the bond stress value...|$|R

40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{reinforcing}} bars have attracted considerable attention for applications where corrosion of steel reinforcement is problematic. Due to the generally low elastic modulus and poor bond characteristics of FRP {{as compared to}} steel {{reinforcing bars}}, the use of FRP results in larger crack widths under service loads. Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is proposed for use with FRP to reduce crack widths. The work presented herein includes the results from 16 beams tested under four-point bending with either Grade 420 (Grade 60) steel or FRP reinforcing bars, and either plain concrete or FRC. A modified Gergely-Lutz model {{was applied to the}} measured crack widths to calculate <b>bond</b> <b>coefficients</b> that were used to quantify the effectiveness of FRC in reducing crack widths. In the beams with steel reinforcing bars, the FRC was found to have little influence on crack widths. In the beams with FRP reinforcing bars, the FRC was found to significantly reduce maximum crack widths...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis: In {{strengthened}} RC members {{the distribution}} of cross sectional tensile forces {{is affected by the}} significant differences in bond behavior of the reinforcement layers. As the tensile forces in the externally bonded reinforcement is the essential input value for bond verification for example at the end anchorage, the detailed knowledge of {{the distribution of}} forces in cracked sections is of fundamental importance. In this paper the common models to describe the interactions in tensile members are summarized and an advanced numerical model based on nonlinear bond stress-slip relationships for strengthened flexural members is presented. On the basis of experimental results combined with parametric studies, the effects of various parameters – for example the axial stiffness of CFRP, the diameter of internal rebars or the concrete compressive strength – on the interactions between the different reinforcement layers are examined. For practical design <b>bond</b> <b>coefficients</b> for a simplified calculation of cross sectional tensile forces are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The remarkably strong {{chemical}} adsorption behaviors of nitric oxide on magnesia (001) film deposited on metal substrate {{have been investigated}} by employing periodic density functional calculations with Van der Waals corrections. The molybdenum supported magnesia (001) show significantly enhanced adsorption properties and the nitric oxide is chemisorbed strongly and preferably trapped in flat adsorption configuration on metal supported oxide film, due to the substantially large adsorption energies and transformation barriers. The analysis of Bader charges, projected density of states, differential charge densities, electron localization function, highest occupied orbital and particular orbital with largest Mg-NO-Mg <b>bonding</b> <b>coefficients,</b> are applied to reveal the electronic adsorption properties and characteristics of bonding between nitric oxide and surface {{as well as the}} bonding within the hybrid structure. The strong chemical binding of nitric oxide on magnesia deposited on molybdenum slab offers new opportunities for toxic gas detection and treatment. We anticipate that hybrid structure promoted remarkable {{chemical adsorption}} of nitric oxide on magnesia in this study will provide versatile strategy for enhancing chemical reactivity and properties of insulating oxide...|$|R
