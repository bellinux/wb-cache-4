25|$|In 1859, the Pensioner Scheme was {{abandoned}} by the British government and ownership of Fort Malden {{was turned over to}} the province of Ontario. On June 8, 1859, an Order in Council within the Ontario government determined that Fort Malden would be recommissioned as a provincial insane asylum. Fort Malden was one of many examples where prior ordnance lands were repurposed by order of the province to become asylums, hospitals, or prisons, as these prior forts already possessed many fortified buildings and defences suited for institutional facilities. It was determined that the Malden Lunatic Asylum would act {{as an extension of the}} Toronto Lunatic Asylum to house surplus patients. However, many of Fort Malden’s buildings had been relatively neglected and so much of the first couple years of the Fort’s history as an asylum was allotted to necessary reconstruction. This remodeling was performed primarily under the architectural supervision of Kivas Tully who used several of the patients as labourers to help build and remodel the asylum's structures. Some of the early remodeling was concerned with repairing the barracks to serve as separate wings for the male and female patients, as well as converting the brick hospital into a kitchen, with the guard house becoming the porter’s apartment, used to house the water <b>supply</b> <b>pump,</b> and the officer’s quarters becoming the home of the doctor’s family.|$|E

50|$|A {{fuel pump}} is a {{frequently}} (but not always) essential component {{on a car}} or other internal combustion engined device. Many engines (older motorcycle engines in particular) do not require any fuel pump at all, requiring only gravity to feed fuel from the fuel tank or under high pressure to the fuel injection system. Often, carbureted engines use low pressure mechanical pumps that are mounted outside the fuel tank, whereas fuel injected engines often use electric fuel pumps that are mounted inside the fuel tank (and some fuel injected engines have two fuel pumps: one low pressure/high volume <b>supply</b> <b>pump</b> in the tank and one high pressure/low volume pump {{on or near the}} engine).|$|E
50|$|The tool {{consists}} {{of at least}} two concentric pipes which are forming two hydraulic channels - one for pumping down a high-pressure working agent (water) and second for delivering pregnant slurry back to the surface. A BHM tool usually has (down-up): an eductor (waterjet pump) section, a hydromonitor section, an extension section and a hub, connecting it all to a drill pipe string. This string extends the tool up to the surface. Above the surface, the tool has a swivel allowing its suspension and rotation in a hole, and also connections to the working agent <b>supply</b> (<b>pump</b> station) and a slurry collector. A drill rig is normally required to operate a BHM tool.|$|E

50|$|By January 1926 a large, level site off Johnston Road, {{about half}} a mile (0.8 km) {{south-west}} of the centre of Mossman, had been acquired for the new hospital. A plan of the proposed hospital layout for the site was prepared by Public Works in April 1926, positioning the main building close to the centre of the site, facing east, and accessed from Hospital Street. To the north of the main building, connected via a covered way, were the nurses' quarters, and to south, also connected via a covered way, the maternity ward. At the western side of the site, and not physically connected to the main building, were a number of ancillary buildings, structures and facilities: a doctor's residence (with private driveway off Johnston Road), tennis court, wardsman's quarters, water <b>supply</b> <b>pump</b> house, drying green, laundry and powerhouse, incinerator, and morgue.

5000|$|These did {{not happen}} often, but they were very {{dangerous}} when they did, and generally resulted in severe casualties among the crew and passengers and {{the complete loss of}} the boat. Steamboat boiler explosions had been a common problem on the Mississippi River system well before the steamboats began serious operations in the Pacific Northwest in the 1850s. By 1852, the problem had gotten so bad that Congress enacted a law setting out detailed standards for inspection of steamboats and licensing of officers. [...] Considerable work was done in the 1840s and 1850s to understand what caused boiler explosions, and these came down to many causes, including general wear and tear, inadequate or poorly designed equipment, overworked boilers that were too small for the engines, general lack of engineering skill among boiler operators, and excessive demands for performance from the vessels captain or management. [...] People noticed early on that most of boiler explosions occurred just as steamboats were leaving (or sometimes arriving at) a landing. This was true in two-thirds of the boiler explosions up to 1852. Steam pressure was supposed to be reduced during a landing, but this would {{make it more difficult to}} get off to a fast start, so too often pressure was kept up even though the engines werent running to relieve the pressure by use of the steam generated by the boiler. [...] Under these circumstances, boiler explosions were much more likely. The explosion came, we read again and again in the accounts of these accidents, while [...] "the boat was backing out from the landing," [...] or as [...] "the boat was straightening out after leaving the wharf," [...] or when [...] "the signal to go ahead had just been given," [...] or when [...] "the engine had made but two or three revolutions." ... Careful steam practice required that the during a landing the fires be well checked, the <b>supply</b> <b>pump</b> be kept working, and steam be released through safety or blow-off valve in order to prevent undue accumulation of pressure. Circumstances, however, worked against sound practice, and very often in the flush decades of steamboating these precautions were not observed. To overcome the inertia of the vessel and get it safely away from the shore, perhaps against opposing winds and currents, a good head of steam was needed, and it was better to have too much and not enough.|$|E
