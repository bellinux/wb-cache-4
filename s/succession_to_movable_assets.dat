40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{cross-country}} differences in collateral laws regarding <b>movable</b> <b>assets</b> on lending and sectoral allocation of resources. Using micro-level loan data for a sample of emerging market countries we show that loan-to-values of loans collateralized with <b>movable</b> <b>assets</b> are on average 21 percentage points higher in countries with strong-collateral laws relative to immovable assets. Further, stronger collateral laws tilt collateral composition away from immovable <b>to</b> <b>movable</b> <b>assets.</b> We also provide evidence of a collateral class, including bank guarantees, for which enforcement is independent of collateral law. To examine {{the effect of}} collateral laws on real activity we map the relationship of collateral laws and collateral composition to asset-composition and sectoral resource allocation using industry-level output and employment data. Weak collateralization laws that discourage the use of <b>movables</b> <b>assets</b> as collateral create distortions in the allocation of resources that favor immovable-based production.
