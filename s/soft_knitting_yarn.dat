40|$|Knittability can {{be defined}} as the ability of yarns to run on {{knitting}} machines without problems. Knittability can be achieved when less stress is applied on the knitting machine parts by the <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns.</b> This paper presents a novel measuring system for the knitting force needed to perform <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns</b> on flat <b>knitting</b> machine based on data acquisition system (DAS). The proposed system is used to measure the knitting force at different machine settings and different properties of the <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns</b> to determine the optimal production conditions. For this reason, three types of knitted fabric structures (single jersey, Rib 1 × 1, and full cardigan) with three different loop lengths and five different twists of ply yarn were produced. The obtained results showed the optimal yarn ply twist factor (αe) which gave minimum knitting force (less stress on needles or <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns)</b> at different loop lengths for each structure...|$|R
40|$|Silver-coated <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns</b> {{are used}} in an NCF to {{increase}} the electrical conductivity of CFRP-laminates. A test textile containing section-wise four different <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns</b> has been produced. The threads differ in yarn count and degree of silver-coating. Depending on the yarn’s linear resistance, the conductivity in thickness direction increases by up to two orders of magnitude to > 100 S/m. The in-plane conductivity is significantly higher as well. Combining conductive <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns</b> with conductive toughening interleaves further increases the electrical conductivity. Lightning strike resistance benefits from the conductivity improvement. The damage decreases particularly in the lower fibre layers, e. g. {{at a depth of}} 1. 0 mm by app. 90 %. In spite of the higher laminate conductivity, additional conductive interleaves do not further improve lightning strike resistance. The damage is smaller than in the reference, but larger than in a comparative laminate where only the <b>knitting</b> <b>yarn</b> is conductive...|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} binding off {{method is}} to pass each knitted loop over the loop next to it.

A new method was proposed and discussed for producing hollow yarns at fabric stage (in this case knitted fabric) which involved the following steps: - a) Production of ring spun yarns, comprising nylon as a core and cotton as a sheath, using Ring Spinning System. b) Production of knitted fabrics of different knit structures viz., single jersey, rib and interlock using above mentioned yarn. c) Dissolution of core element i. e.

40|$|The {{recycling}} {{technologies of}} textile industry waste usually are adjusted for materials manufactured of uniform fibers. Unfortunately, usually materials are manufactured of blended chemical and natural fibers to achieve better wearing properties, i. e. abrasion resistance, durability and etc. This paper presents investigation about {{the destruction of}} cotton component and easy separation from non-biodegradable polyester. The pre-treatment (soaking in aqueous solutions of reagents) was carried out at different temperatures for blended <b>knitting</b> <b>yarn</b> (50  % cotton / 50  % polyester) waste. The waste was pre-treated by aqueous solutions of reagents: MgCl 2; Al 2 (SO 4) 3, MgCl 2 and Al 2 (SO 4) 3 mixture, MgCl 2 and citric acid mixture at 20, 50, 90 and 130 °C. After the pre-treatment all samples were dried at 102 °C and heat-treated at different temperatures: 150, 160 and 180 °C. The investigation {{results showed that the}} highest degradation rate (95. 47  %) of cotton component from 50  % cotton / 50  % polyester blended <b>knitting</b> <b>yarn</b> waste  was achieved by using the pre-treatment at 20 °C temperature by aqueous solution of 20  g/l MgCl 2 and 4  g/l Al 2 (SO 4) 3 mixture and heat-treatment of dry samples at 180 °C temperature.
