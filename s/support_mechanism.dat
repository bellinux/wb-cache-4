40|$|How to {{increase}} the rotational speed and decrease vibration of the rotor in the acceleration has become an attractive subject, especially for the vertical rotors. This paper introduces a novel <b>supporting</b> <b>mechanism</b> to make the vertical rotor work at 80000 [*]r/min smoothly. How to design and optimize the sensitive parameters of the <b>supporting</b> <b>mechanism</b> is the core problem to reduce the vibration in passing through critical speeds. Therefore, the FEM (finite element method) considering the gyroscopic couple is introduced to get the dynamic characteristic of the rotor system. The matching principle of {{the upper and lower}} <b>supporting</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the two-degree freedom system is extended to the multiple degree-freedom system, which is applied to optimize the parameters of the <b>supporting</b> <b>mechanism</b> combining with dynamic characteristic of the rotors system.

Using a sample of 404 companies spun off from the 64 Italian Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics universities (STEM universities) over the 2000 - 2007 period, we show that the ULSMs' marginal effect on universities' spin-off productivity may be positive or negative depending on the contribution offered by different LCSMs. Specifically, in any given region, ULSMs complement the legislative support offered to high-tech entrepreneurship whereas they have a substitution effect with regard to the amount of regional social capital, regional financial development, the presence of a regional business incubator, regional public R&D expenses as well as the level of innovative performance in the region. Results support the idea that regional settings' idiosyncrasies should be considered for universities to develop effective spin-off support policies. This paper contributes to the debate on the evaluation of economic policies supporting entrepreneurship.
