25|$|The unique {{feature of}} this whistle is that the tone sounds only with flow through the orifice from outside; it is an {{acoustical}} diode. A cylindrical cavity with a small circular, <b>square-edged</b> hole {{at one end and}} totally open at the other is known to generate a tone when air is passed through it. It is subject to frequency jumps and hysteresis loops similar to the hole tone. There appear to be two stages and the feedback is likely Class II if the tube is short. The fundamental tone occurs near λ=4L, so one characteristic dimension is L, the length of the tube. The characteristic speed U is that of the flow through the hole.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} aisle wall are three {{monument}}s all of white marble on black marble back plates. One is to Mrs Penelope Cholmeley (died 1821 aged 75 years), {{the sister of}} Montague Chomeley. Her remains were interred at Twyford, Middlesex. The monument back plate is straight sided with top and bottom curved and facetted. The raised inscription plaque is oblong with a 45° cut at each corner, over which is a moulded shelf, on which sits an urn with 'cloth' swagging attached and topped with a flambeau. Floriate devices are a boss {{each side of the}} urn, bell flower ribbons hanging from the shelf either side of the plaque, and an oval flower and leaf spray below. The second is a double dedication: firstly to Sir Montague Cholmeley (died 1851 aged 59 years); secondly to Dame Elizabeth, his wife (died 1822), daughter and co-heiress of John Harrison of Norton Place, north from Lincoln. This monument back plate is straight sided with top deeply curved and bottom partly curved. The raised inscription plaque is rectilinear, and sits on a <b>square-edged</b> stepped shelf supported by curved brackets with embossed acanthus decoration, with a device of two strapped palm leaves below. At each side of the plaque is a hanging folded drape attached to a moulded cornice. At each side of the cornice top is a conch shell which provides the holding point for a plain swag that springs from a knot above; between the swagging is a raised cross. The monument was provided by George Wilcox of Piccadilly. Above this monument is one smaller to James Harrison Cholmeley (1808–1854), of a scrolled plaque on a straight sided back plate with a pointed top; above the scroll sits a decorative crest.|$|E
2500|$|Leupung -- {{sometimes}} spelt [...] "Leupueng", {{is a town}} in {{the district}} (Kabupaten/Kota) of Aceh Besar, close {{to the city of}} [...] Banda Aceh, the capital of the special territory of Aceh. The town has been completely obliterated by the tsunami resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Media reports state that the tsunami was directed by seaside limestone cliffs towards the town of Leupung, which had a population of ten thousand. According to reports nothing vertical and <b>square-edged</b> is left, and the estimated number of survivors is between 200 and 700.|$|E
60|$|Scuta {{locked into}} a deep fold in the terga; the latter having a second equally deep fold on the {{opposite}} upper margin. Carina with a prominent, central, <b>square-edged</b> ridge in the upper part: rostrum rudimentary. Latera and peduncle unknown.|$|E
60|$|Terga, as seen internally, irregularly rhomboidal, ending {{downwards}} in a blunt point, {{of which}} the two sides, (neither being sensibly hollowed out,) stand at about an angle of 45° to each other. Scutal margin, with the upper part, (as above remarked,) slightly protuberant: {{near the bottom of}} this margin, there is a very slight projection, answering to the small knob at the baso-tergal angle of the scutum. Externally, towards the basal angle, the narrow strip not concealed by the overlapping of the latera and carina is <b>square-edged,</b> with the zones of growth on it straight.|$|E
60|$|Carina (Pl. VI, fig. 2 b´), simply bowed (i. e., not rectangularly bent), {{with the}} umbo (and {{primordial}} valve) {{seated at the}} upper point; rather massive, narrow, only slightly increasing in width from the upper to the lower end; {{the two sides are}} flat, and at right angles to the roof, which is bordered on each side by a rather broad, square-topped ridge (see section fig. 2 c´), or the roof may be said to have a <b>square-edged</b> furrow running from the apex to the basal margin, and widening downwards; these two ridges have their lines of growth oblique, and hence have a twisted appearance; the central depressed portion of the basal margin, which is square or truncated, descends lower down than the two ridges. The sides of the valve close to the apex are broad, and consist, as I believe, of intra-parietes, as well as of parietes, but these parts are not separated from each other by ridges, as is commonly the case, more especially with the fossil species. I have described the carina in some detail, on account of its resemblance to that of the cretaceous S. fossula, S. trilineatum, and S. quadricarinatum.|$|E

50|$|The veiltail has a {{modified}} deep-and-round ryukin-shaped body, though without the dorsal 'hump' characteristic of ryukins. The {{hallmark of the}} breed is its lengthy and graceful double tail which is <b>square-edged</b> and without any forking or indentation between the lobes.|$|E
50|$|The valve {{is often}} {{described}} as a needle valve, although this is a misnomer. A true needle valve uses a tapered needle in a tapered seat, so as to provide fine control over flow rate. The float valve uses a pointed needle against a <b>square-edged</b> seat, to give a positive shut-off.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940 an {{interesting}} straight-eight Daimler limousine emerged from Lacland Place, the curves replaced by razor edges.

50|$|The {{design of}} press tools is an {{engineering}} compromise. A sharp edge, strength, and durability are ideal, but a sharp edge {{is not very}} strong or durable, so blades for metal work tend to be <b>square-edged</b> rather than knife-edged. Typical workpiece materials include aluminum, brass, bronze, and mild steel because of their outstanding shearability ratings. Stainless steel is not sheared as often due to its tendencies to work-harden.|$|E
50|$|The flow of real gases through {{thin-plate}} orifices never becomes fully choked. The {{mass flow}} rate through the orifice continues to increase as the downstream pressure is lowered to a perfect vacuum, though the {{mass flow rate}} increases slowly as the downstream pressure is reduced below the critical pressure. Cunningham (1951) first {{drew attention to the}} fact that choked flow will not occur across a standard, thin, <b>square-edged</b> orifice.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that the}} float valve of a {{carburettor}} (controlling {{the fuel level}} within the carburettor) is not a needle valve, although it is commonly described as one. It uses a bluntly conical needle, but it seats against a <b>square-edged</b> seat rather than a matching cone. The intention here is to obtain a well-defined seat between two narrow mating surfaces, giving firm shutoff of the flow from only a light float pressure.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{perennial}} herb growing up to 40 centimeters tall {{with one or}} more upright, <b>square-edged</b> stems. The tiny, narrow leaves are linear in shape with rolled edges and are just a few millimeters long. Flowers occur next to the leaves. The corolla has one lower lip and a hoodlike upper lip. It is purple-blue in color with a white spot inside. Blooming occurs in April through July. Blooming is heavier in the seasons after a fire.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant can}} be found on the Brooksville Ridge of Florida in Hernando and Sumter Counties. It is also {{reported}} from Lake County. Its exact abundance is not known because of the lack of recent comprehensive surveys. In 2000 there were seventeen occurrences. This is a rhizomatous perennial herb growing erect, hairy, <b>square-edged</b> stems up to about half a meter tall. The oppositely arranged leaves are up to 7 centimeters long. The flower has tubular purplish corollas about a centimeter long, with lips marked with white.|$|E
50|$|The {{second floor}} is reached by two {{enclosed}} {{flights of stairs}} which rise from {{each side of the}} vestibule at {{the front door of the}} building. The two stairwells are guarded by simple balustrades with square balusters on the second floor. The detailing at this level is simple: window casings are <b>square-edged,</b> and the uncased posts have chamfered edges to a point within a few inches of the ceiling. Walls and ceiling are plastered, and the juncture between the two is finished in a small plastered cove.|$|E

5000|$|On 17 October 1932 Fey joined Dollfuss' {{cabinet in}} {{the rank of}} a state {{secretary}} concerned with public security. He immediately had all conventions of the Social Democrats, the Communists and the Austrian Nazis banned. After the chancellor had suspended the sessions of the National Council, Fey on 15 March 1933 concentrated Heimwehr forces to occupy the Austrian Parliament Building, however, any operation was aborted by the Vienna police. During a parade in May 1933, Major Fey reportedly [...] "knocked three Nazis unconscious with his own ochsenknüttel (<b>square-edged</b> bludgeon)" [...] and promoted Austrian nationalism.|$|E
50|$|Later, and better, {{patterns}} were the Dunlop 'Traction' tread pattern of 1922 and the 'Triple stud' pattern of 1927. These {{followed the same}} principle of a solid central rib with <b>square-edged</b> blocks, but were developed to improve tread wear. The central rib became a thin and almost vestigial rib between square blocks. The side blocks were now isolated from the centre, although linked by another narrow rib, and their {{leading and trailing edges}} formed a trapezium rather than a square. This triple square stud pattern was a successful pattern for narrow tyres, including motorcycles, and remained popular from several manufacturers into the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|Scher {{used the}} {{typeface}} New Rail Alphabet, designed by Margaret Calvert, for its neutral appearance, but replaced its <b>square-edged</b> punctuation with round. The branding concept puts their wordmark in between two big red dots {{on a white}} background. These dots are meant to allude {{to the idea of}} periods, but they are used in a clean and modernist style. The identity also uses copy such as [...] "Periods are not luxuries. Period." [...] to play with the theme. The identity is serious enough for legal work, but also loud and fun, which is necessary when discussing a topic that is normally stigmatized and seen as appropriate to discuss in public.|$|E

5000|$|Campanula trachelium is a {{perennial}} plant {{with one or}} more unbranched, often reddish, <b>square-edged</b> stems that are roughly hairy. The leaves grow alternately up the stems. The lower leaves are long-stalked and ovate with a heart-shaped base. The upper leaves have no stalks and are ovate or lanceolate, hairy with toothed margins. The inflorescence is a one sided spike with a few slightly nodding flowers. Each flower has five sepals which are fused, erect and hairy, and the five violet (or occasionally white) petals are fused into a bell that is hairy inside. There are five stamens and a pistil formed from three fused carpels. The fruit is a hairy, nodding capsule.|$|E
5000|$|The {{constrictor}} {{and double}} constrictor are both extremely secure when tied tightly around [...] objects with cord scaled {{for the task}} at hand. If binding around a not fully convex, or <b>square-edged</b> object, arrange the knot so the overhand knot portion is stretched across a convex portion, or a corner, with the riding turn squarely on top of it. [...] In situations where the object leaves gaps under the knot {{and there are no}} corners, it is possible to finish the constrictor knot off with an additional overhand knot, in the fashion of a reef knot, to help stabilize it. Those recommendations aside, constrictor knots do function best on fully convex objects.|$|E
5000|$|The Wilshire was {{introduced}} in 1959 as a symmetrical, double-cut, solid body guitar with a <b>square-edged</b> body and two P-90 pickups. For the 1963 model year, the guitar was substantially changed to an asymmetrical shape with rounded edges and two alnico mini-humbucker pickups. It remained largely in this configuration {{for the remainder of}} its production run. The Wilshire was reissued from 1982 to 1985 as the Wilshire II and Wilshire III. The Wilshire II had two mini-humbucker pickups and the Wilshire III had three. Epiphone once again reissued the Wilshire beginning in 2009. Several models were introduced: the limited edition Pro, '66 Worn (with or without [...] "tremotone" [...] (tremolo)) and '62 USA. In 2011, Epiphone released the Frank Iero signature Wilshire [...] "Phant-o-Matic".|$|E
50|$|The Olympic torrent {{salamander}} (Rhyacotriton olympicus) is {{a species}} of salamander in the Rhyacotritonidae family. This is a small salamander (up to 10 cm total length) that lives in clear, cold, mountain streams. It is medium to dark brown and may have a few small light spots on the sides and small dark spots on the tail; it is bright yellow on the belly, usually with some dark spots. Torrent salamanders typically have short snouts and relatively large eyes. As in other torrent salamanders, adult males have <b>square-edged</b> lobes behind the cloaca. These salamanders live {{at the edges of}} clear, cold, mountain streams; they can be abundant under gravel at stream edges and in the spray zones of waterfalls. During rainy seasons, they are occasionally found under objects on land away from streams.|$|E
50|$|Deliberate {{shaping of}} moulded tyre tread design, {{rather than merely}} concentrating on a rubber surface that didn't fail rapidly, began {{at the start of}} the 1920s. There was little {{theoretical}} background to this though until the mid-1920s. The 1922 London Motor Show displayed a range of tread patterns that were reported on by The Autocar. Some of these, from Miller and the French firm of , display what would now be recognised as the classic bar grip pattern of sharp-edged transverse bars with a wide central rib. However these were supplied for narrow high-pressure tyres, for use on roads and at relatively high speeds. Their design was based on simple notions of transverse bars giving fore-and-aft traction, without any developed theory of tread design or experimental measurements of their performance. In practice, such <b>square-edged</b> tread blocks wore badly and unevenly, the initially flat blocks tending to wear with a sloping top surface. This wear pattern was one reason for the practicing of rotating tyres between wheels, so that they spent equal periods wearing in each direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{facade of}} the meeting house faces west and is seven bays wide. Window sashes are 16-over-12, with muntin {{profiles}} typical of the Federal period. Exterior window casings are elaborated with flat fillets in place of backhand moldings. The front doorway, {{in the center of}} the facade, is a simple Greek Revival design which undoubtedly dates from 1844, when the structure was altered from its original use as a meeting house to a dual use as a town hall on the first floor and a chapel on the second. This doorway encloses two doors, each having five flat panels surrounded by applied Grecian ogee moldings. Above the doors is a five-light transom sash with thin muntins characteristic of the Greek Revival period. The door casings are wide flat boards with flat strips applied to their inner and outer edges and with flat square corner blocks at the juncture of side and top casings. The water table and corner boards of the building are simple <b>square-edged</b> planks. The front cornice of the meeting house consists of an ovolo bed molding and an ogee crown molding.|$|E
50|$|The veiltail, a name {{coined by}} William T. Innes, {{originated}} in the United States in the 1890s when Franklin Barrett of Philadelphia crossed a Japanese-bred fringetail ryukin to a telescope eye goldfish that exhibited a short, <b>square-edged</b> caudal. According to William Seale this fringetail {{was one of many}} imported by the Wisconsin State Fish Commission for the World's Fair. However, these fish became sick with fungus and were not shown in the 1893 fair. Mr. Seale saved 5 or 6 of these fish and returned home to Philadelphia with them. Mr. Seale then sold one of these fish to Franklin Barrett for $15 and this was the fish Barrett used to cross to a short but square tailed telescope eye goldfish. The telescope eye goldfish used for this cross were obtained as imports by John Cugley of Philadelphia. This resulted in a strain of fish soon to be known throughout the world as Philadelphia veiltails. Although some have suggested that Philadelphia Veiltails died out in America, a man named Al Thomma was able to obtain stock from a John (Andy) W. Anderson of Philadelphia who possessed fish from the original Barrett line. Mr. Anderson worked for Innes Publishing as advertising editor and publisher of The Aquarium Magazine. Through the work of Al Thomma and Al Foster we still have the Philadelphia Veiltail today.|$|E
5000|$|The Native Americans {{were reduced}} to wards of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and {{continued}} to be represented by state-appointed guardians. Rapid acculturation and intermarriage led many to believe the Nipmuc had simply just vanished, due {{to a combination of}} romantic notions of who the Native Americans were and to justify the colonial expansion. [...] Native Americans continued to exist but fewer and fewer were able to live on the dwindling reserve lands and most left to seek employment as domestics or servants in White households, out to sea as whalers or seafarers, or into the growing cities where they became labourers or barbers. [...] Growing acculturation, intermarriage, and dwindling populations led to the extinction of the Natick Dialect of the Massachusett language, and only one speaker could be found in 1798. [...] One of the traditional things that survived was the peddling of native <b>square-edged</b> splint baskets and medicines. [...] The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, after investigating the condition of the Native Americans, decided to grant citizenship to the Native Americans {{with the passage of the}} Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act of 1869, which ultimately led to the sale of any of the remaining lands. Hassanamessit was divided up among a few families. In 1897, the last of the Dudley lands were sold, and the remaining Native Americans were housed in the 'poor house' on Lake Street in Webster, Massachusetts.|$|E
