5000|$|Although a Brahmin lineage, this gotra is {{descended from}} Kshatriya prince of the Suryavansha dynasty {{who was the}} great {{grandson}} of legendary King Mandhatra. Mandhatra was killed by Lavanasura who was killed later by Rama's brother Shatrughna. This is one of ancient India's most prominent and famous lineages, having produced Rama and his 3 brothers (See Genealogy of Rama) and Yadava lineage from Ikshvaku King Haryaswa in which Krishna was born. Jayadratha of Mahabharata also belonged to <b>solar</b> <b>line.</b> The first notable king of the dynasty was Ikshvaku. Other Brahmin gotras from <b>solar</b> <b>line</b> are Vatula, Shatamarshana, Kutsa, Bhadrayana and Vishnuvriddha. Of these Kutsa and Shatamarshana also descend from King Mandhatra like Harita gotra and have either Mandhatra or his sons (Ambarish/Purukutsa) {{as part of their}} Pravaras. The Puranas, a series of Hindu mythological texts, document the story of this dynasty. Harita was separated from Ikshvaku by twenty-first generations.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the curve-of-growth (COG) technique utilized in rocket measurements to determine the line profiles of the solar He I resonance emissions is theoretically examined with attention {{to the possibility of}} determining the line core shape using this technique. The line at 584. 334 A is chosen as an illustration. Various possible source functions of the <b>solar</b> <b>line</b> have been assumed in the computation of the integrated transmitted intensity. A recent observational data set obtained by the present researchers is used as the constraint of the computation. It is confirmed that the COG technique can indeed provide a good measurement of the <b>solar</b> <b>line</b> width. However, to obtain detailed knowledge of the <b>solar</b> profile at <b>line</b> center and in the core region, (1) it is necessary to be able to carry out relative solar flux measurements with a 1 -percent or better precision, and (2) it must be possible to measure the He gas pressure in the absorption cell to lower than 0. 1 mtorr. While these numbers apply specifically to the present geometry, the results are readily scaled to other COG measurements using other experimental parameters...|$|R

40|$|The solar {{spectrum}} {{is a primary}} reference {{for the study of}} physical processes in stars and their variation during activity cycles. In Nov 2010 an experiment with a prototype of a Laser Frequency Comb (LFC) calibration system was performed with the HARPS spectrograph of the 3. 6 m ESO telescope at La Silla during which high signal-to-noise spectra of the Moon were obtained. We exploit those Echelle spectra to study the optical integrated {{solar spectrum}}. The DAOSPEC program is used to measure <b>solar</b> <b>line</b> positions through gaussian fitting in an automatic way. We first apply the LFC solar spectrum to characterize the CCDs of the HARPS spectrograph. The comparison of the LFC and Th-Ar calibrated spectra reveals S-type distortions on each order along the whole spectral range with an amplitude of +/- 40 m/s. This confirms the pattern found by Wilken et al. (2010) on a single order and extends the detection of the distortions to the whole analyzed region revealing that the precise shape varies with wavelength. A new data reduction is implemented to deal with CCD pixel inequalities to obtain a wavelength corrected solar spectrum. By using this spectrum we provide a new LFC calibrated solar atlas with 400 line positions in the range of 476 - 530, and 175 lines in the 534 - 585 nm range. The new LFC atlas improves the accuracy of individual lines by a significant factor reaching a mean value of about 10 m/s. The LFC [...] based <b>solar</b> <b>line</b> wavelengths are essentially free of major instrumental effects and provide a reference for absolute <b>solar</b> <b>line</b> positions. We suggest that future LFC observations could be used to trace small radial velocity changes of the whole solar photospheric spectrum in connection with the solar cycle and for direct comparison with the predicted line positions of 3 D radiative hydrodynamical models of the solar photosphere.

We use a three-dimensional time-dependent hydrodynamical model solar atmosphere which has been tested successfully against observed granulation patterns {{and an array of}} absorption lines. We show that the <b>solar</b> <b>line</b> is a blend with a Nii line, as previously suggested but oftentimes neglected. Thanks to accurate atomic data on the [Oi] and Nii lines we are able to derive an accurate oxygen abundance for the Sun: log ǫ(O) = 8. 69 ± 0. 05 dex, a value {{at the lower end of}} the distribution of previously published abundances, but in good agreement with estimates for the local interstellar medium and hot stars in the solar neighborhood. We conclude by discussing the implication of the Nii blend on oxygen abundances derived from the [Oi] 6300 ˚A line in disk and halo stars...|$|R

Preliminary {{results are consistent}} with slow direct or no rotation at the level sample, and disagree strongly with a 4 -day retrograde rotation. A serious systematic error, which affects much published work, is due to blending of <b>solar</b> <b>lines</b> in the sky with those reflected from the planet. This always tends to produce a spurious retrograde 'rotation'. Only data obtained in a dark sky, or daytime observations from which the sky lines have been accurately subtracted, can be relied upon.

40|$|Hyperspectral imaging {{spectroscopy}} {{has been widely}} used in remote sensing. However, its potential for applications in industrial and biological fields is enormous. Observation <b>line</b> <b>spectrographs,</b> based on the reflectance of the material under study in each field, {{can be obtained by}} means of an imaging spectrometer. In this way, {{imaging spectroscopy}} allows the simultaneous determination of the optical spectrum components and the spatial location of an object in a surface.

In this paper a non-intrusive and non-contact near infrared acquisition system based on a PGP spectrometer is presented. An extension to the whole near infrared range of the spectrum of a previously designed system in the Vis-NIR range has been performed. The reason under this investigation is to improve material characterization. To our knowledge, no imaging spectroscopic system based on a PGP device working in this range has been previously reported. The components of the system, its assembling, alignment and calibration procedures will be described in detail.

40|$|An {{overlooked}} {{systematic error}} {{exists in the}} apparent radial velocities of <b>solar</b> <b>lines</b> reflected from regions of Venus near the terminator, owing {{to a combination of}} the finite angular size of the Sun and its large (2 km/sec) equatorial velocity of rotation. This error produces an apparent, but fictitious, retrograde component of planetary rotation, typically on the order of 40 meters/sec. Spectroscopic, photometric, and radiometric evidence against a 4 -day atmospheric rotation is also reviewed. The bulk of the somewhat contradictory evidence seems to favor slow motions, on the order of 5 m/sec, in the atmosphere of Venus; the 4 -day rotation may be due to a traveling wave-like disturbance, not bulk motions, driven by the UV albedo differences...|$|R
