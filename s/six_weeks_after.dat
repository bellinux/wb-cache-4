5|$|Fruiting begins about <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> {{the initial}} {{inoculation}} on the agar plate, {{but only when}} portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting.

40|$|Background: There are {{numerous}} benefits of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) on {{mother and child}} wellbeing. The objective was {{to find out whether}} depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and personality traits at the time of delivery are associated with EBF <b>six</b> to nine <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> delivery. Subjects and methods: The targeted population were women who delivered in Croatian largest University maternity hospital. The scores of The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), The Big Five Inventory (BFI) and The Impact of Events Scale (revised) – IES-R three to five days after childbirth were measured to predict self-reported EBF status <b>six</b> to nine <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the delivery. <b>Six</b> to nine <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the delivery data on breastfeeding were collected for 259 (69. 6 %) out of initially 372 enrolled women. Results: <b>Six</b> to nine <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the delivery 151 / 259 (58. 3 %) were still exclusively breastfeeding their child. After adjustment for all other variables, women who gave their second childbirth had significantly higher odds for longer EBF than primiparous women (OR= 2. 12; 95 % CI 1. 10 - 4. 10). Higher EPDS result was significantly associated with lower odds for EBF (OR= 0. 92; 95 % CI 0. 85 - 0. 99). Conclusion: Parity and depressed mood immediately after the delivery are associated with EBF <b>six</b> to eight <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the delivery. Depression symptoms are a moderator between parity and exclusive breastfeeding, so multiparous women without depressive symptomatology are more prone for EBF...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare mothers' and teachers' perceptions of the intellectual developmental level of preschool special education students after children were in a program for <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> and again <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Mothers' and teachers' perceptions were also compared to test scores both <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> and <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Demographic variables considered for each hypothesis were child's age, sex, and sibling position, and mother's education, employment, and marital status. Perceptions were considered interview scores from the Developmental Profile II and test scores were those obtained from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [...] Revised. The data were analyzed by correlated t tests with p <. 05 to reject the null hypotheses. Mothers rated their children significantly higher than teachers rated them and higher than test scores both <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> and <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks.</b> Teachers' perceptions <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> did not differ from their perceptions <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> or from test scores except for children 55 months and older, who had higher test scores than teacher ratings <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b> Boys were rated significantly higher by their mothers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b> Children from two-parent families were rated significantly higher by mothers than by teachers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b> High school educated mothers rated children sigificantly higher except in the first comparison to the test scores. Oldest children were rated higher by mothers than by teachers, and in the second comparison between mothers' scores and test scores. Children 54 months and younger were rated higher by their mothers <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks,</b> and in both comparisons of mothers' scores to test scores. Unemployed mothers rated their children higher <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks</b> than teachers rated them, and employed mothers rated children higher <b>after</b> thirty <b>weeks</b> than they did <b>after</b> <b>six</b> <b>weeks.</b> The author believes that further research, focusing on the relationships between parents' and teachers' perceptions is needed to provide guidance for increased cooperation between home in meeting the needs of young special education students...|$|R
