In this study, full scale tests were firstly conducted to determine the ultimate strength of a plain polymer liner and two types of plain <b>steel</b> <b>mesh.</b> In terms of load bearing capacity, it was found that the polymer liner was stronger than the mesh with thinner diameter wire and weaker than the mesh with thicker wire. The liner was much stiffer than both of the two <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> sizes. The polymer and <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> were further loaded with fractured concrete pieces.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The University of Wollongong in {{collaboration}} with the Australian coal mining industry has shown that a viable polymer-based alternative to <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> in underground roadway support applications can be developed to eliminate the use and handling of <b>steel</b> <b>mesh.</b> The feasibility of developing polymeric alternatives to <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> in underground roadway support applications has been established, the physical and material constraints to be endured by any new polymeric skin reinforcement system have been identified by measuring the mechanical properties of <b>steel</b> <b>mesh,</b> and materials that can be spray-applied have been identified. The study has also shown that polymer mechanical properties can be optimised to produce similar mechanical properties (modulus, yield stress, elongation-at-break etc) to <b>steel</b> <b>mesh.</b> The identified materials will allow the face support cycle to be fully automated, or at least remotely operated and installed, enabling the removal of personnel from the immediate face area, thus contributing to a projected substantial improvement in underground roadway development rates...|$|R
40|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>mesh</b> {{is used as}} {{a passive}} skin {{confinement}} medium to supplement the active support provided by rock bolts for roof and rib control in underground coal mines. Thin spray-on liners (TSL) are believed to have the potential {{to take the place of}} <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> as the skin confinement medium in underground mines. To confirm this belief, large scale laboratory experiments were conducted to compare the behaviour of welded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> and a TSL, when used in conjunction with rock bolts, in reinforcing strata with weak bedding planes and strata prone to guttering, two common rock conditions which exist in coal mines. It was found that while the peak load taken by the simulated rock mass with weak bedding planes acting as the control sample (no skin confinement) was 2494 kN, the corresponding value of the sample with 5 mm thick TSL reinforcement reached 2856 kN. The peak load of the <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> reinforced sample was only 2321 kN, but this was attributed to the fact that one of the rock bolts broke during the test. The TSL reinforced sample had a similar post-yield behaviour as the <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> reinforced one. The results of the large scale guttering test indicated that a TSL is better than <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> in restricting rock movement and thus inhibiting the formation of gutters in the roof. 2014...|$|R
30|$|The beams {{reinforced}} with welded wire mesh achieved better cracking performance than those {{reinforced with}} X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> {{regardless of the}} number of reinforcing steel layers and the type of core material. From the results in Tables  2 and 3, the ratio of the first cracking load of the welded wire mesh beams to that of the X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> beams was 1.12, 1.33, 1.4, 1.2, 1.19 for (WSC/ESC), (WDC/EDC), (WSB/ESB), (WSS/ESS), and (WSR/ESR) respectively. The better performance of the beams reinforced with welded wire mesh could be attributed to the material properties of the two types of <b>steel</b> <b>meshes</b> which resulted in higher tensile strength of the mortar-mesh composite for the case of welded wire mesh in comparison to that of the X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> as explained in Eqs.

Results indicate that deformation is tiny when <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> maintains as an overall ring, and stress caused by vertical bending moment and tension of bottom tie wire are also in the safe range. However, axial forces of lap reinforcement in adjacent <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> exceed the ultimate bearing capacity of tie wire. Hence, tie wires are ruptured; single mesh loses lateral connection and turns into monolithic status as the destruction of overall structure. Further more, monolithic <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> is led to collapse by the damage of bottom connection. So, in order to prevent connection failure and enhance installation security, the overlapping parts of <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> should be taken more reliable measures.

40|$|The {{resource}} utilization {{and direct}} application of sea sand in construction engineering {{is a hot}} topic of interest. In {{order to avoid the}} problem of steel corrosion in the sea sand concrete, basalt fiber reinforced plastic (BFRP) <b>mesh</b> instead of <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> to reinforce sea sand mortar thin plate was considered. This novel thin plate resulted in a structural performance clearly superior to that of a <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> thin plate. In this paper, the durability performance was investigated for both natural indoor environments and wet-dry environments. The experimental results showed that the tensile strength of the BFRP mesh thin plate varied slightly, the bending strength decreased significantly, and the ductility improved after 1 year indoor environmental exposure, which is marginally better than that of the <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> thin plate. Subjected to wet-dry environments in a salt solution for 1 year, however, the tensile strength, flexural strength and ductility of the BFRP mesh thin plate were all significantly decreased.

40|$|A <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> {{can improve}} the tensile {{strength}} and stability of a polyethylene (PE) pipe in a water supply pipeline system.

In order to analyze {{the influence of the}} <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> on the shock wave speed and transient response processes, an improved wave speed formula is proposed by incorporating the equivalent elastic modulus. A field measurement validates the wave speed formula. Moreover, the transient wave propagation and extreme pressures are simulated and compared by the method of characteristics (MOC) for reinforced PE pipes with various steel-mesh densities. Results show that a <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> can significantly increase the shock wave speed in a PE pipe and thus can cause severe peak pressure and hydraulic surges in a water supply pipeline system.

However, {{the results show that}} the welded wire mesh achieved higher ultimate load in comparison to those of the X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh.</b> Comparing the results of specimens (WSC) with (ESC), (WSS) with (ESS), and (WSR) with (ESR) shows that the ultimate load was higher by 18, 12, and 19  % respectively. This could be attributed to the higher ultimate strength of the welded wire mesh in comparison to that of the X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> as mentioned in Sect. 2.1. The slight variation in the percentage of increase in the ultimate load could be attributed to the slight difference in the ultimate strength of the concrete and mortar of the different beams. For the case of double reinforcing layers, the ultimate load of specimen (WDC) was higher than that of (EDC) by about 35  %. The ultimate load of specimen (WSB) was higher than that of (ESB) by about 88  %. This large percentage of increase in the ultimate load for this type of core material {{is due to the fact}} that specimen (ESB) failed due shear as X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> was insufficient for providing the shear strength together with the weak lightweight brick while specimen (WSB) reached its ultimate flexural strength.|$|R
30|$|The test beams {{were divided}} into eleven groups and each group {{contained}} three identical specimens. Group number 1 is the control group in which the beams were cast using ordinary formwork. The beams in this group were reinforced with 2 ϕ 12  mm {{high tensile strength steel}} bars at the tension side and 2 ϕ 12  mm high tensile strength steel bars at the compression side as well as shear reinforcement (stirrups) of Ø 8  mm at 200  mm spacing. The beams incorporating reinforced mortar forms were grouped according to the mesh type, number of <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> layers, type of core material, and shear connection method. For all the beams incorporating precast reinforced mortar forms, the core of material was reinforced with two high tensile strength steel bars of 12  mm diameter in the tension side only. Neither reinforcing bars at the compression side nor stirrups were used in these groups. Two types of <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> were used to reinforce the U-shaped forms namely; welded wire mesh and X 8 expanded <b>steel</b> <b>mesh.</b> Single or double layers of the <b>steel</b> <b>mesh</b> were used as shown in Table  1.
