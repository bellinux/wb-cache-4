40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} period {{doublings}} for one-parameter families of iterated real mappings is generalized to period n-tuplings for complex mappings. An n-tupling {{occurs when the}} eigenvalue of a stable periodic orbit passes through the value ω = exp(2 τπm/n) as the parameter value is changed. Each choice of m defines a different sequence of rc-tuplings, for which we construct a period ft-tupling renormalization operator with a universal fixpoint function, a universal unstable manifold and universal <b>scaling</b> <b>numbers.</b> These <b>scaling</b> <b>numbers</b> can be organized by Farey trees. The present paper gives a general description and numerical support for the universality conjectured above...|$|R

40|$|Fifty-five metrics of {{landscape}} pattern and structure {{were calculated for}} 85 maps of land use and land cover. A multivariate factor {{analysis was used to}} identify the common axes (or dimensions) of pattern and structure which were measured by a reduced set of 26 metrics. The first six factors explained about 87 % of the variation in the 26 landscape metrics. These factors were interpreted as composite measures of average patch compaction, overall image texture, average patch shape, patch perimeter-area <b>scaling,</b> <b>number</b> of attribute classes, and large-patch density-area scaling. We suggest that these factors can be represented in a simpler way by six univariate metrics - average perimeter-area ratio, contagion, standardized patch shape, patch area <b>scaling,</b> <b>number</b> of attribute classes, and large-patch density-area scaling...|$|R
