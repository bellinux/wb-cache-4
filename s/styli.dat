25|$|Vinyl {{pressings}} {{were made}} with stampers from master cuts that were electroplated in vacuo by means of gold sputtering. Audio response was claimed out to 8,000Hz, later 13,000Hz, using light weight pickups employing jeweled <b>styli.</b> Amplifiers and cutters both using negative feedback were employed thereby improving the range of frequencies cut and lowering distortion levels. Radio transcription producers such as World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers (AMP) were the dominant licensees of the Western Electric wide range system and {{towards the end of}} the 1930s were responsible for two-thirds of the total radio transcription business.

25|$|The {{brothers}} also founded an academy, initially led by Methodius, {{which produced}} hundreds of Slavic clerics. A well-educated class was essential for administration of all early-feudal states and Great Moravia was no exception. Vita Methodii mentions bishop of Nitra as Svatopluk I's chancellor and even Prince Koceľ of the Balaton Principality {{was said to}} master the Glagolitic script. Location of the Great Moravian academy has not been identified, but the possible sites include Mikulčice (where some <b>styli</b> {{have been found in}} an ecclesiastical building), Devín Castle (with a building identified as a probable school), and Nitra (with its Episcopal basilica and monastery). When Methodius’ disciples were expelled from Great Moravia by Svätopluk I in 885, they disseminated their knowledge (including the Glagolitic script) to other Slavic countries, such as Bulgaria, Croatia, and Bohemia. They created the Cyrillic script, which became the standard alphabet in the Kievan Rus' (modern day Russia, Ukraine and Belarus). The Great Moravian cultural heritage survived in Bulgarian seminaries, paving the way for Christianization of Kievan Rus'.|$|E
25|$|Modern Archaeognatha and Thysanura {{still have}} {{rudimentary}} appendages on their abdomen called <b>styli,</b> while more primitive and extinct insects known as Monura {{had much more}} developed abdominal appendages. The abdominal and thoracic segments in the earliest terrestrial ancestor of the insects {{would have been more}} similar to each other than they are today, and the head had well-developed compound eyes and long antennae. Their body size is not known yet. As the most primitive group today, Archaeognatha, is most abundant near the coasts, it could mean that {{this was the kind of}} habitat where the insect ancestors became terrestrial. But this specialization to coastal niches could also have a secondary origin, just as could their jumping locomotion, as it is the crawling Thysanura who are considered to be most original (plesiomorphic). By looking at how primitive cheliceratan book gills (still seen in horseshoe crabs) evolved into book lungs in primitive spiders and finally into tracheae in more advanced spiders (most of them still have a pair of book lungs intact as well), it is possible the trachea of insects was formed in a similar way, modifying gills at the base of their appendages.|$|E

The statistical results showed that participants preferred the traditional pen in all criteria. Because of inconvenient hand movements, the mobile <b>stylus</b> was the least preferred on every task.

500|$|Because of the {{volatility}} and extreme toxicity of its oxide, osmium is rarely used in its pure state, but is instead often alloyed with other metals. Those alloys are utilized in high-wear applications. Osmium alloys such as osmiridium are very hard and, {{along with other}} platinum-group metals, {{are used in the}} tips of fountain pens, instrument pivots, and electrical contacts, as they can resist wear from frequent operation. They were also used for the tips of phonograph <b>styli</b> during the late 78 rpm and early [...] "LP" [...] and [...] "45" [...] record era, circa 1945 to 1955. Although very durable compared to steel and chromium needle points, osmium-alloy tips wore out far more rapidly than competing, and costlier, sapphire and diamond tips and were discontinued.|$|E

They retailed at a launch price of £49.95 each but both had notable flaws. The RAM pack was top-heavy and was supported only by the edge connector. It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81, losing anything that the user had typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, double-sided tape or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the [...] "RAM pack wobble" [...] problem. The ZX Printer was a tiny spark printer that used two electrically charged <b>styli</b> to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1931, RCA Victor {{introduced}} their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as {{a material}} for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. One such was a 16-inch, rpm record {{used by the}} Vitaphone sound-on-disc movie system. In 1932, RCA began using Victrolac in their [...] "home recording" [...] system, with which people could record their own voices at home. By {{the end of the}} 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability, and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground <b>styli</b> made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some Red Seal classical 78s, at a De luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic, and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce [...] "unbreakable" [...] children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.|$|E

50|$|Several {{technologies}} {{were used}} to record the sounds, beginning with wax cylinders, {{almost half a century}} before the invention of the magnetic cartridge. Nowadays mostly vinyl records are used. When playing the record, the <b>stylus</b> is placed in the grooves of the record. By then spinning the record, the <b>stylus</b> start to vibrate caused by the shape of the grooves. These vibrations are then converted by the cartridge. The harder the material used for the record, the harder the <b>stylus</b> has to be in order to increase the quality of the sound and to decrease the wear of the needle. For shellac records, a disposable <b>stylus</b> softer than the record was generally preferred for preservation of the recording. The <b>styluses</b> for playing vinyl records are made out of Sapphire or diamond. There are two common types of stylus: elliptical and spherical. Each contacts the groove differently than the other; the elliptical <b>stylus</b> allows for more groove contact, which increases fidelity, while the spherical <b>stylus</b> makes less contact with the groove, which yields a more sensitive <b>stylus.</b>|$|R
