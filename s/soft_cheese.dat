2500|$|Academics {{and experts}} have {{suggested}} that China is in a league of its own {{compared to the other}} BRIC countries. As David Rothkopf wrote in Foreign Policy, [...] "Without China, the BRICs are just the BRI, a bland, <b>soft</b> <b>cheese</b> that is primarily known for the whine [...] that goes with it. China is the muscle of the group and the Chinese know it. They have effective veto power over any BRIC initiatives because without them, who cares really? They are the one with the big reserves. They are the biggest potential market. They are the U.S. partner in the G2 (imagine the coverage a G2 meeting gets vs. a G8 meeting) and the E2 (no climate deal without them) and so on." [...] Deutsche Bank Research said in a report that [...] "economically, financially and politically, China overshadows and will continue to overshadow the other BRICs". It added that China's economy is larger than that of the three other BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia and India) combined. Moreover, China's exports and its official foreign-exchange reserves are more than twice as large as those of the other BRICs combined. In that perspective, some pension investment experts have argued that [...] "China alone accounts for more than 70% of the combined GDP growth generated by the BRIC countries : if there is a BRIC miracle it's first and foremost a Chinese one". The [...] "growth gap" [...] between China and other large emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia and India can be attributed to a large extent to China's early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects: while China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American and South Asian economies suffered from various development bottlenecks (poor transportation, aging power grids, mediocre schools).|$|E

With {{the point of this}} he drew a circle of about seven feet in diameter; and so well accustomed was he to this operation that his circle, we believe, could not have been mended even by a pair of compasses. Two feet to one side of this circle he drew a smaller one, of about four feet in diameter. Next, he cut out of the snow a number of hard blocks, which were so tough that they could not be broken without a severe blow, but were as easily cut as you might have sliced a <b>soft</b> <b>cheese</b> with a sharp knife. These blocks he arranged round the large circle, and built them above each other, fashioning them, as he proceeded, in such a manner that they gradually rose into the form of a dome. The chinks between them he filled compactly with soft snow, and the last block, introduced into the top of the structure, was formed exactly on the principle of the key-stone of an arch. When the large dome was finished, he commenced the smaller; {{and in the course of}} two hours both the houses--or, as the Esquimaux call them, igloos--were completed.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{ability of}} Listeria monocytogenes {{to survive and}} grow at high salt {{concentrations}} and low pH makes it a potential hazard after the consumption of milk and dairy products, often implicated in severe outbreaks of listeriosis. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the behaviour of L. monocytogenes in traditional acid and salted Italian-style <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses</b> and to investigate whether Listeria occurrence and growth in these environments may represent a potential increase of hazard. Methods and Results: A first approach was addressed to in vitro evaluate survival, acid tolerance response, ability to produce biofilm, and capability to invade intestinal-like cells of a L. monocytogenes strain grown under experimental conditions mimicking environmental features that this pathogen encounters in <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses</b> (such as acid pH and high NaCl content). A second set of experiments was performed to monitor, during the storage at 4 degrees C, the survival of acid-adapted and nonadapted Listeriae in artificially contamined <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Both acid tolerance response and invasion efficiency of acid-adapted bacteria resulted in an increase, even when bacteria were simultaneously pre-exposed to increasing salt stress. The contamination of cheeses with acid-adapted and nonadapted bacteria evidenced in all products a good survival. A significant increased survival, the recovery of bacterial cells highly resistant to lethal pH exposure, and the prevalence of filamentous structures were observed in crescenza cheese during the storage. Conclusions: The Listeria survival and acid pH tolerance observed during refrigerated storage are probably related to the intrinsic acid and saline features of <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses</b> analysed. Significance and Impact of the Study: Italian <b>soft</b> <b>cheeses</b> tested may represent a potential hazard for the recovery of acid-adapted L. monocytogenes cells with enhanced ability to adhere to inert surfaces and/or to penetrate host cells...|$|R
