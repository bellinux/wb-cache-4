40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} model sets in commutative spaces, i. e. homogeneous {{spaces of the}} form G/K where G is a (typically non-abelian) locally compact group and K is a compact subgroup such that (G, K) is a Gelfand pair. Examples include model sets in hyperbolic spaces, Riemannian symmetric spaces, regular trees and generalized Heisenberg groups. Continuing our work from BHP 1 we associate with every regular model set in G/K a Radon measure on K G/K called its spherical auto-correlation. We then define the <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> of the regular model set as the spherical Fourier transform of its spherical auto-correlation {{in the sense of}} Gelfand pairs. The main result of this article ensures that the <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> of a uniform regular model set in a commutative space is pure point. In fact, we provide an explicit formula for the <b>spherical</b> <b>diffraction</b> of such a model set in terms of the automorphic spectrum of the underlying lattice and the underlying window. To describe the coefficients appearing in this formula, we introduce a new type of integral transform for functions on the internal space of the model set. This integral transform {{can be seen as a}} shadow of the spherical Fourier transform of physical space in internal space and is hence referred to as the shadow transform of the model set. To illustrate our results we work out explicitly several examples, including the case of model sets in the Heisenberg group. Comment: Formerly part of arXiv: 1602. 08928.

40|$|The Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization Complex Mask Coronagraph (PIAACMC) {{provides}} an {{efficient way to}} control <b>diffraction</b> <b>propagation</b> effects caused by the central obstruction/segmented mirrors of the telescope. PIAACMC can be optimized in a way that takes into account both chromatic diffraction effects caused by the telescope obstructed aperture and tip/tilt sensitivity of the coronagraph. As a result, unlike classic PIAA, the PIAACMC mirror shapes are often slightly asymmetric even for an on-axis configuration and require more care in calculating off-axis shapes when an off-axis configuration is preferred. A method to design off-axis PIAA mirror shapes given an on-axis mirror design is presented. The algorithm is based on geometrical ray tracing and is able to calculate off-axis PIAA mirror shapes for an arbitrary geometry of the input and output beams. The method is demonstrated using the third generation PIAACMC design for WFIRST-AFTA (Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope-Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets) telescope.

40|$|Properly apodized pupils {{can deliver}} point spread {{functions}} (PSFs) free of Airy rings, and {{are suitable for}} high dynamical range imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets (ETPs). To reach this goal, classical pupil apodization (CPA) unfortunately requires most of the light gathered by the telescope to be absorbed, resulting in poor throughput and low angular resolution. Phaseinduced amplitude apodization (PIAA) of the telescope pupil (Guyon 2003) combines the advantages of classical pupil apodization (particularly low sensitivity to low order aberrations) with full throughput, no loss of angular resolution and little chromaticity, which makes it, theoretically, an extremely attractive coronagraph for direct imaging of ETPs. The two most challenging aspects of this technique are (1) the difficulty to polish the required optics shapes and (2) <b>diffraction</b> <b>propagation</b> effects which, because of their chromaticity, can decrease the spectral bandwidth of the coronagraph. We show that a properly designed hybrid system combining classical apodization with the PIAA technique can solve both problems simultaneously. For such a system, the optics shapes can be well within today’s optics manufacturing capabilities, and the 10 − 10 PSF contrast at ≈ 1. 5 λ/D required for efficient imaging of ETPs can be maintained over the whole visible spectrum. This updated design of the PIAA coronagraph maintains the high performance of the earlier design, since {{only a small part}} of the light is lost in the classical apodizer(s).

The <b>diffraction</b> <b>propagation</b> losses due to mountain peaks are calculated for the receivers in Madrid urban area.

The results show that for a near surface receiver (1. 5 m above the ground) in Madrid, interference signal powers received are less than - 135 dBm, which is far below the - 109 dBm, the IMT- 2000 wireless phone threshold. When a receiver is located at about 40 m above the ground (e. g., the top of Clock Tower of Cibeles Palace), diffraction will generate interference power less than - 115 dBm.
