40|$|The BBL ™ Gram Slide is {{used for}} {{evaluating}} and controlling the quality of Gram <b>stain</b> <b>reagents</b> and techniques. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Quality control procedures are performed to help ensure that the information reported by laboratories is accurate, reliable and reproducible.

PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE Prepared slides containing known quality control cultures (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC ™ 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922) are used to test Gram <b>stain</b> <b>reagents</b> and <b>staining</b> technique. As a result, variables that could cause incorrect test results may be detected and corrected.

5000|$|The name [...] "gentian violet" [...] (or Gentianaviolett in German) {{is thought}} to have been {{introduced}} by the German pharmacist Georg Grübler, who in 1880 started a company in Leipzig that specialized in the sale of <b>staining</b> <b>reagents</b> for histology. The gentian violet stain marketed by Grübler probably contained a mixture of methylated pararosaniline dyes. The stain proved popular and in 1884 was used by Hans Christian Gram to stain bacteria. He credited Paul Ehrlich for the aniline-gentian violet mixture. Grübler's gentian violet was probably very similar, if not identical, to Lauth's methyl violet, which had been used as a stain by Victor André Cornil in 1875.|$|E
50|$|The Streptamer {{technique}} {{enables a}} reversible identification and purification of antigen specific T cell population at 4 °C, thus {{it does not}} affect the functional status of the cells.The addition of a Strep-tag competitor, d-biotin, results in the rapid disassembly of MHC multimers. Subsequently, the dissociation of monomeric MHC-peptide molecules from the T cell surface takes place. Therefore, this method comprises the advantages of conventional MHC multimer staining procedures, but it further allows removal of the <b>staining</b> <b>reagents</b> before negative effects of ligand-binding can begin to take place. The Streptamer technology is not only especially suited for clinical applications because of the reversibility of the TCR-MHC interaction, furthermore two other requirements are fulfilled. First, d-biotin (also known as vitamin H) is non-toxic for T-cells in low concentrations, which are used for Streptamer disassembly. Second, the amount of d-biotin that might be transferred with Streptamer isolated T-cells are far lower than d-biotin concentrationsfound in conventional vitamin supplementations, thus, unlikely to be harmful.|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanism}} of neutralization of virus infectivity by antibody is described {{and related to}} the immune defences in vivo.

40|$|Many of the {{difficulties}} of staining plastic embedded tissues for light and electron microscopy derive from physical exclusion of hydrophilic <b>staining</b> <b>reagents</b> by hydrophobic embedding media. Structures which stain most intensely with hydrophilic reagents usually contain less hydrophobic plastic than do non-staining structures. Such incomplete infiltration is apparently caused by exclusion of viscous, hydrophobic monomers by physically dense and/or well hydrated tissue elements. In keeping with this, generalized staining of tissues embedded in hydrophobic media does occur when hydrophobic reagents are used. Staining of plastic-free structures with single hydrophilic reagents or with sequences of such reagents, is, however, largely rate-controlled. The surprising similarity of hydrophilic and hydrophobic plastic embedding media is discussed.
