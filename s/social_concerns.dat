5|$|Like their {{previous}} tours, The Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and U2 used this outlet for addressing political and <b>social</b> <b>concerns.</b> One such issue was Arizona Governor Evan Mecham's canceling the state's observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Throughout the tour, the group continued to explore American roots music: they collaborated with folk artist Bob Dylan, blues musician B. B. King, and Harlem's New Voices of Freedom gospel choir; U2 also visited Graceland and Sun Studios in Memphis, where they recorded new material. These new songs and the band's experiences on tour were documented for the 1988 Rattle and Hum album and Phil Joanou-directed motion picture.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, the {{shipyard}} workers began their strike, {{organized by the}} Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża). The workers were led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, a former shipyard worker who had been dismissed in 1976, and who arrived at {{the shipyard}} late {{in the morning of}} August 14. The strike committee demanded the rehiring of Walentynowicz and Wałęsa, as well as the according of respect to workers' rights and other <b>social</b> <b>concerns.</b> In addition, they called for the raising of a monument to the shipyard workers who had been killed in 1970 and for the legalization of independent trade unions.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{intellectual}} pursuits, the gentry exhibited {{habits and}} cultured hobbies which marked their social status and refinement. The erudite term of enjoying {{the company of}} the 'nine guests' (九客, jiuke)—an extension of the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar—was a metaphor for accepted gentry pastimes of playing the Chinese zither, playing Chinese chess, Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine. The painted artwork of the gentry shifted dramatically in style from Northern to Southern Song, due to underlying political, demographic, and social circumstance. Northern Song gentry and officials, who were concerned largely with tackling issues of national interest and not much for local affairs, preferred painting huge landscape scenes where any individuals were but tiny figures immersed within a larger context. During the Southern Song, political, familial, and <b>social</b> <b>concerns</b> became heavily embedded with localized interests; these changes correlate with the chief style of Southern Song paintings, where small, intimate scenes with a primary focus on individuals was emphasized.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on <b>social</b> <b>concerns,</b> behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E

5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related <b>social</b> <b>concerns</b> were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E
5|$|White middle-class Indiana women learned {{organizational}} skills through the suffrage and temperance movements. By the 1890s they were applying their new {{skills to the}} needs of their home communities, by organizing women's clubs, the combined literary activity with social activism focused on such needs as public health, sanitation, and good schools. Hoosier women worked at both {{the state and local level}} to materialize Progressive Era reforms. In Lafayette, for example, the suffragists concentrated in the Lafayette Franchise League, while those oriented toward <b>social</b> <b>concerns</b> worked through the Lafayette Charity Organization Society (LCOS), the Free Kindergarten and Industrial School Association (FKISA), and the Martha Home. Albion Fellows Bacon led statewide and national efforts at housing reform. A native of Evansville, Bacon worked to pass tenement and housing legislation in Indiana in 1909, 1913, and 1917. She also held leadership roles in Indiana Child Welfare Association; the Child Welfare Committee, a part of the Women's Section of the Indiana State Council of Defense; the Indiana Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Juvenile Advisory Commission of Indiana's Probation Department.

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the development of moral behavior and the development of verbal regulatory processes. Relational frame theory and the distinctions among pliance, tracking, and augmenting forms of rule governance are applied to the domain of moral behavior and its development, in order to identify the specific social and verbal contingencies that are responsible for an evolving moral repertoire. It is argued that moral behavior is controlled by relational and rule-following repertoires, and that these can be arranged into a rough progression: pliance, tracking, augmenting, <b>social</b> <b>concern</b> for pliance, <b>social</b> <b>concern</b> for tracking, and <b>social</b> <b>concern</b> for augmenting. Congruence with data derived from other research traditions is examined, and applied implications are explored...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} evangelism and <b>social</b> <b>concern</b> in {{the theology of}} Carl F. H. Henry. Henry stands not only {{as the most important}} figure in the re-awakening of evangelical <b>social</b> <b>concern,</b> but also a leading thinker among Evangelicals on the theological foundations that should guide this movement in its life and practice. Henry, building on the work of Abraham Kuyper (although with some significant differences), sought to recapture the Reformed emphasis on a worldview approach to the Christian faith. Thus, Henry emerges as a key and oddly understudied figure in the re-awakening of evangelical social action. Yet, his balanced approach upholds the necessity of personal regeneration, thereby prioritizing evangelism, as the key to both a theology of evangelism and a theology of <b>social</b> <b>concern.</b> In doing so, however, he moves past fundamentalist malaise in the social arena and overcomes liberal and neo-orthodox ambiguities about sin and redemptive religion. Furthermore, Henry also offers a corrective to some holistic mission advocates who too closely equivocate evangelism and <b>social</b> <b>concern</b> and thereby minimize important distinctions. The key theological feature in Henry 2 ̆ 7 s prioritizing evangelism {{turns out to be the}} doctrine of revelation. Though most other approaches to this issue focus either entirely or mostly on the Kingdom of God, a doctrine also important to Henry, Henry differs by emphasizing that understanding, entering, and embodying the Kingdom depends foremost on the doctrine of revelation and its primary place in knowing and following the will of God. As such, Henry 2 ̆ 7 s model, defined as a regeneration approach to evangelism and <b>social</b> <b>concern,</b> offers hope for an Evangelical consensus on this issue...|$|R

Her novels repeatedly show how a young heroine can improve a corrupt society through her moral influence.|$|E
