5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} {{different aspects}} of the Eye. The juxtaposed deities often stand for the procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet <b>sometimes</b> <b>do.</b> Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E

5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV power lines traverse the vast expanses of taiga and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain {{that the power}} lines cross is {{for the most part}} not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV power lines, one in the north and one in the south, connect all six power lines along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} roughly in two parts. The first deals with whether {{know-how}} is constituted by propositional knowledge, as discussed primarily by Gilbert Ryle (1949) The concept of mind. London: Hutchinson, Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson (2001). Knowing how. Journal of Philosophy, 98, pp. 411 - 444 {{as well as}} Stephen Hetherington (2006). How to know that knowledge-that is knowledge-how. In S. Hetherington (Ed.) Epistemology futures. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The conclusion of this first part is that know-how <b>sometimes</b> <b>does</b> and <b>sometimes</b> <b>does</b> not consist in propositional knowledge. The second part defends an analysis of know-how inspired by Katherine Hawley 2 ̆ 7 (2003). Success and knowledge-how. American Philosophical Quarterly, 40, pp. 19 - 31, insightful proposal that know-how requires counterfactual success. I conclude by showing how this analysis helps to explain why know-how <b>sometimes</b> <b>does</b> and <b>sometimes</b> <b>does</b> not consist of propositional knowledge...|$|R
25|$|In the United States, {{only eight}} states have an {{official}} name change {{for a man}} {{as part of their}} marriage process and others may petition a court or—where not prohibited—use the common law method (though government agencies <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> not recognize this procedure for men). Due to the widespread practice of women changing their names at marriage, they encounter little difficulty using the common law method at marriage in those jurisdictions that permit it.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid {{design of}} the sled-foot trestle and the post and rail styles can work well. Instead of an 'I' structure, the sled foot is moved up to become a rail - sort of an 'H' with a bar across the top. This puts end-grain on the floor, but it is {{otherwise}} a strong design and somewhat easier to build. Plus, the feet don't {{get in the way}} of the work as sled-feet <b>sometimes</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mathematics and {{geometry}} describe abstract {{objects that}} sometimes correspond to familiar shapes, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> not. Circles, triangles, rectangles, {{and so forth}} describe two-dimensional shapes that are often found in the real world. However, mathematical formulas do not describe individual physical circles, triangles, or rectangles. They describe ideal shapes that are objects of the mind. The incredible precision of mathematical expression permits a vast applicability of mental abstractions to real life situations.|$|E

Furthermore, when females are constantly moving around to avoid violent males, they {{are not able to}} form female social ties (for example, Grévy's zebra/Equus grevyi). This also happens in species where herding males <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> not permit females to join their family in different groups, like in hamadryas baboons.|$|E
25|$|Yogo sapphires <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> {{not need}} heat {{treating}} because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep, {{they are generally}} free of the characteristic inclusions, and they have high uniform clarity. When Intergem Limited began marketing the Yogo in the 1980s as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire, heat treatment was not commonly disclosed; by 1982 the heat treatment became a major issue. At that time, 95% of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. This issue appeared as a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal on 29 August 1984 in an article by Bill Richards, Carats and Schticks: Sapphire Marketer Upsets The Gem Industry.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of snake bites {{can involve}} wearing {{protective}} footwear, avoiding areas where snakes live, and not handling snakes. Treatment partly {{depends on the}} type of snake. Washing the wound with soap and water and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom, cutting the wound with a knife, or using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however, antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends {{on the type of}} snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown, antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world getting the right type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> not work. An additional issue is the cost of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person's breathing is sometimes also required.|$|E

500|$|Although verbal {{report is}} in {{practice}} the [...] "gold standard" [...] for ascribing consciousness, {{it is not}} the only possible criterion. [...] In medicine, consciousness is assessed as a combination of verbal behavior, arousal, brain activity and purposeful movement. [...] The last three of these can be used as indicators of consciousness when verbal behavior is absent. [...] The scientific literature regarding the neural bases of arousal and purposeful movement is very extensive. [...] Their reliability as indicators of consciousness is disputed, however, due to numerous studies showing that alert human subjects can be induced to behave purposefully in a variety of ways in spite of reporting a complete lack of awareness. [...] Studies of the neuroscience of free will have also shown that the experiences that people report when they behave purposefully <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> not correspond to their actual behaviors or to the patterns of electrical activity recorded from their brains.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{eighteen}} years after Bart's House of Weirdness [...] was released, 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey reviewed {{the game in}} 1UP's official Retro Gaming Blog. He praised the game for its graphics, but was critical of the gameplay. Mackey wrote that [...] "the graphics are far more impressive than any other Simpsons title at the time, outside of the arcade brawler. In fact, the graphics alone were responsible for my childlike [...] excitement over House of Weirdness; [...] they're pretty lush — even if they're not entirely faithful to the show. Bart's PC translation might be just a little off-model, but it's a gigantic leap over his duck-like visage seen on the NES." [...] He added, however, that the game [...] "is completely unintuitive, your goals aren't made clear, it's never certain if you're doing the right thing, and you're often locked into screens with no apparent way out but death." [...] Mackey also criticized the levels' structure that [...] "seems more generated than anything" [...] {{and the fact that}} the [...] "big, beautiful" [...] sprites <b>sometimes</b> <b>do</b> not move well.|$|E
