Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and <b>streptokinase.</b> Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E

25|$|Proper CVD {{management}} necessitates a {{focus on}} MI and stroke cases due to their combined high mortality rate, keeping in mind the cost-effectiveness of any intervention, especially in developing countries with low or middle income levels. Regarding MI, strategies using aspirin, atenolol, <b>streptokinase</b> or tissue plasminogen activator have been compared for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in regions of low and middle income. The costs for a single QALY for aspirin, atenolol, <b>streptokinase,</b> and t-PA were $25, $630–$730, and $16,000, respectively. Aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and statins used together for secondary CVD prevention in the same regions showed single QALY costs of $300–400.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{thrombolytic}} agent being used, additional anticoagulation with heparin or {{low molecular}} weight heparin may be of benefit. With tPa and related agents (reteplase and tenecteplase), heparin is {{needed to keep the}} coronary artery open. Because of the anticoagulant effect of fibrinogen depletion with <b>streptokinase</b> and urokinase treatment, it is less necessary there.|$|E
25|$|Several toxins and {{secreted}} enzymes {{have been}} identified in Streptococcus dysgalactiae, including the haemolysins Streptolysin O (SLO) and Streptolysin S (SLS), and a correlation between the expression of SLO and SLS and disease severity has been inferred. speGdys, a homolog of the S.pyogenes superantigen speG, has been documented in some S.dysgalactiae strains. However, it only appears to possess superantigen-capabilities in animals, and its relevance in human disease has yet to be elucidated. <b>Streptokinase</b> appears to be ubiquitous in S.dysgalactiae, enabling fibrinolysis and aiding in bacterial spreading through tissues.|$|E
25|$|The {{coagulation}} system {{overlaps with}} the immune system. Coagulation can physically trap invading microbes in blood clots. Also, some {{products of the}} coagulation system {{can contribute to the}} innate immune system by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as chemotactic agents for phagocytic cells. In addition, some of the products of the coagulation system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, an amino acid produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a cationic detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the coagulation system. In addition, pathogenic bacteria may secrete agents that alter the coagulation system, e.g. coagulase and <b>streptokinase.</b>|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} to prepare {{bioactive}} molecules such as <b>Streptokinase</b> from the bacterium Streptococcus, Cyclosporin A from the ascomycete fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, and [...] statins produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus.|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} for many {{commercial}} and industrial purposes, including the production of chemicals, enzymes and other bioactive molecules, often through protein engineering. For example, acetic acid is produced by the [...] bacterium Acetobacter aceti, while citric acid is produced by the fungus Aspergillus niger. Microorganisms are used to prepare a widening range of bioactive molecules and enzymes. For example, <b>Streptokinase</b> produced by the bacterium Streptococcus and modified by genetic engineering is used to remove clots from the blood vessels of patients who have suffered a heart attack. Cyclosporin A is an immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation, while statins produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus serve as blood cholesterol lowering agents, competitively inhibiting the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol.|$|E
2500|$|Although no perfect {{thrombolytic}} agent exists, ideally {{it would}} lead to rapid reperfusion, have a high sustained patency rate, be specific for recent thrombi, be easily and rapidly administered, create a low risk for intracerebral bleeding and systemic bleeding, have no antigenicity, adverse hemodynamic effects, or clinically significant drug interactions, and be cost effective. Currently available thrombolytic agents include <b>streptokinase,</b> urokinase, and alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rtPA). [...] More recently, thrombolytic agents similar in structure to rtPA such as reteplase and tenecteplase have been used. These newer agents boast efficacy at least as well as rtPA with significantly easier administration. The thrombolytic agent used in a particular individual is based on institution preference and the age of the patient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Streptokinase</b> {{belongs to}} a group of {{medications}} known as fibrinolytics, and complexes of <b>streptokinase</b> with human plasminogen can hydrolytically activate other unbound plasminogen by activating through bond cleavage to produce plasmin. There are three domains to <b>streptokinase,</b> denoted α (residues 1-150), β (residues 151-287), and γ (residues 288-414). Each domain binds plasminogen, although none can activate plasminogen independently.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{argues that}} <b>streptokinase</b> (produced by bacteria of type [...] "streptococcus" [...] together with plasminogen from the patient) is the active agent of Coley's toxins.

50|$|The {{controversy}} {{over whether the}} more expensive rt-PA was clinically superior over <b>streptokinase</b> as a thrombolytic agent climaxed in the scientific press between 1988 and 1992. To end this controversy, the GUSTO trial (Global Utilization of <b>Streptokinase</b> and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries) was set up, a head-to-head comparison between rt-PA and <b>streptokinase.</b> In the GUSTO-trial 41,021 heart attack patients were treated in 1,081 hospitals in 15 countries. Cardiologist Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic (USA), statistician Robert Califf of Johns Hopkins (USA) and David Stump https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=206572&privcapId=29617 of Genentech coordinated the trial. In absolute figures the 30-day mortality rate in the rt-PA group was 1% lower (or in relative figures 14%) compared to the mortality in the <b>streptokinase</b> group. After the GUSTO studies, rt-PA became the thrombolytic drug of choice {{for most of the}} cardiologists in the Western world and would save the lives of many tens of thousands of heart attack patients.|$|E
50|$|If {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PCI) is {{not available}} within 90-120 minutes of first contact, <b>streptokinase</b> is recommended intravenously {{as soon as possible}} after the onset of a ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). As <b>Streptokinase</b> is a bacterial product, the body has the ability to build up an immunity to it. Therefore, it is recommended that this medication should not be used again after four days from the first administration, as it may not be as effective and can also cause an allergic reaction. For this reason, it is usually given only for a person's first heart attack. Further thrombotic events could be treated with Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Overdose of <b>streptokinase</b> or tPA can be treated with aminocaproic acid.|$|E

5000|$|Of primary {{interest}} among the intracellular components are microbial enzymes: catalase, amylase, protease, pectinase, glucose isomerase, cellulase, hemicellulase, lipase, lactase, <b>streptokinase</b> and many others. [...] Recombinant proteins, such as insulin, hepatitis B vaccine, interferon, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, <b>streptokinase</b> {{and others are}} also made this way. The largest difference between this process and the others is that the cells must be ruptured (lysed) {{at the end of}} fermentation, and the environment must be manipulated to maximize the amount of the product. Furthermore, the product (typically a protein) must be separated from all of the other cellular proteins in the lysate to be purified.|$|E

50|$|After {{many years}} of work along with his student Sol Sherry, William Smith Tillett founded it in 1933.

5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the FasX small RNA (fibronectin/fibrinogen-binding/haemolytic-activity/streptokinase-regulator-X) is a non-coding small RNA (sRNA) {{produced by}} all group A Streptococcus. [...] FasX {{has also been}} found in species of group D and group G Streptococcus. FasX regulates expression of secreted virulence factor <b>streptokinase</b> (SKA), encoded by the ska gene. FasX base pairs to the 5' end of the ska mRNA, increasing {{the stability of the}} mRNA, resulting in elevated levels of <b>streptokinase</b> expression. FasX negatively regulates the expression of pili and fibronectin-binding proteins on the bacterial cell surface. It binds to the 5' untranslated region of genes in the FCT-region in a serotype-specific manner, reducing the stability of and inhibiting translation of the pilus biosynthesis operon mRNA by occluding the ribosome-binding site through a simple Watson-Crick base-pairing mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{treatments}} {{have been}} derived from bacteria. One drug is <b>streptokinase,</b> {{which is an}} enzyme secreted by several streptococcal bacteria. This drug is administered intravenously {{and can be used}} to dissolve blood clots in coronary vessels. However, <b>streptokinase</b> is nonspecific and can digest almost any protein, which can lead to many secondary problems. Another clot-dissolving enzyme that works faster and is more specific is called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This drug is made by transgenic bacteria and it converts plasminogen into the clot-dissolving enzyme plasmin. [...] There are also some anticoagulants that come from animals that work by dissolving fibrin. For example, Haementeria ghilianii, an Amazon leech, produces an enzyme called hementin from its salivary glands. [...] , this enzyme has now been successfully produced by genetically engineered bacteria and administered to cardiac patients.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a complex}} of {{purified}} human plasminogen and bacterial <b>streptokinase</b> that has been acylated to protect the enzyme's active site. When the drug is administered, the acyl group gets hydrolyzed, thereby freeing the activator complex. It converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn degrades fibrin (blood clots) to fibrin split products.|$|E
