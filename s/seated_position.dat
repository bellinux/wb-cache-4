5|$|Against All Odds {{official}} {{began with}} a standard match between Elix Skipper and Petey Williams, who was accompanied by Coach D'Amore. The match ended when Skipper performed a move in which he holds his opponent upside-down and around his back. He grabs their head and falls to a <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> to caused their head and neck to be forced into the mat, a move he dubbed the Sudden Death. Skipper followed by covering Williams for the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{encounter}} was a Six Sides of Steel Tables {{match between}} Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a {{table by the}} other. At one point during the contest, Hardy laid Raven on a table then ascended {{to the top of}} the cage. Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a front-flip towards Raven, who moved out of the way and caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a stack of four tables. Hardy then jumped off the top of the cage onto Raven in a <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> forcing him through all the tables and winning the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Burial 48 {{was carved}} from the bedrock under the terrace, upon the central north-south {{axis of the}} North Acopolis {{directly}} under Temple 33; it {{has been identified as}} the tomb of king Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The remains of the king were flanked those of two juvenile human sacrifices; one of these was a child and one was an adolescent. The walls of the tomb were coated in stucco, onto which were painted hieroglyphs indicating that the tomb was sealed in March 457, a year after the king had died. The king was interred bundled in a <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> and his remains lacked the skull, hands, and femurs. Grave goods included 27 ceramic vessels of mixed of local and imported origin, stone and shell artefacts including a well-used stone metate and accompanying handstone, a large quantity of jade artefacts, including jade discs and hundreds of beads that once formed a semicircular collar, two pairs of earspools and a great many more beads in small groups that did not form a part of the collar. Two obsidian blades also accompanied the burial.|$|E

40|$|Period Covered: October 2012 -July 2013 This paper {{explores the}} {{geometric}} feasibility of installing dedicated lower anchors {{in the center}} rear <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> of vehicles. Analysis {{was based on a}} previous research study in which the lateral spacing of seat belt and LATCH lower anchorages were measured in 85 model year 2010 - 2011 vehicles. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine how many vehicles would have the physical space to incorporate a third set of dedicated lower anchors in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> for child restraint installation. Usability of all of the lower anchors, as well as the seat belts, was also considered. To begin, nine vehicles that currently have dedicated lower anchors in the center position were reviewed. The distances between all seat belt anchors and lower anchors across the vehicle sample were also analyzed to identify spacings that are currently feasible in production. The arrangement of seat belt and lower anchor hardware across the rear seat was also reviewed with respect to usability. Based on these analyses, a lateral distance between the outboard webbing and outboard lower anchor of 75 to 100 mm is common. The suggested minimum distance between lower anchors and seat belt hardware is 25 mm. Based on these dimensions, vehicles with 710 mm or more between the outboard lower anchor centerlines (OBLACL) should have sufficient space to provide three sets of usable, dedicated lower anchors in the right, center, and left <b>seating</b> <b>positions.</b> Providing the highest level of usability with regard to use of seat belt or LATCH hardware in adjacent <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> would be achieved by placing each pair of lower anchors between the webbing and buckle hardware for the <b>seating</b> <b>position.</b> If the OBLACL is less than 710 mm, an improvised center LATCH position (permitting use of the inboard lower anchors from the outboard <b>seating</b> <b>positions</b> to secure a child restraint in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position)</b> may be feasible. The maximum spacing of this improvised center LATCH position would be 480 mm. If a vehicle allowed an improvised center LATCH position, placing the inboard lower anchor between the outboard buckle and nearest center seat belt hardware would maximize usability of the seat belt in the outboard <b>seating</b> <b>position</b> and lower anchors in the center <b>seating</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R

25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E

40|$|Objective. This study {{investigated}} the effect of cycling position (upright vs. recumbent) and <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> on the oxygen cost of cycling. Experimental design. A two-factor ANOVA with repeated measures {{was used to examine}} the effect of cycling position (Monark 814 E, Lifecycle 9100 R, and Lifecycle 9500 RHR ergometers) and <b>seat</b> <b>position</b> (optimum and +/- 1 setting) on VO 2 and HR. Participants. Subjects were 10 male physical education students (age = 24 +/- 2. 1 years, height = 178. 8 +/- 4. 8 cm, weight = 76. 2 +/- 7. 8 kg). Interventions. Each subject was tested at three 5 -minute workloads (55, 137, and 186 Watts) in a random order on the three ergometers. These workloads corresponded with manual settings of 1, 3, and 5 on the Lifecycle ergometers. The cycling protocols for the Lifecycle ergometers were performed with the seat set at 107 % of the symphysis pubis measurement and at <b>seat</b> <b>positions</b> of +/- 1 setting from the so-called "optimum" setting. Measures. Physiological response was assessed by continuously monitoring VO 2 and HR. Results. At the optimum seat setting, the VO 2 was significantly higher at the three workloads on the Monark compared to both Lifecycle ergometers. <b>Seat</b> <b>positions</b> of +/- 1 setting from the recommended setting did not affect VO 2. The HR response was non-significant for cycling <b>position</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>position.</b> Conclusions. The results indicate that the Lifecycle ergometers (9100 R and 9500 RHR) underestimate oxygen consumption and indirectly underestimate energy expenditure. <b>Seat</b> <b>positions</b> of +/- 1 setting from the recommended setting on the Lifecycle ergometers did not affect the VO 2...|$|R

Mourners from across Egypt went to Saint Mark Cathedral in Abbaseya to pay their respects. Bells tolled in Cairo's Abbasiya district, where the primary cathedral of the Coptic Church is located. So large was the crowd of mourners gathering in Cathedral Square to pay their respects that three were killed and 137 injured in a crush as the queue to view the body of the deceased pope stretched for more than one kilometer. Viewing was cut short after the tragedy, and the cathedral was closed to the public.|$|E
25|$|Ancient rowing {{was done}} in a fixed <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> the most {{effective}} rowing position, with rowers facing the stern. A sliding stroke, which provided the strength from both legs {{as well as the}} arms, was suggested by earlier historians, but no conclusive evidence has supported it. Practical experiments with the full-scale reconstruction Olympias has shown that there was insufficient space, while moving or rolling seats would have been highly impractical to construct with ancient methods. Rowers in ancient war galleys sat below the upper deck with little view of their surroundings. The rowing was therefore managed by supervisors, and coordinated with pipes or rhythmic chanting. Galleys were highly maneuverable, able to turn on their axis or even to row backwards, though it required a skilled and experienced crew. In galleys with an arrangement of three men per oar, all would be seated, but the rower furthest inboard would perform a stand-and-sit stroke, getting up on his feet to push the oar forwards and then sitting down again to pull it back.|$|E
