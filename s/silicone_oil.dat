25|$|Vitrectomy is an {{increasingly}} used treatment for retinal detachment. It involves {{the removal of}} the vitreous gel and is usually combined with filling the eye with either a gas bubble (SF6 or C3F8 gas) or <b>silicone</b> <b>oil</b> (PDMS). An advantage of using gas in this operation {{is that there is no}} myopic shift after the operation and gas is absorbed within a few weeks. PDMS, if used, needs to be removed after a period of 2–8 months depending on surgeon's preference. <b>Silicone</b> <b>oil</b> is more commonly used in cases associated with proliferative vitreo-retinopathy (PVR). A disadvantage is that a vitrectomy always leads to more rapid progression of a cataract in the operated eye. In many places vitrectomy is the most commonly performed operation for the treatment of retinal detachment. A recent Cochrane Review assessing various tamponade agents for patients with retinal detachment associated with PVR found that patients treated with C3F8 gas and standard <b>silicone</b> <b>oil</b> had visual and anatomic advantages over patients using SF6. Heavy <b>silicone</b> <b>oil</b> did not show any advantages over regular <b>silicone</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

40|$|Quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) {{in contact}} with liquid {{droplets}} {{have been used to}} investigate the rheological properties of liquids and the diverse solid-liquid interfacial phenomena. In this article, we first report the experimental results of the QCM responses due to the deposition of microliter droplets of <b>silicone</b> <b>oils.</b> The <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> with viscosity in a range from 50 cS to 103 cS are tested. It has been found that the responses in the frequency and resistance measurements of the QCM {{in contact with}} the <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> are different from the Newtonian liquids. More importantly, it has been found that for the <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> the frequency of the QCM steadily increases for several hours and even exceeds the initial value of the unloaded QCM which has resulted in the positive frequency changes. The collaborative effects of the interfacial slip and viscoelasticity have been discussed to qualitatively interpret the positive frequency changes. Secondly, we discuss the cyclical variations in the frequency and resistance during the experiments of the <b>silicone</b> <b>oils,</b> which are attributed to the generation of the compressional wave in the droplets. The present work has shown some phenomena which need to be taken into consideration when using the droplet QCM as a rheological sensor and may stimulate the ongoing research on the related issues in the QCM community.

50|$|Some <b>silicone</b> <b>oils,</b> such as simethicone, are potent anti-foaming agents due {{to their}} low surface tension. They are used in {{industrial}} applications such as distillation or fermentation, where excessive amounts of foam can be problematic. They are sometimes added to cooking oils to prevent excessive frothing during deep frying. <b>Silicone</b> <b>oils</b> used as lubricants can be inadvertent defoamers (contaminants) in processes where foam is desired, {{such as in the}} manufacture of polyurethane foam.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used pressure transmitting media have been sodium chloride, <b>silicone</b> <b>oil,</b> and a 4:1 methanol-ethanol mixture. Sodium chloride is easy to load and is used for high-temperature experiments because it acts as a good thermal insulator. The methanol-ethanol mixture displays good hydrostaticity to about 10 GPa and {{with the addition of a}} small amount of water can be extended to about 15 GPa.|$|E
25|$|Silicones {{are often}} used in {{waterproofing}} treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to <b>silicone</b> <b>oil.</b> Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some superalloys.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of silicone breast implants requires the metallic element Platinum (Pt., 78) {{as a catalyst}} to accelerate the transformation of <b>silicone</b> <b>oil</b> into silicone gel for making the elastomer silicone shells, and for making other medical-silicone devices. The literature indicates that trace quantities of platinum leak from such types of silicone breast implant; therefore, platinum {{is present in the}} surrounding pectoral tissue(s). The rare pathogenic consequence is an accumulation of platinum in the bone marrow, from where blood cells might deliver it to nerve endings, thus causing nervous system disorders such as blindness, deafness, and nervous tics (involuntary muscle contractions).|$|E

40|$|Background/aims High {{viscosity}} <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> {{are used}} as tamponade agents to increase the resistance to emulsification; however, this makes the oils more difficult to inject.

25|$|Hydrodynamic analogs {{have been}} {{developed}} that can recreate various aspects of quantum mechanical systems, including single-particle interference through a double-slit. A <b>silicone</b> <b>oil</b> droplet, bouncing along {{the surface of a}} liquid, self-propels via resonant interactions with its own wave field. The droplet gently sloshes the liquid with every bounce. At the same time, ripples from past bounces affect its course. The droplet’s interaction with its own ripples, which form what is known as a pilot wave, causes it to exhibit behaviors previously thought to be peculiar to elementary particles — including behaviors customarily taken as evidence that elementary particles are spread through space like waves, without any specific location, until they are measured.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, {{the head}} of the Russian Antarctic Expedition, Valery Lukin, {{announced}} that his team had only [...] of ice left to drill in order to reach the water. The researchers then switched to a new thermal drill head with a [...] "clean" [...] <b>silicone</b> <b>oil</b> fluid to drill the rest of the way. Instead of drilling all the way into the water, they said they would stop just above it when a sensor on the thermal drill detected free water. At that point, the drill was to be stopped and extracted from the bore hole. [...] Removal of the drill would lower the pressure beneath it, drawing water into the hole to be left to freeze, creating a plug of ice {{in the bottom of the}} hole.

2500|$|Use of {{condensers}} {{in chemical}} procedures—when not performed at fixed, lowered pressure by careful vacuum control—inevitably involves transiently fluctuating pressures within the apparatus, so that isolating the apparatus while {{allowing it to}} be an open rather than sealed system becomes a practical issue; this is particularly true, when chemical reactions are performed that are air- or moisture-sensitive. If the reaction or process using condensers cannot be left open to atmosphere, its isolation is accomplished in simplest fashion via drying tubes (an attached tube packed with desiccant) or other specially packed scavenging tubes, that allows gasses to pass, and so pressure equalization, but prevents entry of substances deleterious to the ongoing chemistry; alternatively, the apparatus can be vented through a [...] "bubbler" [...] that prevents entry of laboratory atmosphere either by allowing the internal volume to push and pull against a volume of resisting liquid (e.g., mineral or <b>silicone</b> <b>oil),</b> or by keeping a positive pressure of inert, [...] "blanketing" [...] gas (e.g., nitrogen or argon) that vents through a similar volume of liquid. Attachment of such during tubes and bubblers can be direct, or indirect via gas/vacuum lines and manifolds.|$|E
50|$|The {{diffusion}} pump {{is widely used}} in both industrial and research applications. Most modern {{diffusion pump}}s use <b>silicone</b> <b>oil</b> or polyphenyl ethers as the working fluid. Cecil Reginald Burch discovered {{the possibility of using}} <b>silicone</b> <b>oil</b> in 1928.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{the vapor}} {{pressure}} of the release agent could also be relevant, if <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> are parts of the applied release agent. At higher temperatures, those <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> have a relatively low vapor pressure [32], which could be critical for the CFRP-processing and would may be indicate a negative effect of an applied vacuum on the release agent transfer. Nevertheless, even if the vapor pressure is reached during the production cycle, the volatile components of the release agent are mainly sucked outside of the laminate by the applied vacuum system within the experimental set-up (e.g. by the application of vacuum bags [27, 33]), proven by the reduction of voids after the application of an higher vacuum [13].|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{conducted}} at the Conservation Research Laboratory (CRL) that use lower molecular weight <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> to bulk and conserve {{a wide range of}} organic materials and artifacts have been very successful. Using tin-based catalysts to cure the silicone-bulked cell structures of waterlogged wood, leather, corn cob, bone and glass samples, it has been possible to successfully consolidate and retain the diagnostic features of numerous historic-period waterlogged artifacts. Several waterlogged wood samples recovered from marine excavations at Port Royal, Jamaica, under the direction of Dr. D. L. Hamilton, have been successfully polymerized; the diagnostic features and original shapes of these samples have been maintained. Within these samples, however, {{it is obvious that the}} use of low molecular weight <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> provided only minimal levels of tensile strength, since some separation of grain layers occurred. Experimentation on larger waterlogged wood samples indicates that the use of pure silicone fluids in the di- and trimethoxysilane groups resulted in artifacts with very poor tensile strength and tear characteristics.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of <b>silicone</b> <b>oils,</b> (CH 3) 3 SiO−[Si(CH 3) 2 O]n−Si(CH 3) 3, and their mixtures is studied. Shear-stress measurements, in the temperature range of 293 − 313 K, reveal that this polymer {{family is a}} group of shear-thinning liquids with a yield stress below which no flow occurs. Experimental diagrams, i. e., shear stress versus shear rate, are satisfactorily described by the Casson fluid model over a wide range of shear rates. In order to monitor the effect of temperature on fluid properties, Casson’s rheological model is reformulated using the fictitious shear rate, γ̇f, and the infinite-shear viscosity, η∞, as constitutive parameters. Due to low intermolecular forces and high chain flexibility, γ̇f varies very little when the temperature increases. For this reason, the apparent material viscosity depends on temperature only through η∞, which exponentially decreases until high shear rates are reached, and there is more alignment possible. Interestingly, the temperature sensitivity of this pseudoplastic behavior is the same for all of the <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> investigated; therefore, they can be classified according to their tendency to emulsify. Experimental results are then used to model the flow of <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> in a cylindrical pipe and estimate the temperature increase due to viscous heating. Numerical results show that the normalized temperature, i. e., ratio of fluid temperature to wall temperature, increases approximately 23...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Finding a new {{safe and}} ecologically {{friendly}} borehole fluid {{is one of}} the most pressing problems for forthcoming ice-drilling projects. Not all recent borehole fluids qualify as intelligent choices from safety, environmental and other technological standpoints. We propose the use of <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> as the borehole fluid. The most suitable type of <b>silicone</b> <b>oils</b> for deep ice drilling are low-molecular (or volatile) dimethyl siloxane oils (DSOs). Low-molecular DSOs are clear, water-white, tasteless, odorless, neutral liquids. They are hydrophobic and inert substances that are stable to water, air, oxygen, metals, wood, paper, plastics, etc. Of the DSOs, class 2 grades of KF 96 - 1. 5 cs and KF 96 - 2. 0 cs most fully fit our criteria for choice as borehole fluids. The final conclusion as to the suitability of DSOs for ice deep drilling will be made after the experiments in a test borehole...|$|R
