5|$|Born to a large, impoverished {{family of}} farm workers, Ellen {{was sent to}} work as a nursemaid at the age of eleven. Soon afterwards, she began {{suffering}} periods of drowsiness and was referred to a local hospital. After four months her condition was declared incurable, and she was sent home. Two days later, Ellen had a series of seizures and—her mother claimed—fell into a deep sleep from which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> roused.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet was {{converted}} into a training ship in the mid-1920s before running aground off the Algerian coast in January 1930. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> pulled free and sank five days later. Waldeck-Rousseau served as the flagship of the Far East fleet from 1929 to 1932 and was decommissioned after returning to France. She was hulked in 1936 and scrapped in 1941–44.|$|E
5|$|His mother Kukaeleiki was the {{daughter}} of Kalauawa, a Kauaʻi high chief, and she was also a cousin of Queen Keōpūolani, the most sacred wife of Kamehameha I. Among Naʻea's more notable ancestors were Kalanawaʻa, a high chief of Oʻahu, and Kuaenaokalani, a Maui high chiefess who held the sacred kapu rank of Kekapupoʻohoʻolewaikala (the kapu of Poʻohoʻolewaikala, a rank so sacred that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> exposed to the sun except at dawn).|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, Bloomberg News {{reported}} that Manning could be visited by only those she had named before her imprisonment, {{and not by}} journalists. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> photographed or give interviews on camera. Manning {{was not allowed to}} browse the web, but could consult print news and have access to new gender theory texts.|$|E
5|$|Operation Paravane was a British {{air raid}} of World War II that inflicted heavy {{damage on the}} German {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The attack was conducted on 15 September 1944 by 21 Royal Air Force heavy bombers, which flew from an airfield {{in the north of}} the Soviet Union. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered Tirpitz unfit for combat, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> repaired as it was no longer possible for the Germans to sail her to a major port.|$|E
5|$|The bow {{section was}} badly damaged, but not irreparably so, {{and the rest}} of the ship, {{including}} the boilers and engines, were not damaged at all. It was determined that if the ship could be lightened, the tide would then lift her off the bottom and she could be sailed to port. With this in mind, three days later, on 20 March, the cargo was unloaded into small coastal freighters. Initially, it appeared that the attempt would succeed, but a week later, after various other vessels had attempted to pull Suevic off the rocks, the weather deteriorated, and waves drove her farther onto shore, from whence <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> moved.|$|E

50|$|When Groark was six, she {{was trapped}} in the 1944 Hartford Circus Fire which killed 168 people. Groark said, even 60 years later, <b>she</b> still <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> in large crowds.|$|R
5|$|Three-year-old {{polar bear}} Mercedes {{was given to}} the zoo in 1984, after she was rescued in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. She had begun {{wandering}} into the town in search of food. Because of the danger she posed to residents, Mercedes was tagged with a number so she could be tracked. When <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> persuaded to return to the wild, a decision was taken to shoot her. A member of the Edinburgh Zoological Society collaborated with a cousin in Canada {{and they were able to}} rescue Mercedes, finding her a new home at Edinburgh zoo. The bear would become one of the zoo's most popular attractions.|$|E
5|$|Editor Vanessa Whitburn told Chris Arnot of The Independent {{that the}} climax to the storyline was planned three {{months prior to}} the show's anniversary. When Ruth listened to a {{voicemail}} from her daughter, it reminded her of home and she called Sam to say <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> with him. Ruth then turned to Usha for support, before returning home to David, who observed Ruth's emotional state. After Sam quit his job, Ruth eventually told David the truth about what happened. Bentinck explained that when he and Finch finished recording the scene, they were both crying as it had been very distressing. David was initially unable to forgive Ruth for her actions, but after speaking to Usha and gaining some perspective, over time things between himself and Ruth became easier.|$|E

25|$|While {{walking home}} Meagher called her brother, Michael McKeon, {{and spoke with}} him briefly about their father. At their flat her husband woke to realise she was not home and started searching for her.

25|$|On 30 September, Khaleda Zia {{was granted}} bail by the High Court, which {{ruled that the}} trial should be stopped {{on the grounds that}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> charged under {{emergency}} laws for actions that had occurred prior to the state of emergency being imposed in January 2007.|$|E
25|$|Canberra was {{withdrawn}} from P service in September 1997 {{and sold to}} ship breakers for scrapping on 10 October 1997, leaving for Gadani ship-breaking yard, Pakistan on 31 October 1997. Her deep draft meant that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> beached as far as most ships, and due to her solid construction the scrapping process took nearly a year instead of the estimated three months, being totally scrapped {{by the end of}} 1998.|$|E
60|$|The {{discussion}} was given up, {{when it was}} announced that a room was ready; and Rashe underwent so much in climbing the stairs, that Cilly thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> worse on the car.|$|R

25|$|While {{still at}} Cornell, in 1989, {{she became a}} MacArthur Fellow. However, despite {{significant}} public and faculty pressure, the university refused to hire her, stating that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> given an appointment because she was not in any department. It was not until she received an offer of a tenured position with a substantial research budget from the University of Georgia that Cornell's administration decided to keep her, creating an endowed chair for her and putting together funding to start the History of Science department.|$|E
25|$|HMCS Wentworth was a River-class frigate {{that served}} with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War. She served {{primarily}} as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named in honour {{of the town of}} Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> named HMCS Dartmouth for fear of confusion with HMS Dartmouth, and so was named after a famous early resident, Nova Scotia Lieutenant Governor Sir John Wentworth. Her name is often mistakenly associated with Wentworth County, Ontario, in honour of the city of Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|In the pilot, Sookie {{was played}} by Alex Borstein but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{released}} from her Mad TV contract. She was therefore replaced by Melissa McCarthy, who re-filmed Sookie's scenes. The role of Dean also changed after the pilot, {{with the original}} actor replaced by newcomer Jared Padalecki. The character Lane was based on Sherman-Palladino's friend and fellow producer Helen Pai; Japanese-American actress Keiko Agena was cast in the role when they could not find an appropriate Korean-American actress. Liza Weil auditioned to play Rory, and while she was considered wrong for the part – Sherman-Palladino liked her {{so much that she}} wrote the role of Paris specially for her.|$|E
60|$|Adeline {{tried to}} refuse, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{trembling}} {{so that it}} seemed as if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have set one foot before the other without help. She took his arm, and stumbled along beside him through the quiet, early spring night.|$|R
25|$|Saint Thomas Aquinas {{refused to}} concede the Immaculate Conception, {{on the ground}} that, unless the Blessed Virgin had {{at one time or}} other been one of the sinful, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> justly <b>be</b> said to have been {{redeemed}} by Christ.|$|R
50|$|Police {{were shown}} to have kept {{contradictory}} testimony from both the prosecution and defense. The witness Delma Bull stated she had been pressured into lying about witnessing the murder and a welfare check proved <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> at the scene.|$|R
25|$|After {{purchasing}} Stena Danica {{from the}} Stena Line, {{the ship was}} rechristened Queen of Surrey by then NDP Minister of Transportation and Communications, Robert Strachan, in April 1974. Queen of Surrey began operating between Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. This busy route requires 8 transits per day and due to her RORO bow design, it was quickly evident that the vessel was unsuitable for this route since <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> loaded and unloaded as fast as necessary. The ship was decommissioned in 1976 and laid up at BC Ferries' dockyard at Deas Island in Vancouver while the government debated {{what to do with}} her.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of women under Welsh law differed significantly {{to that of}} their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man {{without the consent of}} her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements {{as if she had been}} given by her kin.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 January 1799, Grampus was in the Thames and {{under the command of}} Captain John Hall. She weighed at 7a.m., and took a pilot, Sammuel Richardson, on board. Nevertheless, by 9a.m. she had {{grounded}} on the Barking Shelf. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> refloated and so for the next three days work went on to remove her stores, her masts, and whatever else could be salvaged. On 21 January {{the decision was made to}} abandon her as by then she had 20 feet of water in her hold. The subsequent court martial absolved Captain Hall and his officers and crew of any responsibility, instead blaming Richardson's ignorance.|$|E
