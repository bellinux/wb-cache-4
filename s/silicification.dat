40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{prospecting}} in the NE of the Iberian Peninsula, {{with the aim of}} identifying the siliceous sources potentially used by the populations that occupied the marginal basins of the Ebro depression during the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. We intend to define the main characteristics of the cherts in the region studied, taking into account the palaeoenvironment in which <b>silicifications</b> are mainly formed, and the premise that siliceous rocks acquire the attributes of enclosing rocks. The cherts studied are the products of early diagenesis by replacement of carbonate and evaporite sediments. Petrological analyses show that they are made up of microquartz, with high proportion of fibrous forms silica, carbonates, ferric oxides and evaporite relicts. In the future, these characteristics will be useful for ascribing archaeological materials in both geological and geographical terms...|$|R
40|$|The prehistoric Treviño flint mine {{complex is}} located in the Sierra de Araico-Cucho (Berantevilla, Alava- Condado de Treviño, Burgos), inside the lacustrine-palustrine Cenozoic (Aquitanian, Miocene) {{materials}} of the South-Pyrenean syncline of the Basque-Cantabrian Basin. It is a landscape unit constituted by a set of carbonated layers with abundant nodular and stratiform <b>silicifications.</b> The extraction mining works (often referred to as ‘tailing’) are usually identified as dumps or trenches, subtly visible and associated with archaeological materials. An archaeological excavation was carried out in one potential mining structure (dump or pit) that was detected by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) in the mountain pass of “Pozarrate ” near the villages of Grandival and Araico (Treviño, Burgos). In this work we present the results of the excavation of the last two years. The existence of a Neolithic mining dump (the tailings) with a chronology ca. 5000 cal. BC was confirmed. The base rock level with nodular flint was reached and the impressions of the exploited nodules have been identified. As well, the extraction front which reaches about 4. 0 - 5. 0 metres in height was delimited. Thousands of lithic remains associated with the extraction and the initial processing (shaping) of flint were collected, as along with mining tools.

40|$|The prehistoric site of “la Terre-des-Sablons” {{is located}} near by the palaeontological Site of Rosières at Lunery (Cher department, France). During 1980 ’s, about 50 prehistoric {{artifacts}} {{were discovered in}} a quarry {{at the base of}} a sandy fossil fluvial formation. The lithic assemblage show similar techno-typological characters as Early Palaeolithic European industries (Mode 1). Since 2003, multidisciplinary studies were coordinate in the prehistoric Site. Three stepped fossil fluvial formations were recognized and their dating by ESR method applied on fluvial grain quartz indicated that they were deposited at the end of Early Pleistocene since 1. 1 to 0. 8 Ma. During sampling for these geochronological studies, prehistoric artifacts were recovered again at the bottom of the oldest fluvial formation (1. 166 ± 0. 140 Ma), 12 m deep under the initial topographical surface. Between 2006 and 2012, excavations revealed presence of four archaeological levels with cores and flakes associated with a stratified layers of pebbles and cobbles (Unit a, layers 1 and 2) deposited on the incision floor and laid under this lower sandy formation. The technics used for flaking take place in the technics variability describe for the assemblages present in the European Early Pleistocene Sites. Geoarchaeological studies of this gravelly unit a permit to determine the source and phases of the deposits of raw materials gathered by Hominins, especially Jurassic <b>silicifications</b> (“chailles”) and millstone.

[...] The gap between this event and the time that fossil diatoms first appear may indicate a period when diatoms were unsilicified and their evolution was cryptic. [...] Since the advent of <b>silicification,</b> diatoms have made a significant impression on the fossil record, with major deposits of fossil diatoms found as far back as the early Cretaceous, and some rocks (diatomaceous earth, diatomite, kieselguhr) being composed almost entirely of them.|$|E
40|$|National audienceIn {{the middle}} Cher river valley (Centre-Val de Loire Region, France) fieldworks and {{researches}} allowed a geological, geochronological and paleoenvironnemental {{framework for the}} fluvial system and associated prehistoric sites. At Brinay (Cher department), the sandy alluvia of the Les Fougeres Formation that overlap the Acheulian Site of la Noira was dated par ESR Method of 665 perpendicular to 55 ka. On this site, archaeological studies and excavations shown that hominins had prospected amounts of various weathered raw materials downsloping from the interfluve (Sub-Unit a 1 / Unit a). Their strategy of supply seems to have consisted in several series of selections for gathering millstone slabs, while eliminating those which were previously alterated or frozen. These slabs were broken and the fragments were used for knapping flakes or shaping handaxes. During excavations, because of their freshness, evidence of primary position of these artifacts was observed. So, hominins were partially presents near by the river owing to reach raw materials. These in demand millstones are lacustrine <b>silicifications</b> that were uncovered during incision phase of the Cher river then sloped down in debris flows. These phenomena were resulting from climatic cyclicity and correspond to a transition phase {{at the beginning of}} a glacial stage and before pleniglacial stage (MIS 16) while the uncovered areas of Unit a and substratum were cryoturbated. In some valleys of the Middle Loire river Basin, others prehistoric assemblages were founded on the top of incision floors uncovered during different climatic cycles of the Early or Middle Pleistocene.

40|$|The "Marbre rouge à Crinoïdes de Baelen" is {{the only}} Famennian reef-analogous {{structure}} known thus far in the Ardenno-Rhenish Massif. Its location within the Verviers Synclinorium {{is linked to the}} presence of deep-seated transversal faults. During a short-term transgressive pulse and a decrease of siliclastic detrital influx, carbonates were deposited on offshore, submarine structural highs. Initially, crinoids, dasyclads and sponges lowered the current velocity and trapped the lime mud. Subsequently, cyanobacteria and algae produced lime mud and/or fixed skeletal grains in place. Subsidence was important but discontinuous, so that the carbonate buildup has intermittently reached the wave base during its growth. These oscillations are reflected by the irregular but frequent interstratification of crinoidal packstones and grainstones within the mudstones. The latter include cryptalgal, algal and spiculitic mudstones, grading locally into algal bindstones and floatstones. Early-diagenetic (synsedimentary) spar-cementing of the cavities consolidated the calcareous lime buildup. Paleoecological evidence points to a quiet and/or relatively deep shelf environment for the mudstones (siliceous sponges, silicified ostracode assemblages) whereas the abundance of Issinellids would still indicate the (upper ?) photic zone. The micropaleontological content of the crinoidal pack/grainstones rather suggests more shallow subtidal conditions (broken plurilocular foraminifers, girvanellid oncoids, vermetid gastropods). The observed diagenetic processes reveal subsequent influences of marine (fibroradiaxial calcite), mixed marine-meteoric (<b>silicifications,</b> dolomitization) and meteoric (syntaxial rim cements, solution coronas, dedolomitization) phreatic waters, indicating a gradual uplift and possible emersion of the Baelen buildups after their deposition. A strong pressure solution produced conspicuous iden-supported stylolaminitic or stylonodular fabrics within the impurer limestones facies. Thus the Baelen limestone complex is a stratigraphic reef, located on a predestinated mounding site in an open marine shelf setting near wave base, displaying characteristics of both a mud mound and a spar-cemented debris reef.

5000|$|<b>Silicification</b> is {{the process}} in which organic matter becomes {{saturated}} with silica. A common source of silica is volcanic material. Studies have shown that in this process, most of the original organic matter is destroyed. [...] <b>Silicification</b> most often occurs in two environments-either the specimen is buried in sediments of deltas and floodplains or organisms are buried in volcanic ash. Water must be present for <b>silicification</b> to occur because it reduces the amount of oxygen present and therefore reduces {{the deterioration of the}} organism by fungi, maintains organism shape, and allows for the transportation and deposition of silica. The process begins when a specimen is permeated with an aqueous silica solution. The cell walls of the specimen are progressively dissolved and silica is deposited into the empty spaces. In wood samples, as the process proceeds, cellulose and lignin, two components of wood, are degraded and replaced with silica. The specimen is transformed to stone (a process called lithification) as water is lost. For <b>silicification</b> to occur, the geothermic conditions must include a neutral to slightly acidic pH and a temperature and pressure similar to shallow-depth sedimentary environments; under these conditions, <b>silicification</b> can occur in 50,000 years or less.|$|E
50|$|In <b>silicification,</b> {{silicate}} minerals {{are released}} {{due to the}} weathering of rocks. The silica makes its way into a body of still water. Eventually, the mineral laden water permeates the pores and cells of some dead organism, where it becomes a gel. Over time, the gel will dehydrate, forming an opaline crystal structure that is an internal cast of the organism. This accounts for the detail found in permineralizations. <b>Silicification</b> reveals information about what type of environment the organism was likely to live in.

50|$|In {{the ancient}} rocks of Wales, Charnwood, the Pentland Hills, etc., similar tuffs are known, {{but in all}} cases they are greatly changed by <b>silicification</b> (which has filled them with opal, {{chalcedony}} and quartz) and by devitrification.

50|$|It is {{believed}} that the trees were swept downstream by a large flood and covered by alluvial sands.

5000|$|One of the {{processes}} involved in petrification is permineralization. The fossils created through this process tend to contain {{a large amount of}} the original material of the specimen.

The minerals are crystallized from {{an environment that is}} undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of neutral pH and low temperature (0-40 °C).
