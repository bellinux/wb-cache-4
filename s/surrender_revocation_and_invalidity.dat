40|$|<b>Revocation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Invalidity</b> of European Trade Mark <b>Revocation</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> of European trade mark, more {{precisely}} termed as Community trade mark (hereinafter as "CTM"), {{is a specific}} field of trade mark law of the European Union. It is Council Regulation (EC) No 207 / 2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark which forms a legal basis in this regard. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and especially the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union play very significant role in this area. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding Directive 2008 / 95 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate {{the laws of the}} Member States relating to trade marks is also relevant for the <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> of CTM as this Directive provides for the <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> of national trade marks in similar manner. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the nature of <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> of CTM <b>and</b> individual grounds for <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> as well as selected related issues, e. g. of procedural nature. This thesis is divided into four chapters. First chapter briefly introduces the institute of CTM and trade [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The Directive {{provided}} {{a framework of}} minimum provisions applicable throughout the European Union but did not seek to impose onerous obligations on national trade mark registries. For example, the Directive did not stipulate how member states should deal with the registration, <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> of trade marks. These elements were left to the national bodies' discretion.|$|R
40|$|Legal context The {{recognition}} {{and protection of}} well-known marks in Indonesia has improved {{over the last few}} years for a variety of reasons. Key points First, the Asian Crisis resulted in the creation of a Commercial Court, which is a clear improvement over the previously responsible District Courts. Secondly, the increasingly frequent publication of court decisions has improved transparency and consistency of those decisions. Well-known marks are now clearly protected against use for similar goods/services. Protection is extended to dissimilar goods/services by applying Article 16 (3) TRIPS directly or by arguing that registration occurred in bad faith. Nevertheless, decisions thus far concern almost exclusively <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> of registrations. Civil remedies such as damages and interim injunctions are hardly used, because the outdated civil procedural law has not familiarised judges with such legal instruments. Clearing the register of infringing registrations is another matter of concern. Cancellation for non-use for three consecutive years can be difficult, because the plaintiff is required to provide evidence of the last use in the production of the goods/services rather than in the course of trade more generally. Practical significance While it has become much easier to protect well-known marks in Indonesia, much work remains to be done regarding the procedural framework of civil infringement proceedings and regarding the clearing of the register. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Public-key {{infrastructures}} (PKIs) {{that support}} both identity certificates and access control (e. g., attribute, delegation) certificates are increasingly common. We {{argue that these}} PKIs must also support <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> review policies that are typical of more traditional access control systems; e. g., selective <b>and</b> transitive certificate <b>revocation,</b> <b>and</b> per-object access review. Further, we show that PKIs that eliminate identity certificates, such as the SPKI, resolve only selective <b>revocation</b> problems <b>and,</b> at the same time, make access review more complex. 1 Introduction The distribution <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> of identity certificates in Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) have been extensively addressed in the literature [7, 8, 12]. Various PKIs, such as X. 509 [6, 10], SPKI [2], SDSI [11], and PKI applications [1, 8], also include access control (i. e., attribute, delegation) certificates, which are commonly used for the distribution <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> of access privileges.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, identity-based {{cryptographic}} (IBC) schemes {{have been}} considered to secure mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) due to their efficient key management properties. However, proposed schemes do not provide mechanisms for key <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> key renewal. In this paper, we propose the first key <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> key renewal mechanisms for IBC schemes that are especially designed for MANETs. In our fully self-organized revocation scheme, each node monitors nodes in communication range and securely propagates its observations. The public key of a node is revoked if a minimum number of nodes accused the node. To enable key renewal, we introduce a modified format for ID-based public keys, such that new keys can be issued for the same identity. The introduced revocation scheme is efficient because it uses pre-shared keys from the Weil pairing to secure accusation <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> messages <b>and</b> messages are sent to an m-hop neighborhood instead of to the entire network. Our revocation mechanism {{can be adapted to}} PKI schemes in MANETs. ...|$|R
