40|$|Developing ideas {{based on}} {{combinatorial}} formulas for characteristic classes we introduce the algebra modeling <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> classes associated to $N$ connections. Certain {{elements of the}} algebra correspond to the ordinary and <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> classes. That construction allows us to give easily the explicit formulas for some known secondary classes and to construct the new ones. We write how $i$-th differential and $i$-th homotopy operator in the algebra are connected with the Poisson bracket defined in this algebra. There is an analogy between this algebra and the noncommutative symplectic geometry of Kontsevich. We consider then an algebraic model of {{the action of the}} gauge group. We describe how elements in the algebra corresponding to the <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> classes change under this action. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristics,</b> or both, {{because they feel}} {{they will be more}} comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|The rodent AFP {{system can}} be {{overridden}} with massive injections of estrogen, which overwhelm the AFP system and will masculinize the fetus. The masculinizing effect of estrogens may seem counter-intuitive since estrogens are critical for the proper development of female <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristics</b> during puberty. However, {{this is not the}} case prenatally. Gonadal hormones from the testes, such as testosterone and antimullerian hormone are required to cause development of a phenotypic male. Without these hormones the fetus will develop into a phenotypic female even if genetically XY. Interestingly, the conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase in many tissues may be an important step in masculinization of that tissue. Masculinization of the brain is thought to occur both by conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase, but also by de novo synthesis of estrogens within the brain. Thus, AFP may protect the fetus from maternal estradiol that would otherwise have a masculinizing effect on the fetus, but its exact role is still controversial.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the color {{controversy}} {{went in the}} opposite direction within the Appaloosa registry. The ApHC's decision in 1982 to allow solid-colored or [...] "non-characteristic" [...] Appaloosas to be registered resulted in substantial debate within the Appaloosa breeding community. Until then, a foal of Appaloosa parents that had insufficient color was often denied registration, although non-characteristic Appaloosas were allowed into the registry. But breeder experience had shown that some solid Appaloosas could throw a spotted foal in a subsequent generation, at least when bred to a spotted Appaloosa. In addition, many horses with a solid coat exhibited <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as skin mottling, the white sclera, and striped hooves. The controversy stirred by the ApHC's decision was intense. In 1983 a number of Appaloosa breeders opposed to the registration of solid-colored horses formed the American Appaloosa Association, a breakaway organization.|$|E

Moreover, in the case when g is the Lie algebra of formal vector fields and M supports a family of codimension one foliations, the image of a characteristic map from HL 4 (g) to H∗dR(M) is computed, where HL∗ denotes Leibniz cohomology and H∗dR denotes de Rham cohomology...|$|R
