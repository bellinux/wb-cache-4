5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} {{by creating an}} opening in the body using a <b>sharp</b> <b>object</b> through the area to be pierced. This can either be done by puncturing an opening using a needle (usually a hollow medical needle) or scalpel or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through scalpelling.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin with a <b>sharp</b> <b>object.</b> However, {{the number of}} self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a <b>sharp</b> <b>object</b> to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a <b>sharp</b> <b>object,</b> or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E
25|$|Newton/eMate: In 1993 the Apple Newton used a {{precision}} touchscreen which required a rigid and moderately <b>sharp</b> <b>object</b> for input, {{such as a}} fingernail or its included stylus.

25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{study of}} the CT scan of the mummy of Ramesses III's body by Sahar Saleem revealed that the left big toe was likely chopped by a heavy <b>sharp</b> <b>object</b> like an ax. There were no signs of bone healing so this injury must have happened shortly before death. The embalmers placed a prosthesis-like object made of linen {{in place of the}} amputated toe. The embalmers placed six amulets around both feet and ankles for magical healing of the wound for the life after. This additional injury of the foot supports the assassination of the Pharaoh, likely by the hands of multiple assailants using different weapons.|$|E

Despite the advanced state of decomposition, the pathologist was also able to locate multiple lineal abrasions upon the victim's chest and torso, indicating that Fleszar had been extensively beaten before her death. Although police theorized that Fleszar had been raped, the advanced state of decomposition of the corpse had erased any conclusive evidence of sexual assault.|$|E

25|$|Historically, some {{doubted that}} fish could {{experience}} pain. Laboratory experiments {{have shown that}} fish do react to painful stimuli (e.g., injections of bee venom) {{in a similar way}} to mammals. This is controversial and has been disputed. The expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish. In large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than just taking them out of the water. For sport fishing, it is recommended that fish be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out or by stabbing the brain with a <b>sharp</b> <b>object</b> (called pithing or ike jime in Japanese).|$|E
500|$|Self-harm (SH), also {{referred}} to as self-injury (SI), self-inflicted violence (SIV), nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) or self-injurious behaviour (SIB), refers to a spectrum of behaviours where demonstrable injury is self-inflicted. The behaviour involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent. [...] The most common form of self-harm involves cutting of the skin using a <b>sharp</b> <b>object,</b> e. g. a knife or razor blade. The term self-mutilation is also sometimes used, although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome, inaccurate, or offensive. Self-inflicted wounds is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non-lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat. This differs from the common definition of self-harm, as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose. A broader definition of self-harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of disordered eating.|$|E
500|$|Soring can be also {{detected}} by observing the horse for lameness, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers evaded detection from inspectors by training horses not {{to react to}} the pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching after the sored area is touched. The practice is called [...] "stewarding", in reference to the horse show steward. Others use topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine and benzocaine, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Use of chemicals can be completely avoided if pressure shoeing is also used. This process involves placing some type of hard foreign object (such as a small piece of wood, stone, hard acrylic, or <b>sharp</b> <b>object</b> such as a tack or nail) against the sole of the horse's foot before applying the horseshoe and pads. [...] It can also be done by trimming down the horse's hoof to its sensitive structures, then shoeing. Either method causes pain when the horse places its foot on the ground.|$|E

[...] In his dungeon, Mulder is given a <b>sharp</b> <b>object</b> by other prisoner, who had built it to commit suicide. When all the prisoners are taken out and are arranged in a line, Mulder sees Krycek talking to one of the captors and runs toward them, tackling them. Mulder then steals a truck and flees with a unconscious Krycek in the back of it; a pursuit by his captors ensues. As Mulder drives the truck, Krycek awakes and jumps off it. Mulder, having been unable to stop it, runs it off the road and it crashes. Mulder quickly makes {{his way out of the}} truck and hides under the dry leaves, while Krycek is found by a group of men whose left arms have all been amputated and has his arm forcibly severed to prevent his involvements in black oil vaccination tests.|$|E
2500|$|Puncture: [...] <b>Sharp</b> <b>object</b> penetrates {{the tissue}} and travels inward, {{but does not}} move {{laterally}} in any direction {{from the point of}} entry. [...] Such wounds can be misleading, as they may appear quite small on surface examination, but extend quite deeply into the body, even damaging nerves, blood vessels, or internal organs. [...] They may cause substantial internal bleeding or secondary injuries, such as a collapsed lung, which may not be readily evident during primary assessment. [...] Occasionally, the object causing the injury remains in the wound as an impaled object. A stab wound from a knife or other <b>sharp</b> <b>object,</b> or a bullet wound, are examples of this type of injury. [...] Medical professionals usually refer to this type of wound as penetrating trauma.|$|E
