40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the effect of irrigation depths on fiber quality of upland cotton, an experiment was conducted from July to December 2010 in Barbalha-CE, Brazil. The treatments consisted of a factorial combination of two upland cotton cultivars (BRS Aroeira and BRS Araripe) and five irrigation depths (260. 93, 418. 93, 514. 21, 711. 81 and 894. 68 mm), arranged in a split-plot design with four replicates. A line-source sprinkler irrigation system was used and irrigation depth in the control treatment was calculated according to the crop evapotranspiration. The analysed fiber quality variables were: fiber percentage, length, uniformity, short-fiber index, resistance, elongation at rupture, micronaire index, maturity, degree of yellowing, reflectance degree and <b>count</b> <b>strength</b> <b>product</b> (CSP) index. The irrigation depths influenced fiber length, short-fiber index, strength, micronaire index, maturity and reflectance degree. The cultivars influenced fiber percentage, length and color (degree of yellowing). The best results of fiber quality were found with irrigation depths of 514. 21 and 418. 93 mm for the upland cotton cultivars BRS Araripe and BRS Aroeira, respectively. 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Textbooks on program {{verification}} {{make use}} of simple programs in mathematical domains as illustrative examples. Mechanical verification tools can give students a quicker way to learn, because the feedback cycle can be reduced from days (waiting for hand-proofs to be graded by the teaching assistant) to seconds or minutes (waiting for the tool’s output). However, the mathematical domains that are so familiar to students (for example, sum-comprehensions) are not directly supported by first-order SMT solvers. This paper presents a technique for translating common comprehension expres-sions (sum, <b>count,</b> <b>product,</b> min, and max) into verification conditions that can be tackled by two first-order SMT solvers. The technique has been im-plemented in the Spec # program verifier.
