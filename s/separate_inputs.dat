50|$|Coincidence {{detection}} {{relies on}} <b>separate</b> <b>inputs</b> converging {{on a common}} target. Consider a basic neural circuit with two input neurons, A and B, that have excitatory synaptic terminals converging on a single output neuron, C (Fig. 1). If each input neuron's EPSP is subthreshold for an action potential at C, then C will not fire unless the two inputs from A and B are temporally close together. Synchronous arrival of these two inputs may push the membrane potential of a target neuron over the threshold required to create an action potential. If the two inputs arrive too far apart, the depolarization of the first input may have time to drop significantly, preventing the membrane potential of the target neuron from reaching the action potential threshold. This example incorporates the principles of spatial and temporal summation. Furthermore, coincidence detection can reduce the jitter formed by spontaneous activity. While random sub-threshold stimulations by neuronal cells may not often fire coincidentally, coincident synaptic inputs derived from a unitary external stimulus will ensure that a target neuron fires {{as a result of}} the stimulus.|$|E

40|$|The general {{aim of the}} United Nation Millennium {{program is}} to reduce poverty in poor {{countries}} by half in 2015. This can be achieved through economic growth or redistribution or both. While redistribution without growth is win-lose, growth lead poverty reduction is a win-win to different members of a society. This thesis investigates the relationship between productivity, {{one of the main}} source of economic growth other than factor accumulation, and human capital. They have some ambiguous relationship. Some found a positive and others found negative effect of human capital on productivity. Here in this thesis, I tried to see the effect of human capital on productivity. I do that in two ways. First by taking human capital as a facilitator of the adaption of new technologies rather than taking it as a <b>separate</b> <b>input</b> (Nelson-Phelps Hypothesis). Second, I tested the direct effect of it by taking it as a <b>separate</b> <b>input.</b> The data I use to test this fact focuses on Ethiopia. I use health and education spending as a proxy of human capital of the country. The result will help guide the country’s economy policy aimed at promoting growth and save people from misery due to poor economic performance. I found that human capital has a positive influence on facilitating the adaption of new technologies. I found this result by testing the Nelson-Phelps Hypothesis. When I took human capital as a <b>separate</b> <b>input,</b> still it has a positive and significant effect on productivity. The elasticity of human productivity with respect to human capital is approximately 2 suggesting the presence of human capital externalities.

5000|$|In 1982, Celestion broke {{new ground}} in {{loudspeaker}} technology when they presented the SL6, a compact hi-fi speaker featuring {{the first ever}} metal dome tweeter, made of copper and designed {{with the help of}} laser interferometry. They followed this model up with the SL600, which used rigid honeycomb alloy called Aerolam instead of wood in the speaker casing; a material previously used only in the aerospace industry. Both these speaker models, while highly regarded as [...] "breakthrough" [...] designs with outstanding high-frequency clarity, are also known for a somewhat [...] "depressed" [...] sounding high-frequency range, {{as a result of the}} relatively heavy copper dome tweeter. Later iterations of this design deployed a similar tweeter, but with the dome made out of aluminum, a much lighter and more efficient driver, which allowed for a more balanced output with the woofer. The aluminium-domed versions, in the standard cabinet (MDF and wood veneer) were designated as the SL6s, and then (with an improved crossover and woofer surround) the SL6si; The aluminium-domed models using the Aerolam cabinet (the honeycomb alloy) were designated as the SL700 and the (improved) SL700SE which dual inputs—i.e., <b>separate</b> <b>inputs</b> for woofer and tweeter (allowing for bi-amping or bi-wiring). Around that same era, another version of the copper-domed model, with both the Aerolam cabinet and improved crossover elements, was marketed as the SL600si, also with dual inputs. Finally, in 1992, Celestion produced the final variation of this design, as the Ten Year [...] "Anniversary Edition" [...] Model 100, which featured a conventional, but highly refined MDF / wood veneer cabinet, dual inputs, updated mounted plates, an improved crossover, the improved woofer design, and a variation of the aluminium tweeter with an updated faceplate.|$|E

In particular, capital is either a complement or a substitute for labor, different types of labor are either complements or substitutes for one another, and these roles are essentially fixed. Changes in the supply of each input can of course affect marginal products, but each factor’s “purpose” in the production function is both distinct and static.|$|E
