5|$|Daniel Leonard Dworsky (born October 4, 1927) is an American architect. He is {{a longstanding}} {{member of the}} American Institute of Architects College of Fellows. Among other works, Dworsky {{designed}} Crisler Arena, the basketball arena at the University of Michigan named for Dworsky's former football coach, Fritz Crisler. Other professional highlights include designing Drake Stadium at UCLA, the Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles and the Block M <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> at Michigan Stadium. He is also known for a controversy with Frank Gehry over the Walt Disney Concert Hall.|$|E
5|$|The Cowshed houses away fans at Prenton Park, {{and has a}} {{capacity}} of 2,500. It has a slanted <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement,</b> caused by the main road running behind it. It historically housed the more vocal home fans, but was switched to away supporters around {{the start of the}} 21st century. Since the change, a bar and TV screens {{have been added to the}} stand. The name is derived from its appearance before the redevelopment in 1995. With a 3 peak roof of corrugated iron, walls of wooden plank and a cinder bank floor it visually resembled an agricultural building.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{full-size}} mock-up inspection in April 1949 {{was generally}} favorable, range again became a concern since the J40s and early model J57s had excessive fuel consumption. Despite talk of another revision of specifications {{or even a}} full design competition among aircraft manufacturers, General LeMay, {{now in charge of}} Strategic Air Command, insisted that performance should not be compromised due to delays in engine development. In a final attempt to increase range, Boeing created the larger 464-67, stating that once in production, the range could be further increased in subsequent modifications. Following several direct interventions by LeMay, Boeing was awarded a production contract for thirteen B-52As and seventeen detachable reconnaissance pods on 14 February 1951. The last major design change—also at General LeMay's insistence—was a switch from the B-47 style tandem seating to a more conventional side-by-side cockpit, which increased the effectiveness of the copilot and reduced crew fatigue. Both XB-52 prototypes featured the original tandem <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> with a framed bubble-type canopy.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the work}} of , {{solutions}} to the ménage problem {{took the form of}} first finding all <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the women and then counting, for each of these partial <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the number of ways of completing it by seating the men away from their partners. However, as Bogart and Doyle showed, Touchard's formula may be derived directly by considering all <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> at once rather than by factoring out the participation of the women.|$|R

5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E

25|$|Having {{purchased}} {{large numbers}} of second-hand buses from China Motor Bus, New World First Bus started an extensive program to refurbish them. The floor, handrails, lighting system and seating layout were all upgraded. The <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> of buses were slightly modified. A typical refurbished bus accommodated 10 fewer passengers than one before refurbishment.|$|E

25|$|There are {{currently}} {{a total of}} four principal configurations designed by Airbus Helicopters for the EC225. The passenger transport version has a crash-worthy <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> for up to 19 passengers with a high-density <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> accommodating up to 28 passengers available to be fitted. The VIP transport version has a large lounge with seating for up to 12 passengers and a cabin attendant. The emergency medical services (EMS) configuration has medical units for six stretchers and four seats for medical workers. The search and rescue (SAR) configuration allows space for search and rescue equipment with an operator seat, hoistman seat and up to eight rescue seats and three stretchers. While a single pilot is capable of controlling the aircraft under visual meteorical conditions, two pilots are used in a typical crew compliment and, dependent on role, a cabin attendant or flight engineer may also be present.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-two {{of these}} 4-car units were built for {{services}} on the Great Eastern Main Line. The units were constructed {{to a similar}} design to the third-rail Class 415 (4EPB) units introduced by the Southern Region a few years earlier. However, there were several differences, most notably a slightly different front cab and a different <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{multi-purpose}} sports venues, <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> must {{be adapted}} to suit different sports' requirements.

Mobile bleachers provide a lower-cost method of providing such seating with minimal site preparation requirements.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{enumeration}} of <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> of married couples around a circular table such that no spouses sit next to each other and no k consecutive persons are of the same gender. While the case of k= 2 corresponds to the classical problème des ménages with a well-studied solution, no closed-form expression for the number of <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> is known when k>= 3. We propose a novel approach for this type of problems based on enumeration of walks in certain algebraically weighted de Bruijn graphs. Our approach leads to new expressions for the menage numbers and their exponential generating function and allows one to efficiently compute the number of <b>seating</b> <b>arrangements</b> in general cases, which we illustrate in detail for the ternary case of k= 3...|$|R

The DC-9 was an all-new design, using two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines, and a T-tail. The DC-9 has a narrow-body fuselage design with a 5-abreast seating with {{a capacity of}} 80 to 135 passengers depending on <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> and aircraft version.|$|E

25|$|Like its DC-9/MD-80/MD-90 predecessors, the 717 has a 2+3 <b>seating</b> <b>arrangement</b> in {{the main}} economy class, {{providing}} only one middle seat per row, whereas other single-aisle twin jets, such as the Boeing 737 family and the Airbus A320 family, often have 3+3 arrangement with two middle seats per row. Unlike its predecessors, McDonnell Douglas decided not to offer the MD-95/717 with the boarding flexibility of aft airstairs, {{with the goal of}} maximizing fuel efficiency through the reduction and simplification of as much auxiliary equipment as possible.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1948, Temco’s president, Robert McCulloch, {{received}} an inquiry from the Philippine Government expressing {{an interest in}} a tandem trainer version of the Swift.

This TE-1A prototype was completed late in 1948. After initial flight tests a 145-hp Continental engine replaced the original 125-hp installation.|$|E
