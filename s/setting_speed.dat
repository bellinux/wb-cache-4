500|$|The 1950s jump {{started an}} {{industry}} of aftermarket add-ons for cars that continues today. The oldest aftermarket wheel company, American Racing, started in 1956 and still builds [...] "mag wheels" [...] (alloy wheels) for almost every car made. [...] Holley introduced the first modular four-barrel carburetor, which Ford {{offered in the}} 1957 Ford Thunderbird, and versions are still used by performance enthusiasts. Edelbrock started during the Great Depression and expanded after the war. They provided a variety of high performance parts for the new hot rodders, which was popular equipment for <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> records at Bonneville Salt Flats. Owners were no longer restricted to the original equipment provided by manufacturers, helping not only create the hot rod culture but also the foundation for cosmetic modifications. The creation and rapid expansion of the aftermarket {{made it possible for}} enthusiasts to personalize their automobiles.|$|E
500|$|However, {{in later}} years, {{the film has}} {{appeared}} periodically on lists of underrated films. Speed Racer was elected the third most underrated film of the 2000s by Den of Geek's N.P. Horton, which called it [...] "a game-changing film which redefined and reconceptualised the film form as we know it." [...] Nick Hyman, writing for Metacritic, included the film on its list of [...] "movies that critics got wrong" [...] calling it [...] "a cult classic in the making". It was described as [...] "nearly unmatched [...] insofar as action/adventure/family films go" [...] by Alejandro Stepenberg from JoBlo.com, while Slates Chris Wade named it [...] "an underrated masterpiece," [...] stating [...] "they [...] made a brilliant visual cartoon that dares to ask that you take it seriously." [...] Annalee Newitz of io9 analyzed the ten reasons why she believes the film to be an [...] "unsung masterpiece"; among them, the visuals, the humor, and even its political themes. Tor.com's Dexter Palmer considered {{the possibility that the}} film is a [...] "misunderstood art film", highlighting its color scheme that is a [...] "pleasure" [...] and the fact it does not try to seem real. Palmer lauded it because he does not think films must imitate reality, and ultimately said it is [...] "an extreme reminder of what films, and especially fantasy and science fiction films, can place on screen" [...] and that it is [...] "a refreshing change of pace" [...] in film industry. Collider's Kayti Burt ranked it at #30 of Best Hollywood Blockbusters of the 21st Century stating, [...] "While other blockbusters of the year (and the decade) worked to ground their fantastical premises in a gritty, realistic <b>setting,</b> <b>Speed</b> Racer leaned hard in the other direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> {{records on}} test tracks, the DJJ2, DJF2 and other domestically-produced {{high-speed}} trains were insufficiently reliable for commercial operation. [...] The State Council turned to advanced technology abroad but made clear in directives that China's HSR expansion cannot only benefit foreign economies. [...] China's expansion {{must also be}} used to develop its own high-speed train building capacity through technology transfers. The State Council, MOR and state-owned train builders, the China North Car (CNR) and China South Car (CSR) used China's large market and competition among foreign train-makers to induce technology transfers.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic <b>Set</b> <b>Speed</b> Type: The dynamic <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> {{uses the}} GPS {{position}} of speed limit signs, from a database. Some are modifiable by the driver. At least one, Wikispeedia, incorporates crowdsourcing, so driver input is shared, improving the database for all users.|$|R
50|$|All {{cruise control}} systems must {{be capable of}} being turned off both {{explicitly}} and automatically when the driver depresses the brake, and often also the clutch. Cruise control often includes a memory feature to resume the <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> after braking, and a coast feature to reduce the <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> without braking. When the cruise control is engaged, the throttle can still be used to accelerate the car, but once the pedal is released the car will then slow down until it reaches the previously <b>set</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R

2500|$|With {{the capital}} {{infusion}} from incorporation, the Allaire Iron Works remained productive through the 1840s. In this period, engines were supplied for steamboats such as Isaac Newton in 1846, C. Vanderbilt in 1847, and Commodore in 1848 (the {{names for the}} latter two reflecting Vanderbilt's growing influence in the company). Engines were also supplied for the sister ships Bay State and Empire State in 1846-47, the former {{of which was the}} fastest boat on Long Island Sound for some years. In 1849-50, the Allaire Works supplied the engines for two of the original four Collins Line steamers, [...] and [...] The engines for these two vessels were of the side-lever type, with Pacific having a 95-inch cylinder and 9-foot stroke, and Baltic a 96-inch cylinder and 10 foot stroke.

However, it was then necessary to introduce the Land Transport (Speed Limits Validation) Bill in 2015 to confirm the legitimacy of the previous changes.|$|E
50|$|The State Traffic Commission {{typically}} sets {{speed limits}} following engineering studies performed by CONNDOT. Data used in <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits includes traffic volume vs. roadway capacity, design speed, road geometry, the spacing of intersections and/or interchanges, {{the number of}} driveways and curb cuts, and accident rates.|$|E

5000|$|Speed control/Velocity {{constant}} - dynamometer {{holds the}} <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> regardless of force or other parameters. For example, if a vehicle tries to accelerate in this mode, dynamometer applies opposite force to maintain <b>set</b> constant <b>speed.</b> This mode {{is used for}} example in the static power measurement.|$|R
5000|$|A hit-and-miss {{engine is}} a type of {{four-stroke}} internal combustion engine that is controlled by a governor to operate a <b>set</b> <b>speed.</b> It was conceived in the late 19th century and produced by various companies from the 1890s through approximately the 1940s. The name comes from the speed control on these engines: they are designed to fire ("hit") only when operating at or below a <b>set</b> <b>speed,</b> and to cycle without firing ("miss") when they exceed their <b>set</b> <b>speed.</b> This is as compared to the [...] "throttle governed" [...] method of speed control. The sound made when the engine is running without a load is a distinctive [...] "POP whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh POP" [...] as the engine fires and then coasts until the speed decreases and it fires again to maintain its average speed.|$|R

50|$|County councils remain {{responsible}} for {{local and regional}} roads, as well as various tasks like <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits. The NRA, meanwhile, was {{responsible for}} the planning, maintenance and construction of National Primary Routes and National Secondary Routes as well as establishing safety measures. Ireland's national road network consists of 2739 km of National Primary Routes and 2676 km of National Secondary Routes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> can be {{increased}} by using impure limestone in the kiln, to form a hydraulic lime that will set on contact with water. Such a lime must be stored as a dry powder. Alternatively, a pozzolanic material such as calcined clay or brick dust may {{be added to the}} mortar mix. Addition of a pozzolanic material will make the mortar set reasonably quickly by reaction with the water.|$|E

They felt the price of $1,800 (£895) was too high, and technical details (like vertically-split crankcases and a pushrod OHV valve train were too conventional.

50|$|Sailing as a sport {{involves}} {{a variety of}} competitive sailing formats that are sanctioned through various sailing federations and yacht clubs. Racing disciplines include matches within a fleet of sailing craft, between a pair thereof or among teams. Additionally, there are specialized competitions that include <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> records. Racing formats include both closed courses and point-to-point contests; they may be in sheltered waters, coast-wise or on the open ocean. Most competitions are held within defined classes or ratings that either entail one type of sailing craft to ensure a contest primarily of skill or rating the sailing craft to create classifications or handicaps.|$|E
