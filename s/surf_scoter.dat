40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>Surf</b> <b>Scoters</b> (Melanitta perspicillata) was studied on staging {{grounds in}} spring of 2006 and compared to behaviour on moulting grounds later that summer. Moulting <b>Surf</b> <b>Scoters</b> have a distinct activity pattern {{in comparison to}} those on spring staging grounds. During moult, foraging occurs mainly {{in the morning and}} evening, whereas during the spring a similar proportion of birds foraged at all periods of the day. Birds having recently initiated moult foraged significantly less that on staging grounds. However, as moult progressed, this discrepancy disappeared. In addition, we tracked the movements of flightless <b>Surf</b> <b>Scoters</b> using satellite telemetry during the 2006 wing-moult period. Despite their reduced mobility, <b>Surf</b> <b>Scoters</b> are able to swim long distances while flightless. However, the majority of their activities are carried out within small core areas. This study also indicates that satellite telemetry can be used effectively to track the daily movements of wildlife...|$|R
40|$|North American scoter {{populations have}} {{declined}} by approximately 60 % {{over the last}} 30 - 50 years. Prior studies of other sea duck species suggest that trace elements can have deleterious effects on overall body condition. For <b>surf</b> <b>scoters</b> (Melanitta perspicillatta) and white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca), this study tested the following hypotheses: (1) Trace element accumulation differs among seasons, locations, and species; (2) Increased trace elements in tissues correlate with declines in body condition; (3) <b>Surf</b> <b>scoters</b> that shift their feeding to a higher trophic level in spring bioaccumulate higher levels of trace elements; and (4) Selenium and mercury co-accumulate in a 1 : 1 molar ratio. To test these hypotheses, cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and selenium (Se) in livers and kidneys were collected from adult male <b>surf</b> <b>scoters</b> and white-winged scoters in December 2005 and March 2006 from three locations in Puget Sound, Washington. Trace elements in <b>surf</b> <b>scoters</b> differed among locations, and seasons. Se and Cd in liver and kidney explained 21 % {{of the variance in}} a matrix of body condition factors in <b>surf</b> <b>scoters.</b> In white-winged scoters, body condition differed between March and December, but trace elements in tissues did not, indicating that contaminants did not explain changes in condition. Thus, hypotheses 1 and 2 received partial support while hypothesis 3 did not. Finally, Se and Hg did not covary in either the kidney or liver of either species (hypothesis 4). Compared to other marine birds, scoters in this study contained low contaminant levels. Nonetheless, inorganic contaminants explained substantial variation in body condition of <b>surf</b> <b>scoters,</b> and potentially contribute to their population declines. These findings suggest that inorganic contaminants, particularly Cd, should be considered in assessing habitat quality for sea ducks...|$|R

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{movement patterns}} and foraging effort of <b>surf</b> <b>scoters</b> wintering in two sites with shellfish aquaculture, one with clam {{and the other}} with mussel prey. Scoters at the clam site exhibited very little movement and high site fidelity, whereas scoters in the mussel habitats exhibited much larger movements. These habitat-specific movement patterns were likely related to temporal patterns of prey availability; clams remained relatively stable while mussels declined dramatically, depleted by scoters. Mussels occurring on aquaculture structures were novel prey favoured by foraging sea ducks because they occurred in higher densities with less defensive morphology than intertidal mussels. <b>Surf</b> <b>scoters</b> did not respond to depletion of these mussels by intensifying foraging efforts but rather moved to alternate feeding areas. Though shellfish aquaculture has modified habitats in coastal British Columbia, these changes have not compromised scoter foraging opportunities and, in some cases, have improved the availability and quality of prey...|$|R

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{movements and}} site use by two scoter species during late winter and spring. In the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, I found that radio-transmitter-tagged pre-migratory <b>surf</b> <b>scoters</b> (Melanitta perspicillata) and white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca) left {{the areas where}} they had spent the winter and moved to Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) spawn sites coincident with spawn availability in March. In southeast Alaska, I identified stopover and staging sites of satellite-transmitter-tagged migrating <b>surf</b> <b>scoters</b> and identified one site, Lynn Canal, as particularly important. I found that herring spawn availability and proximity to the mainland coast were strong predictors of site use, suggesting that the resource availability and geography of southeast Alaska provide important stopover habitat for migrants. Overall, there was strong phenological correspondence between the northward progression of scoter migration and herring spawn availability, suggesting that herring spawn is a valuable resource for scoters in late winter and spring...|$|R
40|$|I {{quantified}} diet {{composition and}} foraging behaviors of <b>Surf</b> <b>Scoters</b> and Whitewinged Scoters wintering in Baynes Sound, British Columbia. Manila and varnish clams were the predominant prey of both scoter species. Manila clams decreased in density {{over the winter}} period, while pronounced declines were not detected for varnish clam density. Estimates of clam consumption by scoters accounted for most of observed declines in combined abundance of Manila and varnish clams. Clam capture success of both scoter species and foraging effort of <b>Surf</b> <b>Scoters</b> were unrelated to variation in clam density, while White-winged Scoter foraging effort was negatively related to clam density. Observed clam densities were apparently high enough to not elicit strong behavioral shifts in foraging scoters. Further, scoters rarely foraged at night, sufficiently meeting energetic requirements during diurnal hours. These combined results suggest that Baynes Sound constituted high-quality winter habitat in which scoters were not constrained by food availability...|$|R

40|$|Social organisms form {{striking}} aggregation patterns, displaying cohesion, polarization, {{and collective}} intelligence. Determining {{how they do}} so in nature is challenging; a plethora of simulation studies displaying life-like swarm behavior lack rigorous comparison with actual data because collecting field data of sufficient quality has been a bottleneck. Here, we {{bridge this gap by}} gathering and analyzing a high-quality dataset of flocking <b>surf</b> <b>scoters,</b> forming well-spaced groups of hundreds of individuals on the water surface. By reconstructing each individual's position, velocity, and trajectory, we generate spatial and angular neighbor-distribution plots, revealing distinct concentric structure in positioning, a preference for neighbors directly in front, and strong alignment with neighbors on each side. We fit data to zonal interaction models and characterize which individual interaction forces suffice to explain observed spatial patterns. Results point to strong short-range repulsion, intermediate-range alignment, and longer-range attraction (with circular zones), as well as a weak but significant frontal-sector interaction with one neighbor. A best-fit model with such interactions accounts well for observed group structure, whereas absence or alteration in any one of these rules fails to do so. We find that important features of observed flocking <b>surf</b> <b>scoters</b> can be accounted for by zonal models with specific, well-defined rules of interaction...|$|R

50|$|Profilicollis altmani is {{a species}} of acanthocephalan parasite, also {{described}} as Profilicollis kenti and Profilicollis texensis, although the status of this parasite is not fully resolved. This parasite first develops in the haemocoel of Emerita spp. mole crabs, in North and South America. After infection of the mole crab (the intermediate host), the parasite becomes a dormant cystacanth until the crab is eaten by a suitable bird, such as the <b>surf</b> <b>scoter</b> Melanitta perspicillata or herring gull, Larus argentatus (the final or definitive host). Once the parasite cystacanth has passed through the stomach of the bird, it develops into the adult worm and attaches to the intestines of the bird. Eggs produced by the parasite are released from the bird with bird feces and enter the ocean. Here the eggs are transported by the currents until they are accidentally ingested by a filter-feeding mole crab. Interestingly, Profilicollis altmani has become the subject of increasing research {{as it has been}} discovered that this parasite is contributing to a substantial proportion of the deaths of the southern sea otter, Enhydra lutris nereis. Between 1998 and 2001, between 13% and 16.2% of sea otter carcasses found around central California {{the cause of death was}} determined to be a direct result of acanthocephalan peritonitis, caused by this species of parasite. Several decades ago, the proportion of sea otters dying because of these parasites was almost negligible. Most of the sea otters that were found to be killed by infections by Profilicollis altmani were either young juvenile or older female otters, and it is hypothesized that they feed on sand crabs because they are less skilled at foraging or because of a decrease in their preferred prey.|$|E
40|$|In {{research}} on sea ducks, winter {{age and sex}} ratios provide valuable demographic data {{that are difficult to}} obtain by other means. Our objectives were to determine spatial, temporal, and density-related variability in (1) age and sex ratios for five sea duck species and (2) proportions of adult males for eight species that winter in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada. Kilometre-long shoreline sections (n = 49 – 62) were surveyed in early February in three years: 2003, 2004, and 2014. Annual estimates for male age ratio (first year:adult male) varied significantly for Black Scoter Melanitta americana (0. 071 to 0. 170), <b>Surf</b> <b>Scoter</b> M. perspicillata (0. 064 to 0. 101) and Harlequin Duck Histrionicus histrionicus (0. 068 to 0. 138). Regional differences in male age ratio were found for Barrow’s Goldeneye Bucephala islandica (0. 034 to 0. 197) and Common Goldeneye B. clangula (0. 033 to 0. 165), and more complex interactions were found between regions by year for <b>Surf</b> <b>Scoter.</b> Sex ratios were less variable than age ratios and varied consistently by year and region only for Common Goldeneye.
