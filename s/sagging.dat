40|$|We have {{identified}} three novel Toxoplasma gondii proteins showing close structural similarity to molecules of the <b>SAG</b> 1 family, {{a group of}} glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored surface antigens expressed by the invasive stages of T. gondii. The novel proteins, denominated <b>SAG</b> 5 A, <b>SAG</b> 5 B and <b>SAG</b> 5 C, are encoded by tandemly arrayed and tightly clustered genes containing no introns. The 367 amino acid-long <b>SAG</b> 5 B and <b>SAG</b> 5 C are 97. 5 % identical to each other, whereas <b>SAG</b> 5 A (362 amino acids) consists of a C-terminal domain sharing 98 % identity with <b>SAG</b> 5 B and <b>SAG</b> 5 C, and an N-terminal domain whose identity to the other <b>SAG</b> 5 polypeptides is only 42 %. Expression analysis of the T. gondii strains RH (virulent) and 76 K (avirulent) showed that {{all members of the}} <b>SAG</b> 5 cluster are transcribed in T. gondii tachyzoites and bradyzoites. However, immunoblot studies on the RH strain revealed that the synthesis of <b>SAG</b> 5 A does not occur in tachyzoites and is possibly controlled at the post-transcriptional level. On the contrary, <b>SAG</b> 5 B and <b>SAG</b> 5 C were detected by immunoblot in tachyzoite lysates and found to migrate in the 40 - 45 kDa range under reducing conditions or at approximately 34 kDa under unreduced conditions. Triton X- 114 partitioning of tachyzoite protein lysates treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C indicated that <b>SAG</b> 5 B and <b>SAG</b> 5 C are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane-associated molecules. Consistently, immunofluorescence analysis of transformed tachyzoites over-expressing <b>SAG</b> 5 B or <b>SAG</b> 5 C showed that these molecules are targeted to the parasite surface.

40|$|Abstract: Voltage <b>sags</b> {{are caused}} by faults which cause {{equipment}} trips. Different equipment have voltage sensitivity thresholds, and when voltage <b>sags</b> are below that specific threshold, they can lead to interruption of supply, and as a result, they will result in financial losses. In this dissertation, the impact of distributed generation (DG) on voltage <b>sag</b> performance is investigated. Using a stochastic approach, voltage <b>sag</b> performance is assessed by using a method of fault position to determine profiles of magnitudes of remaining voltages at a monitoring point. From these, the expected number of critical voltage <b>sags</b> at a monitoring point are calculated, and the expected cost of these <b>sags</b> is derived for various voltage sensitivity threshold limits. An illustrative study is carried out comparing the voltage <b>sag</b> performance and expected costs of voltage <b>sags</b> for a network without DG and a DG Case for various mixes of customers. It was shown that {{in the presence of}} DG, the expected number of critical voltage <b>sags</b> was lower for all voltage sensitivity criteria assumed and for all customer mixes.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown the surface of Toxoplasma gondii to be {{dominated}} by a family of proteins closely related to <b>SAG</b> 1. In this study, we report the existence of a second family of genes defined by homology to <b>SAG</b> 2. The predicted amino acid sequences of these three new proteins suggests that they are all glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked surface antigens.

We hypothesized both that DFU S. aureus will produce large <b>SAg</b> numbers, consistent with skin infections, and that certain <b>SAgs</b> will be overrepresented. We assessed the <b>SAg</b> and α-toxin profile of isolates from patients with DFU, compared with profiles of isolates from other sources. MATERIALS: Twenty-five S. aureus isolates from patients with DFU were characterized. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect genes for methicillin-resistance and <b>SAgs.</b> Some <b>SAgs</b> and the α-toxin were quantified. We compared the <b>SAg</b> profile of DFU isolates with <b>SAg</b> profiles of S. aureus isolates from skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis and from vaginal mucosa of healthy individuals. RESULTS: Most DFU isolates were methicillin susceptible (64 %), with USA 100 the most common clonal group. The <b>SAg</b> gene profile of DFU isolates most closely resembled that of isolates from patients with atopic dermatitis, with {{the highest number of}} different <b>SAg</b> genes per isolate and a high prevalence of staphylococcal enterotoxin D and the enterotoxin gene cluster.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, power quality has been {{recognised}} asa global problem. Among {{different types of}} power qualityproblems, voltage <b>sags</b> have been identified {{to be one of}} themost severe problems for different process industries. The mostcommon reason to voltage <b>sags</b> is lightning strikes in powerlines. Protection equipment, usually located at switchyards,disconnect faulted power lines as soon as possible, which isapproximately 100 ms. Thus, the duration of voltage <b>sags</b> areapproximately 100 ms. The sensitivity to voltage <b>sags</b> ofelectrical equipment in process industries can be observed asfor instance malfunction, automatic turnoff or damages. This thesis gives an overview of three metals processes withfocus on the sensitivity to voltage <b>sags</b> and interruptions. Theinherent energy in the process is used to find the sensitivity. This energy may also be used to obtain "ride-through" for theprocesses. The three metals processes are a blast furnaceprocess, a hot rolling mill process and a cold rolling millprocess. The main attention in this thesis is paid to the blastfurnace process, which is powered by a line-operatedsynchronous machine. The thesis shows that the protection equipment forelectrical machines can be adjusted to avoid unnecessaryshutdowns. It is also explained why there are high torque andcurrents during voltage <b>sags</b> as well as after voltage <b>sags.</b> Itis shown that the first peak torque and current during thevoltage <b>sags</b> is almost proportional to the voltage change, thatis the voltage magnitude before the voltage <b>sag</b> minus thevoltage magnitude during the voltage <b>sag.</b> The first peak torqueand current after the voltage <b>sag</b> depends sinusoidal-like onthe duration of the voltage <b>sag</b> and almost proportional to thevoltage change during the voltage <b>sag.</b> There is no fluxsaturation during voltage <b>sags,</b> however after voltage sagssaturation is very likely to occur. The thesis explains why andalso how the flux is changed during and after voltage <b>sags.</b> The duration of voltage <b>sags</b> is in many cases set by theprotection equipment located in switchyards. It is shown thatthe durations of voltage <b>sags</b> can be changed to durations thatwill cause less peak torque and current after voltage <b>sags</b> forline-operated AC-machines. It is also shown how this istheoretically achieved.

40|$|Reliability {{measures}} of SAIDI (system average interruption duration index) and SAIFI (system average frequency index) are well established industry standards used world wide.

40|$|Abstract — Voltage <b>sag</b> {{is among}} the major power quality {{disturbances}} that can cause substantial loss of product and also can attribute to malfunctions, instabilities and shorter lifetime of the load. Accurate voltage <b>sag</b> source location can help to minimize the loss and problems caused by voltage <b>sag</b> in a power distribution system. This paper presents a development of a current component index (CCI) algorithm to locate the source of voltage <b>sag</b> in a power distribution system. The product of the RMS current and the power factor angle at the monitoring point is employed for the <b>sag</b> source location. A graph of this product against time is plotted. The voltage <b>sag</b> source location is determined by examining {{the magnitude of the}} current component index {{at the beginning of the}} <b>sag.</b> If the magnitude of the CCI during <b>sag</b> is higher than the magnitude of CCI before <b>sag,</b> it indicates that the voltage <b>sag</b> source is in front of the monitoring point. On the other hand if the magnitude of the CCI during <b>sag</b> is lower than the magnitude of CCI before <b>sag,</b> it indicates that the voltage <b>sag</b> source is in behind the monitoring point. The proposed method has been verified by simulations on a radial distribution system.

40|$|Problem statement: Process {{continuity}} of industrial plants (like a refinery) {{is subjected to}} several shutdowns due to voltage <b>sags</b> causing large induction motors to trip, either by undervoltage or by overcurrent relays, sometimes by the mechanical protection. These unplanned shutdowns cost the plant {{tens of thousands of}} dollars per shutdown in addition to material damage costs, restart charges and any penalties due to delay in product delivery and shipping. Approach: The behavior of induction motors during voltage <b>sags</b> was investigated. In addition to the well-known parameters of voltage <b>sags</b> (time and duration), other parameters such as three-phase unbalance, point on the wave of <b>sag</b> occurrence, harmonics, loading percentage and pre-sag voltage were also examined through computer simulations using the MATLAB/SIMULINK toolbox. Motors&# 8217; ride-through capability during <b>sags</b> was also studied and guidelines for adjusting the protection relays of the induction motors were highlighted. Results: Results showed that response of induction motor to voltage <b>sags</b> is dependant on <b>sag</b> characteristics, as well as motor and load parameters. Three-phase voltage <b>sags</b> and <b>sags</b> occurring at zero crossing were the most severe events. Transient currents occurring at the instants of voltage <b>sag</b> and voltage recovery are directly proportional to the voltage drop, not to the remaining voltage magnitude. Transient currents and torques induced at the instant of <b>sag</b> recovery are higher than those induced at the instant of <b>sag</b> occurrence. Lightly-loaded motors and motors operated at voltages higher than the nominal voltage are less affected by voltage <b>sags.</b> Conclusion: Manufacturers of induction motors impose strict protection settings to protect their machines from any possible damage.
