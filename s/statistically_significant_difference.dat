5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and unproductive.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in {{the thickness of}} the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

It was found that there were <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> within Dörnyei’s L 2 motivational self system.

In the ideal L 2 self the faculty of law showed <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> from the faculties of science and technology, humanities and social sciences, agriculture and life sciences, education, and medicine. The ought-to self showed <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> between the faculty of law and the faculties education, and agriculture and life sciences. L 2 learning experiences showed differences between the faculties of education, and science and technology. Finally, intended effort showed <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> between the faculty of law and the faculties of education, and science and technology.

25|$|Researchers Irving Kirsch and Thomas Moore have contested the {{pharmacological}} {{activity of}} antidepressants in {{the relief of}} depression, and state that the evidence is most consistent a role as active placebos. Their study consisted of a meta analysis incorporating data from both published studies and unpublished data obtained from the FDA via a Freedom of Information Act request. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference,</b> but not one that is clinically significant. In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.|$|E
25|$|While {{direct support}} {{has not been}} found for these hypotheses, {{evidence}} that favours this theory exists. Further, while percentages of the likelihood of homosexuality have been estimated to be increased by 15–48% per older brother, these odds really account {{for only a few}} percent of the population; thus, this hypothesis cannot be universally applied to the majority of homosexual men. Not all studies have been able to reproduce the fraternal birth order effect. Some did not find any <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> in either the sibling composition or rate of older brothers of gay and straight men, including large, nationally representative studies in the US and Denmark.|$|E

The results also indicate that these three techniques have better MAP results than the benchmark (with <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences).</b> The CF-Jaccard, CF-Communities, and the Cluster-MWSCS-based techniques have results {{very close to the}} benchmark (without <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> when compared to the benchmark) but less than the three techniques with the best results—WSCS-based, the MWSCS-based, and Cluster-WSCS-based (with <b>differences</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> when compared to these three).

This can be interpreted in two ways. First, those buried outside the tomb were believed to have enjoyed better health because they were wealthier, and consequently, had better nutritional standards.

25|$|From the IAC {{minutes of}} December 4 and the earlier CIA {{documents}} it appears {{clear that the}} Robertson Panel was the outcome of recommendation (a) of the IAC decision but that this formed part of a wider intended programme of action aimed at enabling rapid positive identification of UFOs from an air defense perspective (i.e. identifying actual Soviet aircraft from misidentified natural phenomena or other conventional objects) {{and a desire to}} reduce reporting of UFOs, which were seen as clogging up air defense communication channels and created the risk of exploitation of this effect. The inter-relationships between these wider aspects of the CIA’s recommendations and the Battelle Memorial Institute's study, culminating in Blue Book Special Report 14, which identified a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between 'unknowns' and UFO reports that could subsequently be identified, or the study group referenced in a Canadian government document as operating as early as 1950 under the chairmanship of Dr Vannevar Bush, then head of the Joint Research and Development Board, to discover the ‘modus operandi’ of UFOs are unclear.|$|E
25|$|It was reported, in 1979, {{that there}} is a {{possible}} link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease, in people with the epsilon4 allele of the gene APOE. HSV-1 appears to be particularly damaging to the nervous system and increases one’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The virus interacts with the components and receptors of lipoproteins, which may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease. This research identifies HSVs as the pathogen most clearly linked to the establishment of Alzheimer’s. According to a study done in 1997, without the presence of the gene allele, HSV-1 does not appear to cause any neurological damage or increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. However, a more recent prospective study published in 2008 with a cohort of 591 people showed a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> between patients with antibodies indicating recent reactivation of HSV and those without these antibodies in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease, without direct correlation to the APOE-epsilon4 allele. It {{should be noted that the}} trial had a small sample of patients who did not have the antibody at baseline, so the results should be viewed as highly uncertain. In 2011 Manchester University scientists showed that treating HSV1-infected cells with antiviral agents decreased the accumulation of β-amyloid and P-tau, and also decreased HSV-1 replication.|$|E

Conducting meta-analyses of recent studies, she demonstrates that, while statistically significant differences in measures of mean risk aversion are sometimes found, the substantive size of these group-level differences tend to be small (on {{the order of a}} fraction of a standard deviation), and many other studies fail to find a <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> at all.
