40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a design study of the mobile transceiver, base <b>station,</b> and <b>gateway</b> <b>station</b> for NASA's proposed Mobile Satellite Experiment (MSAT-X). Major ground segment system design issues such as frequency stability control, modulation method, linear predictive coding vocoder algorithm, and error control technique are addressed. The modular and flexible transceiver design is described in detail, including the core, RF/IF, modem, vocoder, forward error correction codec, amplitude-companded single sideband, and input/output modules, as well as the flexible interface. Designs for a three-carrier base station and a 10 -carrier <b>gateway</b> <b>station</b> are also discussed, including the interface with the controllers and with the public-switched telephone networks at the <b>gateway</b> <b>station.</b> Functional specifications are given for the transceiver, the base <b>station,</b> and the <b>gateway</b> <b>station...</b>|$|R

Many of the shops, restaurants and cafés are new to the city including Cath Kidston, The White Company, Kiehls, Giraffe and Tapas Revolution. It reopened in September 2015 along with the modernised New Street Station.|$|E

50|$|In 2005 {{the square}} was renovated and relaid in Yorkshire stone. Two glass-cased fountains were {{installed}} outside the City Hall; these are illuminated at night, and several seated areas are also illuminated in colours that match the ground lighting {{of the nearby}} Millennium Square. The renovation won Gold in the 2006 Town Centre Environment Awards, run by the BCSC, held on 7 November 2006 in Manchester. Barkers Pool {{was one of two}} projects in Sheffield City Centre to be nominated, the other being the <b>Station</b> <b>gateway</b> at Howard Street.|$|E
50|$|He {{established}} his practice in 1878, and for 10 years worked {{in partnership with}} William de Morgan (1839-1917), for whom he designed tiles, vases, and other artefacts. He advocated the use of glazed materials to resist the polluted atmosphere of nineteenth century London. In this, he anticipated the designs of Otto Wagner in Vienna, who used coloured tiles set in the same planes as walls and piers to suggest architectural features. He designed several buildings, of which the best were the Howrah <b>Station,</b> <b>gateway</b> to Calcutta, situated in the twin city Howrah, district Howrah, West Bengal, India (1901; with a glowing exterior of brick and coloured tiles), and Debenham House in Holland Park (1905-8), completely faced with impervious glazed materials, even the roof-tiles. He was an Arts-and-Crafts architect, whose work was extraordinarily sensitive, imaginative, and original. Among his works his own house, ‘Woodside’, Graffham, near Petworth, Sussex (1905), deserves note.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Customary network {{migration}} to Next Generation Networks (NGN) {{is due to}} service integration and low cost of the offered services in NGN. NGN {{is based on an}} IP/MPLS backbone through which all traffics pass. Besides, different mobile generations up to R 99 UMTS are all based on the circuit switch systems. Thus the connections to NGN may cause some challenges. In this paper, to provide these connections, we review mobile systems characteristics in addition to a new Base Station System by the name Base <b>Station</b> <b>Gateway...</b>|$|E

The paper describes the algorithms employed in the MAC controller in terms of various components of a classical control system and a fuzzy tuning component. The focus of this work is on {{the solution of the}} MAC problem relative to the downstream uplink channel of the SATIP 6 satellite network, through the modeling approach proper to the Theory of Control. We conceive a situation where various connections flow from Internet into a Hub <b>Station</b> (<b>Gateway)</b> which broadcasts data towards the satellite, from where flows are redirected towards the various users...|$|E

50|$|Wireless {{wide area}} {{networks}} are wireless networks that typically cover large areas, such as between neighbouring towns and cities, or city and suburb. These networks {{can be used}} to connect branch offices of business or as a public Internet access system. The wireless connections between access points are usually point to point microwave links using parabolic dishes on the 2.4 GHz band, rather than omnidirectional antennas used with smaller networks. A typical system contains base <b>station</b> <b>gateways,</b> access points and wireless bridging relays. Other configurations are mesh systems where each access point acts as a relay also. When combined with renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic solar panels or wind systems they can be stand alone systems.|$|R
