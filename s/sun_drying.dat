5|$|Traditionally, <b>sun</b> <b>drying</b> {{has been}} used for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E
5|$|As {{everything}} {{depended on}} the final game, the Imperial Cricket Conference agreed that the match be played to a finish. Carr was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman, a decision which proved controversial in the press; Rhodes was also recalled to the team, aged 48. Amid huge public interest, the match was evenly balanced {{at the end of}} the second day when England began their second innings. Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning and few critics—including members of the home team—expected England to score many runs. But Hobbs and Sutcliffe, who had scored 49 on the second evening, began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot <b>sun</b> <b>drying</b> a damp pitch made batting even more hazardous. Concentrating on defence, but scoring whenever possible, the pair added 172 in total. Immediately after reaching 100, Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd. Many critics believed that, given the conditions, match situation and pressure, this was his greatest innings. England built up a large lead and bowled Australia out to win the Ashes. Late in the season, Hobbs made the highest score of his career, 316 not out for Surrey against Middlesex at Lord's, establishing a record individual innings for Lord's which survived until 1990. In total, Hobbs scored 2,949 runs at 77.60, including 12 centuries, to be placed first in the national batting averages.|$|E

25|$|As {{everything}} {{depended on}} the final game, the Imperial Cricket Conference agreed to a request that the match be played to a finish with time no object. The England selectors, conscious that the team had not beaten Australia in a series for 14 years, and had won just once in 19 Tests since 1920, made several changes. Carr was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman, a decision which proved enormously controversial in the press but of which Hobbs approved; Rhodes was also recalled to the team, aged 48. Amid huge public interest and excitement, the deciding match began; Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 53 on the first day, but after both sides had batted once, the match was evenly balanced {{at the end of}} the second day. Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning; batting became extremely difficult, and few critics—including members of the England team—expected England to score many runs. Instead, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, who had scored 49 on the second evening, began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot <b>sun</b> <b>drying</b> a damp pitch made batting even more hazardous. Concentrating on careful defence, but scoring where possible, the pair added 172 in total. Arthur Richardson, a spin bowler, was expected to be the main threat, but while it often looked like Hobbs would be dismissed, he faced most of Richardson's bowling and survived. Some critics believed that, through his batting, Hobbs had deliberately exaggerated the difficulties of facing Richardson to prevent the Australian captain putting on a more difficult bowler. Commentators praised the skilful defence of both batsmen, Hobbs in particular. Immediately after reaching 100, Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd. Many critics believed that, given the conditions, match situation and pressure, this was the greatest innings of Hobbs' career. England continued batting to build up a large lead and bowled Australia out to win the Ashes.|$|E
500|$|Bradman won the toss on New Year's Day 1937, {{but again}} failed with the bat, scoring just 13. The Australians {{could not take}} {{advantage}} of a pitch that favoured batting, and finished the day at 6/181. On the second day, rain dramatically altered the course of the game. With the <b>sun</b> <b>drying</b> the pitch (in those days, covers could not be used during matches) Bradman declared to get England in to bat while the pitch was [...] "sticky"; England also declared to get Australia back in, conceding a lead of 124. Bradman countered by reversing his batting order to protect his run-makers while conditions improved. The ploy worked and Bradman went in at number seven. In an innings spread over three days, he battled influenza while scoring 270 off 375balls, sharing a record partnership of 346 with Jack Fingleton, and Australia went on to victory. In 2001, Wisden rated this performance as the best Test match innings of all time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} of copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra {{can be made}} by smoke drying, <b>sun</b> <b>drying,</b> or kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying system [...] is also used to make drying process runs continuously, therefore it will reduce drying time. In hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night. <b>Sun</b> <b>drying</b> requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. [...] Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. [...] After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). [...] <b>Sun</b> <b>drying</b> is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. [...] This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages in both – starting with <b>sun</b> <b>drying</b> requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun. [...] In India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. [...] Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. [...] Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire. [...] The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.|$|E
