50|$|Robert's brother Cyrus Avery {{thought the}} {{invention}} had huge potential. To fund their company, Cyrus invested some capital, and Robert sold {{his share of}} the farm to his brother John and borrowed additional money. They began business as R.H. & C.M. Avery Company. Sales did not take off and the brothers' company teetered on bankruptcy. Robert moved his family to Kansas and took advantage of the Homestead Act of 1862 to obtain more farm land. He invented a new spiral corn <b>stalk</b> <b>cutter</b> and this time sales increased quickly. In 1872, Robert moved back to Galesburg and with his brother Cyrus' help, restarted the Avery Company. By 1874 he had a full size working model of his corn planter built. The original planter is now in the Edison Institute Museum at Ford's Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan.|$|E
40|$|Commercial corn {{production}} {{cannot be}} carried on by hand methods; {{it can be done}} only with machinery. Operating costs in corn production greatly depend upon the efficiency of labor, power and machinery management. Results obtained in a study of the use of labor, power and machinery at Ames are as follows: Raking and burning cornstalks before plowing in preparing a seedbed for corn required. 47 man-hour of labor and. 38 tractor-hour of power per acre and appeared to be largely a waste of labor and power. Cutting stalks with a <b>stalk</b> <b>cutter</b> before plowing required. 23 hour per acre for man and tractor with no apparent benefit. Disking before plowing took. 25 hour per acre for man and tractor and seemed to be of doubtful value...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial wilt (Ralstoniasolanacearum) is an {{extremely}} damaging disease of flue-cured tobacco in the southeastern USA. It is generally believed that R. solanacearum infects field-grown tobacco through the roots. Epidemics of bacterial wilt are so common within South Carolina that the organism must be spread in a more rapid and efficient manner than the movement of soil on equipment. Field trials conducted at the Pee Dee Research and Education Center measured the spread of R. solancearum down a row of tobacco from a point inoculation following machine flower removal (topping), leaf harvest or stalk cutting. Machine topping, leaf harvest and stalk cutting increased disease 879 %, 1245 %, and 800 % respectively within a 20 plant row when compared to hand topping, hand harvesting or a non contaminated <b>stalk</b> <b>cutter</b> (cv. K 326, P â‰¤ 0. 001). A survey was conducted to determine if R. solanacearum is a common contaminate on harvesting equipment in South Carolina. Tobacco harvesting equipment was randomly selected within Horry and Marion counties and sampled for R. solanacearum by streaking sterile cotton swabs on the harvester surface, then re-streaking the swab onto an enriched Tetrazolium-based selective media (SM 3). R. solanacearum-like colonies that developed on SM 3 were inoculated onto cv. Rutgers tomato to confirm pathogenicity. Bacteria from diseased plants were reisolated on SM 3 and R. solanacearum identity confirmed with an immuno strip test. Pathogenic populations of R. solanacearum were recovered from steel defoliator knives, rubber defoliators and steel guides (51, 50 and 50 % of sampled harvesters respectively). The survival of R. solanacearum on mechanical steel topper blades was determined by running the topper through infected tobacco plants and sequentially sampling the steel knives over time for viable populations of R. solanacearum. Sterile cotton swabs were swept across the blade surface, then streaked onto SM 3 media. Confirmed pathogenic populations of R. solanacearum could be recovered on SM 3 media for up to 6 h after topping R. solanacearum-infected tobacco. The efficiency of machine transmission of R. solanacearum and it's longevity on tobacco machinery {{may be responsible for}} the high frequency of bacterial wilt epidemics in flue-cured tobacco occurring in the Southeastern USA and its movement into previously clean fields...|$|E
50|$|Roths Industries, Inc. (1945-1960) was a {{manufacturer}} of small garden tractors and other agricultural equipment founded by Herbert C. Roths in Alma, Michigan. The company manufactured Garden King Walking Tractors, BesRo Riding Tractors, and Till Ro <b>Stalk</b> <b>Cutters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Robert was the {{inventor}} while Cyrus managed the business aspects. They operated out of Galesburg, Illinois until 1882, {{when they needed}} better access to railroad transportation and wider markets. [...] They bought into the oldest foundry in Peoria, owned by Joseph Frost. They then purchased 18 acre in Peoria, Illinois and moved the business there to North Adams and North Jefferson Streets adjacent to a railroad spur. They built a three-story manufacturing facility, producing check rowers, <b>stalk</b> <b>cutters,</b> corn planters, cultivators and hand tools. In 1883 the company was capitalized at US$200.000 and renamed the Avery Planter Company.|$|R
5000|$|When {{they began}} {{manufacturing}} powered tractors, they hired Albert Espe, {{one of the}} premier tractor designers in the country. In 1899, the company was reincorporated, the capital stock increased to US$600,000, and it was renamed the Avery Manufacturing Company. In 1891, they enlarged their product line to include steam traction engines and grain threshers, which would become up the majority of their business for the next 30 years. Their tractors used the best steam engines of the day, and the boilers were reinforced to withstand extra pressure. The line included unique tractors with top-mounted steam engines resembling locomotives more than typical farm tractors of the day. One of their yellow wood threshers were nicknamed the Yellow Fellow and remained {{a large part of the}} company's business for the next thirty years. Avery made a variety steam engines, including [...] , , [...] and [...] hp models. They also made Corn King and Corn Queen cultivators, separators, wagons, horse <b>stalk</b> <b>cutters</b> and a steel-mounted water tank.|$|R
5000|$|In 1912, {{the entire}} Avery Company plant covered more than twenty-seven acres. The company, {{progressive}} for its time, established a dispensary on site that was staffed five {{hours each day}} by two doctors. It also started its own insurance company about the same time. The main factory building and the associated warehouses covered another {{six and a half}} acres. The sections of the plant were joined by a company-designed trolley system used to transport parts. At the time, it manufactured steam and gasoline traction engines, mounted steel water tanks, self-lift plows, farm wagons, corn planters, traction hauling wagons, traction steam shovels, threshing machinery and all required attachments, riding and walking cultivators, single and double row <b>stalk</b> <b>cutters</b> and gasoline tractors. At its height, it called itself [...] "The Largest Tractor Company in the World" [...] and employed 2,600 men, manufacturing eight different tractors along with motor cultivators and trucks. The company offered a broad line of tractors and engines, ranging from one - row cultivator to a huge [...] tractor.|$|R
