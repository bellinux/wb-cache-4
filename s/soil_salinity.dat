We {{describe}} the wood structure of Aegiceras corniculatum and its differences under various <b>soil</b> <b>salinities.</b> This species had diffuse-porous wood with poorly defined growth rings. Vessels which had single perforations occurred abundantly and in multiples and were storeyed. Intervascular pits between contiguous vessels were alternate bordered ones while half-bordered pit-pairs existed between both vessel-ray and vessel-parenchyma. Homogenous xylem rays were multiseriate and uniseriate. Fiber-tracheids with bordered pits often had thinner walls. Xylem parenchyma cells were scant and distributed diffusely and paratracheally. Differences in the structural and quantitative characters of vessels, xylem rays and fiber-tracheids under diverse <b>soil</b> <b>salinities</b> are described...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{mangrove}} ecosystems {{that deal}} with the interaction of organisms and their environment very often draw conclusions based on only a restricted number of <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity</b> measurements. As inundation by salty water is the most typical characteristic of the mangrove environment, the authors addressed the temporal and spatial fluctuation of <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity</b> at seven locations in the mangrove forest of Gazi Bay, Kenya. As a pilot study, the research team measured <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity</b> twice a month, at neap tide and at spring tide, during one year. It can be concluded that the <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity</b> in mangrove forests can be highly variable in {{time as well as}} in space and depends on a complex interaction between inundation frequency, canopy closure, fresh water input and soil texture. Mangrove researchers should therefore pay attention to the differences in local site conditions inside the mangrove forest and conduct salinity measurements that cover the temporal and spatial fluctuations before drawing conclusions on the relationship to this environmental condition...|$|R
25|$|In general, {{facilitation}} is {{more likely}} to occur in physically stressful environments than in favorable environments, where competition {{may be the most important}} interaction among species. This can also occur in a single habitat containing a gradient from low to high stress. For example, along a New England, USA, salt marsh tidal gradient, a presence of black needle rush (Juncus gerardii) increased the fitness of marsh elder (Iva annua) shrubs in lower elevations, where <b>soil</b> <b>salinity</b> was higher. The rush shaded the soil, which decreased evapotranspiration, and in turn decreased <b>soil</b> <b>salinity.</b> However, at higher elevations where <b>soil</b> <b>salinity</b> was lower, marsh elder fitness was decreased in the presence of the rush, due to increased competition for resources. Thus, the nature of species interactions may shift with environmental conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of hurricane landfall {{in a given}} coastal stretch may play a more {{important role in the}} ecology of coastal forests than previously thought because of direct and indirect impacts of fallen trees and the introduction of salt water that lingers long after the storm passes.

These elevated salinities may contribute to delayed mortality of certain tree species and set the stage for eventual forest decline and dieback...|$|R

40|$|This study uses {{five years}} of field data from the Land Retirement Demonstration Project located in western Fresno County of California to develop a {{comprehensive}} theoretical and numerical modeling framework to evaluate the specific site conditions required for a sustainable land retirement ecosystem outcome based on natural drainage. Using field data, principles of mass balance in a control volume, the HYDRUS- 1 D Software Package for simulating one-dimensional movement of water, heat, and multiple solutes in variably-saturated media, and PEST, a modelindependent parameter optimizer, the processes of soil water and solute movement in root zone and the deep vadose zone were investigated. The optimization of unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters and downward flux (natural drainage) from the control volume against observed vadose zone salinity levels and shallow groundwater levels yield difficult to obtain natural drainage rate {{as a function of}} water table height within the control volume. The results show that unsaturated soil hydraulic properties and the downward flux from the soil profile are the critical parameters. A ‘natural drainage approach’ to sustainable land management for drainage impaired land is proposed. With this approach it is feasible to design a sustainable land use regimen for drainage impaired lands in general and retired lands in particular. Further analysis of data on the evolution of vadose zone salinity and perched water levels also show that effective unsaturated soil hydraulic property and the "natural drainage rate" change with average <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity.</b> The results show that at the same pressure head, soil water content is less with higher <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity</b> as compared to lower <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity.</b> It is thus concluded that the use of <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity</b> invariant <b>soil</b> water hydraulic parameters in numerical modeling can seriously compromise prediction, especially for a variable <b>soil</b> water <b>salinity</b> environment...|$|R
25|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>salinity</b> {{is often}} {{measured}} as the electric conductivity (EC) of the extract of a saturated soil paste (ECe). The EC units are usually expressed in millimho/cm or dS/m. The critical ECe value of 5.5 dS/m in the figure, obtained from measurements in farmers' fields, {{indicates that the}} rice crop is slightly salt sensitive.|$|E
25|$|Further, SaltMod {{gives the}} option of the re-use of {{drainage}} and well water (e.g. for irrigation) and it can account for farmers' response to waterlogging, <b>soil</b> <b>salinity,</b> water scarcity and over-pumping from the aquifer. Also it offers the possibility to introduce subsurface drainage systems at varying depths and with varying capacity {{so that they can}} be optimized.|$|E

Salt-tolerant plants include saltbush, a plant found {{in much of}} North America and in the Mediterranean regions of Europe.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, the dikes, or levees, of Suisun Marsh were {{originally}} built by nineteenth century farmers seeking to create farmland from tidal marsh. While {{this system is}} still in use on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta islands to the east, it failed in the Suisun Marsh due to unacceptably high <b>soil</b> <b>salinities.</b> Portions of the marsh were subsequently converted from farming to permanently and seasonally flooded wetlands in the twentieth century. Today, approximately 230 miles of levees maintain seasonally and permanently flooded wetlands. Between approximately mid-October and mid-January, managed seasonal wetlands are flooded {{to a depth of}} 8 to 12 inches to attract waterfowl.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} use of chemical herbicides, cultural controls, such as altering <b>soil</b> pH, <b>salinity,</b> or fertility levels, were used to control weeds. Mechanical control (including tillage) was also (and still is) used to control weeds.|$|R
25|$|Although {{intertidal}} ecology {{has traditionally}} focused on these negative interactions (predation and competition), there is emerging evidence that positive interactions are also important. Facilitation refers to one organism helping another without harming itself. For example, salt marsh plant species of Juncus and Iva {{are unable to}} tolerate the high <b>soil</b> <b>salinities</b> when evaporation rates are high, thus they depend on neighboring plants to shade the sediment, slow evaporation, and help maintain tolerable salinity levels. In similar examples, many intertidal organisms provide physical structures that are used as refuges by other organisms. Mussels, although they are tough competitors with certain species, are also good facilitators as mussel beds provide a three-dimensional habitat to species of snails, worms, and crustaceans.|$|R
25|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>salinity</b> poses a {{major threat}} to rice crop productivity, {{particularly}} along low-lying coastal areas during the dry season. For example, roughly 1 million hectares of the coastal areas of Bangladesh are affected by saline soils. These high concentrations of salt can severely affect rice plants’ normal physiology, especially during early stages of growth, and as such farmers are often forced to abandon these otherwise potentially usable areas.|$|E
25|$|Euphorbia tithymaloides is {{native to}} {{tropical}} and subtropical North America and Central America. It prefers soil that is sandy, well-drained, and nutrient-rich, particularly with higher concentrations of boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. It is relatively intolerant of high <b>soil</b> <b>salinity</b> levels, but exhibits saline tolerance if well fertilized. The plant tends to be taller and have more biomass if it is well-watered. The plant requires a sunny area to grow in.|$|E
25|$|As water {{moves through}} the landscape, it {{collects}} soluble salts, mainly sodium chloride. Where such water enters the atmosphere through evapotranspiration, these salts are left behind. In irrigation districts, poor drainage of soils and surface aquifers can result in water tables' coming to the surface in low-lying areas. Major land degradation problems of <b>soil</b> <b>salinity</b> and waterlogging result, combined with increasing levels of salt in surface waters. As a consequence, major damage has occurred to local economies and environments.|$|E
40|$|The grass Phragmites australis has {{historically}} been restricted to the relatively benign upper border of coastal marshes, {{but over the past}} century, and particularly in recent decades, it has been spreading aggressively in New England throughout brackish and salt marshes with high <b>soil</b> <b>salinities</b> that are physiologically stressful to the plant. Here I tested the hypothesis that variations in climatic conditions, particularly increased precipitation during the 1997 - 98 El Niño event, buffer harsh abiotic conditions and enhance the performance of this nuisance species. I monitored the growth and reproductive output of P. australis in the year before, during, and after the 1997 - 98 El Niño in coastal brackish marshes of southern New England, USA. During the El Niño year, P. australis produced on average 30 % more shoots, which were 25 % taller, and yielded an order of magnitude more inflorescences than in the other 2 years. <b>Soil</b> porewater <b>salinities</b> were negatively related to precipitation during the 3 years of the study, and the growing season during the El Niño year was one of the wettest of the past century. Consequently, increased precipitation during El Niño may facilitate the spread of less salt-tolerant nuisance and invasive species throughout brackish and salt marshes. Todd E. Minchinto...|$|R

40|$|High <b>soils</b> <b>salinity</b> is a main factor {{affecting}} agricultural production. Studying {{the function}} of salt-tolerance-related genes is essential to enhance crop tolerance to stress. Rab 7 is a small GTP-binding protein that is distributed widely among eukaryotes. Endocytic trafficking mediated by Rab 7 {{plays an important role}} in animal and yeast cells, but the current understanding of Rab 7 in plants is still very limited. Herein, we isolated a vesicle trafficking gene, OsRab 7, from rice. Transgenic rice over-expressing OsRab 7 exhibited enhanced seedling growth and increased proline content under salt-treated conditions. Moreover, an increased number of vesicles was observed in the root tip of OsRab 7 transgenic rice. The OsRab 7 over-expression plants showed enhanced tolerance to salt stress, suggesting that vacuolar trafficking is important for salt tolerance in plants...|$|R
25|$|Cotton {{requires}} particularly intense irrigation. In Tajikistan's cotton-growing regions, farms {{were established}} in large, semiarid tracts and in tracts reclaimed from the desert, but cotton's growing season is summer, when the region receives virtually no rainfall. The 50 percent increase in cotton cultivation mandated by Soviet and post-Soviet agricultural planners between 1964 and 1994 consequently overtaxed the regional water supply. Poorly designed irrigation networks led to massive runoff, which increased <b>soil</b> <b>salinity</b> and carried toxic agricultural chemicals downstream to other fields, the Aral Sea, and populated areas of the region.|$|E
25|$|The Earth's {{carrying}} capacity {{is a central}} issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as Thomas Malthus pointed out the finite {{carrying capacity}} of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study Limits to Growth. Diminishing returns suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as erosion, an impending water crisis, and <b>soil</b> <b>salinity</b> (from irrigation) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that industrial agriculture, which exacerbates these problems, is not sustainable agriculture, and are generally inclined favorably to organic farming, which also reduces the output of carbon.|$|E
25|$|However, such {{intensive}} agriculture {{in such an}} arid area has had a significant negative impact of water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from {{above and below the}} surface is used for agriculture. One third of aquifers are overdrafted, especially in Caborca, Guaymas and the coast near Hermosillo. There have been water disputes in the state, notablely between officials from Hermosillo and the relatively water-rich Ciudad Obregón. The overpumping has drastically lowered water tables and has increased <b>soil</b> <b>salinity</b> in many areas. In some areas, the tables have dropped by as much as one or two meters per year, making fresh water increasing unavailable and forcing the abandonment of croplands. For this reason, {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century area under cultivation in Sonora dropped by more than 24%.|$|E

40|$|In coastal salt marshes, mats of wrack (dead plant stems) {{that are}} {{deposited}} on the marsh by high tides can kill underlying vegetation and initiate secondary succession. The importance of wrack disturbance in northwest Atlantic salt marshes {{has been a}} topic of recent debate. The importance of wrack disturbance in southwest Atlantic salt marshes, which experience a very different climate regime than do northern marshes, has rarely been examined. Working in a Georgia salt marsh, we documented a pattern of positive association between wrack and Batis maritima biomass, and conducted experiments that indicated that wrack was beneficial to Batis maritima. Sampling indicated that natural wrack deposition was correlated with areas of vigorous Batis growth and mild soil conditions. Natural wrack deposition occurred primarily at the highest elevations occupied by Batis maritima (the high Batis zone). Batis plants in the high zone were taller, with more and larger leaves, and contained several times the biomass/unit area than Batis plants at lower elevations. High zone <b>soils</b> had lower <b>salinities,</b> better percolation rates, and a lower organic content than did soils from lower elevations. Experimental manipulations demonstrated that deposition of wrack was partially responsible for these patterns. In each of two experiments, <b>soil</b> <b>salinities</b> were lower and plants taller and larger {{in the presence of}} wrack compared to in its absence. Although wrack lowered salinities and enhanced plant growth, the effects were not large enough to completely explain the differences between Batis zones. Instead, wrack probably reinforced pre-existing gradients in flooding and salinity caused by differences in elevation and terrestrial runoff. Our results contrast with previous studies from northern marshes. Because of geographic differences in climate and plant phenology, northern marshes are more likely than southern marshes to receive patches of wrack thick enough to kill underlying vegetation. Plants covered by thin layers of wrack, as commonly occurs in southern marshes, may often grow through the wrack rather than suffer mortality. Also because of climatic differences, wrack is more likely to benefit plants by ameliorating salinity stress in southern marshes, where <b>soil</b> <b>salinities</b> are often hypersaline, than in northern marshes where soils are rarely hypersaline. Although ecological processes may differ between northern and southern salt marshes, these differences may be predictable based on an understanding of geographic variation in climate...|$|R

25|$|Another problem {{faced by}} many plants is high <b>soil</b> <b>salinity.</b> One {{study shows that}} some EcM fungi are capable of {{improving}} salt tolerance in a species of poplar by altering leaf physiology. Though the symbiotic contact {{takes place at the}} root interface, the fungus was able to alter such leaf traits as concentration of nutrients and phytohormones, and ratios of fatty acids in order to combat leaf chlorosis and shedding. In seagrape seedlings, the EcM fungus Scleroderma bermudense was able to alleviate salt stress. In the seagrape tissue, there was a decrease in both sodium and chlorine, but an increase in potassium and phosphorus, implying this trend might represent a mechanism to explain the observed tolerance. Another study even identified 22 proteins differentially produced under salt stress of the EcM fungus Boletus edulis. They mostly concerned cellular processes such as metabolism, cell cycle control and stress tolerance, with 14 proteins being upregulated and 8 down.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} modern water {{management}} in Egypt {{begins with the}} construction of the Old Aswan Dam in 1902 and barrages on the Nile in the 19th and early 20th century. The Old Aswan Dam partially stored the waters of the Nile to allow the growing of multiple crops per year in the Nile Delta, while the barrages raised the water level of the Nile so that water could be diverted into large irrigation channels running in parallel to the river. The water regime of the river was changed fundamentally in 1970 when the Aswan High Dam was completed, eliminating the annual Nile flood. The dam brought major benefits such as increased water availability for Egyptian agriculture leading to higher income and employment, hydropower production, flood control, improved navigation, and the creation of fisheries in Lake Nasser. But it also had environmental and social impacts including resettlement, loss of fertile silt that now accumulates in the reservoir behind the dam, waterlogging combined with an increase in <b>soil</b> <b>salinity,</b> and increased coastal erosion.|$|E
25|$|This {{period is}} {{generally}} taken {{to coincide with}} {{a major shift in}} population from southern Mesopotamia toward the north. Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. <b>Soil</b> <b>salinity</b> in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth, Sumerian would remain only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe.|$|E

25|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} {{suffer from}} a variety of anthropogenic impacts, such as large-scale eutrophication, food web alteration, runaway consumer effects, climate change, habitat destruction, and disease. Rarely do these factors act in isolated ways. Often, researchers find additive or synergistic interactions between impacts compounding the amount of ecosystem degradation. One such example is found in salt marshes in the southeastern United States. Depletion of top predators in these systems has led to snail overgrazing of salt marsh cordgrass and subsequent die-off (as explained above). However, this die-off has been linked with intense drought conditions and the resultant increases in salt and acid stress (Silliman et al. 2005). Drought stress that raises <b>soil</b> <b>salinities</b> and increases cordgrass vulnerabilities to top-down control may be a product of climate change (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005). Cases such as these highlight how abiotic and biotic interactions can interact to affect ecosystem health.|$|R
40|$|Abiotic {{conditions}} often change ecological interactions. Studies {{in areas}} with low to moderate <b>soil</b> <b>salinities</b> have demonstrated a facultative mutualism between fiddler crabs and salt marsh vegetation. In these habitats, fiddler crab burrowing increases plant growth, and plant roots help support the walls of crab burrows. We looked for these interactions in hypersaline soils bordering unvegetated salt pans in a Georgia salt marsh. Crab burrows and vegetation cover were positively associated. Neither crab removals nor burrow additions demonstrated a positive effect of crabs on vegetation. However, both vegetation removals {{and the addition of}} an artificial canopy (suspended shadecloth) demonstrated a strong positive effect of vegetation on crab burrows. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence that plants supported burrow walls. Instead, crabs likely associate with vegetation to avoid predators. Our results caution against extrapolating experimental results between habitats with different abiotic conditions. Ó 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
