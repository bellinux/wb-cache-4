40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the implementation of}} Bayesian sampling methodology in a graphical probability environment, i. e. Bayesian networks (BNs). An architecture of BNs which is able {{to be used for}} sampling from small and large consignments is outlined in detail. Through direct interaction with their users, the proposed models provide a framework that is capable of dealing with several distinct sampling issues, such as (i) the calculation of posterior probability distributions for the proportion of ‘positives’ (i. e. discrete units with <b>a</b> characteristic <b>of</b> interest) in <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> {{as well as for the}} number <b>of</b> positives among <b>a</b> <b>consignment’s</b> uninspected items, (ii) case preassessment and (iii) likelihood-ratio evaluation. A discussion is included on features of the proposed models that allow one to account for further complications such as competing prior beliefs about the proportion <b>of</b> positives in <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> and potentially misclassified data (e. g. positive testing results obtained from units that are actually negative) ...|$|R

40|$|Home {{delivery}} {{service is}} one of the most important cost drivers in e-commerce industry. We consider the three-dimensional container packing problem under home delivery service, where each rectangular item with its specific destination is loaded orthogonally onto a rectangular container so that the utilization rate of the container space is maximized. In our framework, we assume the routing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> to be given, which turns out that there is <b>an</b> order <b>of</b> unloading items with respect to the consignment. If we load items without considering the order of unloading items, we may unload and reload other unconcerned items drastically while unloading the required item. Therefore, in this paper, the unloading costs for <b>a</b> <b>consignment</b> are precisely defined according to the invisible and untouchable rule, and a subvolume scheme based algorithm is proposed. Our experimental results suggest our approach to be promising. Container packing problem, home delivery, transportation, logistics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe explore {{iterative}} {{schemes for}} obtaining {{a solution to}} the linear system (∗) Ax = b, A ϵ Cm × n, if the system is solvable, or for obtaining an approximate solution to (∗) if the system is not solvable. Our iterative schemes are obtained via <b>a</b> 3 -part <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> into A = M − Q 1 − Q 2. The 3 -part <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> is, in turn, <b>a</b> refinement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> (2 -part) subproper <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> into A = M − Q. We indicate the possible usefulness of such refinements (<b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2 -part <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>A)</b> to systems (∗) which arise from a discrete analog to the Neumann problem, where the conventional iterative schemes (i. e., iterative schemes induced by <b>a</b> 2 -part <b>splitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>A)</b> are not necessarily convergent...|$|R
