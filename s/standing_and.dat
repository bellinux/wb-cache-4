5|$|Cases in the United Kingdom were {{previously}} inconsistent upon {{the issue of}} permitting representative standing.

5|$|Crinolines {{were worn}} by women of every social <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> class across the Western world, from royalty to factory workers. This led to {{widespread}} media scrutiny and criticism, particularly in satirical magazines such as Punch. They were also hazardous if worn without due care. Thousands of women {{died in the}} mid-19th century {{as a result of}} their hooped skirts catching fire. Alongside fire, other hazards included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar fasciitis by placing excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich's family held social <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> {{substantial}} financial means.

Heydrich developed a passion for the violin and carried that interest into adulthood; he impressed listeners with his musical talent.|$|E
5|$|Kane {{competed in}} five {{events at the}} 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, winning a bronze medal in the men's super G behind Russia's Alexey Bugaev and Austria's Matthias Lanzinger.

He went on to finish fourth in the men's slalom <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> sixth in the men's downhill <b>standing,</b> <b>and</b> failed to finish in two events. Towards the end of the Games, Kane and Dutch snowboarder Bibian Mentel-Spee were named winners of the Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award, which is presented at every Paralympic Games for outstanding performances and overcoming adversity.|$|E

5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral <b>standing,</b> <b>and</b> then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E
5|$|The Interstate grew quickly, {{along with}} the {{automobile}} industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways of American life and culture. The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA {{tried to}} focus the strikers on civil disobedience and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers. The union members used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics. These acts included <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel, mass sit down strikes, and large groups of people picketing outside of the Pittston coal mines. This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country.|$|E

5|$|The crown {{over the}} lion and sun {{configuration}} consolidated {{the association of}} the symbol with the monarchy. The sun lost its importance as the icon of kingship and the Kiani Crown became the primary symbol of the Qajar monarchy. Under Nasir al-Din Shah, logos varied from seated, swordless lions to <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> sword-bearing lions. In February 1873, the decree for Order of Aftab (Nishan-i Afab) was issued by Nasi-al Din Shah.|$|E
5|$|The first statehouse, {{located in}} Corydon, Indiana, is still <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> is {{maintained}} {{as a state}} historic site. The second building was the old Marion County courthouse which was demolished and replaced in the early 20th century. The third building was a structure modeled on the Parthenon, but was condemned in 1877 because of structural defects and razed so the current statehouse could be built on its location.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was completed early in van der Weyden's career, probably just after his apprenticeship with Robert Campin ended.

5|$|The {{usage of}} ain't in the {{southern}} United States is distinctive, however, in the continued usage of the word by well-educated, cultivated speakers. Ain't is in common usage of educated Southerners. In the South, the use of ain't {{can be used as}} a marker to separate cultured speakers from those who lack confidence in their social <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> thus avoid its use entirely.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of its}} history, astrology was {{considered}} a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. At {{the end of the}} 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as heliocentrism and Newtonian mechanics) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical <b>standing,</b> <b>and</b> common belief in astrology has largely declined.|$|E

5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known {{at the time as}} dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at the time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while <b>standing</b> <b>and</b> at rest, and swollen legs displaying open sores.|$|E
