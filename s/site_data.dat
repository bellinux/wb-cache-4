500|$|The Supreme Court remanded {{the case}} to the {{district}} court. During the investigation, the government obtained cell site location data with a 2703(d) order under the Stored Communications Act. In light of the Supreme Court's decision, the government sought to use this data instead of the GPS data it had collected. Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ruled in December 2012 that the government could use the cell <b>site</b> <b>data</b> against Jones. A new trial began in January 2013 after Mr Jones rejected 2 plea offers of 15 to 22 years with credit for time served. In March 2013, a mistrial was declared with the jury evenly split. Mr. Jones had represented himself at trial. [...] The Government planned for a fourth trial but in May 2013 Jones accepted a plea bargain of 15 years with credit for time served.|$|E
