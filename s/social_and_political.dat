5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E

Two hundred and fifty-one members of the Irish and Northern Irish diaspora in England rated themselves on a number of ethnic identity items. It was determined that there are significant differences between the <b>social,</b> national <b>and</b> <b>political</b> identities of the Irish and Northern Irish diasporic groups and that there are significant differences between the <b>social,</b> national <b>and</b> <b>political</b> identities of the Northern Irish Catholic and Protestant diasporic groups.

5|$|Characteristic of {{the turn}} of the 10th century in most Polish tribal {{settlement}} areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity. The gords were the centers of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> life.

Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the {{influence}} of French Revolutionary ideals, particularly those of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Trimmer emphasized orthodox Anglicanism and encouraged the perpetuation of the contemporary <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> order.
