25|$|The U.S. Earth {{satellite}} {{program began}} in 1954 as a joint U.S. Army and U.S. Navy proposal, called Project Orbiter, {{to put a}} <b>scientific</b> <b>satellite</b> into orbit during the International Geophysical Year. The proposal, using a military Redstone missile, was rejected in 1955 by the Eisenhower administration {{in favor of the}} Navy's Project Vanguard, using a booster advertised as more civilian in nature. Following the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, the initial Project Orbiter program was revived as the Explorer program {{to catch up with the}} Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The name Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1 (also {{known as}} the TMA-1) refers to the strong {{magnetic}} field found somewhere in the lunar Crater Tycho by an American <b>scientific</b> <b>satellite.</b> Astronauts find that this magnetic anomaly is caused by an alien monolith buried about 15 meters below the surface. When the monolith is excavated and examined, it {{is found to be}} a black cuboid whose sides extend in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (1² : 2² : 3²). However, in the novel, Clarke suggests that this sequence or ratio extends past the three known spatial dimensions into the much higher dimensions, like this: 16 : 25 : 36...|$|E

50|$|The rocket {{was also}} used for three {{suborbital}} tests of X-23 PRIME reentry vehicles. A leftover SLV-3 from the PRIME program was used to launch a collection of small <b>scientific</b> <b>satellites</b> from VAFB's SLC-3E on August 16, 1968.|$|R
2500|$|President Dwight Eisenhower {{was skeptical}} about human spaceflight, but sought {{to advance the}} {{commercial}} and military applications of satellite technology. [...] Prior to the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1, Eisenhower had already authorized Project Vanguard, a <b>scientific</b> <b>satellite</b> program associated with the International Geophysical Year. [...] As a supporter of small government, he sought to avoid a space race which would require an expensive bureaucracy to conduct, and was surprised by, and sought to downplay, the public response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik. In an effort to prevent similar technological surprises by the Soviets, Eisenhower authorized the creation in 1958 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), responsible {{for the development of}} advanced military technologies.|$|E
2500|$|Space {{science and}} {{technology}} have been a government priority for decades. [...] In the late 1980s and 1990s, Brazil invested almost US$1 billion in developing space infrastructure around the National Institute of Space Research (INPE), leading to {{the launch of the}} first <b>scientific</b> <b>satellite</b> built entirely in Brazil in 1993 (SCD-1). Between 1999 and 2014, Brazil and China built a series of five remote sensing satellites for environmental monitoring within the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellites (CBERS) programme. Brazil has now achieved the critical mass of skills and infrastructure required to dominate several space technologies. It is determined to master the complete chain of space technologies, from material sciences, engineering design, remote sensing, aperture-synthetic radars, telecommunications and image processing to propulsion technologies. The joint Argentinian–Brazilian SABIA-MAR mission will be studying ocean ecosystems, carbon cycling, marine habitats mapping, coasts and coastal hazards, inland waters and fisheries. Also under development is the new SARE series designed to expand the active remote observation of Earth through the use of microwave and optical radars.|$|E

40|$|Voyager’ is an {{educational}} card game involving <b>scientific</b> <b>satellites,</b> developed {{for use in}} schools with children aged 9 to 13 years.

Several copies of the game were produced using funding obtained from the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) as a Public Understanding of Science (PUS) award. These initial ‘trial’ versions of the game were taken to three different schools where feedback obtained from both pupils and staff was used to produce a final copy of the game that can be distributed to other schools along with a set of companion notes to form the basis of a science lesson.
