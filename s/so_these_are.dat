All intra-EU transfers in euro are treated as domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised <b>so</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E

Regimens omitting each of the standard drugs are listed below.|$|E
25|$|Ingested {{proteins}} {{are usually}} broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides {{in the small}} intestine, and then absorbed. They can then be joined to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway {{can be used to}} make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. These are the essential amino acids, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize arginine and histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and <b>so</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> often considered essential amino acids.|$|E
25|$|In {{synthetic}} {{organic chemistry}} orthogonal protection {{is a strategy}} allowing the deprotection of functional groups independently of each other. In chemistry and biochemistry, an orthogonal interaction occurs when there are two pairs of substances and each substance can interact with their respective partner, but does not interact with either substance of the other pair. For example, DNA has two orthogonal pairs: cytosine and guanine form a base-pair, and adenine and thymine form another base-pair, but other base-pair combinations are strongly disfavored. As a chemical example, tetrazine reacts with transcyclooctene and azide reacts with cyclooctyne without any cross-reaction, <b>so</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> mutually orthogonal reactions, and so, can be performed simultaneously and selectively. Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to chemical reactions occurring inside living systems without reacting with naturally present cellular components. In supramolecular chemistry the notion of orthogonality refers {{to the possibility of}} two or more supramolecular, often non-covalent, interactions being compatible; reversibly forming without interference from the other.|$|E

They also described her as having a [...] "warm heart" [...] and being [...] "family oriented". Charlie can be [...] "misunderstood" [...] at times, which makes her appear brash. On her character, Anderson said, [...] "Charlie is strong-willed with lots of guts and she is never afraid to show who she is, which makes her genuine and likeable". Whilst interviewed by the Llanelli Star, Anderson described Charlie's responsibilities stating: [...] "Charlie is very passionate about her work. She cares about Ruby more than life itself and is responsible for her, <b>so</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> priorities over a finding a man. I don't think it's a matter of need for her but she definitely would like someone to share her life with and that romantic element is a good balance in Charlie's somewhat serious life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{different}} spellings for the sokuon {{depend on}} what mora (if any) was elided into the following consonant to form the geminate consonant. [...] For example, 学期 (gakki [...] "semester") is spelled がくき (gakuki) in historical kana because the on'yomi of 学 used in this compound is がく (gaku). [...] Geminate consonants in native Japanese words were formed either by the elision of a long vowel, as in 真赤な (makka-na [...] "bright red"; once まあかな, maaka-na), or by some random process, as in 屹度 (kitto [...] "surely"; once きと, kito); such words are written with the full-size つ (tu) in historical kana. [...] In general, a Japanese on'yomi can end in either a vowel, ち, つ, き, or く, (ち and つ corresponding to Middle Chinese final -t, and き and く corresponding to Middle Chinese final -k), <b>so</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> the only four kana which can replace the sokuon in historical kana. [...] Historically, on'yomi could also end with pu (for the Middle Chinese final -p), {{but because of the}} sound shift described in the first table, word-medial /pu/ in Old Japanese became /u/, so there was no consonant left to elide.|$|E
2500|$|Visits {{from his}} mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish {{relatives}} for four years.

Then suddenly, his health deteriorated, [...] "Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that frightened me more than I can tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because he had been so well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here" [...] As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June. I also get out of breath more easily. <b>So</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> the results of my trip. Very annoying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lastly, type III {{factors are}} factors {{that do not}} contain any nonzero finite {{projections}} at all. [...] In their first paper [...] were unable {{to decide whether or}} not they existed; the first examples were later found by [...] Since the identity operator is always infinite in those factors, they were sometimes called type III∞ in the past, but recently that notation has been superseded by the notation IIIλ, where λ is a real number in the interval [...] More precisely, if the Connes spectrum (of its modular group) is 1 then the factor is of type III0, if the Connes spectrum is all integral powers of λ for 0nbsp&<nbsp&λnbsp&<nbsp&1, then the type is IIIλ, and if the Connes spectrum is all positive reals then the type is III1. (The Connes spectrum is a closed subgroup of the positive reals, <b>so</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> the only possibilities.) The only trace on type III factors takes value ∞ on all non-zero positive elements, and any two non-zero projections are equivalent. At one time type III factors were considered to be intractable objects, but Tomita–Takesaki theory has led to a good structure theory. In particular, any type III factor can be written in a canonical way as the crossed product of a type II∞ factor and the real numbers.|$|E
