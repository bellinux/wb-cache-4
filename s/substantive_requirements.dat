Physicists commonly take the <b>substantive</b> <b>requirement</b> of general covariance to mean that the laws exhibit diffeomorphism invariance and that this invariance is a gauge symmetry. This latter requirement does place restrictions on the content of a spacetime theory.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{possible}} approaches to automatic memory management in C++ have been considered over the years. Here we propose the reconsideration of an approach that relies on partially conservative garbage collection. Its principal advantage is that objects referenced by ordinary pointers may be garbage-collected. Unlike other approaches, this {{makes it possible to}} garbage-collect objects allocated and manipulated by most legacy libraries. This makes it much easier to convert existing code to a garbage-collected environment. It also means that it can be used, for example, to “repair ” legacy code with deficient memory management. The approach taken here is similar to that taken by Bjarne Stroustrup’s much earlier proposal (N 0932 = 96 - 0114). Based on prior discussion on the core reflector, this version does insist that implementations make an attempt at garbage collection if so requested by the application. However, since there is no real notion of space usage in the standard, {{there is no way to}} make this a <b>substantive</b> <b>requirement.</b> An implementation that “garbage collects ” by deallocating all collectable memory at process exit will remain conforming, though it is likely to be unsatisfactory for some uses. ...|$|R

40|$|Pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), {{activities}} {{resulting in}} the discharge of dredge or fill material into waters of the US, including wetlands, require permit authorization from the US Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE). As part of the Section 404 permitting process, compensatory wetland mitigation {{in the form of}} wetland enhancement, restoration, or construction may be required to off-set impacts sustained under a Section 404 permit. Under normal circumstances, compensatory mitigation is a relatively straight forward process; however, issues associated with mitigation become more complex at sites undergoing remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), because on-site response/remedial actions involving dredged and fill material are not subject to the formal Section 404 permitting process. These actions are conducted in accordance with the <b>substantive</b> permitting <b>requirements</b> of the ACOE`s Nationwide and individual permitting programs. Wetland mitigatory requirements are determined through application of the US Environmental Protection Agency`s (USEPA`s) 040 (b) (1) Guidelines promulgated in 40 CFR Part 230 and are implemented through compliance with <b>substantive</b> permitting <b>requirements</b> during the conduct of response/remedial actions.
