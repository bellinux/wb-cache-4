The influence of filler metals of different strengths on the mechanical properties of joints was also tested. A significant decrease in hardness was observed in the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) due to martensite tempering, in regions where peak temperature was close to isotherm AC 1 (calculated in 735 oC for these steel); coincidently, fracture in every tensile test occurred in regions where martensite was tempered, even when a wire of less strength was used. It was noticed that the decrease in ultimate tensile and yield strength of base metal was inherent to welding.

40|$|The {{continuous}} CO 2 {{laser beam}} welding of two aluminum metal matrix composites (6061 and 2618 reinforced with 20 % of Al 2 O 3) has been investigated with {{special attention to the}} influence of the base alloys, the filler material and the process parameters on the microstructure of the welding bead. In this work <b>square</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> has been obtained with different CO 2 laser power, feed rate and shielding gases. The microstructure of the welding beads has been examined by optical and electronic microscopy. A migration of the Al 2 O 3 reinforcement particles from the fusion zone (FZ) towards the heat affected zone (HAZ) has been detected and the particles agglomerate near the interface FZ-HAZ. An increase in both porosity and agglomerate sizes inside the welding bead has been observed as the feed rate has been reduced. The hardness of welding beads has been higher than the unaffected composites. A reduction of both the beads hardness and the Al 2 O 3 migration and agglomeration has been obtained by the use of magnesium-rich filler material in the welding process, probably because magnesium is able to increase the reinforcement wettability, and to reduce the rate of formation of spinel phase MgAl 2 O 4.

40|$|The {{presence}} of residual stress in steel members can significantly compromise the stiffness and fatigue life of steel structural components. This influence becomes more serious for the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> {{in the construction}} of large-sized steel members due to the different residual stress distribution from the normal size <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> This paper experimentally studied the residual stress in the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> through an 8 -experiment test program. High residual stress was produced during the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> and this stress was observed to be even higher than the yield strength of the steel.

40|$|The {{sensitisation}} of a 12 % chromium ferritic stainless steel, {{conforming to}} EN 1. 4003 and available commercially in South Africa under the trade name of 3 CR 12, was investigated {{during the course}} of this project. 3 CR 12 was designed to pass through the (a + g) phase field on cooling, with the austenite transforming to martensite on subsequent cooling to room temperature. The aim of this investigation was to verify that 3 CR 12 can sensitise during continuous cooling after welding, provided that low heat input levels are used. Two grades of 3 CR 12 with slightly different chemistries, designated 41220 (A) and 41311 (B), were evaluated. Grade 41220 has a higher austenite potential than grade 41311. 3 CR 12 plate was joined autogenously to AISI 316 L by means of a series of <b>square</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> Gas tungsten arc welding with argon shielding was used, and the heat input was varied from approximately 30 J/mm to 450 J/mm, in conjunction with welding speeds ranging from 2. 36 mm/s to 33. 3 mm/s. Rosenthal’s heat flow equations were used to calculate the cooling rate from 1500 ºC to 800 ºC for each experimental weld, and to illustrate the influence of the effective heat input and welding speed on the martensite content of the high temperature heat-affected zone. An increase in welding speed reduces the heat input and increases the cooling rate after welding. At lower heat input levels (less than approximately 100 J/mm), austenite nucleation was found to be suppressed by the rapid cooling rates, and a continuous network of ferrite-ferrite grain boundaries formed in the high temperature heat-affected zone. Higher heat inputs resulted in slower cooling with more martensite in the high temperature heat-affected zone after cooling. At heat input levels above approximately 250 J/mm, enough martensite formed during cooling to eliminate a continuous network of ferrite-ferrite grain boundaries in the high temperature heat-affected zone. Sensitisation was evaluated using an electrolytic oxalic acid etch (ASTM 763 - 99, Practice W), and a potentiostatic etch in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4. During the potentiostatic etch test, the potential was maintained at 0 VSCE to reveal the presence of any chromium depleted zones. Both grades of 3 CR 12 were found to be sensitised when a continuous network of ferrite-ferrite grain boundaries was present in the high temperature heat-affected zone (i. e. after welding at low heat input levels). When the heat input during welding was high enough to ensure the presence of martensite on the majority of the heat-affected zone grain boundaries, thereby effectively eliminating continuous ferrite-ferrite grain boundary networks, the welds were not in the sensitised condition. The austenite that forms during cooling acts as a carbon sink, absorbing any excess carbon. This prevents supersaturation of the ferrite and subsequent carbide precipitation that can lead to chromium depletion and sensitisation. Due to its higher austenite potential, grade 41311 can be welded at lower heat input levels and with faster cooling rates than grade 41220 without inducing continuous carbide precipitation and sensitisation. In order to prevent sensitisation, a fusion-line cooling rate of 80 ºC/s should not be exceeded in 3 mm 3 CR 12 plate during welding.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The objective {{of the study was}} to examine factors that influence the strength of <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> and gain an understanding of the process of failure. The study was divided into several sectors. The first and primary part of the programme was to determine the extent to which the pipe system's long-term strength under both internal fluctuating and constant pressure is reduced by the presence of axially misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> The second objective was to examine fracture initiation sites and crack propagation paths of the failed aligned and misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> samples in relation to the melt flow zone and the weld bead in order to establish the cause of failure. Finally the project considered the influence of selected welding parameters on the fatigue performance of aligned <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> and an investigation into the influence of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing technique on the basic material's properties. Fatigue and stress-rupture lifetimes were found to decrease significantly with increasing axial misalignment at the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>weld</b> in 63, 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipe systems at 79 °C in a water environment. In the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>weld</b> having axial misalignment of 20 per cent of the wall thickness and above, the reduction in the fatigue and stress-rupture lifetime was greater than 50 per cent compared to the aligned weld. It was not clear whether there is a pipe size effect or not; there was no marked change in the fatigue performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> for the three pipe diameters examined. However, the fatigue performance of the aligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 90 and 125 mm was noticeably better compared to 63 mm pipe systems. The stress rupture performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipes was more than halved compared to those in 63 mm pipe systems. Both the fatigue and stress rupture performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> could be explained in terms of amplified axial stress and in general, the Ory expression for evaluating the increase in axial stress due to misalignment appears to be valid. The temperature dependence of the fatigue performance of aligned and misaligned <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> in 63 and 90 mm MDPE pipe systems suggests that if continuous internal fluctuating pressure under the conditions examined is maintained, then the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> with axial misalignment of below 10 per cent of the wall thickness may well meet the design lifetime of 50 years at the service termperature. Under stress-rupture conditions, all the misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> considered in the three pipe diameters surpassed the minimum specified requirement of 170 hours at 79 °C. The fatigue was the most aggresive condition of the two for minor misalignment. Examination of the circumferential <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> failures revealed that the crack invariably initiated from the notch located at the inner weld bead and no preferred crack propagation path was taken in relation to the melt flow zone. It was proved that the notch was responsible for the observed circumferential failure of aligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 63 mm MDPE pipes by testing these <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> where the internal weld bead was machined off. The failure site for the internal weld bead machined off sample was in the pipe remote from the weld inferring that the material in the melt flow zone does not constitute any weakness. The effect of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing in 63 mm HDPE pipe was found to increase the density (and crystallinity) signifying a slow annealing process in the material. However, the changes in these parameters were not of sufficient scale to strongly influence the performance. The main effect of elevated temperature testing in water environment appears to be the extraction of stabiliser from the base polymer as was indicated by the rapid decrease in oxidation induction time with the ageing times.

For the full-penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack initiated at the weld toe, while for the partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack started at the weld root. The high stress concentration at the weld root decreases the fatigue strength of the welds with UP {{as compared to the}} full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> In presence of a tensile mean stress, the fatigue life is significantly shorter than under fully reversed loading. An analytical model was used to predict the lifetime of the weldments. The total lifetime is composed of crack initiation and crack propagation. Because of the high stress concentration at the weld root the period of crack initiation is negligible for the weldments with UP. The lifetime based on crack propagation can be simply described using the geometry factor of the center crack tension specimen. Considering of the extra material provided by the weld reinforcement is suggested. The model predictions agreed with the experimental results for the full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> While for R= 0, the most lifetime was spent in crack initiation (and small crack growth), for R=- 1 the relative amount of crack propagation is more dominant due to crack closure under compressive loading...|$|R

40|$|The {{residual}} stress distributions for plate T <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> were determined from a detailed {{finite element analysis}} of the welding process and they were {{compared with those of}} the measured data for validation. The {{residual stress}} distributions from the analyses and measurements were shown to be in similar shape. The distributions were found to be below the master curve for the residual stresses that were previously determined from a statistical analysis for a range of weld geometries and materials. A failure assessment for the T <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> with cracks under residual stress distributions has been carried out. The conservatism in the current life assessment procedures regarding the residual stresses were quantified based on the stress intensity factor SIF calculations for the T <b>butt</b> <b>weld.</b> It was shown that the master curve profile provides more realistic values for the SIFs with reasonable conservatism than the profiles recommended in the existing assessment procedure...|$|R
30|$|The {{evaluation}} {{was conducted}} on the weldability of <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> samples with K-joint edges of the 50 -mm-thick 09 G 2 FB steel plate fabricated by TMCP.|$|R
40|$|Thin wires of Ti-Ni {{shape memory}} alloy are welded without fusion or cast zone by the {{resistance}} <b>butt</b> <b>welding.</b> The weld current is fed to the <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> parts with little offset during the time shorter than that in the forging process. The tensile strength of the welded part is attained over 80 percents of that of the base metal. For checking the shape memory effect, the recovery from bending deformation for the welded parts is tested in comparison with that for the base metal, and the residual strain after the recovery is experimentally related to the ratio of latent heat of martenstic transformation to that of reverse transformation, measured by the differential scanning caloriemeter...|$|R
