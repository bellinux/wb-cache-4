Under consideration {{is a model}} of a gear wheel in a gearbox which rotates and is partially submerged in oil. The flow of interest is complex and involves effects of free surface dynamics, rotation, and formation of bubbles and drops. Occurring flow regimes include laminar, transitional and turbulent. The major focus of the investigation is on details of the developed flow, and the purpose is validation of numerical methods developed for design and optimization of such components. Current experiments are performed in a test rig which is modelling a generic simplified gearbox with a <b>single</b> <b>isolated</b> rotating <b>wheel.</b> The flow measurements are carried out by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and the test rig is specially designed for this purpose with the optical access maximized. The flow similarity with respect to a real gearbox is fully maintained and the working fluid is a transparent mineral oil. The PIV measurements are performed at four different rotation speeds for two different wheel configurations in order to cover a spectrum of operational conditions needed for numerical modelling. The emphasis is on the result of experiments on a smooth wheel. The measurements are providing velocity distribution around the wheel and details on bubble and drop distribution...|$|R

The experiments were planned in a randomized block design and {{were conducted in}} the controlled conditions provided by a soil bin environment utilizing a well-equipped single wheel-tester of Urmia University, Iran. The image processing technique was used for determination of the contact patch length and contact patch width. Analysis of covariance {{was used to evaluate}} the correlations. The highest values of contact length and width and tire deflection occurred at the highest <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> and lowest tire inflation pressure. Contact patch width is a polynomial (order 2) function of <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> while there is a linear relationship between tire contact length and <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> as well as between tire deflection and <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> Correlations were developed for the evaluation of contact patch length-rolling resistance, contact patch width-rolling resistance and tire deflection-rolling resistance.

The {{plastic deformation}} and resilient modulus of subgrade material subjected to moving <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> are a function of Principal Stress Axis Rotation (PSAR). Difficulties associated in controlling PSAR in the conservative experimental methods lead to inaccurately estimate the actual plastic deformation characteristics of rail track subgrade. This study therefore modified a torsional multi-ring shear apparatus to evaluate the deformation characteristics of subgrade materials under moving <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> The performance of this modified apparatus was evaluated by comparing its experimental results with those of small scaled model tests of asphalt roadbed rail track with sandy subgrade. This evaluation suggests that the modified multi-ring shear apparatus has an excellent capability to the estimation of deformation characteristics of rail track subgrade under moving <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> A series of modified multi-ring shear tests was then conducted to investigate the effects of loading conditions, subgrade density and loading frequency on the deformation of subgrade material under moving <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> Results of this test series shows that cyclic single point load test underestimates the actual deformation characteristics of subgrade materials irrespective to subgrade density and loading frequency. Further, the ratio between the plastic cumulative deformations obtained from the moving <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> and the cyclic single point loading, termed as “ ratio of axial strain ” (Rs), was introduced to evaluate the plastic deformation characteristics of rail track subgrade material under the moving <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> only, using {{the results of the}} cyclic single point loading tests.

To this end, the current study focuses on <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> management with the aim to establish <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> monitoring and mitigation actions (in terms of limits on allowable wheel defects) that minimize traffic disruptions. As a first step, the relation between <b>wheel</b> impact <b>load</b> magnitudes (resulting from the out-of-round wheels) and critical rail crack sizes {{that would result in}} rail breaks is established. Variations in parameters such as track stiffness, rail temperature, impact load characteristics and hanging sleepers etc. are investigated and a “bad case scenario” that implies severe, but realistic operational conditions is established. In this manner allowable <b>wheel</b> impact <b>load</b> magnitudes can be linked to pertinent critical crack sizes that must be identified during inspections. An interesting finding is that thermal stresses have such a major effect that a seasonal variation in allowable <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> limit seems justified.

We were inspired to launch an investigation for {{soil compaction}} determination at three levels of <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> (1, 2 and 3 kN), three levels of velocity (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 m/s) and at 1, 2 and 3 passages of wheel with three replications on clay-loam soil. Experiments were conducted utilizing a single wheel-tester inside a soil bin. Penetration resistance and soil sinkage were determined as soil compaction indices. Data were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at. % 1 significance level. Results indicated that the highest penetration resistance of 260 kPa occurred at a depth of 210 mm, third pass, <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> of 3 kN and velocity of 0. 5 m/s. The lowest penetration resistance of 121 kPa was at 1 kN <b>wheel</b> <b>load,</b> first pass and at a velocity of 1 m/s.

Findings disclosed that augmentation of <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> and multiple pass increased soil compaction while the increase of velocity had a reverse effect.

40|$|Subsoil {{compaction}} affects {{all aspects}} of soil quality, and contrary to topsoil compaction it is persistent. Natural alleviation processes such as wetting/drying, freezing/thawing and biological activity including root growth decrease rapidly with depth. In compacted soil, these alleviation processes are moreover diminished because root growth and biological activity are reduced and soil water contents remain higher in compacted than in well-structured soil. <b>Wheel</b> <b>loads</b> are still increasing and, in consequence, the extent and severity of subsoil compaction. Sustainable soil management requires the uncompromising criterion that no subsoil compaction can be accepted. Consequently, only field traffic with <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> lower than the carrying capacity of the subsoil is allowed. This implies that subsoil stress caused by <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> should not exceed {{the strength of the}} subsoil. Therefore, this chapter emphasises the importance of soil strength and the calculation of soil stresses in the subsoil. One of the main constraints in using the carrying capacity concept proves to be the lack of data on soil strength. Existing recommended limits for <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> and inflation pressures are not adequate and can result in over or underestimating of allowable <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> and subsequent uneconomical solutions or subsoil compaction. Adequate drainage of soils is a prerequisite for reduced subsoil compaction. Mouldboard ploughing with all tractor wheels on the non-ploughed ‘land’ and umbilical systems for applying manure slurry are realistic options to reduce compaction. Controlled traffic systems that limit the wheeled area may be implemented by the use of wide span vehicles and by steering tractors along traffic lanes. Although we support such provisions, our chapter will advocate and focus primarily on adjusting <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> to the carrying capacity of the subsoils. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between heavy vehicle and road surface roughness results in vibrations that {{detract from the}} perceived comfort of the driver, and generate dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> which are believed to increase pavement wear. This paper describes the methodology for assessing the viability of a new profile-based index (PI^sub t^), developed in previous work, {{as a predictor of}} the magnitude of dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads,</b> and discusses the results. In the previous work, roughness content in the waveband 4. 8 - 19. 5 m correlated best with the mean ratings of ride quality by a panel of truck drivers. When travelling at normal highway speeds, roughness wavelengths in this band excite the low frequency vibration modes of the heavy vehicle body. As these modes are considered to be the major contributors to dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> of road pavements, it was hypothesised that the PIt could alsobe a good predictor of the magnitude of the dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> Computer simulations of the dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> were carried out by using a full vehicle model and the profiles of 10 pavement sections as the excitation inputs. Tests of the PI^sub t^ proved that it is a good predictor of the dynamic loading of some road pavements. However, careful examination of the data resulted in identifying another profile index, the overall root mean square of profile elevation, that provides good predictions of the magnitude of dynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> for all pavement sections considered in this study. The variable sub-grade and climate conditions between the test sections influence the extent of long wavelength roughness development and, ultimately, the excitation levels of the low frequency vibration modes of the truck body.

40|$|Precise {{assessment}} of cyclic plastic deformation of rail track subgrade {{is essential in}} designing cost effective rail tracks. Plastic deformation of rail tracks is often underestimated due to the omission of effects of principal stress axis rotation and water content on subgrade deformation. Moisture content of rail track subgrade is influenced by infiltration, seasonal ground water table variation and climate changes. To understand the influence of principal stress axis rotation and moisture content on the plastic deformation of soil, a series of cyclic moving <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> tests and cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed on unsaturated Toyoura sand, using a modified multi-ring shear apparatus.

40|$|A {{pavement}} strength {{rating system}} is internationally adopted {{in order to}} protect aircraft pavements from inadvertent overload. The system has two elements. The primary element is designed to protect the pavement against subgrade rutting and the second is intended to protect asphalt pavement surfaces. The surface-protection element is arbitrary and empirical, placing category-based limits on aircraft tyre pressures. In 2008, increases in the tyre pressure limits were proposed by aircraft manufacturers and these were approved in 2013. The research reported in this paper assesses the impact of tyre pressure and individual <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> increases on calculated flexible pavement stress indicators, as well as identifying an improved surface layer protection element. Stresses were calculated near the surface, at the surface layer interface and at the subgrade. Tyre pressure and <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> combinations included current (18 t and 1. 35 MPa), imminent (33 t and 1. 75 MPa) and future (40 t and 2. 15 MPa) aircraft. Surface layer stress increased significantly (20 – 30 %) with increases in both tyre pressure and <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> The subgrade stress increased near-equally (97 %) with <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> but was insensitive (< 1 %) to tyre pressure changes. The ability of the current aircraft pavement strength rating system to protect pavements from the increasing demands of aircraft was demonstrated to be limited to the subgrade. It is recommended that the tyre pressure rating be amended to reflect the combined impact of both tyre pressure rating and individual <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> It is also recommended that ongoing efforts to incorporate additional asphalt surface failure modes into routine pavement design be given high priority. The importance of these issues is reinforced by the limited availability of remedies to counter any negative impacts of increased surface layer stresses, especially in hot climates. © 2016 Taylor & Franci...|$|R

The finite element program ABAQUS is used to model the supported butt joint. In this model, the rail, joint bars, epoxy, and ties surrounding the joint are modeled using solid elements. The remaining ties are modeled as an elastic foundation.

This study concerns the load carrying capacity of plate box-girder web panels subjected to a <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> at the midspan of the panel. Distribution of a <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> through a rail and flange is investigated from recordings made of in-plane vertical stress distribution profiles along the upper edge of a web panel of a short-span model box-girder. The girder was loaded through various interfaces above the web by a <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> A simple method is proposed for relating a distributed <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> to an equivalent uniform patch load. Methods for estimating distributed <b>wheel</b> <b>loading</b> lengths are investigated. It is shown that crane web panels are generally subjected to patch loads of short length, occupying less than one-quarter of the panel length. A computer analysis is presented to determine elastic buckling coeffic-ients for flat rectangular plates subjected to a uniform in-plane patch load centrally disposed on one edge and supported by shear stresses on the adjacent edges. Patch loads of various lengths are considered over a range of plate aspect ratios for plates with various combinations of simply supported and clamped edges. Also considered are some non-uniformly distributed patch loads modelling approximately a distributed <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> For {{the large majority of}} geometries considered, it is the support condition along the loaded edge which has greatest influence on the buckling load. Correlation with buckling loads estimated from experimental measurements on a model crane girder web panel indicated that an assumption of simply supported panel edges is over-conservative and that it is probably more representative to consider the edges attached to the flanges as clamped. Ultimate load carrying capacity is considered. A plastic mechanism analysis originally presented by Roberts and Rockey is studied and a modified form derived which reveals the transition region from collapse initiated by direct web yielding for girders with stocky webs to failure by a mechanism of out-of-plane web deformation for girders with slender webs. Certain approximations in the original analysis are shown to involve the omission of terms which can contribute significantly to the plastic work expression. Inclusion of these terms, however, whilst offering potential refinement, increases considerably the complexity of the analysis. Results are presented of a series of collapse tests conducted on short-span model box-girders subjected to a <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> above one of the webs. The effect on the failure load of rail size, web thickness, panel aspect ratio, and longitudinal web stiffening is investigated. Snap buckling was exhibited by several of the test web panels.
