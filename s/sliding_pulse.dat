30|$|In the {{unstable}} patient or in a scenario of cardiac arrest, the methodology varies slightly. The most superior {{area of the}} chest is scanned for any <b>sliding,</b> <b>pulse</b> and B lines bilaterally. Absence of these three signs is enough to conclude the diagnostic process and move to an immediate life-saving invasive treatment. Faced with these extreme emergencies, {{there is no need}} to waste any more time checking for the presence of a lung point, because visualization of this latter sign would not change our decision to drain. Indeed, if we do not detect a lung point, then a tension pneumothorax is the diagnosis and we should treat it in the immediate; if we visualize a lung point in any part of the chest, the pneumothorax needs to be treated anyway. Instead, visualization of even one among <b>sliding,</b> <b>pulse</b> or B lines allows ruling out pneumothorax as the cause of the clinical storm.|$|E
30|$|The {{misdiagnosis}} of {{the absence}} of sliding or a false lung point may lead to an unnecessary pleural drainage. Furthermore, in doubtful cases, higher costs and irradiation exposure may arise if other unnecessary diagnostic imaging methods are ordered. In case of false <b>sliding,</b> false <b>pulse</b> or multiple septa, the diagnosis of pneumothorax may be dangerously delayed or even missed.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel control method for Direct Torque and Flux Control (DTFC) of an Induction Machine (IM) fed by a three-level Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) <b>Sliding</b> Mode <b>Pulse</b> Width Modulated (SMPWM) voltage source inverter.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{nonlinear}} technique for controlling the current in high-performance Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM) drives is introduced. The proposed drive scheme comprises two nonlinear control loops, an inner current control loop and an outer speed control loop. The current control loop employs a <b>sliding</b> mode <b>pulse</b> width modulator (SMPWM), while the speed controller utilizes fuzzy logic {{to produce the}} necessary reference current. The proposed high-performance SRM drive is analyzed theoretically and subsequently validated through simulation. Satisfactory dynamic performance and precise speed control with reduced torque ripple and constant switching frequency is obtained. Moreover, no complex mathematical model of the SRM or extensive lookup table is required for control purposes. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Cyto{{genetics}} is {{a branch}} of genetics that involves critical applications in medical decisions. The procedures involved take cells with chromosomes and rupture them on the slide to release their chromosomes in metaphase spreadings. Usually the slide contains few metaphase spreadings and plenty of intact cells, so finding and analyzing metaphase spreadings are difficult. It {{is for this reason}} that many investigations search for innovations that optimize chromosome spreading and facilitate cytogenetic studies. To aid rupturing cells in cytogenetic <b>slide</b> preparation, <b>Pulsed</b> Electric Fields (PEFs) could be used. PEFs are a kind of electric fields, which affect the cell membrane in a way that can lead to cell lysis. These effects are currently the basis of applications such as nonthermal pasteurization. Therefore, applying PEFs to cell suspension of the cytogenetic experiments would probably lyse all the cells, yielding a clear slide with many metaphase spreadings...|$|R
30|$|The bedside lung {{ultrasound}} diagnostic {{methodology for}} pneumothorax {{has been described}} in literature. A recent consensus process of the main {{experts in the field}} has led to the approval of a step-by-step methodology that consists of combining the four main sonographic signs of pneumothorax: the lung <b>sliding,</b> the lung <b>pulse,</b> the B lines and the lung point [1]. While the first three signs are strongly predictive of the absence of the condition, the lung point is the only sign that confirms a pneumothorax. However, the value of this general rule varies if we consider different settings and scenarios.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the value of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in newborn infants. Methods: From March 2012 to May 2013, 100 newborn infants were divided into two groups: RDS group (50 cases) and control group (50 cases). According to the findings of chest x-ray, there were 10 cases of grade II RDS, 15 grade III cases, and 25 grade IV cases in RDS group. Lung ultrasound was performed at bedside by a single expert. The ultrasound indexes observed in this study included pleural line, A-line, B-line, lung consolidation, air bronchograms, bilateral white lung, interstitial syndrome, lung <b>sliding,</b> lung <b>pulse</b> etc. Findings: In all of the infants with RDS, lung ultrasound consistently showed generalized consolidation with air bronchograms, bilateral white lung or interstitial syndrome, pleural line abnormalities, A-line disappearance, pleural effusion, lung pulse, etc. The simultaneous demonstration of lung consolidation, pleural line abnormalities and bilateral white lung, or lung consolidation, pleural line abnormalities and A-line disappearance co-exists with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % for the diagnosis of neonatal RDS. Conclusion: This study indicates that using an ultrasound to diagnose neonatal RDS is accurate and reliable tool. A lung ultrasound has many advantages over other techniques. Ultrasound is non-ionizing, low-cost, eas...|$|R
40|$|Composition, microstructure, and {{hardness}} {{are essential}} for the wear characteristics of electroplated hard gold films in <b>sliding</b> contact applications. <b>Pulse</b> plating {{has proved to be}} a useful deposition technique with process characteristics allowing good control over both alloy composition and microstructure. In this study, Ni-alloyed Au films were prepared by electroplating using both DC and pulsed current deposition. It was found that the Ni content (< 2. 5 at%) increases with a decrease of the average current density and with decreasing pulse duration. All deposits had average grain sizes ranging from 16 to 28 nm and contained numerous non-crystalline inclusions about 2 nm in diameter with average spacing from 12 to 30 nm. The hardness values of the fine grained films were ranging from VHN, = 200 to 225 while the hardness of the coarse grained films was less than VHN, = 170. The study shows that the increased hardness of alloyed gold films is dominated by a grain size refinement rather than dispersion hardening due to particle distributions or solid solution strengthening...|$|R
5000|$|Similar to its predecessor, Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter game {{in which}} players can control both a pilot and their Titans - mecha-style exoskeletons. The pilot has an arsenal of {{abilities}} which enhance their efficiency during combat. These abilities include cloaking, zip-lining, and parkour - such as double-jumping and wall-running - {{with the aid of}} a jump kit. These movements can be chained together in order to travel between locations quickly. The game introduces several new gameplay mechanics: a <b>sliding</b> mechanic, the <b>pulse</b> blade, which is a throwing knife that reveals the location of any nearby enemy, the holo-pilot, a holographic pilot that mimics players' action to confuse enemies, and a grappling hook, which can be used to slingshot players to a building or an enemy it attaches to. The pilots have a large arsenal of gadgets and weapons, such as shotguns, submachine guns, pistols, and grenades to fight against enemies. At close range, players can execute their opponents, and an interruptible execution animation, which shifts to a third-person perspective, will play.|$|R
30|$|Lung {{ultrasound}} is nowadays {{acknowledged as}} a useful methodology for the diagnosis of pneumothorax at bedside [1]. The diagnostic value of the sonographic signs of pneumothorax {{is similar to the}} well-known and largely used radiologic signs of the same condition in chest radiography. Visualization of a gap between the parietal and visceral pleura in a chest film is largely used, and intuitively diagnostic of pneumothorax, even though, to our knowledge there are no published studies specifically designed to evaluate its specificity in comparison with a gold standard. Nevertheless, there is not any doubt about the power and high specificity of this radiologic sign of pneumothorax. Similarly, the sonographic signs of pneumothorax are largely intuitive of the condition and share the same very high specificity with the radiologic signs [2, 3]. Absence of lung <b>sliding</b> or <b>pulse</b> and absence of B lines combined with a lung point during a lung ultrasound examination have the same diagnostic meaning of the visualization of a pleural gap in a chest radiography. However, whereas chest radiography is a conventional method, lung ultrasound needed to break the wall of scientific prejudices before it was acknowledged as a viable method for a neumothorax diagnosis. This is the reason why many years and clinical studies were needed to change clinical guidelines and protocols and finally introduce bedside lung ultrasound in clinical practice. We cannot say anything unless this process has been completed. The need for a widespread use of lung ultrasound is compelling. If it is true, as it has been proven, that the specificity of a chest radiography is as high as a lung ultrasound, {{it is also true that}} many studies showed that sensitivity of lung ultrasound is far higher [1, 4 – 6]. The category of radio-occult pneumothorax is part of the daily experience of any physician who faces trauma patients, post-procedural thoracic complications and spontaneous pneumothoraces.|$|R
30|$|By {{performing}} a transverse scan above the sternal notch over the trachea, {{the location and}} appearance of the oesophagus can be noted. Intubation should then be performed. If the tube is seen passing into the oesophagus, remove it without ventilating the patient and make another intubation attempt, possibly using another technique. If the tube is not seen, {{or if it is}} seen in the trachea: ventilate the patient via the tube. Move the transducer to the midaxillary line, and look for lung sliding bilaterally. If there is bilateral lung sliding, it is confirmation that the tube is in the airway, but intubation of a main-stem bronchus cannot be ruled out. If there is one-sided lung <b>sliding</b> and lung <b>pulse</b> on the other side, then main-stem intubation is likely, and the tube should be withdrawn gradually until bilateral lung sliding is present. If there is no lung sliding on either side, but a lung pulse, there is a small risk of the tube having entered the oesophagus. If there is neither lung <b>pulse</b> nor lung <b>sliding,</b> then a pneumothorax should be expected. In experienced practitioners verification of endotracheal tube placement is as fast as auscultation alone and faster than the standard method of combined auscultation and capnography [77, 78].|$|R
40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Context. We {{introduce a}} new technique, called the Sliding Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum, used for detecting and characterising the temporal changes of drifting subpulses from radio pulsars. The method was tested using simulated data as well as archived observations made with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at wavelengths of 92 and 21 cm. Aims. The drifting subpulse phenomenon is a well known property of radio pulsars. It has been studied extensively since their discovery, however {{the properties of the}} temporal behaviour of drifting subpulses are not fully explored. The drifting can also be non-coherent and the presence of effects like nulling or drift rate changing can mask the drifting behaviour of the pulsar. The S 2 DFS is a robust method for investigating this phenomenon and by introducing it we aim to expand our knowledge of the temporal drifting subpulse properties. Methods. Our new analysis method uses horizonally collapsed fluctuation spectra obtained with the Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum (2 DFS) method. Stacking the collapsed spectra obtained in a 256 <b>pulse</b> window which <b>slides</b> by a <b>pulse</b> at a time produces a map of the collapsed fluctuation spectrum (S 2 DFS plot).
