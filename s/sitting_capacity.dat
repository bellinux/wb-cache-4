Bonnet was formally charged with only two acts of piracy, against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence {{in the trial of}} Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|R

But even someone who does not really know the answer to this question may nevertheless be able to analyze a few factors that contribute to the present mess we are in. The religion of Islam, and the Dutch reactions to it, are definitely parts of the problem. Islamic communities, if sufficiently large, develop two types of elite. I use `elite' here not only in its meaning of `a group that has a power out of proportion to its size', but also in the meaning of ‘a small group that thinks of itself as superior to all others'. The first elite are the Muslim religious professionals, the religious leaders, usually called imams in this country, but they are better known under their Iranian name, the Ayatollahs...|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{decisions}} of Holt had caused sufficient consternation as to {{the legal status of}} slaves that some slave owners sought clarity of the law. In 1729 various slave owners obtained the Yorke-Talbot slavery opinion made by the Crown's principal law officers at one of the Inns of Court. [...] The law officers opined that under English law (i) a slave's status did not change when he came to England, [...] (ii) a slave could be compelled to return to the colonies from England, and (iii) that baptism would not manumit a slave. The opinion cited no authorities, and set out no legal rationale for the views expressed in it, but it was widely published and relied upon. One {{of the authors of the}} opinion, Lord Hardwicke (although at the time he was only known as Philip Yorke), subsequently endorsed the views expressed in the opinion (although not expressly referring to it) whilst <b>sitting</b> in judicial <b>capacity</b> in Pearne v Lisle (1749) Amb 75, 27 ER 47. The case revolved around title to fourteen slaves who were in Antigua, and involved a number of technical points as to colonial law. But Lord Hardwicke held that slavery was not contrary to English law, and that as the common law of England applied at the time to Antigua, that slavery was not unlawful in Antigua.|$|R
40|$|In the Preface to {{the first}} edition of this work. the author stated its purpose to be, to furnish to the {{practitioner}} and the student of the law such a presentation of elementary constitutional principles as should serve, with the aid of its references to judicial decisions, legal treatises, and historical events, as a convenient guide in the examination of questions respecting the constitutional limitations which rest upon the power of the several State ·legislatures. In the accomplishment of that purpose, the author further stated that he had faithfully endeavored to give the law as it had been settled by the authorities, rather than to present his own views. At the same time, he did not attempt to deny - what he supposed would be sufficiently apparent- that he had written in full sympathy with all those restraints which the caution of the fathers had imposed upon the exercise of the powers of government, and with faith in the checks and balances of our republican system. and in correct conclusions by the general public sentiment, rather than in reliance upon a judicious, prudent, and just exercise of authority, when confided without restriction to any one man or body of men, whether <b>sitting</b> in legislative <b>capacity</b> or judicial. In this sympathy and faith he had written of jury trials and the other safeguards to personal liberty, of liberty of the press and of vested rights; and he had also endeavored to point ont that there are on all sides definite limitations which circumscribe the legislative authority, independent of the specific restrictions which the people impose by their State constitutions. But while not predisposed to discover in any part of our system the rightful existence of any unlimited power, created by the Constitution, neither, on the other hand, had he designed to advance new doctrines, or to do more than clearly and with reasonable conciseness to state the principles to be deduced from the judicial decisions.
