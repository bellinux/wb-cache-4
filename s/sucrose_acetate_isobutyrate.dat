In addition to glucose, other carbon fuels including fructose, <b>sucrose,</b> <b>acetate,</b> and ascorbic acid were also tested. When the anolyte containing S. oneidensis was grown {{in the presence of}} oxygen, power densities of 270 ± 10, 350 ± 20, and 120 ± 10 W/m 3 were recorded from the mini-MFC for glucose, fructose, and ascorbic acid electron donors, respectively, while <b>sucrose</b> and <b>acetate</b> produced no response. The power produced from glucose decreased considerably (≤ 100 W/m 3) if strictly anaerobic conditions were maintained. Based on the previously published proteomic and genomic literature on S. oneidensis, this reduction in power output is most likely due to the differential expression of proteins by these bacteria when grown under oxygen-rich or anoxic conditions. The power densities generated from the mini-MFC exposed to oxygen led to significant changes in current production over time with repeated feedings of these carbon nutrients.

40|$|Bone tissue {{engineering}} approaches commonly involve {{the delivery of}} recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins (rhBMPs). However, there are limitations associated with the currently used carriers, including the need for surgical implantation and the associated increase in infection risk. As an alternative to traditional porous collagen sponge, we have adopted a solution of the injectable <b>sucrose</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> (SAIB) as a carrier for rhBMP- 2. The ability to deliver rhBMP- 2 and other agents by injection reduces the infection risk and lesion size whilst in surgery, {{with the potential to}} avoid open surgery altogether in some indications. The primary methodology used for this in vivo study was a C 57 BL 6 /J mouse ectopic bone formation model. Specimens were examined by x-ray, microCT, and histology at 3 weeks. SAIB was delivered non-invasively and produced up to 3 -fold greater bone volume compared to collagen. To further refine and improve upon the formulation, SAIB containing rhBMP- 2 was admixed with candidate compounds including ceramic microparticles, anti-resorptives, and cell signalling inhibitors and further tested in vivo. The formulation combining SAIB/rhBMP- 2, the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZA), and hydroxyapatite (HA) microparticles yielded a 10 -fold greater bone volume than SAIB/rhBMP- 2 alone. To investigate the mechanism underlying the synergy between ZA and HA, we used in vitro binding assays and in vivo fluorescent biodistribution studies to demonstrate that ceramic particles could bind and sequester the bisphosphonate. These data show the utility of SAIB as a non-invasive rhBMP delivery system as well as describing an optimised formulation for bone {{tissue engineering}}...|$|E

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the ruminal epithelial tissue-associated bacterial (defined as epimural bacteria in this study) community is limited. In this study, we aimed to determine whether diet influences {{the diversity of the}} epimural bacterial community in the bovine rumen. Twenty-four beef heifers were randomly assigned to either a rapid grain adaptation (RGA) treatment (n = 18) in which the heifers were allowed to adapt from a diet containing 97 % hay to a diet containing 8 % hay over 29 days or to the control group (n = 6), which was fed 97 % hay. Rumen papillae were collected when the heifers were fed 97 %, 25 %, and 8 % hay diets. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative real-time PCR analysis were used to characterize rumen epimural bacterial diversity and to estimate the total epimural bacterial population (copy numbers of the 16 S rRNA gene). The epimural bacterial diversity from RGA heifers changed (P = 0. 01) in response to the rapid dietary transition, whereas it was not affected in control heifers. A total of 88 PCR-DGGE bands were detected, and 44 were identified from phyla including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. The bacteria Treponema sp., Ruminobacter sp., and Lachnospiraceae sp. were detected only when heifers were fed 25 % and 8 % hay diets, suggesting the presence of these bacteria is the result of adaptation to the high-grain diets.

40|$|In this work, {{through the}} use of thermal {{analysis}} techniques, the thermal stabilities of some antioxidants were investigated, in order to evaluate their resistance to thermal oxidation in oils, by heating canola vegetable oil, and to suggest that antioxidants would be more appropriate to increase the resistance of vegetable oils in the thermal degradation process in frying. The techniques used were: Thermal Gravimetric (TG) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses, as well as an allusion to a possible protective action of the vegetable oils, based on the thermal oxidation of canola vegetable oil in the laboratory under constant heating at 180 ºC/ 8 hours for 10 days. The studied antioxidants were: ascorbic acid, sorbic acid, citric acid, sodium erythorbate, BHT (3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxytoluene), BHA (2, 3 -tert-butyl- 4 -methoxyphenol), TBHQ (tertiary butyl hydroquinone), PG (propyl gallate) - described as antioxidants by ANVISA and the FDA; and also the phytic acid antioxidant and the SAIB (<b>sucrose</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>isobutyrate)</b> additive, which is used in the food industry, in order to test its behavior as an antioxidant in vegetable oil. The following antioxidants: citric acid, sodium erythorbate, BHA, BHT, TBHQ and sorbic acid decompose at temperatures below 180 ºC, and therefore, have little protective action in vegetable oils undergoing frying processes. The antioxidants below: phytic acid, ascorbic acid and PG, are the most resistant and begin their decomposition processes at temperatures between 180 and 200 ºC. The thermal analytical techniques have also shown that the SAIB antioxidant is the most resistant to oxidative action, and it can be a useful choice in the thermal decomposition prevention of edible oils, improving stability regarding oxidative processes...|$|E
40|$|Consumer's {{demand for}} more natural and high quality food {{products}} products, presenting health benefits, has increased over the years. Besides the nutritional aspects, an appealing appearance and texture is also required. Cloudiness or opacity (cloudy appearance) is an important citrus drinks property (orange, lime, lemon, etc.), since it gives natural fruit juice appeal. This property can be achieved through addition of clouding agents, which also help in uniform distribution of flavors throughout the liquid beverage. A common problem in the beverage industry is producing cloud or flavor emulsions that remain stable over the desired shelf life. Beverage cloud emulsions are oil-in-water emulsions to provide cloudiness and are prepared in a concentrated form, but diluted prior to the consumption. Optical and rheological properties of beverage cloud emulsions {{as a function of}} water-phase and oil-phase concentrations were investigated. The specific gravity of phases, particle size distribution and creaming stability of prepared emulsions in diluted forms were evaluated. The rate of cloud emulsion creaming by determining the rheology of water phase, difference in specific gravities of the phases and droplet properties of the emulsion in presence and absence of weighting agents (<b>sucrose</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> and brominated vegetable oil) or/and xanthan gum was studied. Flow and dynamic rheological properties of single-phases and emulsions containing modified starch and arabic gum as surface active hydrocolloids as well as xanthan and tragacanth as stabilizers gums were investigated. Finally, stability of cloud emulsions in orange juice drink was examined. Oil-phase concentration had a significant effect (P < 0. 05) on increasing the opacity of emulsion. Raise in viscosity of emulsions was more pronounced as oil concentration increased and shear thinning behavior of oil added emulsions was associated with droplet flocculation. Creaming in acidified sugar solution of 11 °Bx and pH 3 was observed when the oil-phase specific gravity decreased and sedimentation occurred at the lower viscosity of water phase. Addition of xanthan gum into the water phase decreased the flow behavior index (n) form 0. 88 down to 0. 31 and increased elastic modulus (G') over 20 times at elevated frequency (o = 50 rad/s) and perk up the stability of the emulsion. The xanthan gum added emulsion indicated smaller average particle size and demonstrated 14 and 5 times slower separation compared to the emulsions without or with the addition of weighting agents respectively. Starch-xanthan stabilized emulsion and associated water phase at 1. 5 : 1 surface active gum to oil ratio demonstrated viscoelastic behavior (G' ≥ G") with lower droplets coalescence and creaming rates, 0. 013 nm/day and 0. 02 percent backscattering/day respectively. Conversely, arabic-xanthan stabilized emulsion at 1 : 1 gum to oil ratio showed the highest rate of droplets coalescence at 0. 057 rim/day and greater degree of creaming at 0. 61 percent transmission/day. While creaming were associated with arabic gum stabilized emulsions, after 3 month storage, modified starch illustrated appropriate shelf stability with no sign of creaming in orange juice drink...|$|E

Peptides were fermented to <b>acetate,</b> <b>isobutyrate,</b> isovalerate, 2 -methylbutyrate, H 2, and CO 2. The addition of either thiosulfate of sulfur but not sulfate increased peptide utilization, growth rate, and biomass; during growth, H 2 S was produced and a concomitant decrease in H 2 was observed. The addition of either thiosulfate or sulfur also reversed H 2 inhibition. 16 S rRNA sequence analysis indicates that strain SEBR 4207 (T) is distantly related to members of the genus #Thermoanaerobacter$ (83 % similarity).

40|$|ABSTRACT Complete {{mineralization}} of {{chlorinated solvents}} by microbial {{action has been}} demonstrated under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions. In most of the cases, {{it is believed that}} the biodegradation is initiated by broad-specificity enzymes involved in metabolism of a primary substrate. Under aerobic conditions, some of the primary carbon and energy substrates are methane, propane, toluene, phenol, and ammonia; under anaerobic conditions, glucose, <b>sucrose,</b> <b>acetate,</b> propionate, isopropanol, methanol, and even natural organics act as the carbon source. Published biochemical studies suggest that the limiting step is often the initial part of the biodegradation pathway within the microbial system. For aerobic systems, the limiting step is thought to be the reaction catalyzed by mono- and dioxygenases which are induced by most primary substrates, although some constitutive strains have been reported. Other critical features of the biodegradative pathway include: 1) activity losses of critical enzyme(s) through the action of metabolic byproducts, 2) energetic needs of contaminant biodegradation which must be met by catabolism of the primary substrates, 3) changes in metabolic patterns in mixed cultures found in nature depending on the availability of electron acceptors, and 4) the associated accumulation and disappearance of metabolic intermediates. Often, the contaminant pool itself consists of several chlorinated solvents with separate and interactive biochemical needs. The existing models address some of the issues mentioned above. However, their ability to successfully predict biological fate of chlorinated solvents in nature is severely limited due to the existing mathematical models. Limiting step(s), inactivation of critical enzymes, recovery action, energetics, and a framework for multiple degradative pathways will be presented as a comprehensive model...|$|R

In Expt 1, all substrates were incubated in batch cultures with rumen micro-organisms from goats for 24 h. Increasing amounts of tomato, cucumber and the mixture of both fruits in the substrate increased final pH and gas production, without changes in final ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N) concentrations, substrate degradability and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, indicating {{that there were no}} detrimental effects of any waste fruits on rumen fermentation.

Abundance of total bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, fungi, methanogenic archaea and protozoa were similar in fermenters fed T 250 and CON substrates, but fermenters fed C 250 and M 250 substrates had lower abundances of R. flavefaciens, fungi and protozoa than those fed the CON substrate. Results indicated that tomato fruits could replace dietary barley grain up to 250 g/kg of substrate DM without noticeable effects on rumen fermentation and microbial populations, but the inclusion of cucumber fruits at 250 g/kg of substrate DM negatively affected some microbial populations as it tended to reduce microbial N synthesis and changed the VFA profile. More studies are needed to identify the dietary inclusion level of cucumber which produces no detrimental effects on rumen fermentation and microbial growth...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} phenotypic {{and physiological}} studies with 20 hyperthermophilic microorganisms isolated from hydrothermal vents {{located in the}} North Fiji Basin (southwestern Pacific Ocean) {{at a depth of}} 2, 000 m. These isolates were strict anaerobes that were regular to irregular coccoids and used elemental sulfur in their metabolism. Growth was observed at temperatures ranging from 50 to 101 °C. The DNA base compositions varied from 43 to 60 mol%. All of these organisms were heterotrophs and fermented peptides to <b>acetate,</b> isovalerate, <b>isobutyrate,</b> and propionate. They contained both diether and tetraether lipids in their membranes, which indicates that they belong to the domain Archaea. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed that there were two distinct homology groups, which correlated well with results obtained from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of soluble whole-cell proteins, and these groups corresponded to the genera Pyrococcus and Thermococcus. Five isolates exhibited levels of DNA-DNA relatedness with Pyrococcus abyssi ranging from 71 to 100 % and produced almost identical protein patterns. The remaining isolates formed a weakly homogeneous group based on DNA-DNA similarity data and protein patterns; the results of unweighted pair group cluster analyses suggested that these isolates were members of five new species of the genus Thermococcus. Since the first discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents nea...|$|R
40|$|The hydrodistilled {{essential}} oils from flowers of five Adriatic populations of Anthemis maritima were analysed by GC-FID and GC/MS. Anthemis maritima is a psammophilous plant living generally on coastal sand dunes but occasionally on sea cliffs and shingle beaches. 163 chemical compounds {{were identified in}} total, accounting for 90. 5 % of the oils. The main classes of compounds represented in the {{essential oils}} were monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes and terpene esters. In particular, cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis, the multivariate chemometric techniques used to classify the samples, highlighted three different chemotypes linked to a geographic origin. One group living in Northern Italy was characterised by the highest content of -pinene, -terpinene and -caryophyllene, a second chemotype was in Central Italy with the highest amount of trans-chrysanthenyl acetate and a third group living in Southern Italy with a more heterogeneous volatile profile was characterised by the highest values of cis-chrysanthenyl <b>acetate,</b> trans-chrysanthenyl <b>isobutyrate,</b> cis-carveol propionate, -zingiberene and cubenol. Moreover, the comparison of the Adriatic populations with the Tyrrhenian samples, analysed in a previous research, showed that cubenol (absent in all the Tyrrhenian populations) and (E) --farnesene (absent in all the Adriatic samples) {{play a crucial role}} in discriminating the Italian populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of the overall pyruvate dehydrogenase complex {{was found to be}} similar in extracts of Aspergillus nidulans after growth on either <b>sucrose</b> or <b>acetate.</b> Eight mutants lacking the {{activity of}} this complex were found among some 200 glycolytic mutants selected for their inability to grow on sucrose. The absence of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity was also confirmed for a mutant, g 6 (pdhA 1), isolated previously. Studies with the mutants supported the existence of two unlinked genes, pdhA and pdhB, controlling the function of the complex. In vivo and in vitro complementation between mutations at the two loci were shown by the ability of forced heterokaryons to grow on sucrose and by the restoration of overall pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity in mixed cell-free extracts. The mutations were recessive to their wild-type alleles, and the pdhA and pdhB loci were assigned to linkage groups I and V, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophilic {{anchoring}} {{is introduced}} as a promising strategy to constructively control the various interactions of synthetic pore sensors {{with the surrounding}} biphasic environment. Artificial rigid-rod beta barrels are selected as classical synthetic multifunctional pores and random-coil tetralysines are attached as hydrophilic anchors. The synthesis of this advanced pore is accomplished in 32 steps from commercially available starting materials. With regard to pore activity as such, the key impact of hydrophilic anchoring is a change from a Hill coefficient n EC(50)). These results not only reveal stoichiometric binding as the expected origin of the sensitivity limit of synthetic pore sensors, they also provide promising solutions for this problem. The combination of hydrophilic anchoring with targeted pore formation emerges as a particularly promising strategy to further reduce effective pore concentrations. The scope and limitations of this approach are exemplified with pertinent analyte pairs that are essential for the sensing of <b>sucrose,</b> lactose, <b>acetate,</b> and glutamate with synthetic pores in samples from the supermarket...|$|R
40|$|A {{strictly}} anaerobic, gram-positive, sporulating rod (0. 5 - 0. 6 x 2. 0 - 4. 0 microm), designated strain Lup 21 T, {{was isolated}} from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating cheese-factory wastewater. Strain Lup 21 T was motile {{by means of}} peritrichous flagella, had a G+C content of 31. 4 mol% and grew optimally at 37 degrees C, pH 7. 4, {{in the absence of}} NaCl. It is a heterotrophic micro-organism, utilizing proteinaceous compounds (gelatin, peptides, Casamino acids and various single amino acids) but unable to use any of the carbohydrates tested as a carbon and energy source. It reduced thiosulfate and elemental sulfur to sulfide in the presence of Casamino acids as carbon and energy sources. <b>Acetate,</b> butyrate, <b>isobutyrate,</b> isovalerate, CO 2 and sulfide were end products from oxidation of gelatin and Casamino acids in the presence of thiosulfate as an electron acceptor. In the absence of thiosulfate, serine, lysine, methionine and histidine were fermented. On the basis of 16 S rRNA similarity, strain Lup 21 T was related to members of the low-G+C Clostridiales group, Clostridium subterminale DSM 6970 T being the closest relative (with a sequence similarity of 99. 4 %). DNA-DNA hybridization was 56 % with this species. On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the isolate was designated as a novel species of the genus Clostridium, Clostridium thiosulfatireducens sp. nov. The type strain is strain Lup 21 T (= DSM 13105 T = CIP 106908 T) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{electrophysiological}} {{investigation was}} performed to analyse activity recorded in response to stimulation with concentrated and diluted solutions of NaCl, <b>sucrose,</b> formamidine <b>acetate,</b> and sodium acetate from labellar chemosensilla of the dipteran Protophormia terraenovae. A computerized analysis of this activity led to the finding of four kinds of spikes (A, B, C, and D) which differed in their wave forms. The forms of spikes A, B, and C are described in the literature as being evoked by activation of the specific salt, water, and sugar neurones respectively. The fourth type of spike (D) recorded in response to formamidine acetate and sodium acetate is probably generated by a fourth chemosensorial cell {{that has not yet}} been defined functionally. These two acetates evoke activities that are equivalent both in spike frequency and time distribution even at low concentrations. The results suggest that the acetate ion in the blowfly effectively stimulates the fourth chemosensory neuron present in the sensillum. The activation appears to be involved in signalling acidity to the insect...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{environmental}} chamber experiments and computer model calculations {{were carried out}} to assess the atmospheric ozone formation potentials of selected organic compounds representative of those emitted from consumer products. This information is needed to reduce the uncertainties of ozone reactivity scales for stationary source emissions. The compounds studied were cyclohexane, cyclohexane, isopropyl alcohol, the three octanol isomers, diethyl ether, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl <b>acetate,</b> methyl <b>isobutyrate,</b> n-butyl <b>acetate,</b> and propylene glycol methyl ether acetate. "Incremental reactivity" experiments were carried out {{to determine the effect}} of each compound on O 3 formation, NO oxidation and integrated OH radical levels when added to irradiations of reactive organic gas (ROG) - NO x mixtures representing simplified polluted urban atmospheres. Differing ROG surrogates and ROG/NO x ratios were employed to test how the impacts of the compounds vary with chemical conditions. In addition, single compound - NO x irradiations were carried out for the various ketones, OH radical rate constants were measured for the octanol isomers and propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, and the yields of the C 8 carbonyl products were determined for each of the octanol isomers. The results of these experiments were used in the development and testing of the SAPRC- 99 mechanism that is documented in detail in a separate report (Carter, 2000). The data obtained, in conjunction with results of industry-funded studies of related compounds, has resulted in significantly reduced uncertainties in estimates of ozone impacts of the wide variety of oxygenated compounds present in consumer product emissions inventories. However, uncertainties still remain, [...] ...|$|R
