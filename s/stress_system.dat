25|$|The Estonian {{language}} is a Finnic language, together with the neighboring Finland. According to some sources, the Livonian language has {{had a role in}} the development of Latvian. The fixed first syllable stress in Latvian owes its existence to Livonian influence, according to early-20th century research.

25|$|It {{inhibits}} {{production of}} interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper (Th)1 cells, but upregulates IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 by Th2 cells. This {{results in a}} shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the <b>stress</b> <b>system</b> (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection {{is believed to be}} a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the high}} levels of anxiety seen in IBS {{patients}} and the overlap with conditions such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, a potential model of IBS involves a disruption of the <b>stress</b> <b>system.</b> The stress response in the body involves the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system, both of which have been shown to operate abnormally in IBS patients. Psychiatric illness or anxiety precedes IBS symptoms in two-thirds of patients, and psychological traits predispose previously healthy people to developing IBS after gastroenteritis.|$|E
40|$|Stress, via the {{activation}} of the <b>stress</b> response <b>system,</b> {{has been linked to}} the emergence of cardiovascular precursors. The majority of studies relating the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, the two main branches of the <b>stress</b> response <b>system,</b> to <b>stress</b> and cardiovascular precursors have focused on examining each branch of the <b>stress</b> response <b>system</b> in isolation. However, considering only these singular associations disregards the structural and functional inter-connection between the <b>stress</b> response <b>systems.</b> Examining the inter-relation between the <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> among children and adolescents is particular opportune given the emergence of cardiovascular precursors early in the life course. The objective of the current research program was to examine the patterning of the cardio-autonomic nervous system and HPA axis, and whether the inter-relation between these <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> was associated with cardiovascular precursors among children. Three studies were conducted. Study 1 demonstrated the patterning of the <b>stress</b> response <b>system,</b> and found that the inter-relation between <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> better accounted for the relation between stress and the <b>stress</b> response <b>system</b> than either system alone. Extending these results, Study 2 demonstrated that the inter-relation between <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> was associated with cardiovascular precursors in a population-based sample of children. Exposure to stress moderated the association between inter-relation of <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> and cardiovascular precursors, which was more robust among children with greater stressful life events. Study 3 replicated these results in a sample of children at-risk for obesity, and demonstrated that the inter-relation between <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> was related to cardiovascular precursors among at-risk children with greater stress exposure. Overall, this research program found that the inter-relation between the <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> was related to cardiovascular precursors, and children’s environmental exposure to stressful events influenced these associations. Future studies should consider using an inter-relation approach, which may provide greater insight into the association between stress and cardiovascular health than considering the <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> independently. The patterning of the <b>stress</b> response <b>system</b> has implications for future studies examining how stress “gets under the skin” to promote the development of disease...|$|R

This paper discusses a connectionist model that learns a variety of stress patterns without the incorporation, as processing primitives, of theoretical linguistic constructs such as metrical foot and parameter. An analysis of the learnability of various stress patterns is developed, based on learning results and connection weights developed for different <b>stress</b> <b>systems.</b> This analysis predicts that certain aspects of <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> {{will be more difficult}} to learn, at least within the computational framework adopted.

40|$|Perturbations {{early in}} life {{including}} exposure to stress during the prenatal and early postnatal period appear to have profound and lasting consequences for development that may be mediated through dysregulation of physiological <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> (e. g., Cicchetti and Blender, 2004; Davis et al., 2007; Phillips, 2007; Gunnar and Quevedo, 2008). The biological stress response consists primarily of the hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (Mason, 1975; Chrousos and Gold, 1992). Evaluation {{of the consequences of}} early life stress exposure requires assessment of the dynamic interplay between these two physiological <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> during devel-opment. Studies evaluating biological <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> in young children, however, are hampered by the need to use mini-mally invasive measures.

Thus, research evaluating the development of individual differ-ences in stress regulation and the role that physiological <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> play in shaping development have focused primarily on the correlates and concomitants of the activity of the HPA axis (e. g., Stansbury and Gunnar, 1994; Davis et al., 1999).

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} is a chronically relapsing disorder characterized by compulsion to seek and take drugs {{and has been}} linked to dysregulation of brain regions that mediate reward and stress. Activation of brain <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> is hypothesized to be key to the negative emotional state produced by dependence that drives drug seeking through negative reinforcement mechanisms. This review explores the role of brain <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> (corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, orexin [hypocretin], vasopressin, dynorphin) and brain antistress systems (neuropeptide Y, nociceptin [orphanin FQ]) in drug dependence, with emphasis on the neuropharmacological function of extrahypothalamic systems in the extended amygdala. The brain <b>stress</b> and antistress <b>systems</b> may {{play a key role in}} the transition to and maintenance of drug dependence once initiated.

40|$|AIMS: The {{purpose of}} this review {{is to provide a}} {{synthesis}} of our knowledge of the neurobiological bases of addiction relevant for the diagnosis of addiction. METHODS: A heuristic framework of neuroadaptive changes within key brain neurocircuitry responsible for different stages of the addiction cycle is outlined and linked to human studies to provide important future translational links for diagnosis. RESULTS: Animal studies have revealed dysregulation of specific neurochemical mechanisms (dopamine, opioid peptides) in the brain reward systems and recruitment of brain <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> (corticotropin-releasing factor) during the development of dependence that convey vulnerability to relapse. Animal studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala in drug- and cue-induced relapse, respectively, and the brain <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> in stress-induced relapse. Genetic studies suggest roles for the genes encoding the neurochemical elements involved in both the brain reward and <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> in the vulnerability to addiction, and molecular studies have identified transduction and transcription factors that may mediate dependence-induced reward dysregulation. Human imaging studies reveal similar neurocircuits involved in acute intoxication, chronic drug dependence and vulnerability to relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Major neurobiological changes in substance abuse disorders common to human and animal studies relevant for diagnosis include a compromised reward <b>system,</b> overactivated brain <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> and compromised orbitofrontal/prefrontal cortex function. No biological markers of substance abuse disorders currently exist, but there are many promising neurobiological features of substance abuse disorders that will eventually aid in the specific diagnoses of substance use, misuse and dependence...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{addiction}} can {{be defined}} by a three-stage cycle – binge/intoxication, with-drawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation – that involves allostatic changes in the brain reward and <b>stress</b> <b>systems.</b> Two primary sources of reinforcement, positive and negative reinforcement, have been hypothesized {{to play a role}} in this allostatic process. The negative emotional state that drives negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from dysregulation of key neurochemical elements involved in the brain reward and <b>stress</b> <b>systems.</b> Specific neurochemical elements in these structures include not only decreases in reward system function (within-system opponent processes) but also recruitment of the brain <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and dynorphin-κ opioid systems in the ventral striatum, extended amygdala, and frontal cortex (both between-system opponent processes). CRF antagonists block anxiety-like responses asso-ciated with withdrawal, block increases in reward thresholds produced by withdrawal from drugs of abuse, and block compulsive-like drug taking during extended access. Excessive drug taking also engages the activation of CRF in the medial prefrontal cortex, paralleled by deficits in executive function that may facilitate the transition to compulsive-like respond...|$|R

We examine whether (1) function of biological <b>stress</b> <b>systems,</b> (2) adverse life events, and (3) their combination predict {{the onset of}} chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain. Methods Subjects (n= 2039) of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, free from chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain at baseline, were identified using the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire and followed up for the onset of chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain over 6  years. Baseline assessment of biological <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> comprised function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (1 -h cortisol awakening response, evening levels, postdexamethasone levels), the immune system (basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammation) and the autonomic nervous system (heart rate, pre-ejection period, SD of the normal-to-normal interval, respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The number of recent adverse life events was assessed at baseline using the List of Threatening Events Questionnaire. Results Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, immune system and autonomic nervous system functioning {{was not associated with}} onset of chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain, either by itself or in interaction with adverse life events. Adverse life events did predict onset of chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain (HR per event= 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 04 to 1. 24, p= 0. 005). Conclusions This longitudinal study could not confirm that dysregulated biological <b>stress</b> <b>systems</b> increase the risk of developing chronic multisite musculoskeletal pain.
