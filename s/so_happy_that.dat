5|$|After the Ice King captures Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake {{manage to}} save her. Bubblegum is <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>that</b> {{she decides to}} throw a party for Finn as a thank you. Finn makes a Paper Crane for Bubblegum as a gift, but Jake says that Finn has a crush on her, which Finn denies. When they arrive at the party, however, no one notices them; everyone, {{including}} Bubblegum, is too preoccupied with a heart-shaped man named Ricardio. He and Bubblegum begin discussing scientific topics on the dance floor, which leaves Finn feeling jealous.|$|E
25|$|Lü Meng {{rejected}} the coins and gold, but Sun Quan {{insisted that he}} accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as Lü Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but {{felt that it was}} too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng's room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night when he saw that Lü Meng did not eat anything. When Lü Meng's condition improved slightly, he was <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>that</b> he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng's death. Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their priced possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.|$|E

[...] What will there be between us old codgers, aside of course from happy memories of skiing tours in the long distant past ... Will you come to me mainly to take receipt of the promised gift I have held for you in our cellar—that long cured Westphalian ham, and those patiently waiting bottles of your favorite nectar: Johannisberger 1937? [...] Could these things of the senses end up being all that there is between us? [...] I am <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>that</b> the moment approaches, but my heart is heavy..." ...|$|E

500|$|Israel {{qualified}} one rider in the women's Olympic road race, Shani Bloch, {{by virtue}} of a top-22 international finish in the 2016 Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) World Rankings, signifying the nation's Olympic comeback to the sport {{for the first time}} since 1960. Bloch had retired in 2004 to start a family, but came out of retirement in 2014, training with her Israeli teammates to qualify for Rio. She was the oldest member of the Rio delegation at the age of 37. On finishing, the race Bloch said [...] "I’m <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>that</b> I managed to finish the race. This gives me an amazing sense of satisfaction. I’m so proud to represent Israel. I thank God for this opportunity." [...] Bloch was ranked 88 in the world at the time of qualification, and finished in 48th place with a time of 4:02:59.|$|E
500|$|Morgan's {{individual}} {{event was}} the 400-metre freestyle. She reduced her personal best by 2.3 seconds in recording {{a time of}} 5 minutes 7.8 seconds in the heats, just 0.2 of a second behind Marley Shriver of the United States, who set a new Olympic record. The mark was surpassed in later heats by Fraser and Crapp, but Morgan nevertheless qualified fourth fastest for the final, almost seven seconds faster than the cutoff. The final was held {{the day after the}} relay final. Morgan was unable to repeat her heat performance, finishing sixth in a time of 5 minutes 14.3 seconds, far outside her personal best. Had she repeated her heat swim, she would have placed fourth, just 0.7 of a second from the bronze medal. Nevertheless, she noted that [...] "I was <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>that</b> I had made the final in an individual event in the Olympic Games, for this was my first appearance in a senior competition".|$|E
500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of {{additional}} filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in [...] "15 to 25 takes" [...] as {{he did not feel}} the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's amazing how much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>that</b> I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story." [...] Brooks's directing style [...] "drove [...] bats", especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as [...] "free-falling. You're not going for some result. It's just, throw it in the air and see where it lands." [...] The film was poorly received and was a box-office failure.|$|E

500|$|Accompanied by her adviser, Neto, Manasa {{descended to}} earth to see human devotees. She was {{initially}} mocked {{by the people}} but then Manasa forced them to worship her by raining calamity on those who denied her power. She managed to convert people from different walks of life, including the Muslim ruler Hasan, but failed to convert Chand Sadagar [...] Manasa {{wanted to become a}} goddess like Lakshmi or Saraswati. To get there she had to achieve the worship of Chand Sadagar who was extremely adamant and took oath not to worship Manasa. Thus to gain his fear and insecurity, Manasa one by one killed his six sons [...] At last Manasa conspired against two dancers of Indras Court who loved each other, Anirudha and Usha [...] Anirudh had to take birth as Lakhinder, Chand and Sanaka's seventh son. Usha took birth as behula and married him. Manasa killed him but Behula floated on water for nine months with the dead body of her husband and finally brought back the lives of the seven sons and the lost prosperity of Chand. At last, he yielded by offering a flower to the goddess with his left hand without even looking at her. This gesture made Manasa <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>that</b> she resurrected all of Chand's sons and restored his fame and fortunes. The Mangal kavyas say that after this, the worship of Manasa was popular forever.|$|E
