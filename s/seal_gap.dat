50|$|Magnetic liquid rotary seals {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical seal assemblies called rotary feedthroughs, which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the <b>seal</b> <b>gap,</b> and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid held magnetically between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the drag torque very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, bearing arrangements, and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10−8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 °C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|E

In {{order to meet the}} static seal requirements of large gap in aviation, aerospace, metallurgy, and so on, we set up the experimental rig of magnetic fluid static seal and designed the static seal of magnetic fluid. In the experimental rig, we studied the static seal of magnetic fluid and obtained the relationships among the burst pressure and the amount of injection of magnetic fluid, <b>seal</b> <b>gap,</b> temperature and magnetization in the experimental rig.

40|$|Earlier {{version of}} an indigenously {{developed}} Pressure Wave Generator (PWG) could not develop the necessary pressure ratio to satisfactorily operate a pulse tube cooler, largely due to high blow by losses in the piston cylinder <b>seal</b> <b>gap</b> and due to a few design deficiencies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a feasibility study on air-riding seal aeroelasticity for large-diameter aero-engines. A literature survey of previous seal studies revealed a significant amount of experimental work but numerical modeling using CFD techniques was relatively scarce. Indeed, most existing theoretical studies either deal with the structural behavior, or use simplified flow modeling. The aeroelasticity stability of a simplified air-riding seal geometry, devised for this particular feasibility study, was analyzed in three dimensions for typical engine operating conditions. Both the unsteady flow and structural vibration aspects were considered in the investigation. The boundary conditions and the <b>seal</b> <b>gap</b> were varied to explore the capabilities and limitations of a state-of-the-art unsteady flow and aeroelasticity code. The methodology was based on integrating the fluid and structural domains in a time-accurate fashion by exchanging boundary condition information at each time step. The predicted characteristics, namely lift and flow leakage as a function of pressure and <b>seal</b> <b>gap,</b> were found to be in agreement with the expected behavior. Operating seal gaps were determined from the actual time histories of the seal motion under the effect of the aerodynamic and the restoring spring forces. Both stable and unstable cases were considered. It was concluded that, in principle, the existing numerical tools could be used for the flow and aeroelasticity analyses of hydrostatic seals. However, due to large Mach number variations, the solution convergence rate was relatively slow and it was recognized that a preconditioner was needed to handle seal flows. For small gaps of about 10 microns, typical of spiral groved seals, the flow has a high Knudsen number, indicating that the Navier-Stokes formulations may no longer be valid. Such cases require a totally different treatment for the modeling of steady and unsteady aerodynamics, either by modifying the transport parameters of the Navier-Stokes equations or by considering rarefied gas dynamics...|$|E

The expounded approaches uses solution of 3 D Navier-Stokes momentum and continuity equations for various forms of grooved gas seals, particular for the trapezoidal shape variety for which {{there has been a}} particular dearth of in-depth analysis.

30|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) can be tribo-chemically smoothened {{during a}} self-mated sliding {{procedure}} in the aqueous environment. As well {{reported in the}} point-contact tests, this smoothening process works well due to the abundant water as oxidant. After this smoothening process, the tribo-surface is well polished, a closely mated tribo-gap naturally forms, and an ultra-low friction state is built. However, water in the tribo-gap could be insufficient in industrial applications, e.g., the <b>seal</b> <b>gap</b> in mechanical seals. In this study, the tribo-chemical smoothening behavior in such environment was researched. A surface-contact reciprocating {{test was used to}} simulate the aqueous environment where water was insufficient. After tests, compared to the published results from the point-contact tests, the same ultra-low friction state was achieved. A part of the tribo-surface was tribo-chemically smoothened. The obtained smoothened surface microstructure was consistent with the published information. Meanwhile, severe abrasive wear occurred. A porous oxygen-rich layer was found existing beneath the abrasion-induced grooves, in which numerous smashed wear debris adhered on the worn surfaces. We concluded that the shortage of water initiated the severe abrasion, meanwhile the generated wear debris aggravated the wear condition. This understanding is instructive for developing new methods to avoid the severe abrasion in the same water insufficient environment.|$|E
40|$|Sophisticated methods (CFD analyses) {{are used}} {{more and more}} for the {{analysis}} of gas seal forces. However, for some types of seals such as honeycomb or hole pattern seals bulk-flow models are still the only feasible way. Ha and Childs introduced such a model in their paper [4]. The entrance loss factor in their model is constant, what apparently leads to an incomplete consideration of the Lomakin effect. Comparison to measured results shows considerable deviation for the radial forces in annular gas seal. The present paper is dedicated to investigation of the cause of this deviation. For this purpose an extended model for entry conditions is proposed. The entrance loss factor is considered {{as a function of the}} seal clearance. Numerical computations of the pressure loss at the entrance of the gas seal using the FLUENT code are performed.

Seals must remain in sealing engagement with opposing surfaces, for multiple missions, {{even though the}} <b>seal</b> <b>gap</b> may be opening and closing due to thermal and structural loads.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 246 - 253 In {{many cases}} it is {{necessary}} to judge the stability behavior of a specific compressor. This might be the OEM checking the feasibility of a proposed compressor layout or it might be the user judging one of his machines which causes troubles in operation. API 617 suggests a stability level I or level II analysis. The shortcoming of the level I analysis is that it considers only the global cross-coupling stiffness of the entire stages neglecting the actual seal design of a compressor. Thus the damping of a machine is always decreasing with increasing load which is not reflecting the true stability behavior of modern turbo compressors. On the other hand a level II analysis requires detailed insight into the machine design which might not be defined at that time or which is not known to the user. To overcome these problems this tutorial proposes a different kind of stability check which only requires a minimum of operational and design data and delivers a comprehensible and (relatively) reliable picture of the stability behavior of the investigated compressor. This tutorial derives the used stability criterion and explains the effect of the circumferential speed of the gas in the <b>seal</b> <b>gap</b> on the rotordynamic behavior. Finally it presents example calculations for different seal configurations and compares the resulting stability judgments to the results of the classical API level II analysis and to the results of experimentally determined rotor damping...|$|E
