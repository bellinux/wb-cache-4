5000|$|The Riviera is a unique, {{though not}} unattractive design, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} famous Republic <b>Seabee</b> of the 1940s. The major difference between the Riviera and the <b>Seabee</b> {{is the use of}} a high twin-boom tail arrangement on the Riviera while the <b>Seabee</b> uses a single conventional tail. The Riviera uses a tricycle landing gear, with the nose gear retracting into the nose and concealed behind two small nose gear doors. As a result, forward visibility is somewhat better in the Riviera than in the <b>Seabee</b> when taxiing or taking off on land. The Riviera is powered by a [...] Continental IO-470-P six-cylinder flat engine mounted above the fuselage in a pusher arrangement. A three-bladed propeller was standard.|$|R

The <b>Seabees</b> used backhoes to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was still burning eight hours after impact.|$|E
