50|$|In {{response}} to Tegmark's claims, Hagan, Tuszynski and Hameroff claimed that Tegmark {{did not address}} the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24 nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, although still far below 25 ms. Hameroff's group also suggested that the Debye layer of counterions could screen thermal fluctuations, and that the surrounding actin gel might enhance the ordering of water, further <b>screening</b> <b>noise.</b> They also suggested that incoherent metabolic energy could further order water, and finally that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of resisting quantum decoherence.|$|R

40|$|Windbreaks play an {{important}} role in the protection of livestock, particularly in young animals and in areas with cold northerly winds during the winter and early spring. Properly placed windbreaks can provide benefits to feedlots, livestock pastures, and calving areas. Reducing wind speed in winter lowers animal stress, improves animal health, and increases feeding efficiency. Livestock windbreaks provide significant amounts of wildlife habitat, protect the working environment in and around the livestock area, and <b>screen</b> <b>noise</b> and odors associated with livestock operations. Specific needs of animals dictate that special attention be given to access, snow storage, and drainage when planning a livestock windbreak. Each windbreak should be designed to meet the specific livestock operation. A well-thought-out and properly cared for windbreak protects livestock in both the winter and summer and will provide economic benefits to the landowner over the long term. The time spent on layout, site preparation, weed control, and replanting is paid back many times throughout the life of a windbreak...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In Iran country, small {{enterprise}} {{with less than}} 10 workers comprise about % 90 of all industries and 80 % of working population. Noise, higher than the permissible level is among the hazardous agents, workers in these plants facing with. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the correlation between <b>screening</b> estimation and <b>noise</b> measurement in small plants.. Material and Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 51 plants with less than 5 workers. <b>Noise</b> <b>screening</b> was done using <b>screening</b> from. Next, <b>noise</b> level was measured in all the plants by TES- 1358 sound level meter and regular grid method. Data were analyzed using chi-square test and linear regression in SPSS version 16.. Result: The mean (SD) scores of sound pressure level and screening form were 86. 5 dBA (4. 5) and 64. 2 (9. 4) in 51 understudy plants, respectively. According to the results of sound measurement, sound level in 34 plants (66. 6 %) exceeded the permissible level and in 17 plants (33. 33 %) was below the limit. The results of screening forms showed that 47 plants (92. 16 %) had permissible level of noise while noise in 4 (7. 84 %) was not in permissible level. Chi square test revealed no significant relationship between the results of the two methods, based on the permissible and impermissible limits (p-Value= 0. 288). Furthermore, according to the regression analysis, R 2 was obtained 0. 357 [...] Conclusion: No correlation was shown between the results of the two methods used. Thus, it is recommended to change the parameters used in the <b>noise</b> <b>screening</b> form for small plants, with less than 5 workers...|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis a software, MapMonit, {{that use}} real {{measurement}} data {{as a basis}} to calculate noise maps was studied. The project focus on noise from roads. Simulations in MapMonit based on measurements were compared with control measurements and simulations of existing noise computation software. The software used for comparison was CadnaA. The project started with measurements of road traffic noise with four microphone heights at four distances {{that would be used}} as input to the software called MapMonit. Since {{this was the first time}} the software ever got tested with real measurements, the first test site was chosen to be as simple as possible with a long, straight road and surrounding flat fields. The microphone distances from the road edge were 5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 100 m with microphone heights 0. 4 m, 1. 5 m, 2 m and 4 m at each of the distances. A grid of control microphones were positioned in the vicinity from 10 m to 180 m from the road edge. At distances 5 m to 20 m for microphone heights 1. 5 m to 4 m, the results turned out to be very good. The difference between the A-weighted levels of MapMonit simulations and the control measurements was generally less than 1 dB for all control positions. Compared to CadnaA, the two simulated levels were very similar for propagation paths up to 100 m with differences below 1. 4 dB. At control distances over 170 m, the difference was very high, up to 5. 3 dB, with MapMonit simulating the highest values. A complicated test site in the vicinity of a <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> were also studied. The reference microphones for input to MapMonit were placed in front, above and behind the screen, and one behind a garage also on the quiet side. The control measurements were placed around the neighborhood at the quiet side of the <b>noise</b> <b>screen.</b> Due to a flaw with the MapMonit software implementation, the results were presented with flat topography. The reference microphone in front of and above the <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> gave satisfying results, with differences less than 2 dB at all control positions except for a position just behind a garage. Obstacles along the propagation path included both a <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> and buildings. Choosing the microphone mounted just above the <b>noise</b> <b>screen,</b> the difference between the A-weighted levels of CadnaA and MapMonit was less than 1 dB for all positions except the one behind the garage...|$|R

At the very least, the ship data should be screened to eliminate observations deviating unreasonably from climatology. In fact, a two pass screening is better, with the second pass screening out data deviating unreasonably from the first pass mapping attempt. Even with <b>screening,</b> the <b>noise</b> level is comparable with that of the satellite data and, particularly in spot comparisons, should not be used to evaluate the accuracy of the satellite data.

40|$|Sound {{propagation}} over {{a traditional}} <b>noise</b> <b>screen</b> in downwind conditions is numerically investigated and {{compared with a}} graded index sonic crystal (GRIN SC) noise barrier. The latter type of noise barrier creates a shadow zone by upward refraction of waves propagating through. Upward refraction is here achieved by varying the cylinder radius with height hence creating a graded index medium which effective sound speed varies accordingly. Contrary to GRIN SC noise barriers, traditional <b>noise</b> <b>screens</b> aim at improving the sound environment by screening sound emanating from, e. g. traffic noise sources. It {{has been shown that}} in downwind propagating conditions traditional solid screens introduce large wind speed gradients above the barrier top, which may give rise to downward refraction of acoustic waves into the shadow zone. In two-dimensional space, wind speed profiles of a traditional screen and an acoustically equivalent GRIN SC noise barrier are numerically computed using computational fluid dynamics. The modeled background flow, treated as an effective sound speed, is then used as input parameter for acoustic propagation calculations. The acoustic performance of both structures including a non-uniform background flow has been evaluated for a simple outdoor setup assuming a hard reflecting ground surface and a single noise source...|$|R
40|$|Wavelets are a {{powerful}} tool for biomedical signal processing. Wavelets are used for the processing of signals that are non-stationary and time varying. The EMG signal contains transient signals related to muscle activity. EMG signals have typically many transient components, which are very interesting to isolate and classify according to their physiological significance. Wavelet based denoising is used to isolate coordinated muscle activity of the shoulder of a volunteer subject related to certain movements that appear during driving a car. The reconstructed de-noised signals show clearly the muscle activity. Because of the wavelet denoising, accurate observation of activity that is not possible with conventional filtering, becomes possible. That means small activity peaks covered by the <b>screen</b> of <b>noise</b> are now observable. Wavelet coefficients can be used as features for identifying fatigue or estimating type of movement.
