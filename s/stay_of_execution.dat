5|$|On April 24, 2017, Arkansas {{carried out}} a double-execution of Jack Jones, 52, and Marcel Williams, 46. The state of Arkansas {{attempted}} to execute eight people before its supply of midazolam expired on April 30, 2017. Two of them were granted a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution,</b> and another, Ledell T. Lee, 51, was executed on April 20, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a {{referendum}} to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
50|$|For {{fourteen}} years, Bickham avoided <b>execution,</b> winning seven <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> He {{lived on}} death row in the Angola State Penitentiary, in solitary confinement 23 hours per day.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 Sparks issued <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> for Joseph Stanley Faulder and Danny Lee Barber, {{holding that}} the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles {{failed to provide}} due process in {{considering}} their requests for clemency.|$|R
50|$|Pruett is {{represented}} by the Texas Innocence Network and has already received 4 <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> to allow for further DNA testing. In 2014, his postconviction writ of habeas corpus was denied, but Judges Alcala and Johnson filed a dissenting statement.|$|R
5|$|Testimony in {{the trial}} {{concluded}} on May 15, 1826; summations concluded four days later. Despite the lack of physical evidence, the jury deliberated only an hour before convicting Beauchamp of Sharp's murder. He {{was sentenced to death}} by hanging on June 26 of that year. Beauchamp requested a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> to write a justification for his actions. The stay was granted, and the execution was rescheduled for July 7, 1826. Though Anna Beauchamp was questioned, a charge against her for being an accessory to the crime was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The Beauchamps {{were accused}} of trying to bribe a guard to let them escape, but this effort failed. They also tried to get a letter to Senator Beauchamp, asking for his help in escaping. A final plea to Governor Desha for another <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> was denied on July 5. Later that day, the couple {{attempted}} a double suicide by taking large doses of laudanum, but both survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{automatically}} {{appealed to the}} Utah Supreme Court, which upheld Taylor's conviction and sentence in October 1991. Taylor's execution was initially scheduled for January 15, 1992. The date was rescheduled to June 24 when Taylor's attorney Martin Gravis requested {{to withdraw from the}} case. On June 17, Judge Roth granted a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> after Taylor's new defense attorney Ron Yengich requested more time to prepare an appeal. At issue was a new 1992 law in Utah that established the sentence of life imprisonment without parole.|$|E
50|$|After the verdict, Johnson was {{on death}} row in Huntsville prison located in Huntsville, Texas, for almost 10 years. He {{received}} several <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> and lodged numerous appeals. One of these appeals was a confession supposedly signed by Vest after the two were arrested.|$|R
50|$|In September and October 2015, Glossip {{was granted}} three {{successive}} <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> due {{to questions about}} Oklahoma's lethal injection drugs after Oklahoma Corrections Department officials used potassium acetate to execute Charles Frederick Warner on January 15, 2015, contrary to protocol. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt ordered a multicounty grand jury investigation <b>of</b> the <b>execution</b> drug mix-up.|$|R
50|$|McGee {{spent eight}} years in Mississippi jails prior to his execution, during which time the {{assistance}} of the Civil Rights Congress gained him two new trials and several <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> Supreme Court Justice Harold Burton ordered a stay in July 1950; however the full U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear McGee's final appeal.|$|R
5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row {{who claimed to have}} been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E
5|$|According to polls, {{support for}} capital {{punishment}} had been steadily declining since the 1990s, {{but the majority}} of people in Utah still supported the death penalty in the period leading up to Gardner's scheduled execution. In 2010, Kay McIff of the Utah House of Representatives sponsored legislation to require condemned inmates to raise all appeal arguments in their first post-conviction petition, noting that Gardner's multiple appeals kept his case lingering on death row for nearly 25years. The bill, HB202, passed the Utah House by a margin of 67-to-5 on February 1, 2011, and unanimously passed the Utah State Senate on February 17. The legislation was signed into law by the Governor on 22 March 2011. The law denies any <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> after a first appeal, without a judicial review of new evidence (or a pregnant appellant), that a judge determines would have materially affected the original case.|$|E
5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.|$|E
50|$|Willie McGee (died May 8, 1951) was {{a married}} African American man from Laurel, Mississippi, who {{was sentenced to}} death in 1945 for the rape of Willette Hawkins, a white {{housewife}} in town.McGee's legal case became a cause célèbre. The Civil Rights Congress handled McGee's defense and appeals; he had two new trials and <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Judge Hawkins set the executions for July 10, 1931, the {{earliest}} date Alabama law allowed. While appeals were filed, the Alabama Supreme Court issued indefinite <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>executions</b> 72 {{hours before the}} defendants were scheduled to die. The men's cells were next to the execution chamber, and they heard the July 10, 1931 <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> William Hokes, a black man from St. Clair County convicted of murder. They later recalled that he [...] "died hard." ...|$|R
50|$|The Challenger, Barracuda, and Javelin were {{cancelled}} {{after the}} 1974 model year, and the Camaro and Firebird {{were to be}} discontinued at the same time, although they received last-minute <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> The Cougar, originally billed as an upscale version of the Mustang, remained available as a luxury vehicle despite its upsizing to the platform shared with the Ford Torino, later becoming a corporate twin to the Ford Thunderbird after 1976.|$|R
5|$|He {{was tried}} and convicted of Sharp's murder on May 19, 1826. His sentence– {{execution}} by hanging– {{was to be}} carried out on June 16, 1826. Beauchamp requested a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> so that he could write a justification of his actions; he continued to assert his avenging his wife's honor. The request was granted, allowing Beauchamp to complete his book, The Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp: who was hanged at Frankfort, Ky., on the 7th day of July, 1826, for the murder of Col. Solomon P. Sharp. After two failed suicide attempts with his wife, who {{died as a result of}} the second incident, Beauchamp was hanged for his crime on July 7, 1826. Beauchamp's Confession was published in 1826. Some editions included The Letters of Ann Cook as an appendix. Historians dispute whether Cooke was their author.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, {{and he was}} apprehended at {{his home}} in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking laudanum shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of {{the hair on the}} lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that the}} various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E
50|$|His latest {{execution}} date {{was scheduled for}} January 3, 2008, but was stayed on December 26, 2007 by US District Judge Todd J. Campbell, pending investigation into the constitutionality of Tennessee's lethal injection methods. The <b>stay</b> was part <b>of</b> a larger investigation, and {{not directly related to}} Reid's case. On April 16, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in a Kentucky case upholding the legality <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> by lethal injection. The state of Tennessee immediately began appealing <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> to resume death penalty cases, including Reid's.|$|R
2500|$|Martineau and Nelson {{received}} 13 <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> They were {{spared the}} death penalty in 1972 when the United States Supreme Court ruled in Furman v.

5000|$|Dolan {{was tried}} and {{found guilty of}} murder in the first degree. Represented by {{attorney}} William F. Howe, Dolan went to lengthy efforts to save himself and won several <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> However, he eventually lost his desperate legal battle. When sentenced to death for the second time, Dolan rose, told the judge, [...] "I never lifted my hand against any man ... I never shed human blood," [...] and burst into tears.|$|R
25|$|The same day, Hill {{petitioned the}} U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari and {{requested}} a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> Justice Kennedy granted a temporary stay, which was followed {{up the next}} day by a granting of certiorari from the entire Court and a full <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b>|$|E

50|$|Jailhouse {{lawyer is}} a colloquial term in North American English {{to refer to}} an inmate in a jail or other prison who, though usually never having practiced law nor having any formal legal training, informally assists other inmates in legal matters {{relating}} to their sentence (e.g. appeal of their sentence, pardons, <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution,</b> etc.) or to their conditions in prison. Sometimes, he or she also assists other inmates in civil matters of a legal nature.|$|R
50|$|Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., {{transportation}} becomes {{important as}} characters travel on planes, trains, and automobiles. At 6 p.m., characters eat dinner and have shootouts. In the evening, they attend parties. Around 8 p.m., orchestras and theaters begin their shows. As midnight approaches, the characters become more frantic, throwing tantrums and requesting <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> Screeching violins from multiple clips {{build up to}} the moment. At midnight Orson Welles is impaled on a clock tower in The Stranger, and Big Ben, a common sight in The Clock, explodes in V for Vendetta.|$|R

25|$|Barefoot {{appealed to}} the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals which {{rejected}} his argument that this use of psychiatric testimony during the sentencing phase of his trial was unconstitutional and upheld the conviction and sentence. After denials of a writ of certiorari and of habeas corpus, petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in Federal District Court raising the same objections {{to the use of}} psychiatric testimony. Although the District Court rejected his claims and denied the writ, it did issue a certificate of probable cause. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied a second writ of habeas corpus and denied a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> The Court of Appeals also denied a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In April 21, 1992 {{the state}} carried out his first {{execution}} since 1967 by putting to death Robert Alton Harris {{for the murders}} of two teenage boys in San Diego. A series <b>of</b> four <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> issued by the 9th circuit appeal court delayed the execution, causing the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene to vacate the stays and prohibit all other federal courts from any further intervention, ruling that the lower court decisions caused [...] "abusive delays" [...] and were [...] "attempts to manipulate the judicial process".|$|R
50|$|After his conviction, McGee was {{defended by}} the Civil Rights Congress, which mounted a public {{campaign}} {{as well as}} filing legal appeals of his case. Bella Abzug, then a young attorney, represented his appeals in Mississippi and the Supreme Court {{in one of the}} first civil rights cases of her legal career. The CRC won two new trials and numerous <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution.</b> McGee was convicted again each time and sentenced to death. At the third trial, he said that he and Hawkins had been having an affair and that the sex was consensual. This made no difference to the outcome.|$|R
50|$|Under current practice, the Circuit Justice {{for each}} circuit is {{responsible}} for dealing with certain types of applications that, under the Court's rules, may be addressed by a single Justice. These include emergency applications for stays (including requests for <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>execution</b> in death-penalty cases) and injunctions pursuant to the All Writs Act arising from cases within that circuit, {{as well as more}} routine matters such as requests for extensions of time. In the past, Circuit Justices also sometimes ruled on motions for bail in criminal cases, writs of habeas corpus, and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal.|$|R
