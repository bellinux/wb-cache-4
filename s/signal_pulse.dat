50|$|The {{earliest}} form of sequential (although not proportional) actuator {{for radio}} control was the escapement. Like the device used in clocks, this escapement controls {{the release of}} stored energy from a spring or rubber band. Each signal from the transmitter operates a small solenoid that then allows a two- or four-lobed pawl to rotate. The pawl, like a clock, has two pallets so that the pawl can only rotate by one lobe's position, per <b>signal</b> <b>pulse.</b> This mechanism allows a simple keyed transmitter to give sequential control, i.e. selection between a number of defined positions at the model.|$|E
5000|$|Because a {{secondary}} could not instantaneously transmit its <b>signal</b> <b>pulse</b> on receipt {{of the master}} signal, a fixed delay was built into the signal. No matter what delay is selected, {{there will be some}} locations where the signal from two secondary would be received at the same time, and thus make them difficult to see on the display. Some method of identifying one secondary from another was needed. Common methods included transmitting from the secondary only at certain times, using different frequencies, adjusting the envelope of the burst of signal, or broadcasting several bursts in a particular pattern. A set of stations, master and secondaries, was known as a [...] "chain". Similar methods are used to identify chains in the case where more than one chain may be received in a given location.|$|E

50|$|As {{the names}} imply, {{both of the}} NRL systems relied on the {{comparison}} of returned signals stored on magnetic drums. In an attempt to remove clutter from radar displays, many late-war and post-war radar systems added an acoustic delay line that stored the received signal for exactly {{the amount of time}} needed for the next <b>signal</b> <b>pulse</b> to arrive. By adding the newly arrived signal to an inverted version of the signals stored in the delay line, the output signal included just the changes from one pulse to the next. This removed any static reflections, like nearby hills or other objects, leaving only the moving objects, such as aircraft. This basic concept would work for a long-range radar as well, but had the problem that a delay line has to be mechanically sized to the pulse repetition frequency of the radar, or PRF. For long-range use, the PRF was very long to start, and deliberately changed in order to make different ranges come into view. For this role, the delay line was not usable, and the magnetic drum, recently introduced, provided a convenient and easily controlled variable-delay system.|$|E
5000|$|The coherer is a {{primitive}} form of radio signal detector {{used in the}} first radio receivers during the wireless telegraphy era {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. Its use in radio was based on the 1890 findings of French physicist Edouard Branly and adapted by other physicists and inventors over the next ten years. The device consists of a tube or capsule containing two electrodes spaced a small distance apart with loose metal filings in the space between. When a radio frequency signal is applied to the device, the metal particles would cling together or [...] "cohere", reducing the initial high resistance of the device, thereby allowing a much greater direct current to flow through it. In a receiver, the current would activate a bell, or a Morse paper tape recorder to make a record of the received signal. The metal filings in the coherer remained conductive after the <b>signal</b> (<b>pulse)</b> ended so that the coherer had to be [...] "decohered" [...] by tapping it with a clapper, such as a doorbell ringer, each time a signal was received, thereby restoring the coherer to its original state. Coherers remained in widespread use until about 1907, when they were replaced by more sensitive electrolytic and crystal detectors.|$|E
5000|$|Writing logic [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0" [...] {{is done by}} {{charging}} and discharging the floating gate in an FJG cell. It is done through current flowing through the pn diode under different voltage stress conditions at different contact nodes. When charging the floating gate, the pn diode is reverse biased, causing large band bending at the floating gate/channel junction. Band-to-Band tunneling will occur under such condition causing electrons tunnel from the floating gate to the channel(Fig.3(a)). Discharging the floating gate is realized by forward biasing the pn diode and draining the charges out of the floating gate(Fig.3(b)). Both processes can be done within a few nano seconds, which enables ultra high speed operation.Fig. 4 illustrates the transient characterization of the read and write operations of an FJG device, wherein the write logic [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0" [...] operations take 5 ns including 1ns rising/falling edge of the <b>signal</b> <b>pulse.</b> It {{can be seen that}} the read logic [...] "1" [...] current is as high as 20Î¼A after the write logic [...] "1" [...] operation while the read logic [...] "0" [...] current is less than 1Î¼A after the write [...] "0" [...] operation.
