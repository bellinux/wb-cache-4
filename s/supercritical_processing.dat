40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} a single-step, organic solvent-free supercritical fluid process for the preparation of olanzapine-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes with an express goal to enhance the dissolution properties of olanzapine. The complexes were prepared by <b>supercritical</b> carbon dioxide <b>processing,</b> co-evaporation, freeze drying and physical mixing. The prepared complexes were then analysed by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, solubility and dissolution studies. Computational molecular docking studies were performed to study the formation of molecular inclusion complexation of olanzapine with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. All the binary mixtures of olanzapine with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, except physical mixture, exhibited a faster and greater extent of drug dissolution than the drug alone.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate different manufacturing processes claimed to promote inclusion complexation between indomethacin and cyclodextrins in order to enhance the apparent solubility and dissolution properties of indomethacin. Especially, the effectiveness of <b>supercritical</b> carbon dioxide <b>processing</b> for preparing solid drug–cyclodextrin inclusion complexes was investigated and compared to other preparation methods. The complexes were prepared by physical mixing, co-evaporation, freeze drying from aqueous solution, spray drying and <b>supercritical</b> carbon dioxide <b>processing</b> methods. The prepared complexes were then evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, solubility and dissolution studies. The method of preparation of the inclusion complexes was shown to influence the physicochemical properties of the formed complexes. Indomethacin exists in a highly crystalline solid form. Physical mixing of indomethacin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin appeared not to reduce the degree of crystallinity of the drug. The co-evaporated and freeze dried complexes had a lower degree of crystallinity than the physical mix; however the lowest degree of crystallinity was achieved in complexes prepared by spray drying and <b>supercritical</b> carbon dioxide <b>processing</b> methods. All systems based on methyl-β-cyclodextrin exhibited better dissolution properties than the drug alone.

A second SC-extraction step, performed at 200 bar 40 Â°C, demonstrated that many undesired compounds were co-extracted at these process conditions. The comparison with liquid extraction, using petroleum ether, showed that using SC-CO 2 and an exhaustive processing, 30 % more pyrethrins were extracted. Using the fractional separation, the produced extracts contained about 99 % w/w pyrethrins if the process was stopped after about 80 min. Another suggested duration of the extraction process can be set at about 250 min, at which about 63 % w/w pyrethrins were contained in the extracted material.

40|$|Supercritical fluid {{technology}} has been utilized {{in the development of}} tissue engineering scaffolds. However, it results in some problems, such as the poorly interconnected pores and the inability to load growth factor due to the salt leaching process for removal of the solid porogen. In this study, ammonium bicarbonate (AB) particles were used as a porogen and mixed uniformly with poly-l-lactide (PLLA) solution. Supercritical CO 2 was used to immerse and flush through the resulting compound to allow the occurrence of phase inversion, subsequently generating a nanofibrous network. As the decomposition temperature of AB crystals is 36 °C, the temperature of the CO 2 was increased to 40 °C to decompose the porogen, and the decomposition products were removed by washing with CO 2. The resulting PLLA scaffolds possessed both large pores and micro pores with a controllable pore size, a high porosity (> 95 %), an interconnected structure, a nanofibrous network, good mechanical properties (compressive strength up to 100 kPa), and a very low organic solvent residue (12 ppm).

Nitrogen physisorption, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) combined with Rietveld/whole powder pattern modeling (WPPM) and organic elemental analysis (OEA) were used as tools for characterization of the porous structure morphology, structural and microstructural properties, and purity of the prepared composites. All prepared Ce x Ti 1 −x O n composites possessed well-developed mesoporous structure with minimum portion of micropores, showing specific surface area in the range of 203 – 256 m 2 /g. The experimental conditions during pressurized hot and <b>supercritical</b> <b>processing</b> as well as the Ce loading {{played a key role in}} crystallization of individual Ce x Ti 1 −x O n composites. With increasing Ce loading, crystallization of anatase at the expense of brookite was promoted, accompanied with decreasing microstrain in anatase crystallites. The elevated processing temperature (250 °C) led to crystallization of CeO 2 cubic beside TiO 2 anatase. As a consequence of the different solubility of the used surfactant in pressurized hot and supercritical solvents under pressures of 10 and 30 MPa, cubic CeO 2 crystallites of different sizes were formed. This property of CeO 2 crystallites crucially affected the recrystallization of Ce 0. 30 Ti 0. 70 O n -S composites at elevated temperatures; small and uniform CeO 2 crystallites stabilized the anatase–cerianite phase mixture, giving rise to minor brookite phase.

The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain the feasibility of <b>supercritical</b> <b>processing</b> to prepare different particulate forms of fluticasone propionate (FP), and to evaluate the influence of different liquid solvents and precipitation temperatures on the morphology, size and crystal habit of particles. Method: The solution of FP in organic solvents, was precipitated by supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO 2) at two pressure and temperature levels. Effects of process parameters on the physicochemical characteristics of harvested microparticles were evaluated. Results: Particle formation was observed only at the lower selected pressure, whilst at the higher pressure, no precipitation of particles was occurred due to dissolution of FP in supercritical antisolvent. The micrographs of the produced particles showed different morphologies for FP obtained from different conditions. The results of thermal analysis of the resulted particles showed that changes in the processing conditions didn't influence thermal behavior of the precipitated particles. Evaluation of the effect of temperature on the size distribution of particles showed that increase in the temperature from 40 oC to 50 oC, resulted in reduction of the mean particle size from about 30 &micro;m to about 12 &mu;m. &zwj;Conclusion: From the results of this study it may be concluded that, processing of FP by supercritical antisolvent could be an approach for production of diverse forms of the drug and drastic changes in the physical characteristics of microparticles could be achieved by changing the type of solvent and temperature of operation...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a novel drug {{delivery}} system for biologics i. e. proteins and peptides using a solid core drug delivery system (SCDDS). Both, 0. 5 μm and 1. 0 μm silica particles were used as a model core material and were coated with different ratios of fatty acid. A proportional increase in particle size was observed with increasing ratio of fatty acid in the formulation. Coating of silica particles with smaller chain fatty acids (lauric and myristic acid) resulted in a higher increase in particle size compared to the longer chain fatty acids i. e. palmitic acid and stearic acid. Bovine serum albumin was used as a model drug. SCDDS preparation included absorption of BSA on silica (BSA-Si) followed by coating of the BSA-Si particles with fatty acid via <b>supercritical</b> <b>processing.</b> In order to determine the best system to achieve maximum absorption of BSA, isotherms were obtained in different media i. e. water, 0. 15 M NaCI solution and a citrate-phosphate buffer at pH 4. 0, 4. 7, 5. 0, and 7. 0. Results showed an increase in the amount of BSA absorbed was observed with the increasing specific surface area of silica particles. Isotherms demonstrated that maximum absorption of BSA can be achieved at or close to the iso-electric point (IEP) of the protein. A SCDDS was prepared by absorbing BSA on silica at pH 5. 0 in citrate/phosphate buffer and coating these particles with fatty acid in the ratio (fatty acid:silica) of 0. 1 : 1, 0. 25 : 1 and 0. 5 : 1. Release studies were conducted in phosphate buffer saline at pH 7. 4. The release of BSA was fastest and highest from SCDDs prepared using 0. 5 μm silica with a specific surface area of 4. 4 m 2 /g. SCDDS prepared using 1. 0 μm silica with a specific surface area of 2. 2 m 2 /g provided slowest BSA release. BSA release from the SCDDS was also dependent on the chain length of fatty acid used and its ratio in the formulation.

40|$|The {{combination}} of reaction calorimetry and supercritical fluids as reactants and/or solvent holds {{great potential for}} the optimization of chemical processes using high pressure near-critical and/or supercritical mixtures. The very specific properties of supercritical fluids and fluid mixtures have been under investigation already from {{the nineteenth century and}} some are quite well understood. But there is still a lack of knowledge in macroscopic properties and raw data for pure fluids and fluid mixtures. This cumulates with the difficulty to apply simple equations of state for the prediction of phase behavior and the calculation of the thermodynamic and the derived transport properties. As a whole, the relatively poor engineering information about supercritical fluids {{is one of the major}} reasons that explains the slow industrial development of <b>supercritical</b> <b>processing.</b> The work presented here concerns the complete development of the new "supercritical reaction calorimetry field", which is in fact the application of reaction calorimetry to supercritical fluids media. As far as we know we are pioneers in this domain as only relatively small scale calorimeters have been successfully used with SCFs and only scarcely. The fact is that the use of reaction calorimetry provides essential information for scale-up purposes. Moreover it allows additional in-line equipment to be used, in order to get complementary information. This renders the reaction calorimeter much lesser specialized and potentially attractive as a tool for industrial application developments. In order to correctly position this project in the scale of laboratory and industrial researches, the first chapter is dedicated to the review of SCFs and SCF mixtures properties, their potential as volatile organic solvent relievers and their actual industrial applications. As a result there is still a great need in engineering data for pure SCFs and their mixtures, although their unique properties make them suitable for several processes, mostly driven by environmental considerations. Classical reaction calorimetry is also shortly discussed with the determination of the technical challenge that arose from the use of a supercritical fluid, as it basically occupies all the available space. Thus we point out that both cover and flange should be separately controlled and adjusted to the inner temperature in order to avoid side heat transfer from the reaction media to those elements. Moreover, the regulation parameters for the jacket and the additional cover and flange should be optimized. This has proved to be difficult as these parameters have been shown to depend strongly on the supercritical carbon dioxide pairs, density and temperature. Nevertheless satisfactory pairs of P, I parameters for all three parts of the reactor have been found using the Ziegler-Nichols approach for the jacket and a pure trial-and-error approach for the two others. The heat transfer with SCFs should be carefully taken into account in order to proceed with correct chemical reactions' evaluation. Heat transfer in scCO 2 and CO 2 -methanol mixtures can be described in stirred tank reactors using the well known Wilson plot methods. The behavior of the internal film heat transfer coefficient with the temperature is drastically different from the one observed for classical liquid systems. In contrast to classic liquids, in supercritical CO 2, the lower the temperature (above the critical point) the higher the internal film heat transfer coefficient. It shows a clear divergence when approaching the critical point. This tendency could be explained by the evolution of the thermodynamical and transport properties of scCO 2 around the critical point. This confirms some observations in the literature with some continuous flow heat transfer apparatuses working with SCFs. The heat transfer coefficients for the cover and the flange have been evaluated and show the same general tendency as the one of the jacket in regard to the temperature. The hydrodynamics of scCO 2 in a stirred tank reactor have been investigated using Laser Doppler Anemometry measurements and indicating that the stirred scCO 2 has a similar behavior with liquid water. However, the turbulent kinetic energy and the mean velocities are 20 % lower for scCO 2, which can be explained by its lower density. Information about the phase behavior during a reaction is essential in order to proceed homogeneously. Under this condition, the system allows for higher reaction rates and for easier process control. This has motivated the complementary development of a video imaging surveillance system for the inside of the reactor, as well as the development of a high pressure variable-volume view cell for the screening of mixtures' phase behavior. As the "top-view" observation is not ideal for phase change observation (no meniscus visualisation), the further development of an in-situ high pressure ultrasonic probe is also provided in this work. Sound speed measurements have been proven to be not only useful as a "phase-change" detector, but also allowed determining the critical point of pure fluids and mixtures. This work also pointed out the real difficulty to combine a homogeneous supercritical reaction media to a sufficiently high heat produced signal. To access the limit of detection of the calorimetric system and to find out the characteristic time constant of the reactor and its variation with temperature and density, we created an amplifier system based on a Labview® interface program. Using some defined functions for the calibration heater released heat, it has been possible to simulate some typical reaction curves and thus validate the heat flow measurements with the supercritical reaction calorimeter...|$|E

40|$|This {{intermediate}} report describes the {{progress in the}} Green cellulose project. The literature studies are in progress and a start has been made with the market study. Furthermore, two experimental trails have been performed. The literature report contains general information on cellulose derivatives, <b>supercritical</b> carbon dioxide <b>processing</b> using <b>supercritical</b> carbon dioxide. The market overview gives insight in market volume, the most important products and producers of cellulose derivatives. So far, the experiments have not been successful since no change in crystallinity was observed and severe cellulose degradation occurred. However, this could indicate that using supercritical carbon dioxide {{might be used to}} modify solely the amorphous regions. In future experiments reaction times will be lowered and co-solvents will be added...|$|R
40|$|A common {{phenomenon}} in tissue engineering is rapid tissue formation {{on the outer}} edge of the scaffold which restricts cell penetration and nutrient exchange to the scaffold centre, resulting in a necrotic core. To address this problem, we generated scaffolds with both random and anisotropic open porous architectures to enhance cell and subsequent tissue infiltration throughout the scaffold for applications in bone and cartilage engineering. Hydroxyapatite (HA) and poly(D,L-lactic acid) (P(DL) LA) scaffolds with random open porosity were manufactured, using modified slip-casting and by <b>supercritical</b> fluid <b>processing</b> respectively, and subsequently characterised. An array of porous aligned channels (400 microm) was incorporated into both scaffold types and cell (human osteoblast sarcoma, for HA scaffolds; ovine meniscal fibrochondrocytes, for P(DL) LA scaffolds) and tissue infiltration into these modified scaffolds was assessed in vitro (cell penetration) and in vivo (tissue infiltration; HA scaffolds only). Scaffolds were shown to have an extensive random, open porous structure with an average porosity of 85 %. Enhanced cell and tissue penetration was observed both in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that scaffold design alone can influence cell and tissue infiltration into the centre of tissue engineering scaffold...|$|R
30|$|The {{high-pressure}} gas-foaming technique {{employs a}} gas as a porogen to create interconnected pores. It {{was developed to}} eliminate the use of organic solvents, the residual of which might result in an inflammatory response after implantation. This fabrication process can be conducted at mild conditions. CO 2, a non-toxic and non-flammable gas, has been widely used in <b>supercritical</b> fluid <b>processing.</b> First, a polymer is placed in a chamber and then saturated with high-pressure CO 2. As the pressure is rapidly dropped, the nucleation and formation of pores occur {{as a result of}} the thermodynamic instability in the gas/polymer system (Mooney et al. 1996). The fabrication parameters such as temperature, pressure, degree of saturate and depressurisation time have a great influence on the pore morphology and pore size of the scaffolds. The gas-foaming technique typically produces a sponge-like structure with the average pore size in the range of 30 – 700  μm and a porosity up to 85  % (Chen 2011). The drawbacks of this process include the use of the excessive heat during compression moulding; closed, non-interconnected pore structures, and a non-porous skin layer at the surface of the final product.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{formulate}} a solid core drug delivery system for oral delivery of proteins using silica as core material, haemoglobin as model drug and <b>supercritical</b> fluid <b>processing</b> as encapsulation technique. Silica particles of different morphology were used as a carrier material for protein immobilisation and fatty acids coating was performed using supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2) as a processing media. The melting behaviour of saturated fatty acids (lauric, myristic, palmitic and stearic acid) and pluronics (F- 38, F- 68, F- 77, F- 127 and F- 108) were studied under pressurised CO 2 to identify the coating parameters. These excipients showed a melting point depression {{in the range of}} 10 to 20 °C in pressurised CO 2. In the case of fatty acids the decrease in melting point was inversely proportional to the carbon chain length and directly related to the polarity of carbonyl group. Whereas, melting point depression for all pluronics was similar and was attributed to the high cohesive energy density of these polymers. This phenomenon was used to encapsulate the thermolabile protein molecules in pressurised CO 2 at low temperatures. The stability of bovine haemoglobin (bHb) was studied by ultraviolet-visible and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Thermal, storage and agitation stability were studied to identify the processing parameters for the storage, adsorption and desorption processes. Three morphologically different silica particles were studied as potential inorganic carrier for the protein. The particles were characterised by nitrogen adsorption and scanning electron microscopy and the maximum protein adsorption and kinetics was determined at pH 6. The bHb adsorption on silica was found to be irreversible, hence application of pluronics as a displacer was also studied. Finally, the bHb adsorbed particles were coated with fatty acids by <b>supercritical</b> fluid <b>processing</b> and solvent evaporation methods. The highest bHb release was obtained from SFP (Syloid FP- 244) silica in comparison to other silica particles in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer. SFP based formulation also showed a trend in the protein release which was dependent on the solubility of fatty acids in the release media. The highest release was obtained from myristic acid coated solid core drug delivery system (SCDDS) followed by palmitic and stearic acid. Lauric acid coated SFP formulations led to changes in protein conformations, hence omitted from these studies. The release studies of myristic acid based SCDDS in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids showed that fatty acid coating provided enteric properties to the formulation. It can be concluded from these studies that SCDDS prepared using mesoporous silica as core and fatty acids as coating material can be an effective drug delivery system for the oral delivery of biomolecules...|$|R
40|$|Multicompartment {{particles}}, {{which are}} particles composed of smaller building units, have gained considerable interest {{during the past}} decade to facilitate simultaneous and differential delivery of several biomolecules in various applications. Supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2) processing is an industrial technology widely used for large-scale synthesis and processing of materials. However, the application of this technology for production of multicompartment particles from colloidal particles has not yet been explored. Here, we report the formation of raspberry-like gelatin (RLG) microparticles composed of gelatin nanoparticles as colloidal building blocks through <b>supercritical</b> CO 2 <b>processing.</b> We show that these RLG microparticles exhibit a high stability upon dispersion in aqueous media without requiring chemical cross-linking. We further demonstrate that these microparticles are cytocompatible and facilitate differential release of two different model compounds. The strategy presented here can be utilized as a cost-effective route for production of various types of multicompartment particles using colloidal particles with suitable interparticle interactions. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Multicompartment particles have gained considerable interest {{during the past decade}} to facilitate simultaneous and differential delivery of multiple biomolecules in various biomedical applications. Nevertheless, common methods employed for the production of such particles are often complex and only offer small-scale production.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An Al(porphyrin) {{functionalized}} {{with a large}} axial ligand {{was incorporated}} into a porous organic polymer (POP) using a cobalt-catalyzed acetylene trimerization strategy. Removal of the axial ligand afforded a microporous POP that is catalytically active in the methanolysis of a nerve agent simulant. <b>Supercritical</b> CO 2 <b>processing</b> of the POP dramatically increased the pore size and volume, allowing for significantly higher catalytic activities. Over the past decade, much efforts have been made toheterogenize homogeneous catalysts by integrating them into microporous materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), 1 − 5 covalent organic frameworks (COFs), 6, 7 polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), 8, 9 conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), 10, 11 and porous organic polymers (POPs). 12, 13 Beyond the obvious advantages of site iso...|$|R

These techniques (such as microwave, ultrasound, pulse electric field, instant controlled pressure drop, <b>supercritical</b> fluid <b>processing)</b> in the frontiers of food processing, food chemistry, and food microbiology, are not new and were already used for> 30 years by academia and industry. We will {{pay special attention to}} the strategies and the tools available to make preservation, transformation and extraction greener and present them as success stories for research, education and at industrial scale. The design of green and sustainable processes is currently a hot research topic in food industry. Herein we aimed to describe a multifaceted strategy (innovative technologies, process intensification, bio-refinery concept) to apply this concept at research, educational, and industrial level. Industrial relevance: Green Food Processing could be a new concept {{to meet the challenges of}} the 21 st century, to protect both the environment and consumers, and in the meantime enhance competition of industries to be more ecologic, economic and innovative. This green approach should be the result of a whole chain of values in both senses of the term: economic and responsible, starting from the production and harvesting of food raw materials, processes of preservation, transformation, and extraction together with formulation and marketing...|$|R
40|$|Presented on September 9, 2009, from 4 - 5 pm in room G 011 of the Molecular Science and Engineering Building on the Georgia Tech Campus. Runtime: 34 : 24 minutesProton {{exchange}} membranes (PEMs), {{commonly used}} in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), are typically limited by either high methanol permeability (also known as the cross-over limitation) or low proton conductivity. A potential alternative to this problem is to use thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) with rubbery and glassy thermodynamically immiscible microphases. The glassy segment is often composed of polystyrene, which can be sulfonated to high ion exchange capacities (IEC), and thus creates ion containing polymers or ionomers. Linear poly-styreneisobutylene- styrene (SIBS) and both, linear and branched poly-styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), were sulfonated and functionalized with different cations (size and electronegativity). Controlling the degree of sulfonation and the functionalization allowed for selective membranes {{that could be used}} for applications such as fuel cells, gas sensors, and permselective separations. In addition, <b>supercritical</b> fluid <b>processing</b> allowed for additional morphological changes, especially with perfluorinated membranes. This presentation will review some of the critical materials characterization results including elemental analysis (EA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The kinetic and transport properties will also be discussed for the development of separation processes and catalytic nanochannel reactor arrays for fuel cell applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSupercritical {{extraction}} processes {{have been}} widely commercialized since 1970 of the XX century {{and now they are}} technologically advanced. Supercritical extraction is used in a number of industrial branches. Significant achievements are observed in the field of plant raw materials processing. Scientific investigations have proved that plenty of raw materials can be processed with CO 2 supercritical extraction. The most popular extraction applications include extraction of hop (e. g. bitter acids and xanthohumol), coffee, tea, and many others. Hop extraction became standard practice of processing of hop cones into extract and almost entirely dominated hop processing market. It is commonly and mistakenly believed that cost of plant processing with the use of CO 2 is very high. However, implications based on literature data published and authors’ experience prove that the cost of <b>supercritical</b> extraction <b>processing</b> is comparable to the cost of liquid extraction, and sometimes being even lower. The analysis of this technology allows for further reductions of extract production cost. Cost components and the specification of cost reductions by modification of process parameters were presented in this paper. Main business advantages can be obtained by accurate control of the amount of solvent stream in the plant system, which has an effect on energy consumption in all the important process loops. Therefore, a significant reduction of energy consumption per product manufactured in the particular production cycle is expected...|$|R
