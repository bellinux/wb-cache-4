Therefore, tension tests parallel and perpendicular to the grain were carried out. The results were evaluated using the variance analysis (ANOVA). As a result it can be stated that lengthwise <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers</b> exhibit significantly higher strength and better mechanical characteristics than plain <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers.</b> The checks parallel to the grain which occurred by manufacturing at that side of the veneer leaf which faces the cutting edge and which is stressed in tension are to be considered as reason therefore. In contrast to the tests parallel to the grain the modulus of elasticity perpendicular to the grain shows significantly lower values for lengthwise <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers</b> than for plain <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers.</b> Due to their higher strength values lengthwise <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers</b> are considered better base materials for engineered wood products than plain <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers...</b>|$|R

The treatment is accomplished by soaking samples through an aqueous solution of these resins, drying and curing at room temperatures. The effect of kind of acids and of varying ratio of fire retardant components in treat-ing solution on the fire proofing efficiencies of HINOKI <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> and filter paper are discussed. Results are compared with those reported in previous paper 4 l and ammonium salts as fire retardant agents for wood, paper, fabrics and other combustible materials. Aminotria-zine-aldehyde condensation products combined with strong acids such as phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid and sulfamic acid imparted excellent fire resistance to wood and filter paper. Satisfactory fire proofing properties can be obtained in both HINOKI <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> and filter paper at resin add-on as low as about 1 O~ 15 % with a few excep-tions.

Although the technological process of <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> is well known, its quality and price depend on many technological parameters of production, particularly on the quality of logs. The research, which was focused on the influence of visual defects of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) logs and the impact of climatic conditions in the drying phase of <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> on the surface veneer waviness, was conducted in an industrial environment. The results indicate that the largest share of waved veneer was cut from cracked logs (71 %) and less from curved logs (20 %). The veneer was sorted manually by experienced controllers from this branch of industry. Their subjective criteria can affect the accuracy of classification of veneer and, consequently, the research results.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The drying of wood is {{required}} in most forest products manufacturing operations. Depending on the wood species, dimensions, drying temperatures, and drying duration, the amount of emissions and energy consumption can greatly affect the operating cost, environment, and quality of wood dried. As such, the forest products industry continues to explore the use of new technologies to address these points of concern. A study was done to evaluate {{the addition of a}} radio-frequency (RF) heating system to a natural gas-fired conventional veneer dryer as a means to reduce emissions, reduce energy consumption, and improve productivity while maintaining material quality. To establish the benefits of RF-assisted drying, a study comparison was made for drying wood veneer in a RF-assisted dryer and a conventional dryer. The study was conducted at Western <b>Veneer</b> and <b>Slicing</b> in White City, Oregon. This plant was selected because both types of dryers, an RF-assisted dryer manufactured by Production Machinery, Inc. and a conventional dryer manufactured by Amitec, were located at the same site and were used for drying the same type of material. Two comparison drying tests were conducted, one using sliced ponderosa pine and the other using rotary peeled Douglas-fir. The <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> was selected because it was the type of material used by the White City plant and the rotary veneer was used because it is of the type used in the plywood industry. The parameters measured for each drying run were material flows, drying rates, emission rates, dryer operating conditions, exhaust conditions, and electrical and natural gas consumption. It was found that although the RF-assisted dryer was able to successfully dry the <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> as it was designed to do, it was not properly "tuned" to efficiently dry the rotary veneer.

40|$|The heating of logs, bolts, and {{flitches}} to be {{cut into}} high-quality rotary or <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> requires {{a knowledge of the}} temperatures appropriate for various species and conditions, and of the factors that control the attainment of these temperatures during the heating process. Good equipment and good control of the heating process are essential. Under the guidelines given in this paper, optimum temperature levels for different woods and different conditions can be determined, and time schedules can be calculated for heating in steam or water. Optimum temperatures can be determined by following suggested values given for a number of veneer species.

Three steps are involved in arriving at a heating schedule applicable to a given set of conditions. Mathematical analyses have provided graphic shortcuts to aid in taking each step. The first step is to adjust for temperature differences from those assumed in this paper, namely a 70 ° F. initial wood temperature and a 212 ° F. heating medium temperature.

This method of measurement hopes to contribute to the sustainability in value and enable approximate through-cut calculations of standing trees. This problem was exemplarily investigated by analyzing seven logs of the tree species European beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus spec.) and wild cherry (Prunus avium). To detect the outward wood defects on the scanned trees the laserscans were unwound and analyzed. Firstly the trees were identified in the laserscanner data, and for every trunk, the diameters were calculated of the log ends. These diameters were averaged and yielded the diameter of the reference cylinder, which constitutes an ideal trunk. The scan coordinates were converted into picture coordinates by means of different transformation matrices. The result of this cylindrical unwinding is a 2 D-picture for every scanned tree. These pictures were applied to another analysis software, which enabled an semiautomatic wood defect detection and classification.

Astronium graveolens Jacq., also {{commonly}} known as "Gateado" or "Gateado Galán," is a timber tree often used for making fine furniture, decorative <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer,</b> sawn, keels and long structures such as beams and trusses posts (1 - 2). The species are used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat allergies, inflammation, diarrhea and ulcers. Previous phytochemical studies report the presence of gallotannins as galloylglucose compounds, trans-ocimene (3) and flavonoids. In this work, we reported the isolation of known compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5). Studies report an interesting anti-angiogenic activity for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (6), we evaluated its ability to bind and inhibit the Human Placental Growth Factor (hPlGF), a key mediator of pathological angiogenesis. Materials and Methods. The leaves of Astronium graveolens collected (July 2010) at the Experimental Station "Caparo,― Barinas State, Venezuela were defatted with n-hexane and successively extracted for 48 h with chloroform and and methanol, to give 8. 5, 8. 0 and 8. 3 g of the respective residues. A portion of methanol extract (2. 5 g), was chromatographed on Sephadex LH- 20 using MeOH as eluent. A total of 106 fractions were collected (8 ml each) and combined by TLC results on silica 60 F 254 gel-coated glass sheets with n-BuOH–AcOH–H 2 O (60 : 15 : 25) and CHCl 3 –MeOH–H 2 O (40 : 9 : 1), to give 11 pooled fractions (A–K). The fractions more interesting were purified by RP-HPLC. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by 1 D- and 2 D-NMR Spectroscopy (1 H, 13 C, 13 C DEPT, DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, ROESY) and confirmed by mass spectrometry studies. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was used to study the interaction of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and the h-PlGF binding to its receptor (h-VEGF-R 1 or h-Flt- 1); the concentrations are: 0, 5 mg for h-Flt- 1, 10 ng for h-PlGF, 0, 5 mg for the biotinylated antibody and 200, 100, 50, 25, 12, 5, 6, 25, 3, 12 μM for the natural compound. Finally, we measured the binding affinity between 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and h-PlGF with surface plasmon resonance assays, using Biacore technology. Results and Discussion.

40|$|In {{the wood}} thick-slicing process, the {{compressive}} force {{acting on the}} pressure bar face and the compressive deflections caused in wood play important roles, but few studies {{have dealt with the}} exact measurements of the deflections, and so, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} obtain several basic information on them. The clear specimens the end grain surface to which were applied thin sensitive films printed grid patterns, were prepared. After being soused in water up to saturated condition, they were set on the experimental apparatus equipped with two 2 -axis dynamometers (Fig. 1). Then, these test specimens were compressed or rolled out by two types of pressure bars in both stationary and feeding state of the feeding carriage. The distributions of the deflections in the specimens were determined from the moiré fringe pattern or the distortion pattern of grid line. Furthermore, in order to determine the effects of pressure bar compression and restraint in the thick-slicing process, cutting tests were carried out on the experimental apparatus, using a roller bar and a single faced nosebar (sharp bar), and the cutting force components acting on the tool face and the compressive force components acting on the pressure bar face were measured with the two 2 -axis dynanometers. The main results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) The vertical component of the compressive force acting on the bar face (Pv) varies largely with the combinations of horizontal distance (h) and vertical distance (v), whereas the horizontal component of the bar force (PH) varies slightly with h and v (Figs. 11 and 12). (2) In slicing with a roller bar, Pv increases largely with decrease in h. Therefore, the tool edge deflection due to overcompression of bar occurs in the smaller range of h (Fig. 10). (3) The distribution pattern of the deflection in the workpiece varies with the types of pressure bars applied, that is, in the case of sharp bar, the high strain concentrates at the loaded point and the distribution of the deflection is limited to a narrower area, but in the case of roller bar, the strain concentration diminishes and the distribution of the deflection spreads in a large area (Photos. 1 ～ 4). (4) Surfaces of the <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> produced with a roller bar are well smoother than those with a sharp bar (Photos. 5 and 6). (5) From these results, it may be concluded that the major factors affecting the quality of the thick-sliced veneer are not only the bar restraint which is determined by the combinations of such factors as h, v, depth of cut (t), cutting angle (θ) and roller diameter of roller bar (D) but also the contact area between the bar face and the workpiece surface...|$|R

The value drops with altitude and inclination and is higher on slope sites. Undamaged trees from higher social layers are also more valuable. Furthermore, beech timber value is positively affected by high harvesting intensity. In dense stands with a basal area exceeding 60 – 65 m 2 /ha, the value begins to decline. In order to improve the quality structure of beech stands, beech would have to be grown in beech-dominated clusters or stands, and thinned at the correct time. Particular attention needs to be paid to minimize the damage to dominant trees during harvesting. Quality assessment carried out within the forest inventory enables to assess the stand quality and value potential of forests at different spatial scale. The research has highlighted several possibilities to use quality data in connection with other parameters to enhance the efficiency of forest management...|$|R
