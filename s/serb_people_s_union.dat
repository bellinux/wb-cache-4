40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to reconstruct the}} history of Zambia s role in Zimbabwe s liberation struggle from 1964 to {{the latter part of}} 1979. In doing so, it examines key aspects of Zambia s contribution to the liberation struggle by analysing the broad range of assistance accorded to the Zimbabwe African <b>People</b> <b>s</b> <b>Union</b> (ZAPU) and the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), the two liberation movements which waged armed struggle against the Rhodesian government. The study argues that the Zambian authorities employed a two-pronged approach war and diplomacy in supporting Zimbabwe s liberation struggle. However, for mainly economic reasons, they were more inclined to pursue diplomatic approaches rather than exclusively relying on armed struggle in resolving the Rhodesian crisis. They backed the armed struggle only to an extent that it was a necessary instrument to coerce the Rhodesian government to the negotiating table, but this strategy had limited success and created numerous tensions and contradictions. Some sections of Zimbabwe nationalists accused Zambian President, Kenneth Kaunda, of undermining the liberation struggle and supporting a particular nationalist leader. Thus, Zambia s role in support of Zimbabwe s liberation struggle was shaped by the ideological, strategic and economic interests of Zambia s ruling elites which, in turn, shaped the attitudes, perceptions and relationships among the nationalist leaders competing for power within the liberation movements. Despite the numerous tensions and contradictions, and the enormous economic risks associated with Zambia s commitment to Zimbabwe s liberation struggle, the study concludes that it played a major role and contributed significantly to the liberation war.
