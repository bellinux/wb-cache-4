5000|$|The Adventures of Cliff Hanger - A cartoon lantern-jawed outdoorsman usually {{featured}} {{hanging off}} the side of a cliff, holding onto a branch. Each episode presents Cliff with a preposterous situation of some kind, which he attempts to use to his advantage by reaching into his backpack, pulling out what he calls his [...] "trusty survival manual", and following the instructions provided there. The instructions, though often highly unorthodox, usually prove successful, and Cliff briefly escapes from the cliff. But, inevitably, another highly unlikely incident occurs that leaves Cliff back where he started, hanging onto his branch once again. The cartoon then ends with Cliff's baleful catchphrase: [...] "Can't... hold... on... much... longer!" [...] Much like Warner Bros./Chuck Jones created Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, these cartoon clips follow along the same storyline; although Cliff never gives up on trying to get off the cliff, he never succeeds. Each segment begins and usually ends with a theme song sung by a formally dressed group of singers that flies by in a helicopter, singing [...] "Cliff Hanger, hanging from a cliff! And that's why he's called Cliff Hanger!" [...] Cliff attempts to attract their attention to his predicament by shouting [...] "Excuse me!", but to no avail. In one episode, he apparently succeeds at drawing their attention, and they rescue him, but it turns out he is simply dreaming. He once got off the cliff when he jumped on a whale's blowhole and washed up on a beach in [...] "The Last Cliff Hanger" [...] and Lionel is upset about the last book, but he got tired and, through a series of bizarre events (thanks to the writer, Livingston Dangerously), got himself back onto it. In two episodes Cliff Hanger and the <b>Solid</b> <b>Oil</b> Lamp and Cliff Hanger and the Sheep on a Ship, Cliff Hanger imagines he is in a restaurant eating steak, he is in a bathtub and a starstruck door. In another episode, Lionel's friend Lenny, a lizard, introduces a similarly styled series of books called Justin Time, about a stereotypical explorer named Justin Time who relaxes in a hammock until an absurd scenario like those of Cliff Hanger occurs, forcing him to intervene to restore the calm, boasting, [...] "Couldn't be more comfortable." [...] He too used a version of the Survival Manual, called a Safety Manual, which is from his Survival Kit, a version of Cliff Hanger's backpack and the same formally dressed Chorus, riding {{in the back of a}} Pickup truck introduces him at the beginning of the story, Singing [...] "Justin Time, he's always saved just in time! And that is why he is called Justin Time!" [...] Ironically, Lionel disliked this series. Only one Justin Time segment was ever shown as it only appeared in one episode. In the series, the character Lionel is a fan of Cliff Hanger books, which his sister Leona thinks are pointless.|$|E

The broadness {{and complexity of the}} ubiquitous absorption feature around 3. 2 µm suggest a variety of cometary organic constituents. For example, complex hydrocarbons (aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic) can contribute to the feature between 3. 3 and 3. 5 µm and to the low reflectance of the surface in the visible. Here we present the 0. 25 - 5 µm reflectance spectra of well-characterized terrestrial hydrocarbon materials (<b>solid</b> <b>oil</b> bitumens, coals) and discuss their relevance as spectral analogues for a hydrocarbon part of 67 P/CG's complex organics. However, the expected low degree of thermal processing of cometary hydrocarbons (high (H+O+N+S) /C ratios and low carbon aromaticities) suggests high IR reflectance, intense 3. 3 - 3. 5 µm absorption bands and steep red IR slopes that are not observed in the VIRTIS spectra. Fine-grained opaque refractory phases (e. g., iron sulfides, Fe-Ni alloys) intimately mixed with other surface components are likely responsible for the low IR reflectance and low intensities of absorption bands in the VIRTIS spectra of the 67 P/CG surface. In particular, iron sulfides are common constituents of cometary dust, "cometary" chondritic IDPs, and efficient darkening agents in primitive carbonaceous chondrites.

Two farms from different districts were involved in this study. Forty cows with 7 - 9 month pregnancy were selected from each farm and they were divided into control and treatment groups. Cows in control group were offered a mixed supplement of 1 kg copra meal + 2 kg fresh grated cassava root + mineral mix and treatments group were offered the control diet + 1 kg palm <b>oil</b> <b>solid</b> waste. The dietary supplement was offered to the cows for 2 months before and 2 months period after calving. The cows were grazed under palm oil plantation. The addition of palm <b>oil</b> <b>solid</b> waste in the diet improved (P < 0. 05) milk yield (8. 5 l/d vs 10. 5 l /d), calves weight at birth (19. 6 kg vs 22. 1 kg) and live weight gain of the calves (0. 66 kg/d vs 0. 99 kg/d). Additional dietary inclusion of palm <b>oil</b> <b>solid</b> waste improved milk yield of murrah buffalo, and further improvement of milk yield was expected to achieve by higher inclusion of palm <b>oil</b> <b>solid</b> waste in the diet...|$|R
