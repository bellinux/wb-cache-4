5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E

5|$|The {{order of}} sejm {{proceedings}} was formalized in the 17th century. The lower chamber would {{do most of}} the statute preparation work. The last several days were spent working together with the <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> king, when the final versions were agreed upon and decisions made; the finished legislative product had to have the consent of all three legislating estates of the realm, the Sejm, the <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> monarch.

5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a {{position}} to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains.

Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, {{the formal}} {{ceremony}} of granting assent in parliament {{has not been}} regularly used since the early 20th century.

The governor-general then signs the bill, sending messages {{to the president of the}} <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general's action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.|$|E

The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.|$|E

According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E
