5|$|Designed to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 1980s record, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. was {{influenced}} by artists such as the Cure, Depeche Mode, Cyndi Lauper and Madonna. The album incorporates a diverse range of genres, including electropop, dance-rock, new wave, R, hip hop, soul, and disco, while lyrically, most of its songs are about fashion and wealth. Promotion of the album included the release of six commercially successful singles and the North American Harajuku Lovers concert tour. While promoting, Stefani was often accompanied by back-up dancers called the Harajuku Girls.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, {{in an effort to}} replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to {{juxtapose}} my singing style with a hardcore hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} finished product still <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with the hip-hop producers whose work I most admired. It was important, if I were to {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound cohesive and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E

5|$|The shells {{are made}} of cast iron, {{as large as a}} bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; and when they get there a <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired {{successfully}} into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> woman.|$|E

5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E

25|$|Psychedelic music bands {{often used}} new {{recording}} techniques and effects and drew on non-Western {{sources such as}} the ragas and drones of Indian music. The Electric Prunes appeared in early ads for the Vox Wah wah pedal, which touted the effect's ability to make an electric guitar <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sitar.|$|E
25|$|An {{account of}} profits is another {{potential}} remedy. It is usually used where the {{breach of duty}} was ongoing or when the gain is hard to identify. The idea of an account of profits is that the fiduciary profited unconscionably {{by virtue of the}} fiduciary position, so any profit made should be transferred to the principal. It may <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> constructive trust at first, but it is not.|$|E

25|$|Its name {{initially}} was 'Parallels Workstation for Mac OS X', which {{was consistent with}} the company's corresponding Linux and Windows products. This name was not well received within the Mac community, where some felt that the name, particularly the term “workstation,” evoked the aesthetics of a Windows product. Parallels agreed: “Since we've got a great Mac product, we should make it look and <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Mac product...”, it was therefore renamed ‘Parallels Desktop for Mac’.|$|E
25|$|Included as a short interlude, {{the track}} is a minimalist {{instrumental}} cover version of Roy Budd's {{theme for the}} film Get Carter. It is played on a single voice on a Casio VL-1, using the preset 'Fantasy' with a digital 'reverb' effect. On its second repeat, additionally to the reverb a stereo 'chorus' is further added making the sound 'bigger', on the third repeat heavier 'Ensemble Chorus' is added making the single VL-1 <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dozen. Arranged by Oakey, Callis and Rushent.|$|E
25|$|More and more, architects are {{investigating}} ways that courtyards {{can play a}} role in the development of today's homes and cities. In densely populated areas, a courtyard in a home can provide privacy for a family, a break from the frantic pace of everyday life, and a safe place for children to play. With space at a premium, architects are experimenting with courtyards as a way to provide outdoor space for small communities of people at a time. A courtyard surrounded by 12 houses, for example, would provide a shared park-like space for those families, who could take pride in ownership of the space. Though this might <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> modern-day solution to an inner city problem, the grouping of houses around a shared courtyard was common practice among the Incas as far back as the 13th century.|$|E

50|$|Audible Doppler {{and target}} size support passive vehicle type {{classification}} when {{identification friend or foe}} {{is not available}} from a transponder signal. Medium pulse repetition frequency (PRF) reflected microwave signals fall between 1,500 and 15,000 cycle per second, which is audible. This means <b>a</b> helicopter <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> helicopter, <b>a</b> jet <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jet, and propeller aircraft <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> propellers. Aircraft with no moving parts produce a tone. The actual size of the target can be calculated using the audible signal.|$|R
25|$|The duo's music blends Okinawan {{folk songs}} with Western dance music and dub, {{and they often}} {{collaborate}} with native Okinawan singers and other musicians. Though their music may at times <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> DJ's mix of dance tracks with min'yō tracks, it consists mostly, if not entirely, of compositions composed, performed and recorded as original, new pieces. It may draw extensively from traditional lyrics, tunes, and chords, it is never simply mixed from pre-existing recordings by other artists, and always includes considerable original elements. The pair started out incorporating vocals and other elements via sampling, on later albums and other releases they have worked directly with Okinawan artists, recording vocals and other elements live in the studio. The duo has released four albums, and their music has been included in Buddha Bar compilation albums and used {{on a variety of}} television programs, documentaries, and other media.|$|E
25|$|While {{there were}} no {{external}} witnesses of the capsizing of Finn-Baltic, it was noticed by several people on the shore shortly afterwards and the rescue operation began within minutes of the accident even though the ship had not sent a distress signal. Around 12:30 the harbour bailiff of the Port of Hanko saw something odd amid the waves while standing at {{the window of his}} office. At first he thought it was just a barge being towed by a tug, but after spotting first the red bottom of the vessel and then its propeller and rudder, he realized that a ship had capsized in the storm and immediately contacted the captain of the rescue vessel Russarö, who alerted the Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre (MRSC) of Hanko at 12:40. At the same time a harbour worker standing on one of the easternmost quays saw something that resembled a new island {{in the middle of the}} storm. At first he, too, thought that it was just a towing, but was bothered by several strange details in the barge, such as the bow thruster, and decided to go get binoculars. When he came back to get a better view, he saw Russarö heading out. Finn-Baltic was also photographed only minutes before the combination capsized by a harbour worker, who remembered hearing a rumbling <b>sound,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> freight train, shortly after taking the picture of the ship.|$|E
500|$|The group's {{willingness}} to experiment was {{also evident in}} their dedication to finding or inventing sounds that captured the heightened perception they experienced through hallucinogenic drugs. The album made liberal use of compression and tonal equalisation. Emerick says that the Beatles encouraged the studio staff to break from standard recording practices, adding: [...] "It was implanted when we started Revolver that every instrument should sound unlike itself: a piano shouldn't <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> piano, a guitar shouldn't <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> guitar." ...|$|E
