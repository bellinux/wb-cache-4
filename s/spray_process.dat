40|$|Emerging new {{applications}} and growing demands of plasma-sprayed coatings have initiated {{the development of}} new plasma <b>spray</b> <b>processes.</b> One of them is suspension plasma spraying (SPS). The use of liquid feedstock such as suspensions yields higher flexibility compared to the conventional atmospheric plasma <b>spray</b> <b>processes</b> (APS) as even submicron- to nano-sized particles can be processed.

50|$|An aqueous-based parts washer is {{much like}} a large dish washer. It uses water and {{detergent}} combined with heat and mechanical energy to provide the cleaning action. There are two main process styles of aqueous parts washers, the jet <b>spray</b> <b>process</b> and the power wash process. In a cabinet parts washer, the parts are placed on a turntable and the door is closed. During the cleaning cycle heated solution is flooded or blasted on the parts as the turntable rotates. Many systems have a wash, rinse and dry cycle. When the cycle is complete the door is opened and the parts removed.|$|E
50|$|A jet spray washer cleans by {{flooding}} the parts with warm chemical solution and high chemical concentration {{to clean the}} parts. In the power wash process the parts are blasted with hot chemical solution utilizing the hydraulic impact force of the cleaning solution as the primary cleaning mechanism. A parts washer utilizing the power washer process operates at a very low concentration of cleaning detergent. The lower concentration causes the cleaning solution to last longer before it becomes supersaturated and requires disposal. Additionally, a low concentration of cleaning chemicals allows for easier rinsing of the detergent from the parts thereby minimizing rinse cycle requirements thus saving water and cycle time. A final factor used in the power wash process is an oscillating manifold system that is non-synchronous to {{the rotation of the}} turntable. This system assures that the blasted solution reaches all areas of the parts load that are otherwise blinded by the stationary manifolds used in the jet <b>spray</b> <b>process.</b> All things considered the power wash process is superior to the jet <b>spray</b> <b>process</b> for faster more thorough parts cleaning cycles while minimizing detergent use and waste generation. The power wash process is generally effective for difficult soil removal applications such as burnt hydrocarbons, paint, scale, varnish, carbon, mastic, or rubber. Additional power wash types of applications generally include cleaning diesel engines, aerospace components, aluminum automobile engine parts and rolling mill equipment.|$|E

5000|$|Plasma {{transferred}} wire arc (PTWA) {{is another}} form of wire arc spray which deposits a coating on the internal surface of a cylinder, or on the external surface of a part of any geometry. It is predominantly known for its use in coating the cylinder bores of an engine, enabling the use of Aluminum engine blocks {{without the need for}} heavy cast iron sleeves. A single conductive wire is used as [...] "feedstock" [...] for the system. A supersonic plasma jet melts the wire, atomizes it and propels it onto the substrate. The plasma jet is formed by a transferred arc between a non-consumable cathode and the type of a wire. After atomization, forced air transports the stream of molten droplets onto the bore wall. The particles flatten when they impinge {{on the surface of the}} substrate, due to the high kinetic energy. The particles rapidly solidify upon contact. The stacked particles make up a high wear resistant coating. The PTWA thermal <b>spray</b> <b>process</b> utilizes a single wire as the feedstock material. All conductive wires up to and including 0.0625" [...] (1.6mm) can be used as feedstock material, including [...] "cored" [...] wires. PTWA can be used to apply a coating to the wear surface of engine or transmission components to replace a bushing or bearing. For example, using PTWA to coat the bearing surface of a connecting rod offers a number of benefits including reductions in weight, cost, friction potential, and stress in the connecting rod.|$|E
