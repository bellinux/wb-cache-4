Therapeutics recovered from human plasma, called plasma protein products, involve a large pharmaceutical industry of plasma fractionation. In plasma fractionation of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) and albumin (HSA) recommended analysis techniques are regulated by the European Pharmacopoeia and are including total protein concentration assays and zone electrophoresis for protein composition and purity. These techniques are robust, but more efficient techniques with higher resolution, specificity and less <b>hands-on</b> <b>time</b> are available.

This technology {{was used in this}} master thesis to set up assays using Biacore systems for quantification of HSA and hIgG from all steps of chromatographic plasma fractionation as a tool for process development and in-process control. The analyses have simplified mass balance calculations to a high extent as they imply specific detection of the proteins compared with using total protein detection. The assays have a low <b>hands-on</b> <b>time</b> and are very simple to perform and the use of one master calibration curve during a full week decreases analysis time to a minimum.

To address this issue, Vysis has developed an automated signal enumeration system, Vysis AutoVysion. A multicenter, blinded study was conducted on 39 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded invasive breast carcinoma specimens, including 20 HER 2 nonamplified and 19 HER 2 amplified (weakly to highly amplified), provided in duplicate to each study site for analysis.

40|$|AIM: Whether mental stress {{negatively}} impacts team {{performance during}} cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remains controversial; this may partly {{be explained by}} differences in stress measures used in previous studies. Our aim was to compare self-reported, biochemical and physiological stress measures in regard to CPR performance. METHODS: This prospective, observational study was conducted at the simulator center of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Self-reported (feeling stressed and overwhelmed [stress/overload]), biochemical (plasma cortisol) and physiological (heart rate, heart rate variability) stress measures were assessed in 28 residents (teams of 2) before, during and after resuscitation. Team performance was defined as time to start CPR and <b>hands-on</b> <b>time</b> during the first 180 s. RESULTS: At baseline, significant negative correlations of heart rate variability with stress/overload and heart rate, as well as positive correlations of heart rate and cortisol were found. During resuscitation, self-reported, biochemical and physiological stress measures did not correlate significantly. There was no association of baseline stress measures with performance. During CPR, stress/overload {{was significantly associated with}} time to start CPR (regression coefficient 12. 01 (95 % CI 0. 65, 23. 36), p= 0. 04), while heart rate was negatively associated with time to start CPR (regression coefficient - 0. 78 (95 % CI - 1. 44, - 0. 11), p= 0. 027) and positively with <b>hands-on</b> <b>time</b> (regression coefficient 2. 22 (95 % CI 0. 53, 3. 92), p= 0. 015).
