At its debut, {{there were only}} two haunt attractions, Eerie Manor and Cedar Point Cemetery. Guests could travel on the Cedar Point <b>Spooky</b> Express through haunted lagoons and graveyards. The first new attraction, Toxic Tunnel of Terror, was introduced in 1998. Camp <b>Spooky</b> debuted a year later with children's activities in Camp Snoopy. In 2000, Cedar Point Cemetery was re-themed into Pharaoh's Secret. The park added three attractions in 2001, Eerie Manor was re-themed into Undertaker U., and Fright Zone and Magical House on Boo Hill were added.|$|E

5|$|Some unusual {{features}} of the Chinese vampire include its long, curved fingernails, perhaps derived from the appearance of growing fingernails on corpses due to flesh recession, and its greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like Encounters of the <b>Spooky</b> Kind and Mr. Vampire were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Erin Hannon (Kemper) works to make a <b>spooky,</b> non-childish Halloween party with help from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) becomes friends with Robert California's (James Spader) son (David Mazouz), and Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) debate the existence of ghosts. Meanwhile, Robert figures out everyone's deepest fears and tries to culminate a ghost story.|$|E
5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} <b>spooky</b> yet heart-wrenching piano melody'.

And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E

5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster as an ‘over-commission’ for series two. After {{a series}} of other story pitches, Lidster was asked to work on one of Russel T Davies’s standby plots {{concerning}} a <b>spooky</b> 24-hour supermarket to center on Jack and Ianto. Described as “Die Hard in a Supermarket”, it was set shortly after Ianto was brought {{back from the dead}} (as was originally planned, before this storyline shifted to Owen). It would have involved getting a woman named Maggie, the supermarket’s last customer, out alive. The store would have been possessed by a demonic creature from the rift that manifested only late at night and which feds of the human life-force. Ianto would have able to save the day due to being already dead.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very <b>spooky</b> scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E

5|$|The Vietnam War saw the {{introduction}} of helicopter gunships which could be employed to support ground based forces, and the experience gained in Vietnam would spawn the creation of several aircraft {{during and after the}} war designed specifically to aid ground forces, including the AC-47 <b>Spooky,</b> Fairchild AC-119, Lockheed AC-130, and A-10 Thunderbolt II, all of which are operated by the Air Force, and the F/A-18 Hornet which is operated by the navy. In addition, the army and marine corps operate UH-1 Iroquois, AH-1 Cobra, and AH-64 Apache helicopters for close air support, and these helicopters can be stationed onboard amphibious assault ships to provide ship-to-shore air support for ground forces. These aircraft would later prove instrumental in aiding ground forces from the 1980s onwards, and would be involved in the 1991 Gulf War, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Undead Nightmare is a {{modified}} {{expansion of the}} 2010 video game Red Dead Redemption, an open world Western action-adventure in which the former outlaw John Marston is coerced {{by the federal government}} to capture former members of his gang in exchange for his family's freedom. Undead Nightmare is an alternate timeline expansion that adds a new full-length story in a zombie horror theme and reworks the base game's environment to appear dark and <b>spooky.</b> As corpses begin to rise from the dead to become flesh-eating zombies, some of the living go into hiding and others become hostile. Marston seeks to find the plague's cause and its cure for his wife and son. The game's story lasts about six hours and includes new cutscenes, voice acting, and music. It is accessed separately from the main game menu with its own save files. It does not share play progress and items from the main game, nor does it require the base game in any form.|$|E
5|$|Finally, by 19:00 B Company {{was able}} break contact and withdrew after a five-hour battle. Both sides then fell {{back as the}} Viet Cong also dispersed, {{evacuating}} most of their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, under covering fire from the APCs of 2 Troop, B Company boarded the remaining carriers, moving into a night harbour near the landing zone with {{the remainder of the}} battalion at 19:25, as the last of their casualties were extracted by helicopter. Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered the Australian withdrawal, and then proceeded to pound the abandoned battlefield into the evening. That night the body of the dead APC driver was evacuated by helicopter, as American AC-47 <b>Spooky</b> gunships circled overhead, dropping flares to illuminate the battlefield and strafing likely Viet Cong positions, while F-4 Phantoms dropped napalm. The airstrikes then continued in preparation for a further assault by the Australians planned for the following day. Otherwise there was no further fighting that night, and both sides remained unmolested. Ultimately no attack was made against the Australian base at Nui Dat that night either, while no unusual activity was reported in the area.|$|E

5|$|The initial VC attack {{had split}} allied {{formations}} within the garrison; the 1st and 2nd Platoons of the 11th MSF Company were {{pushed away from}} the eastern perimeter, while the Marines were either alone or had organized themselves into small groups of two or three, but none were in contact with each another. Meanwhile, from inside his command post, White called in air-support which later {{came in the form of}} an AC-47 <b>Spooky</b> gunship, a modified version of the C-47 Skytrain equipped with 7.62mm General Electric miniguns for the support of ground troops. On the eastern side of the garrison, VC soldiers of the 40th Battalion continued to charge up the hill firing their AK-47 assault rifles. Simultaneously, other elements of the VC 1st Regiment probed the southern and western end of the garrison, now held by Captain White's 1st and 3rd Platoons, to test the strength of allied defenses in that part of the garrison. By that stage, however, most Nung soldiers had retreated from their positions on the eastern end of the garrison, while the U.S. Marines were pinned down around the perimeters. By 03:30, the VC had captured the Marines' gun position. Captain White was able to maintain contact with Warrant Officers Cameron and Lucas through telephone, but they could not coordinate their forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{title in}} the series, Fire Emblem Awakening, was planned {{to be the last}} in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. Fates was co-developed by regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of Awakening returning to their respective roles for Fates: they were Intelligence System's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on Xenoblade Chronicles X. Masahiro Higuchi, Awakenings project manager, came on board as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as they had all developed Awakening assuming it would be the last in the series. During its early design stages, Fates was given the working title Fire Emblem 3DS II. The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by <b>Spooky</b> Graphic. To develop the multiple versions, one core team worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled individual level design.|$|E
5|$|A second regimental-sized {{attack against}} 3 RAR at Balmoral was {{launched}} by the North Vietnamese at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion assault preceded by 60mm and 80mm mortar fire from the south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as the North Vietnamese sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms fire from their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles. The main assault began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined effect of this firepower stopping the North Vietnamese on the wire before they could penetrate the position. Although the assault was well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The assault was subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and C-47 <b>Spooky</b> gunships engaged the North Vietnamese, directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30.|$|E

5|$|At 03:45 on 26 May the North Vietnamese began a heavy {{bombardment}} with {{mortar and}} rockets, accompanied by machine-gun and small-arms fire. Immediately following the barrage, Balmoral {{was subjected to}} a ground assault across the open ground from the north-east by a force of up to battalion strength, falling primarily on D Company, commanded by Major Peter Phillips. At {{the same time the}} North Vietnamese conducted a feint on the southern perimeter opposite A Company—under Major Horrie Howard—using Bangalore torpedoes to break through the wire, although the gap was not exploited. Two Centurions that had been sited directly on the main axis of assault but concealed during the day, rolled forward under the cover of darkness. Their machine-guns and canister rounds proved telling during the fighting; the main attack stalled as it reached the wire before being repelled with heavy casualties by the combined firepower of the Australian infantry and tanks. Meanwhile, as sporadic mortar, rocket-propelled grenade and small-arms fire continued, to the south FSB Coral was also hit with suppressing fire from mortars, recoilless rifles and rocket-propelled grenades between 04:15 and 04:30, killing one Australian and wounded another. The defenders at Balmoral then directed fire from helicopter gunships and C-47 <b>Spooky</b> aircraft onto likely assembly areas and mortar base plate locations. Around 05:00 the North Vietnamese finally broke contact and withdrew, removing the majority of their casualties under covering fire as the Australian artillery fired on their escape routes. Clearing patrols from 3 RAR then swept the area at first light but found only six North Vietnamese dead and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and equipment. The Australians subsequently began the evacuation of their casualties, having lost a further three dead and 14 wounded.|$|E
5|$|By 04:00 A Company {{was still}} heavily engaged and the Australians called in {{helicopter}} light-fire teams and C-47 <b>Spooky</b> gunships, which dropped flares continuously from 04:30 {{to illuminate the}} battlefield. By 05:00 the main attack was halted and the North Vietnamese began withdrawing, just as the Australians were beginning to run low on ammunition. During the lull A Company was resupplied by APC, while the Australians pushed an RCL team forward to provide additional support. At 05:15 the North Vietnamese attacked again, targeting the boundary between A and C Companies on {{the northern edge of}} the perimeter, only to be repulsed by mortar fire. Later a two-battalion attack on A, B and C Companies was also turned back. The Australians then counter-attacked with elements of A Company supported by APCs, regaining the lost 3 Platoon section post. Finally, after a six-hour battle the North Vietnamese broke contact at 06:30 and withdrew with their dead and wounded, fighting a series of rearguard actions to prevent follow-up. The Australians also began collecting their casualties for evacuation, while another resupply was completed with APCs. 1 RAR subsequently commenced a clearance of the area, with the four Australian rifle companies patrolling to a depth of , killing one North Vietnamese soldier and capturing another. Five Australians had been killed and 19 wounded, while two US artillerymen were also wounded during the fighting. Only 34 North Vietnamese bodies were counted on the perimeter at dawn, however intelligence later indicated that fewer than 100 of the 790 attacking troops had survived unwounded. Meanwhile, in an attempt to disrupt the North Vietnamese withdrawal, Keldie led a troop of cavalry from Coral, engaging a North Vietnamese battalion during a pursuit that lasted until 15:00.|$|E
