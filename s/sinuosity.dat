500|$|Under ideal {{conditions}} (uniform gentle slope on a homogeneously erodible substrate), the <b>sinuosity</b> of a meandering river approaches [...] The <b>sinuosity</b> is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, {{and increasing the}} overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and [...] "short-circuit", creating an ox-bow lake in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of [...] between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Water flow is the {{key factor}} in lotic systems {{influencing}} their ecology. [...] The strength of water flow can vary between systems, ranging from torrential rapids to slow backwaters that almost seem like lentic systems. [...] The speed of the water flow can also vary within a system and is subject to chaotic turbulence. This turbulence results in divergences of flow from the mean downslope flow vector as typified by eddy currents. [...] The mean flow rate vector is based on variability of friction with the bottom or sides of the channel, <b>sinuosity,</b> obstructions, and the incline gradient. [...] In addition, {{the amount of water}} input into the system from direct precipitation, snowmelt, and/or groundwater can affect flow rate. [...] Flowing waters can alter the shape of the streambed through erosion and deposition, creating a variety of habitats, including riffles, glides, and pools.|$|E
2500|$|By the Triassic, the Permian Zechstein Sea {{had retreated}} and the climate {{had become a}} little wetter giving a gentle {{transition}} making the Permian-Triassic boundary uncertain in northern England as there are no fossil horizons or facies changes that make a definitive separation possible as there in continental Europe. The horizon however is characterised by a succession of red marls (calcareous mudstones) deposited on coastal flats, followed by the Sherwood Sandstone (formerly Bunter Sandstone). [...] The 'British Isles' were not islands, but had an intra-continental position within Pangea. The area that now constitutes Great Britain was drifting northwards as Pangea rotated, was at a latitude of 10° - 20° north, equivalent to the latitude of the present day Sahara desert. Erosion of the then recently uplifted landmass formed Aeolian deposits in the southern and central parts of the country. This iron-rich silica sandstone was both oxidised and reworked to give it its red colouration and its name, [...] "New Red Sandstone". British deposits of the era consist of these red beds, alluvial, fluvial and lake deposits, with some shallow-water marine and evaporite deposits. These Permo-Triassic outcrops {{can be seen on}} either side of the Pennines and in Devon. Within the main central England basin (Staffordshire and Cheshire), the deposits are dominated by pebbly sandstones and conglomerates (Chester Pebble Beds, Wilmslow and Wildmoor Sandstones), which have been interpreted as the deposits of a fluvial system running within well-confined channels. The Sherwood Sandstone Group comprises a series of conglomerates, coarse sandstones and mudstones. The Chester pebble beds to the south of Alderley represent material deposited in alluvial fan/braided river system. The finer sediments of the Wilmslow and Helsby Sandstone to the west of Alderley represent alluvial deposits of low <b>sinuosity</b> channels. The Alderley area represents the midpoint between the full braided river system and the lower energy area. Minor aeolian dunes and channel infill deposits in the Wilmslow Sandstones indicate an inter channel area or seasonal drying of some of the minor river channels.|$|E

60|$|Miss Deringham {{turned to}} watch them, realizing that {{whatever}} the steer risked, its pursuers were in peril of life and limb. Sometimes one horse rose above fern and thicket, or twisted, apparently with the <b>sinuosity</b> of a snake, in and out amidst the clustered trunks, while once the girl lurched forward. Miss Deringham gasped, {{but part of the}} fluttering skirt was rent away, and the little lithe figure swept on again. The pair were, it was evident, closing with the steer, and the latter apparently cut off from the valley it made for by the ravine. This was not, however, to prove an insuperable obstacle, for as Miss Deringham with difficulty edged her horse nearer, the beast charged straight at the hollow, and dropped into it. Then, while she regarded its capture as certain, it rose into view again, and floundered up the almost vertical slope on the other side with no very obvious difficulty. Miss Deringham, who found this riding down of a Canadian steer almost as exciting as anything she had seen when following the English hounds, regretted that the ravine with its fringe of undergrowth and litter of netted branches must apparently put a stop to the pursuit. Though the width was not great, no horse, she fancied, would be expected to face it, and she watched the two figures flitting amidst the trunks to see when they would pull up.|$|E

We went to them every day, as we did to the cathedral, {{but we did not}} see them until our second morning in Seville. We gave what was left from the first morning in the cathedral to a random exploration of the streets and places of the city. There was, no doubt, everywhere some touch of the bravery of our square of San Fernando, where the public windows were hung with crimson tapestries and brocades in honor of St. Raphael; but his holiday did not make itself molestively felt in the city's business or pleasure. Where we could drive we drove, and where we must we walked, and we walked of course through the famous Calle de las Sierpes, because no one drives there. As a rule no woman walks there, and naturally there were many women walking there, under the eyes of the popular cafes and aristocratic clubs which principally abound in Las Sierpes, for it is also the street of the principal shops, though it is not very long and is narrower than many other streets of Seville. It has its name from so commonplace an origin as the sign over a tavern door, with some snakes painted on it; but if the example of <b>sinuosity</b> had been set it by prehistoric serpents, there were scores of other streets which have bettered its instruction. There were streets that crooked away everywhere, not going anywhere, and breaking from time to time into irregular angular spaces with a church or a convent or a nobleman's house looking into them.|$|E
60|$|Maxwell, now, at least, {{knew that}} he had got his play going in the right {{direction}} again. He felt a fresh pleasure in returning to the old lines after his excursion in the region of comedy, and he worked upon them with fresh energy. He rehabilitated the love-business as he and his wife had newly imagined it, and, to disguise the originals the more effectively, he made the girl, whom he had provisionally called Salome, more like himself than Louise in certain superficial qualities, though in an essential nobleness and singleness, which consisted with a great deal of feminine <b>sinuosity</b> and subtlety, she remained a portrait of Louise. He was doubtful whether the mingling of characteristics would not end in unreality, but she was sure it would not; she said he was so much like a woman in the traits he had borrowed from himself that Salome would be all the truer for being like him; or, at any rate, she would be finer, and more ideal. She said that it was nonsense, the way people regarded women as altogether different from men; she believed they were very much alike; a girl was as much the daughter of her father as of her mother; she alleged herself as proof of the fact that a girl was often a great deal more her father's daughter, and she argued that if Maxwell made Salome quite in his own spiritual image, no one would dream of criticising her as unwomanly. Then he asked if he need only make Atland in her spiritual image to have him the manliest sort of fellow. She said that was not what she meant, and, in any case, a man could have feminine traits, and be all the nicer for them, but, if a woman had masculine traits, she would be disgusting. At the same time, if you drew a man from a woman, he would be ridiculous.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Doramin {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{remarkable}} men of his race I had ever seen. His bulk for a Malay was immense, but he did not look merely fat; he looked imposing, monumental. This motionless body, clad in rich stuffs, coloured silks, gold embroideries; this huge head, enfolded in a red-and-gold headkerchief; the flat, big, round face, wrinkled, furrowed, with two semicircular heavy folds starting on each side of wide, fierce nostrils, and enclosing a thick-lipped mouth; the throat like a bull; the vast corrugated brow overhanging the staring proud eyes--made a whole that, once seen, can never be forgotten. His impassive repose (he seldom stirred a limb when once he sat down) was like a display of dignity. He was never known to raise his voice. It was a hoarse and powerful murmur, slightly veiled as if heard from a distance. When he walked, two short, sturdy young fellows, naked to the waist, in white sarongs and with black skull-caps on the backs of their heads, sustained his elbows; they would ease him down and stand behind his chair till he wanted to rise, when he would turn his head slowly, as if with difficulty, to the right and to the left, and then they would catch him under his armpits and help him up. For all that, there was nothing of a cripple about him: on the contrary, all his ponderous movements were like manifestations of a mighty deliberate force. It was generally believed he consulted his wife as to public affairs; but nobody, as far as I know, had ever heard them exchange a single word. When they sat in state by the wide opening it was in silence. They could see below them in the declining light the vast expanse of the forest country, a dark sleeping sea of sombre green undulating as far as the violet and purple range of mountains; the shining <b>sinuosity</b> of the river like an immense letter S of beaten silver; the brown ribbon of houses following the sweep of both banks, overtopped by the twin hills uprising above the nearer tree-tops. They were wonderfully contrasted: she, light, delicate, spare, quick, a little witch-like, with a touch of motherly fussiness in her repose; he, facing her, immense and heavy, like a figure of a man roughly fashioned of stone, with something magnanimous and ruthless in his immobility. The son of these old people was a most distinguished youth.|$|E
60|$|Ransom {{remembered how}} he had liked her before, and he felt that, as the phrase was, {{he was going to}} like her again. He wanted to express his good-will to her, and would greatly have enjoyed being at liberty to offer her a cigar. He didn't know what to offer her or what to do, unless he should invite her to sit with him on a fence. He did realise {{perfectly}} what the situation in the small frame-house must be, and entered with instant sympathy into the feelings which had led Doctor Prance to detach herself from the circle and wander forth under the constellations, all of which he was sure she knew. He asked her permission to accompany her on her walk, but she said she was not going much further in that direction; she was going to turn round. He turned round with her, and they went back together to the village, in which he at last began to discover a certain consistency, signs of habitation, houses disposed with a rough resemblance to a plan. The road wandered among them with a kind of accommodating <b>sinuosity,</b> and there were even cross-streets, and an oil-lamp on a corner, and here and there the small sign of a closed shop, with an indistinctly countrified lettering. There were lights now in the windows of some of the houses, and Doctor Prance mentioned to her companion several of the inhabitants of the little town, who appeared all to rejoice in the prefix of captain. They were retired shipmasters; there was quite a little nest of these worthies, two or three of whom might be seen lingering in their dim doorways, as if they were conscious of a want of encouragement to sit up, and yet remembered the nights in far-away waters when they would not have thought of turning in at all. Marmion called itself a town, but it was a good deal shrunken since the decline in the shipbuilding interest; it turned out a good many vessels every year, in the palmy days, before the war. There were shipyards still, where you could almost pick up the old shavings, the old nails and rivets, but they were grass-grown now, and the water lapped them without anything to interfere. There was a kind of arm of the sea put in; it went up some way, it wasn't the real sea, but very quiet, like a river; that was more attractive to some. Doctor Prance didn't say the place was picturesque, or quaint, or weird; but he could see that was what she meant when she said it was mouldering away. Even under the mantle of night he himself gathered the impression that it had had a larger life, seen better days. Doctor Prance made no remark designed to elicit from him an account of his motives in coming to Marmion; she asked him neither when he had arrived nor how long he intended to stay. His allusion to his cousinship with Miss Chancellor might have served to her mind as a reason; yet, on the other hand, it would have been open to her to wonder why, if he had come to see the young ladies from Charles Street, he was not in more of a hurry to present himself. It was plain Doctor Prance didn't go into that kind of analysis. If Ransom had complained to her of a sore throat she would have inquired with precision about his symptoms; but she was incapable of asking him any question with a social bearing. Sociably enough, however, they continued to wander through the principal street of the little town, darkened in places by immense old elms, which made a blackness overhead. There was a salt smell in the air, as if they were nearer the water; Doctor Prance said that Olive's house was at the other end.|$|E

50|$|River flood plains {{that contain}} rivers {{with a highly}} sinuous {{platform}} are populated by longer oxbow lakes than those with low <b>sinuosity.</b> This is because rivers with high <b>sinuosity</b> have larger meanders, and greater opportunity for longer lakes to form. Rivers with lower <b>sinuosity</b> are characterized by fewer cutoffs and shorter oxbow lakes due to the shorter distance of their meanders.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} from the general form happens because the downvalley path is not perfectly straight. The <b>sinuosity</b> index can be explained, then, as the deviations from a path defined by the direction of maximum downslope. For this reason, bedrock streams that flow directly downslope have a <b>sinuosity</b> index of 1, and meandering streams have a <b>sinuosity</b> index that is greater than 1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sinuosity</b> in {{submarine}} channels is {{a feature}} regularly observed on seismic maps. It can vary between occasional low amplitude bends to highly sinuous densely looping channels. Channel <b>sinuosity</b> results in significant migration lateral and affects continuity of facies associated with both channel sediments and surrounding deep water sediments. It {{is important that}} {{although it is not}} always clear how these sinuosities evolve, they typically do not result from a random wandering. In most cases the wandering and changes in <b>sinuosity</b> is as a result of external forces. As a result of this Peakall et al. (2000) advocates the avoidance of the term meandering to describe this <b>sinuosity,</b> a phrase used to describe similar <b>sinuosity</b> observed in terrestrial fluvial systems.

5000|$|<b>Sinuosity</b> {{is one of}} {{the channel}} types that a stream may assume over all or part of its course. All streams are sinuous at some time in their {{geologic}} history over some part of their length. The <b>sinuosity</b> of a meandering stream has a tendency to approach a critical state at which the opposing forces which create and cut off meanders interact {{in such a way that}} <b>sinuosity</b> fluctuates around a constant mean, regardless of the original conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{classification}} of a <b>sinuosity</b> (e.g. strong / weak) often {{depends on the}} cartographic scale of the curve (see the coastline paradox for further details) and of the object velocity which flowing therethrough (river, avalanche, car, bicycle, bobsleigh, skier, high speed train, etc.): the <b>sinuosity</b> of the same curved line could be considered very strong for a high speed train but low for a river. Nevertheless, {{it is possible to}} see a very strong <b>sinuosity</b> in the succession of few river bends, or of laces on some mountain roads.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sinuosity</b> index {{plays a part}} in {{mathematical}} {{descriptions of}} streams. The index may require elaboration, because the valley may meander as well—i.e., the downvalley length is not identical to the reach. In that case the valley index is the meander ratio of the valley while the channel index is the meander ratio of the channel. The channel <b>sinuosity</b> index is the channel length divided by the valley length and the standard <b>sinuosity</b> index is the channel index divided by the valley index. Distinctions may become even more subtle.|$|E
