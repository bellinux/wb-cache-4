5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolutionary War (17751783), the Continental Army made {{relatively}} little use of cavalry, primarily relying on infantry {{and a few}} dragoon regiments. The United States Congress eventually authorized regiments specifically designated as cavalry in 1855. The newly formed American cavalry adopted tactics based on experiences fighting over vast distances during the Mexican War (18461848) and against indigenous peoples on the western frontier, abandoning <b>some</b> <b>European</b> traditions.|$|E
5|$|In <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries, such as Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, the muskrat is {{considered}} an invasive pest, as its burrowing damages the dikes and levees on which these low-lying countries depend for protection from flooding. In those countries, it is trapped, poisoned, and hunted to attempt to keep the population down. Muskrats also eat corn and other farm and garden crops growing near water bodies.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{confusion}} over which scientific name {{to use for}} over two hundred years. Tricholoma tigrinum {{has been used in}} <b>some</b> <b>European</b> field guides, but has been applied in error to this species. The uncertainty was such that Czech mycologists Josef Herink and František Kotlaba suggested in 1967 that both designations were incorrect, and proposed the new name T.pardalotum.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 20th century, in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained {{the right to vote}} in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E

5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning <b>some</b> <b>European</b> states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.|$|E
5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped {{the political landscape}} within the past ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, Dream Theater {{announced}} <b>some</b> <b>European</b> tour {{dates for}} early 2016. The next month, they announced North American tour dates beginning in April and ending in May. As the band felt that The Astonishing would lend itself well to a live performance, {{they decided to}} play the album in full for each show and hired a production company to help with their presentation. They also {{made it a point}} to book historical concert halls and theaters such as Radio City Music Hall. Following the conclusion of the North American leg, the band moved on to South America before returning to the United States for another run of shows, officially wrapping up the tour in December 2016.|$|E

5|$|In <b>some</b> <b>European</b> Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} {{prior to}} the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a shield and, while standing upon it, was borne on the shoulders of several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E
5|$|Irving, {{along with}} James Fenimore Cooper, {{was among the}} first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and Irving {{encouraged}} American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. Irving was also admired by <b>some</b> <b>European</b> writers, including Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Charles Dickens, Francis Jeffrey, and Walter Scott. Also, as the United States' first internationally best-selling author, Irving advocated for writing as a legitimate profession and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{worked with}} musicians {{including}} Fernando Garibay, Jeff Bhasker, and Martin Kierszenbaum, {{and created a}} concept album based on perfectionism. Its lyrical content contains references to love, sex, and money, complemented by a sonority rooted in synthpop, dance-pop and dark pop. Perfectionist received mixed reviews from music critics, who asserted that the singer's visual projects were superior to her music. Obtaining top 50 positions in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries, the album performed moderately on international record charts. In the United Kingdom and United States, the set attained chiefly low positions; in the latter, its sales as of September 2013 were of 14,000 copies.|$|E
50|$|About 1975, {{two local}} guides guiding <b>some</b> <b>Europeans</b> {{hoping to see}} the white bison said they had not seen a 'white bison' in the last 15 or 20 years. They {{admitted}} quite frankly this was partly {{because there was no}} occasion for them to go looking for gaur.|$|R

5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. <b>Some</b> <b>European</b> countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{first version}} of the song was {{produced}} by Bobby Orlando and was released on Columbia Records' Bobcat Records imprint in April 1984, becoming a club hit in the United States and <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries. After the duo signed with EMI, the song was re-recorded with producer Stephen Hague for their first studio album, Please. In October 1985, the new version was released, reaching {{number one in the}} United Kingdom and the United States in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community made repeated unsuccessful attempts {{to end the}} fighting. Both sides violated ceasefires, often within hours. Calls by <b>some</b> <b>European</b> Community members for the Western European Union to intervene militarily were vetoed by the United Kingdom. Instead, a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington {{to find a way}} to end the conflict. The United Nations (UN) imposed an arms embargo on all of the Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under Security Council Resolution 713, but this was ineffective, in part because the JNA had no need to import weapons. The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} {{is the most}} widespread species, while the others are confined to smaller regions, e.g. the southwestern Iberian Peninsula in the southern marbled newt, and the Danube basin {{and some of its}} tributaries in the Danube crested newt. The Italian crested newt (T. carnifex) has been introduced outside its native range in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries and the Azores. In the northern Balkans, four species of crested newt occur in close vicinity, and may sometimes even co-exist.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum, {{commonly}} known as spotted tricholoma, tiger tricholoma, tigertop, leopard knight, or dirty trich, is a gilled mushroom widely distributed across North America and Europe, as well as parts of Asia. It is generally found in beech woodland in summer and autumn. Two subspecies have been described from southern Europe. First officially described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, Tricholoma pardinum has had a confusing taxonomic history that extends over two centuries. In 1762, German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer described the species Agaricus tigrinus with an illustration corresponding to what {{is thought to be}} T.pardinum, and consequently, the name Tricholoma tigrinum has been used erroneously in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> field guides.|$|E
5|$|Anggun is the Asian {{artist with}} the highest album sales outside Asia, with her {{releases}} being certified gold and platinum in <b>some</b> <b>European</b> countries.
