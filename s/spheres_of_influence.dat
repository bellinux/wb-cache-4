5|$|The Germans reaffirmed their {{alliance}} with Italy and signed non-aggression pacts with Denmark, Estonia and Latvia whilst trade links were formalised with Romania, Norway and Sweden. Hitler's foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arranged {{in negotiations with}} the Soviet Union a non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which was signed in August 1939. The treaty also contained secret protocols dividing Poland and the Baltic states into German and Soviet <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Cao's {{defeat at}} the naval Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD, China was divided into three <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence,</b> with Cao Cao {{dominating}} the north, Sun Quan (182–252 AD) dominating the south, and Liu Bei (161–223 AD) dominating the west. Cao Cao died in March 220 AD. By December his son Cao Pi (187–226 AD) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Wei. This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between three states: Cao Wei, Eastern Wu, and Shu Han.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E

25|$|Austria was humiliated by {{defeat and}} was forced to concede control, and its <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence,</b> over the south German states.

5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} {{diplomatic}} <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> {{resulting from the}} Congress of Vienna in 1814–15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe. The negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia's growing strength within and among the German states and so failed to foresee that Prussia would rise to challenge Austria for leadership of the German peoples. This German dualism presented two {{solutions to the problem}} of unification: Kleindeutsche Lösung, the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or Großdeutsche Lösung, the greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria).|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> Not even the creator god could reach {{beyond the boundaries of}} the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E

5|$|Bormann's {{power and}} {{effective}} reach broadened considerably during the war. By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee {{with representatives of}} the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take Ayutthaya, Tabinshwehti claimed to have regained control of the Tavoy frontier. Indeed, the Burmese chronicles claim the Siamese king had agreed to pay an annual tribute. Even if this claim was true, the Toungoo Dynasty's control over Tavoy lasted {{a little over a}} year in any case. Tabinshwehti was assassinated just a year after the Siamese {{campaign}} on 30 April 1550, and the empire he had built in the previous 16 years quickly collapsed, with each town claiming a king. Even after Bayinnaung had restored the kingdom in the following years, the frontier region was likely under overlapping <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> (During his 1554–1555 campaign against Upper Burma, his southernmost garrison was at Ye, not Tavoy.) It was only in 1562 that Bayinnaung made an emphatic claim on the region by setting up a Burmese garrison at Tavoy, in preparation for his invasion of Siam a year later.|$|E

40|$|List of hydro-, phreato- and aphreatophytes in the Netherlands Phreatophytes are species (or other taxa) {{which are}} in a certain part of their {{distribution}} area exclusively or mainly limited to the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the phreatic surface (level of the ground water). Species which in their distribution {{are not limited to}} this <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence,</b> are called aphreatophytes. A list (LONDO, 1975) was {{made on the basis of}} field observations for the purpose of ground water management in the Netherlands. The following categories are distinguished: H—Hydrophytes, species with vegetative parts submerged and/or floating on the water surface. W—Species requiring for at least part of the year a (ground) water level above or at the soil surface (in years with a normal water table) for a good development and completion of their life cycle (e. g. germination). F—Species growing exclusively within the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the phreatic surface, which is generally below the soil surface. Species of categories W and F are strictly phreatophytes. f—Species growing mainly or nearly exclusively within the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the phreatic surface, which is generally below the soil surface. The species of this category as well as those of the following categories (f) and a, are not strictly phreatophytes. (f) —Species growing in the greater part of their area in the Netherlands within the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the phreatic surface (which is generally below the soil surface), but also occurring, and often abundantly in certain habitats (especially in areas rich in lime), above this <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence,</b> a—Species which in many habitats in the Netherlands are not limited to the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the phreatic surface (here they are aphreatophytes), but which grow exclusively or mainly within this <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence,</b> locally especially in dunes or other sandy areas. A—Species not bound to the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the phreatic surface (aphreatophytes). z—Species growing only in salt habitats. Species of salt habitats occurring (sometimes incidentally) also in environments with fresh ground water, are classified in one of the other categories.

5|$|Mithridates the Great was {{the ruler}} of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor, from 120 to 63 BC. He is remembered as one of Rome's most {{formidable}} and successful enemies who engaged {{three of the most}} prominent generals of the late Roman Republic: Sulla, Lucullus, and Pompey the Great. In a pattern familiar from the Punic Wars, the Romans came into conflict with him after the two states' <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> began to overlap. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring. After conquering western Anatolia (modern Turkey) in 88 BC, Roman sources claim that Mithridates ordered the killing {{of the majority of the}} 80,000 Romans living there. In the subsequent First Mithridatic War, the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper after the Battle of Chaeronea and later Battle of Orchomenus but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival Marius; consequently, Mithridates VI was defeated but not destroyed. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.|$|E
5|$|Persia at {{the time}} was divided into British and Russian <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence,</b> with a neutral zone in between. Germany {{exercised}} influence over the central parts of the country through their consulate in Isfahan. The local populace and the clergy, opposed to Russian and British semi-colonial designs on Persia, offered support to the mission. Niedermayer and von Hentig's groups reconnoitred Isfahan until the end of June. The Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, was already receiving reports of pro-German sympathies among Persian and Afghan tribes. Details of the progress of the expedition were being keenly sought by British intelligence. By now, British and Russian columns close to the Afghan border, including the Seistan Force, were hunting for the expedition. If the expedition was to reach Afghanistan, it would have to outwit and outrun its pursuers over thousands of miles in the extreme heat and natural hazards of the Persian desert, while evading brigands and ambushes.|$|E
5|$|The Great Arab Revolt {{started on}} 5 June 1916 from Medina and pushed northwards until the {{fighting}} reached Transjordan in the Battle of Aqaba on 6 July 1917. By 1918, the revolt — with the Allies' support — successfully {{gained control of}} most of the territories of the Hejaz and the Levant, including Damascus. However, it failed to gain international recognition as an independent state, due mainly to the secret 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement and the 1917 Balfour Declaration. This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British, including the 1915 McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, in which the British stated their willingness to recognise the independence of a unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo to Aden under the rule of the Hashemites. The region was divided into French and British <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> Abdullah I, the second son of Sharif Hussein arrived from Hejaz by train in Ma'an in southern Jordan on 11 November 1920, where he was greeted by Transjordanian leaders. Abdullah established the Emirate of Transjordan on 11 April 1921, which then became a British protectorate.|$|E

5|$|The loss of {{its only}} {{access to the}} Baltic Sea was a major blow to the Lithuanian economy. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda. The region, which {{represented}} only about 5% of Lithuania's territory, contained {{a third of its}} industry. Lithuania also lost its heavy investments in the port's infrastructure. About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, left the region and sought shelter and support from the Lithuanian government. Lithuanians doubted the fate of their country: in March–April withdrawals of deposits in banks and credit institutions totaled almost 20% of total deposits. After the loss of Klaipėda, Lithuania drifted into the German sphere of influence, especially in terms of trade. At the end of 1939, Germany accounted for 75% of Lithuanian exports and for 86% of its imports. Germany and the Soviet Union concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, dividing Eastern Europe into their respective <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> Not surprisingly, Lithuania was, at first, assigned to Germany. The Nazis {{went so far as to}} suggest a German–Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and promised to return the Vilnius Region, but Lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality.|$|E
5|$|When Russia {{invaded the}} Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian {{dominance}} in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Russian Entente. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Tawau, the region around it {{was the subject of}} dispute between the British and Dutch <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> In 1893, the first British merchant vessel sailed into Tawau, marking the opening of the town's sea port. In 1898, the British set up a settlement in Tawau. The British North Borneo Chartered Company (BNBC) accelerated growth of the settlement's population by encouraging the immigration of Chinese. Consequent to the Japanese occupation of North Borneo, the Allied forces bombed the town, in mid-1944, razing it to the ground. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, 2,900 Japanese soldiers in Tawau became prisoners of war and were transferred to Jesselton. Tawau was rebuilt after the war, {{and by the end of}} 1947, the economy was restored to its pre-war status. Tawau was also the main point of conflict during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation from 1963 to 1966. During that period, it was garrisoned by the British Special Boat Section, and guarded by Australian Destroyers and combat aircraft. In December 1963, Tawau was bombed twice by Indonesia and shootings occurred across the Tawau-Sebatik Island international border. Indonesians were found trying to poison the town's water supply. In January 1965, a curfew was imposed to prevent Indonesian attackers from making contact with Indonesians living in the town. While in June 1965, another attempted invasion by the Indonesian forces was repelled by bombardment by an Australian destroyer. Military conflict finally ended in December 1966.|$|E
