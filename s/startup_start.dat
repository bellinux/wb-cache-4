ProAddicts is based on three main pillars: • The future of {{vertical}} social networks (technically specialized) • Sport as a lifestyle. • The video as a communication medium. These three pillars make ProAddicts a virtual platform where you can offer {{all kinds of people}} the opportunity to share sports experiences through their own videos and promote communication of extreme sports lovers. ProAddicts is a sports video website categorized into four elements: water, earth, air and road. Inside these four categories are different subcategories. This segmentation allows users to find more easily videos of the sport that they were looking for and ProAddicts to offer a more targeted advertising and therefore more attractive to both, advertisers and users. Then, using this marketing plan we will analyze the internal and external situation, competition and the market to see what is the current situation of ProAddicts. Also we will detail what will be the strategy to reach the established objectives. And finally we will present a set of actions, their cost and the way we will track them to achieve the fixed objectives...|$|R

Statistical characterizations of empirical data are useful in QoS modeling to quantify risks without the need to conduct an ad-hoc measurement study. They are vital to estimate realistic values for QoS model parameters, e.g., network bandwidth variance, virtual machine (VM) <b>startup</b> times, <b>start</b> failure probabilities. Observations of performance variability have been reported for different types of VM instances [5]-[7]. Hardware heterogeneity and VM interference are the primary cause for such variability, which is also visible within VMs of the same instance class. Other works characterize the variability in VM startup times [7],[8], which is correlated in particular with operating system image size [8]. Some studies on Amazon EC 2 have found high-performance contention in CPU-bound jobs [9] and network performance overheads [10]. A few characterization studies specific to public and private PaaS hosting solutions also appeared in the literature [11],[12], together with comparisons of cloud database and storage services [13]-[16]. Also, a comparison of different providers on a broad set of metrics is presented in [17].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} detect the rotor position of permanent-magnet motors at standstill, which is suitable to avoid temporary reverse rotation at <b>startup</b> or <b>starting</b> failure. The approach {{is based on the}} investigation of the stator inductance variation {{as a function of the}} rotor magnets position and the stator current space vector. It involves the application of a proper sequence of voltage pulses to the stator windings, and the measurement of the peak values of the resulting current in order to achieve the rotor position estimation. Actually, the current measurements show significant uncertainties which affect the rotor position detection. In order to avoid these problems, the authors propose a novel procedure which combines an iterative sequence of voltage pulses with a fuzzy logic processing of the current responses and phase currents derivation based on the DC-link current measurements. The proposed method has been implemented on a μC digital signal processor (TMS 320 F 240). The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution. It can be applied in sensorless drives, in drives equipped with nonabsolute position transducers, with a wide range of motors, and it does not require the knowledge of any of the motor parameters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of the support from the environment, in which students live and work, on the success of student startups. A unique experiment was conducted, in which one group of students was confronted with a network of external specialists and the other group was not confronted with this network. This experiment dealt with the endogeneity problem that is often related with social networks, because this time part of the network was externally delivered to the startups involved in the experiment. The experiment also delivered data from which we can conclude that student startups in a more traditional market profit more from a dense network than from a network with structural holes {{in the first six months}} after starting their businesses. Student <b>startups</b> that <b>started</b> in less developed markets seemed to profit more from structural holes in this startup phase. In both cases there was no significant evidence that a network with structural holes contributed to a higher performance of student startups in their first six months. This paper ends with recommendations for universities how to help their student startups to succeed better within the educational system...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{how to measure}} student transformation primarily within a university entrepreneurship degree program. Student transformation is defined as changes in knowledge (“Head”), skills (“Hand”), and attitudinal (“Heart”) learning outcomes. Following the institutional impact model, student transformation is {{the primary goal of}} education and all other program goals and aspects of quality desired by stakeholders are either input factors (professors, courses, facilities, support, etc.) or output performance (number of <b>startups,</b> average <b>starting</b> salary, % employment, etc.). This goal-setting framework allows competing stakeholder quality expectations to be incorporated into a continuous process improvement (CPI) model when establishing program goals. How to measure these goals to implement TQM methods is shown. Measuring student transformation as the central focus of a program promotes harmony among competing stakeholders and also provides a metric on which other program decisions (e. g., class size, assignments, and pedagogical technique) may be based. Different stakeholders hold surprisingly different views on defining program quality. The proposed framework provides a useful way to bring these competing views into a CPI cycle to implement TQM requirements of accreditation. The specific entrepreneurial learning outcome goals described in the tables in this article may also be used directly by educators in nonaccredited programs and single courses/workshops or for other audiences...|$|R
