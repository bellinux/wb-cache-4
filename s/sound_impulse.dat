50|$|A {{network of}} nerves in the MSO detect {{the place that}} a {{threshold}} is overcome by sending electrochemical impulses along the auditory nerve pathway to the cortex for higher-level processing. These nerves permit the subconscious localization of a sound source; people can identify the direction from which a sound emanates before they can identify the type of source, which is done when the signals reach the cortex. A sound source produces a propagating sound wave that strikes the ear closer to it before traveling an extra distance to strike the opposite ear. The impulses produced in the auditory nerves which conduct signals to the brain for sound processing pass {{one another in the}} MSO at a point on the opposite side relative to the location sound source. If a <b>sound</b> <b>impulse</b> originates from a point equidistant to each ear (e.g. directly behind or in front of the head), the neuronal impulses from each ear will pass at a point {{in the center of the}} MSO, allowing us to unconsciously identify where a sound source is located.

Hence, this study aimed to assess the effects of HOT on guinea pigs exposed to {{acoustic trauma}}. Fifteen guinea pigs were exposed to noise in the 4 -kHz range with intensity of 110 dB sound level pressure for 72 h. They were assessed by {{brainstem auditory evoked potential}} (BAEP) and by distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) before and after exposure and after HOT at 2. 0 absolute atmospheres for 1 h. The cochleae were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). There was a statistically significant difference in the signal-to-noise ratio of the DPOAE amplitudes for the 1 - to 4 -kHz frequencies and the SEM findings revealed damaged outer hair cells (OHC) after exposure to noise, with recovery after HOT (p = 0. 0159), which did not occur on thresholds and amplitudes to BAEP (p = 0. 1593). The electrophysiological BAEP data did not demonstrate effectiveness of HOT against AAT damage. However, there was improvement of the anatomical pattern of damage detected by SEM, with a significant reduction of the number of injured cochlear OHC and their functionality detected by DPOAE.

This phenomenon is possibly due to the complexity of the outer hair cells and their efferent control system and the different time scales of regulatory processes. A total of 100 healthy subjects ranging from 18 to 40 years of age with normal hearing and normal DPOAE values in the range of 781 – 4000 Hz were recruited in the study.

40|$|Long-term {{observations}} have obviously {{proved that}} possibly earlier diagnostics of hearing defects, adequate estimation and therapy are {{essential factors for}} elaboration of verbal contacts and integration in society of children with hearing defects. As the result of insufficient and inadequate stimulation at early age - deficit of <b>sound</b> <b>impulse</b> in infants could {{be the cause of}} incomplete functional development and further maturation of hearing centre. Unfortunately, the today known and widely used subjective methods of examination do not allow to detect precisely the threshold of hearing at early age. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain the effectivity of caustically initiated brain stem potential detection method (BERA) used for precise detection of hearing threshold in children of early age. The work was performed in the Children Hearing Centre of Latvia and in the Centre of Social Paediatrics, Medical Faculty of University of Latvia. Totally 136 children at the age from two to 168 months were examined. The objectivized detection of hearing threshold (BERA) was performed during medically provoked sleep period. We have detected that the data of the same child in subjective and objective audiometric examination were different, and besides, in the group of children at the age from two to 24 months these differences were statistically significant (p< 0. 05), in comparison with older children. That means that it indicates the group of children, where the audiometric examination could play essential role for further set up of rehabilitation strategy. Besides, the objectivized audiometric examination (BERA) allowed to detect precisely the asymmetry of hearing threshold in the age groups. It is interesting to mention that the asymmetry of hearing threshold was the same in left and right sides for the pre-schoolers, but the right side hearing threshold decrease prevailed in school children. It could be an indirect sign of elevation of functional inability of brain hearing centre with the age. The method of BERA of detecting caustically initiated brain stem potentials is evidently more precise and sensitive audiometric method for detection of hearing threshold elevation and asymmetry, specially at early age and thus gives wider possibilities for in due time development rehabilitation and integration in society of children with hearing defectsSeparate summary in Latvian, English, German, 21 p.

40|$|An {{impulsive}} sound source (propane gun) {{was used to}} measure the acoustic-to-seismic transfer functions of natural soils.

Due to the spectral energy distribution of the <b>sound</b> <b>impulses,</b> measurements are possible for frequencies up to 600 Hertz. The reliable frequency range of a measurement can be estimated by means of the coherence function. The seismic impulse responses depend on the soil properties and on the elevation angle of the arriving sound waves at the sensor location (local reaction). Furthermore, soil inhomogeneities cause a strong dependency on the azimuth angle of the sound waves. As a consequence, the acoustic-to-seismic coupling properties of a given soil can only be described by means of common features (if existent) of the transfer functions taken at different sound azimuth angles or by means of stati stical numbers such as mean value and variance...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} the Audio Degradation Toolbox (ADT) for the controlled degradation of audio signals, and propose its usage {{as a means}} of evaluating and comparing the robustness of audio processing algorithms. Music recordings encountered in practical applications are subject to varied, sometimes unpredictable degradation. For example, audio is degraded by low-quality microphones, noisy recording environments, MP 3 compression, dynamic compression in broadcasting or vinyl decay. In spite of this, no standard software for the degradation of audio exists, and music processing methods are usually evaluated against clean data. The ADT fills this gap by providing Matlab scripts that emulate a wide range of degradation types. We describe 14 degradation units, and how they can be chained to create more complex, `real-world' degradations. The ADT also provides functionality to adjust existing ground-truth, correcting for temporal distortions introduced by degradation. Using four different music informatics tasks, we show that performance strongly depends on the combination of method and degradation applied. We demonstrate that specific degradations can reduce or even reverse the performance difference between two competing methods.
