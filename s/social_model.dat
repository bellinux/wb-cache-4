25|$|The <b>social</b> <b>model</b> of {{disability}} suggests disability {{is caused by}} the way society is organised, rather than by a person’s impairment.

This independent reading and understanding of other parts happen as the definitions of <b>social</b> <b>modeling</b> are fragmented in every interdependent part. With fragmentation, the iStar model can be elaborated from the composition of these interdependent, understandable, and manageable parts.|$|R
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century, the dissenting feminist voices had little to no social influence. There was little sign of change in the {{political}} or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women's movement. Collective concerns began to coalesce {{by the end of the}} century, paralleling the emergence of a stiffer <b>social</b> <b>model</b> and code of conduct that Marion Reid described as confining and repressive for women. While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and worry, and fueled opposing views.|$|E

The start time, earlier than that of the TF1 debate, was chosen to avoid continuing well past midnight. Three themes were addressed: employment, the French <b>social</b> <b>model,</b> and the protection of the French. The final part of the debate concerned the exercise of power and moralization of public officials. Each of the 11 candidates invited had {{a minute and a half}} to answer each question, and other candidates were permitted to challenge their answers. This was the first ever debate including all first-round candidates; A total of 6.3 million people representing an audience share of 32% viewed the debate; BFM TV alone claimed 5.5 million viewers, equivalent to 28% audience share – an all-time record for the channel.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, the {{narrative}} surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media's focus on stereotyped portrayals {{of the heroic}} and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities, rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor Alan Toy noted [...] "Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement. But a lot of disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven't done something extraordinary. They may be bankers or factory workers– proof enough of their usefulness to society. Do {{we have to be}} 'supercrips' in order to be valid? And if we're not super, are we invalid?" [...] The media's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the <b>social</b> <b>model</b> of disability, where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.|$|E

40|$|In the Agent-oriented {{software}} engineering (AOSE) community, {{it is now}} widely recognised that interaction {{is perhaps the most}} important single characteristic of complex software systems. Recently, the focus of AOSE research has shifted towards <b>social</b> (or organisational) <b>modelling,</b> which allows interaction to be modelled with higher-level constructs like organisational structures and social policies. However, a gap remains between the <b>social</b> <b>models</b> proposed in AOSE methodologies and the increasing number of sophisticated agent interaction frameworks outside AOSE, such as those based on auctions, commitments, and dialogue games. Hence, <b>social</b> <b>models</b> in AOSE methodologies need to have more "hooks" to enable integration with rich domain-specific agent interaction frameworks. Towards closer integration between <b>social</b> <b>modelling</b> in AOSE and other agent interaction frameworks, we extend the ROADMAP methodology and provide a framework for enhancing the analysis of interaction requirements through goal-oriented analysis and <b>social</b> <b>modelling.</b> More precisely, goal models provide the purpose of interaction, while <b>social</b> <b>models</b> provide the <b>social</b> dependencies and policies that govern interaction. We show how the resulting requirements specification, complemented by protocol descriptions, can inform the design of the system's interaction model. The resulting approach bridges the gap described above by linking high-level social concepts to low-level, domain-specific design decisions about interaction...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "anti-cure perspective" [...] {{endorsed}} by the movement is a view that autism is not a disorder, but a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome. Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be validated, supported and appreciated rather than shunned, discriminated against or eliminated. They believe the quirks and uniqueness of autistic individuals should be tolerated as the differences of any minority group should be tolerated and that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing left-handedness. The ARM {{is a part of}} the larger disability rights movement, and as such acknowledges the <b>social</b> <b>model</b> of disability.

The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine which of the three factors was the strongest predictor of vigorous physical activity among adolescents, and whether perceived subjective norms and <b>social</b> <b>modeling</b> moderated the relationship between intrinsic motivation and vigorous physical activity. 294 adolescents (158 boys, 136 girls, Mage = 13. 7, SD= 0. 7) completed a questionnaire. Regression analyses indicated that intrinsic motivation was the strongest predictor of adolescents’ vigorous physical activity. Perceived subjective norms were only partially able to predict adolescents’ vigorous physical activity. <b>Social</b> <b>modeling</b> was not a significant predictor of vigorous physical activity. Perceived subjective norms and <b>social</b> <b>modeling</b> did not moderate the relation between intrinsic motivation and vigorous physical activity. Therefore it can be concluded that intrinsic motivation is the strongest predictor of adolescents’ vigorous physical activity.
