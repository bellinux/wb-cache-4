500|$|According to helium conservationists like Nobel laureate {{physicist}} Robert Coleman Richardson, {{writing in}} 2010, {{the free market}} price of helium has contributed to [...] "wasteful" [...] usage (e.g. for helium balloons). Prices in the 2000s had been lowered by {{the decision of the}} U.S. Congress to sell off the country's large helium stockpile by 2015. According to Richardson, the price needed to be multiplied by 20 to eliminate the excessive wasting of helium. In their book, the Future of helium as a natural resource (Routledge, 2012), Nuttall, Clarke & Glowacki (2012) also proposed to create an International Helium Agency (IHA) to build a <b>sustainable</b> <b>market</b> for this precious commodity.|$|E
2500|$|David Lett, from Eyrie Vineyards, {{planted the}} first American Pinot gris vines in Oregon in 1965. Hoping to {{increase}} sales, Lett started to graft Riesling vines to Pinot gris in 1979. The grape originally had difficulties finding a <b>sustainable</b> <b>market</b> until Lett began marketing the wine to salmon traders {{as a good}} match to the fish. The wine's popularity still only increased slightly until the mid-1990s when well capitalized larger producers entered the picture with enough volume to warrant expensive marketing campaigns. In 1991, King Estate Winery was founded with a mission to produce enough high quality Oregon Pinot gris to develop a sustainable national market for the wine; they are credited with bringing the Pinot gris grape varietal into national consciousness in the U.S. Today they are the world's leading producer of premium Pinot gris and farm the world's largest contiguous organic vineyard which contains over [...] of Pinot gris grapes.|$|E

40|$|In this article, three {{different}} conceptions of <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> are discussed and compared. These different conceptions {{are referred to}} as social, green, and critical <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing.</b> Social <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> follows the logic of demand-driven marketing management and places the responsibility for sustainable development outside the firm. Green <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> aims for a reform toward proactive marketing management within existing institutional structures and places responsibility for sustainable development within the firm. Critical <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> aims for a reassessment of the assumptions of the existing market systems that prevent transformation to a <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> system and places responsibility for sustainable development in the institutional environment. It is noticed that the literature on <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> fails to address the role of <b>marketing</b> education in <b>sustainable</b> development.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{sustainability}} initiatives is increasing by both consumers and organizations (Gittell, et al. 2013). It changes the way businesses are operating and communicating, hence the interest for <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> has increased. <b>Sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> {{should not only}} be about initiatives to appear more environmental friendly or socially conscious, but rather about a more substantive and meaningful levels of commitments (ibid). Alongside these practical ideas of <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing,</b> consumers’ requirements for sustainability have sometimes {{been used as a}} strategy to create sustainable communication, although companies are lacking initiatives of sustainability. The idea of marketing as a strategy to create desire and needless spending along with sustainability goals has been criticized as being in direct contradictories (Meller & Magaš 2014, Pettie 2001, Pettie & Belz 2010). Thus, the problematics compose of the discussed oxymoron between sustainability and marketing together with the difference between sustainable communication and communicating sustainability.   This qualitative study has been done with a starting position from the idea of addressing how <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> is practiced, why it is practiced and how the future outlook of the concept is perceived from a company perspective. The chosen theories for this study compose mainly of basic marketing theories and models with a sustainability adaption. A qualitative study addressing this issue from a company perspective has not been discovered in previous researches, which resulted in the idea of highlighting different companies’ opinions and practices of <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing.</b> The findings have discovered the usage of <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> today and potentially in the future, together with reasons for why it is practiced.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the learning gaps in sustainability education {{with a purpose}} of postulating pedagogical practices for integrating sustainability education into international marketing curricula. Using a content analysis and an online survey, we examined views on <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> practices of international business firms, among 60 undergraduates enrolled in a course of international marketing. The content analysis produced three thematic categories; (1) sustainability from reductionists’ perspective, (2) <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> practices bring nothing but good for businesses, (3) unpredictable future for <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> practices. The survey revealed that 67 % of the undergraduates are reasonably aware {{of the notion of}} sustainability and 37 % consider the mass media as the most significant information source of sustainability. However, compared to other sources, university lectures (21 %) are perceived as a more significant information source of sustainability. More importantly, the majority (81 %) of them believe that the university courses can largely contribute to sustainability education. In regards to the motives of <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> practices, the undergraduates perceived that environmental motives (51 %) or financial motives (6 %) drive the practices. Despite the reasonable level of awareness of sustainability among the undergraduates, we found three learning gaps in sustainability education. The undergraduates found it difficult in (1) viewing the social function of international business firms from a holistic point of view, (2) critically assessing <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> practices, and (3) articulating futuristic views on <b>sustainable</b> <b>marketing</b> practices. Addressing the learning gaps, we recommend a series of pedagogical practices that help redesigning international marketing curricula in order to integrate sustainability education...|$|R
