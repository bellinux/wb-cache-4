40|$|Inroduction: The {{treatments}} of excluded bile duct leakage after hepatectomy {{are not easy}} and various strategies have been reported, such as surgery, ethanol or fibrin glue injection, and portal vein embolization. Presentation of case: A 72 -year-old man with a surgical history of laparoscopic ileocecal resection for diverticular bleeding was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma. Right hemihepatectomy was performed, and computed tomography examination on postoperative day 9 showed abdominal fluid collection in the right subphrenic space. Percutaneous intra-abdominal fluid drainage was performed and it was diagnosed as bile leakage. After that it was diagnosed as excluded bile leakage from the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> by drip infusion cholangiographic-computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. To improve this clinical condition, we performed the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> excision on postoperative day 48. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged. Discussion: According to the postoperative examination, {{it appeared that the}} bile duct from the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> joined to the right main bile duct or the bile duct of the right posterior section. This bile duct anomaly was not detected preoperatively on imaging examination. It is most likely that the bile duct from the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> was cut when the hepatoduodenal ligament in the hepatic hilum was peeled. To prevent excluded bile leakage, the hepatoduodenal ligament should be carefully peeled and ligated instead of using energy devices. Conclusion: We consider that surgical treatment for postoperative excluded bile leakage is both a quick and reliable procedure in patients with acceptable liver function and anatomical subject...|$|E
30|$|The {{first case}} of a liver abscess because of {{gastrointestinal}} perforation by migration of a foreign body was reported in 1898 [3, 4]. A fishbone is the most frequent cause, accounting for approximately 40 % of cases [3]. Chong et al. [5] reviewed the literature for cases of liver abscess secondary to foreign body penetration. They searched the PubMed database for English literature from 1955 to 2013 using the keywords “liver abscess,” “hepatic abscess,” and “foreign body.” Eighty-eight patients were reported in the literature. The left lobe of the liver was the most frequent site of foreign body migration (65.9 %) because of the anatomical proximity to the stomach. On the other hand, liver abscesses in the right lobe of the liver mainly occurred by migration of the foreign body (29.5 % of cases) from the ascending colon. Bilobar involvement occurred in 4.5 % of cases [5]. Liver abscess in the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> is extremely rare, and {{to the best of}} our knowledge, this is the first report of liver abscess by foreign body penetration in the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> of the liver. Moreover, in the current case, there were no signs of foreign body penetration, such as purulent ascites or adhesion in the bursa omentalis, from the stomach or duodenum. Generally, when a foreign body penetrates the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, the omentum and other organs seal the perforated gastrointestinal serosa. Therefore, more than half of the cases of viscus perforation required more than 2  weeks to develop symptoms of viscus perforation [6]. In the current case, the mechanism by which the hepatic abscess was caused by a foreign body in the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> of the liver was unclear. We suspect that the foreign body migrated to the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> of the liver through the hepatoduodenal ligament because there were no ascites or intra-abdominal abscess around the bursa omentalis.|$|E

40|$|Although {{reports of}} {{hypoplasia}} {{or absence of}} the liver of left lobe are not few, descriptions of the intrahepatic vessels are rare but valuable for discussion of the pathogenesis. The present report demonstrates {{a case of the}} left surgical lobe hypoplasia that is characterized by 1) the scar-like lobe with few parenchymal tissue and dilated bile ducts, 2) no <b>Spiegel’s</b> <b>lobe</b> with the portal vein stuck to the inferior vena cava, 3) unusual configurations of the right hepatic vein and the 8 th segmental portal vein branch, 4) the hepatic groove on S 8, and 5) the trifurcation pattern of the portal vein primary division. According to the macroscopic and histological observations, we hypothesized that the secondary abnormal peritoneal fusion occurred in utero and/or during the postnatal growth, and that it involved the left portal vein and other adjacent structures, resulting in severe atrophy of the left surgical lobe...|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{complete}} extended right hepatectomy or trisectionectomy for a bismuth type IV hilar {{bile duct}} carcinoma, we propose {{the application of}} Belghiti's liver hanging maneuver (LHM) using a small nasogastric tube. This small nasogastric tube {{was placed in the}} cut plane: the top of the tube was placed between the hepatic veins. The tube was placed along the border between the left lateral sector and <b>Spiegel's</b> caudate <b>lobe</b> and the bottom of the tube was placed at {{the left side of the}} umbilical Glissonian pedicle. Hepatic parenchyma was transected using a vascular sealing device. Hepatic transection was always targeted to the tube and, eventually, a cut line of left hepatic ducts remained. We report the case of a 76 -year-old female and an 83 -year-old female with widely extended hilar bile duct carcinomas showing Bismuth type IV. Applying the modified LHM for extended right hepatectomy, the cut planes were easily and adequately obtained in patients with hilar bile duct carcinoma...|$|R
30|$|A 69 -year-old male patient visited our {{hospital}} {{because of a}} continuous low-grade fever and right back pain since 2  weeks. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of his abdomen revealed a mass with ring enhancement (35 [*]×[*] 30  mm) in the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> {{as well as a}} needle-like foreign body. Because conservative treatment by fasting and administration of antibiotics was unsuccessful, the patient underwent emergency laparotomy for removal of the foreign body and drainage of the liver abscess. The patient made a satisfactory postoperative recovery without complications and was discharged on the eighth postoperative day. The foreign body was composed of both protein and calcium phosphate and was histologically diagnosed as matured bone. We herein report successful surgical treatment of a patient with a liver abscess in the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> caused by foreign body penetration.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Leiomyosarcomas of {{vascular}} origin {{are particularly}} rare tumors occurring {{mainly in the}} inferior vena cava (IVC). They are malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor. Case Presentation. A 65 -year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 [*]mm in diameter, between the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images, with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma and performed a laparotomy. On the basis of surgical findings, we extirpated the tumor by performing a wedge resection of {{the wall of the}} IVC and suturing the primary IVC wall. Pathological findings led to a further diagnosis of the tumor as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. Thirty-seven months after the operation, multiple liver and lung metastases were detected, and the patient died from multiple organic failures. Conclusion. We experienced a rare case of a leiomyosarcoma of IVC mimicking hepatic tumor...|$|E
30|$|Unintentional {{ingestion}} {{of a foreign}} body is not uncommon. Almost all ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract uneventfully [1]. Obstruction or perforation by ingested foreign bodies are observed in less than 1 % of cases, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be helpful for the diagnosis of penetration of the upper gastrointestinal tract by a foreign body [2]. Development of a liver abscess resulting from penetration of a foreign body is rare [3]. We report a case of successful surgical treatment of a liver abscess in the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> caused by foreign body penetration.|$|E
30|$|Therapeutic {{methods for}} {{isolated}} bile leakage {{can be divided}} into surgical and non-surgical methods. Surgical treatment was adapted to intractable bile leakage which was not treated by non-surgical management. Fukuhisa et al. reported the successful treatment of a case by surgical treatment of the isolated bile leakage from the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> after right hemihepatectomy [12]. They suggested that surgical treatment with liver resection for postoperative isolated bile leakage was both a quick and reliable procedure for patients with acceptable liver function and anatomical subject [12]. Fistulojejunostomy was one of the therapeutic methods reported [13], but a detailed report is unavailable. In this patient, isolated bile leakage was diagnosed using DIC-CT and cholangiography, with the drainage tube or endoscopic method. It was considered that it was not cured by drainage alone. Anterior resection after partial hepatectomy was not technically easy, and the patient was not hoped. Fistulojejunostomy to the leaked bile duct was difficult because the sutured space was transformed into a slit shape. Furthermore, this operation was thought to be difficult for a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis because treatments such as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation for the recurrence of HCC are contraindication because treatment with transarterial chemoembolization and radiofrequent ablation becomes high risk of the liver abscess [14].|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{caudate lobe}} is a {{distinct}} liver lobe and surgical resection requires expertise and precise anatomic knowledge. Left-sided approach was described for resection of small tumors originated in the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe</b> but now the procedure has been performed even for tumors more than five centimeters. The {{aim of this study}} is to present three cases of tumor of caudate lobe underwent isolated lobectomy by left-sided approach. Presentation of case: Three patients with metastasis of colorectal cancer, carcinoma hepatocellular and metastasis of neuroendocrine tumor underwent resection. After modified Makuuchi incision, early control of short hepatic e short portal veins before hepatectomy was performed. The operative time was 200, 270 and 230  min respectively. No blood transfusion was used and no postoperative complications were observed. The length of stay was 7, 11 and 5  days respectively. Discussion: Some approaches have been described to access and resect tumors of the caudate lobe, including the left-sided approach, right-sided approach, combined left- and right-sided approach and the anterior transhepatic approach. For liver resection in patients with malignant disease, parenchymal preservation is important in order to avoid postoperative liver failure or due to the risk of second hepatectomy. In these patients isolated caudate lobectomy is a safe option. Conclusion: Isolated caudate lobectomy is a feasible procedure. Left-sided approach can be preformed even for tumors larger than 5  cm...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{caudate lobe}} {{of the liver}} {{is divided into three}} subsegments based on the portal blood supply: the <b>Spiegel</b> <b>lobe,</b> the paracaval portion (S 1 r), and the caudate process. An {{isolated}} paracaval (S 1 r) subsegmentectomy is indicated for a small hepatocellular carcinoma localized within S 1 r. Because this challenging procedure has not been described, we report the details of successful surgical technique. Methods The portal pedicle isolation technique provides easy access to the S 1 r portal pedicle. A tape is passed along the midline of the anterior surface of the vena cava and its lower end is passed through the caudate parenchyma dorsoventrally to establish a landmark for the left border of S 1 r. A liver-splitting anterior approach is used to open the interlobar plane widely to the precaval tape. As exposing the vena cava and the root of the right hepatic vein, parenchymal dissection is advanced to the right and then, upward. Results The procedure was performed successfully in a 51 -year-old man with hepatitis B who had a 2 -cm hepatocellular carcinoma in S 1 r. Blood loss was 645 ml. Conclusions An isolated paracaval subsegmentectomy of the caudate lobe can be performed successfully, although it is likely to remain an uncommonly used procedure. Figure 1 is misse...|$|E
