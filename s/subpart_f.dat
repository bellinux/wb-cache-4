Under the United States' Internal Revenue Code <b>Subpart</b> <b>F,</b> payments between related Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs), or from American companies to related CFCs, may be [...] "treated as <b>Subpart</b> <b>F</b> income" [...] (subject to current taxation {{as if they were}} profits {{in the hands of the}} ultimate American owner of the corporate structure), in an effort to limit the ability of American citizens and corporations to defer US tax on the income of foreign corporations they control. However, payments between an American-owned foreign entity which is taxed as a corporation, and a foreign subsidiary of that entity which itself has elected to be treated as a disregarded entity, are not treated as <b>Subpart</b> <b>F</b> income. This arrangement may be used to shift income between the two non-American jurisdictions and avoid local taxes in one or the other, e.g. through thin capitalization. Another category of US taxpayers who benefit from check-the-box regulations consists of US flow-through entities (S corporations and partnerships) with foreign subsidiaries. If the foreign subsidiary is treated as a corporation, the taxes it pays to the foreign government do not create a foreign tax credit for the US owner under Section 902. However, with a check-the-box election to be treated as a disregarded entity, the foreign taxes are treated as having been directly imposed on the US owner, thus giving rise to the tax credit.|$|E

This is avoided by organizing the second Irish company as a fully owned subsidiary of the first Irish company resident in the tax haven, and then making an entity classification election for the second Irish company to be disregarded as a separate entity from its owner, the first Irish company. The payments between the two Irish companies are then ignored for American tax purposes.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, rules {{provides}} that U.S. shareholders of a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) must include their shares of income or investment of E&P by the CFC in U.S. property. U.S. shareholders are U.S. persons owning 10% or more (after {{the application of}} complex attribution of ownership rules) of a foreign corporation. Such persons may include individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, estates, and other juridical persons. A CFC is a foreign corporation more than 50% owned by U.S. shareholders. This income includes several categories of portable income, including most investment income, certain resale income, and certain services income. Certain exceptions apply, including the exclusion from <b>Subpart</b> <b>F</b> income of CFC income subject to an effective foreign tax rate of 90% {{or more of the}} top U.S. tax rate.|$|E
5000|$|The tax law of many countries, {{including}} the United States, does not tax a shareholder of a corporation on the corporation's income until the income is distributed as a dividend. Prior to U.S. CFC rules, {{it was common}} for publicly traded companies in the United States to form foreign subsidiaries in tax havens and shift [...] "portable" [...] income to those subsidiaries. Income shifted included investment income (interest and dividends) and passive income (rents and royalties), as well as sales and services income involving related parties (see transfer pricing). U.S. tax on this income was avoided until the tax haven country paid a dividend to the shareholding company. This dividend could be avoided indefinitely by loaning the earnings to the shareholder without actually declaring a dividend. The CFC rules of <b>Subpart</b> <b>F</b> were intended to cause current taxation to the shareholder where income was of a sort that could be artificially shifted or was {{made available to the}} shareholder. At the same time, such rules were intended not to interfere with active business income or transactions with unrelated parties.|$|E

40|$|On 29 December 2000, the U. S. Treasury Department {{released}} its long-awaited study of <b>Subpart</b> <b>F,</b> entitled “The Deferral of Income Earned through U. S.

40|$|The {{debate about}} whether to abolish {{deferral}} or to adopt territoriality {{has been going on}} ever since the Kennedy Administration first proposed ending deferral in 1961. The problem is that neither side has factual support for their argument about whether the U. S. tax system, including <b>Subpart</b> <b>F,</b> as currently enacted or with any of the proposed reforms, in fact negatively impacts the tax burden of US-based MNEs. Even the concept of competitiveness itself is unclear. Despite numerous claims, there has been no rigorous attempt that we are aware of to determine whether MNEs based in our major trading partners in fact have a tax advantage or disadvantage because of <b>Subpart</b> <b>F</b> or other rules. In October, 2011, the American Tax Policy Institute sponsored a conference organized by Reuven Avi-Yonah and Jane Gravelle on 2 ̆ 7 International Taxation and Competitiveness 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|Over {{a finite}} horizon each {{national}} subsidiary of a multi-national company can be forecast to be a net source or sink of funds. Each of these subsidiaries in each year {{is considered to}} be the node of a network; funds flow along the directed arcs connecting the nodes. Liquid assets carried by the subsidiaries on the arcs between time periods earn interest minus adjustments for expected devaluations. In each time period a flow of funds between each pair of subsidiaries can be achieved by manipulating transfer prices and managerial fees, by making short term intersubsidiary loans, and by paying dividends up the intersubsidiary ownership tree. The costs and constraints on these flows are outlined with particular attention given to the IRC <b>Subpart</b> <b>F</b> regulations of the U. S. 1962 Revenue Act, and to the 1968 regulations of the Office of Foreign Direct Investment. It is shown to be extremely important that subsidiary dollar accounts count toward the compensating balance requirements of a U. S. bank, and it is also shown that there are benefits to a global tax consolidation under <b>Subpart</b> <b>F.</b> The problem can be solved as a generalized network (weighted distribution problem). This avoids the need to guess at the average discount rate {{if it is to be}} solved as an ordinary network. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of {{corporate}} taxation on U. S. capital invested abroad and on tax planning practices. The econometric analysis first indicates that investment is strongly influenced by average tax rates, with a magnified impact particularly for low-tax rates, implying that the attractiveness of low-tax countries is not weakened by anti-deferral rules and cross-crediting limitations. Further explorations suggest that firms report higher profit, higher <b>Subpart</b> <b>F</b> income, and {{are less likely to}} repatriate dividends when they are located in low-tax jurisdictions. Finally, when the role of effective transfer pricing regulations is estimated, it appears that low degrees of law enforcement are associated with higher income shifting. ...|$|E
