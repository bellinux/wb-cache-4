50|$|On {{account of}} their radically reduced armor, some paleontologists have {{suggested}} that the Ptyctodontida were not actually placoderms, but actual holocephalians, some primitive group of elasmobranch fish, or even were the ancestors of the holocephalians, including the chimaeras. Thorough anatomical examinations of whole fossil specimens reveal that the profound similarities between these two groups are actually very superficial. The major differences between them were that holocephalians have <b>shagreen</b> on their <b>skin</b> and ptyctodontids did not, that the armored plates and scales of holocephalians are made of dentine, and the armored plates and scales of ptyctodontids were made of bone, the anatomy of the craniums of holocephalians is more similar to sharks, and that of ptyctodontids were more similar to those of other placoderms, and, most importantly, the holocephalians have true teeth, while the ptyctodonts had beak-like tooth-plates.|$|R
5000|$|Despite of eclectic and spreading, novel “Shagreen Skin” {{is a very}} {{constructive}} composition: {{the whole}} structure is described by one line of successive decreasing of life. <...> It pleases how carelessly the story is written, everywhere feels how Balzac hurried up..., {{under the pressure of}} his creditors the writer made his violent activity so intensive that caught a nervous exhaustion. The heavy weight of nervous exhausting, heavy activity, and also pressure of the creditors are still in his works and creates vain stress. In general, I decided that the ballet under <b>Shagreen</b> <b>Skin</b> should be a holiday of joyful decreasing of life.

40|$|A {{new species}} of Bryophryne from the humid montane forest of the Department of Cusco, Peru, is described. Specimens were {{collected}} at 2795 – 2850 m a. s. l. in the Área de Conservación Privada Ukumari Llaqta, Quispillomayo valley, {{in the province of}} Paucartambo. The new species is readily distinguished from all other species of Bryophryne by having green coloration on dorsum, and blue flecks on flanks and ventral parts. Specimens are characterized by lacking a distinct tympanic annulus, tympanic membrane, and dentigerous processes of vomers, and by having dorsal <b>skin</b> <b>shagreen,</b> discontinuous dorsolateral folds, skin tuberculate on flanks, skin areolate on ventral surfaces of the body, and fingers and toes without lateral fringes or webbing. The new species has a snout–vent length of 14. 2 – 16. 9 mm in three males and 22. 2 – 22. 6 mm in two females, and is smaller than all other congeneric species except for B. abramalagae. Generic allocation is supported by low genetic distances of the 16 S mitochondrial gene and morphological similarity with other species of Bryophryne, and geographic distribution. Bryophryne phuyuhampatu sp. n. is only known from the type locality, a cloud forest along the Quispillomayo River in the upper Nusiniscato watershed...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new species}} of Pristimantis from the humid sub-montane forest of the Región Cusco in Peru. Pristimantis pluvialis sp. n. was collected in the Kosñipata and Entoro valleys at elevations from 740 to 1110 m a. s. l., near the borders of Manu National Park and within the Huachiperi Haramba Queros Conservation Concession. The new species can be distinguished from {{other members of the}} genus Pristimantis by its rostral tubercle, smooth dorsal skin, and by its advertisement call. Pristimantis lacrimosus and P. waoranii superficially most resemble the new species, but P. pluvialis sp. n. differs from both species by having a rostral tubercle (absent in P. waoranii and variable in P. lacrimosus) and larger size, from P. lacrimosus by its call emitted at a lower frequency, and from P. waoranii for its dorsal coloration with dark markings. Two other species have partially overlapping distributions and resemble the new species, P. mendax and P. olivaceus, but they produce advertisement calls with much higher dominant frequencies than the advertisement call of the new species. Furthermore, P. mendax differs from the new species by lacking a rostral tubercle and by having a sigmoid inner tarsal fold, whereas P. olivaceus differs by being smaller and by having dorsal <b>skin</b> <b>shagreen</b> with scattered tubercles. The new species has snout-vent length of 21. 8 – 26. 9 mm in males (n = 12) and 28. 8 mm in a single female...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new species}} of Gastrotheca from the Río Abiseo National Park of the San Martín Region in the Andes of northern Peru. The description {{is based on a}} series of 29 specimens that were collected between 1989 and 1999 at two localities (Pampa del Cuy, Alpamachay) in the wet puna of the national park between 3380 and 3470 m elevation. The new species has a snout–vent length of 46. 9 – 57. 7 mm (53. 5 ± 3. 0) in females (n =  21), and 35. 3 – 43. 8 mm (41. 6 ± 3. 2) in males (n  =  6). In life, the dorsum is pale grayish brown with reddish-brown paravertebral markings or blotches, and the venter is cream. Females have a single median, dorsal brood pouch and release tadpoles in water as indicated by two specimens found at Gosner Stages 45 and 46. The new species is distinguished from all of its congeners by having the dorsum with two reddish-brown paravertebral markings bearing prominent longitudinal ridges and warts. The new species differs from the two other species of Gastrotheca (G. ossilaginis, G. phalarosa) known from the Region San Martín by lacking integumentary-cranial co-ossification (present in G. ossilaginis), by having the skin on dorsum with prominent longitudinal ridges and warts (dorsal <b>skin</b> <b>shagreen</b> in G. ossilaginis), and in producing tadpoles (direct development in G. ossilaginis). The new species most closely resembles G. phalarosa. Both species produce tadpoles, have fingers and toes with lateral fringes, and Finger I larger than Finger II. Gastrotheca phelloderma differs from G. phalarosa by having the skin on dorsum with prominent longitudinal ridges (absent in G. phalarosa), the venter granular (smooth except granular on posterior part of belly and proximal posteroventral surfaces of thighs in G. phalarosa), a palmar tubercle (absent in G. phalarosa), a long and distinct inner tarsal fold (barely evident on distal fifth of tarsus in G. phalarosa), and the throat and belly grayish tan (black with white spots in G. phalarosa) ...|$|R
