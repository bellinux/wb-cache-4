With macrographic examination, SEM {{observation}} and fracture quantitative analysis technology, the fracture fractography of a <b>spray</b> <b>tube</b> {{with both the}} mechanical stress and the thermal stress in a boiler desuperheater of a power plant was interpreted, and the failure mode and the cause were researched.

The alternating bending stress and thermal stress were main factors of the fracture failure. The shallow surface thermal fatigue cracks in tube inner wall were induced by thermal stress.

40|$|Although {{electrostatic}} spray {{technology has}} enjoyed phenomenal success in automotive painting and agricultural spray applications, many spray applications remain untouched by this technology due to technical and/or time constraint. One such high potential spray application {{is in the}} medical coating industry with strict requirements of high precision, high consistency, and considerable drug cost. Focusing further on medical stent coating, existing ultrasonic spray nozzles are wasteful and time-consuming in addition to added complexity of reclaiming the drug overspray. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that pressurized air and/or ultrasonic vibration which introduces much turbulence to spray droplets in flight. To further improve transfer efficiency and consistency of existing spray nozzles, SSCo has developed a new airless Electrostatic spray nozzle which relies solely on electrostatic charges accumulated in a unique <b>spray</b> <b>tube</b> design to gently applied coating material in a consistent and efficient manner. An added benefit is to have steady spray at flow rates ranging from 3 cc/hr- 10 cc/hr. An analysis of various <b>spray</b> <b>tube</b> tips is performed, each having different geometry making full use of Gauss' Law to concentrate electrostatic charge and maximizing electric field strength at terminal spray point. A particular point of interest will be how the droplet shape, distribution, and size are affected by the different designs. Lab testing indicated that the larger sharp edge areas where electric charge accumulates, the smaller the droplet size while droplet shape sphericity stays relatively constant. This is concluded from results showing that a spray tip with a circumferential corner area produces smaller droplets than that with 4 points. Furthermore, a spray tip with 4 points produces smaller droplets than that with 1 point. The results lead us to believe that some spray tip designs sufficiently charge the droplets reaching Rayleigh limit more efficiently...|$|E

40|$|The high ozone {{depletion}} {{and global warming}} potentials of fluorocarbon refrigerants have resulted in prohibitions and restrictions in many markets. Hydrocarbon refrigerants have low environmental impacts and are successfully used in domestic refrigerators and car air conditioners but replacing fluorocarbons in centrifugal chillers for air conditioning applications is unknown. Hydrocarbon replacements need a heat transfer correlation for refrigerant in flooded evaporators and predictions for operating conditions, capacity and performance. Safety precautions for large quantities of hydrocarbon refrigerants are needed and control of overpressure in plantrooms requires accurate prediction. Reliable correlations exist for forced convection in a single phase flow, condensation outside tubes and evaporation off <b>sprayed</b> <b>tubes.</b> For flooded evaporators this thesis proposes a new correlation for forced convection boiling of any refrigerant. An enhancement factor is combined with a modified Chen coefficient using recent pool boiling and forced convection correlations outside tubes. This correlates within typically a factor of two to known boiling literature measurements for CFC- 113, CFC- 11, HCFC- 123, HFC- 134 a and HC- 601. The operating conditions, capacity and performance of replacement hydrocarbons in centrifugal chillers were predicted using fluorocarbon performance as a model. With the new heat transfer correlation hydrocarbon predictions for flooded evaporators were made. For any fluorocarbon refrigerant there exists a replacement mixture of hydrocarbons which with a rotor speed increase about 40 % gives the same cooling capacity in the same centrifugal chiller under the same operating conditions. For example replacing HCFC- 123 in a flooded evaporator with HC- 601 / 602 [90. 4 / 9. 6] and increasing the rotor speed by 43 % will increase the coefficient of performance by 4. 5 % at the same cooling capacity. The maximum plantroom overpressure considered was from leakage and ignition of a uniform air/refrigerant mixture with maximum laminar burning velocity. Flow was modelled using a turbulence viscosity due to Launder and Spalding and turbulent deflagration using a reaction progress variable after Zimont. These partial differential equations were solved approximately for two and three dimensional geometries using finite volume methods from the Fluent program suite. Simple overpressure predictions from maximum flame area approximations agreed with Fluent results within 13. 7 % promising safe plantroom design without months of computer calculation...|$|R

It was determined that the Ni-Al coatings could be applied to a depth of two inches on the <b>tube</b> ends. When <b>sprayed</b> on flat coupons the coatings exhibited relatively high adhesion strength and microhardness. Polarization curves showed that the coating performance was variable.

Corrosion also occurred on the coated coupons tested in the volcanic pool. This may have been exacerbated by the difficulty in applying a uniform coating to the coupon edges. The Ni-Al coatings applied to the tubes had significant porosity and did not provide adequate corrosion protection. This is associated with the short standoff distance and is not a reflection of the normal quality of plasma sprayed coatings.

Those in the medical intensive care unit being endotracheal intubated and being able to clearly communicate with the caregivers were enrolled after providing their inform consent. We prescribed Xylocaine 10 % pump spray as frequently as demanded. Results: Nineteen patients were eligible for this study. The numerical rating scale of the throat pain before local Xylocaine spray were 8. 82 ± 0. 79, 7. 98 ± 0. 92, 7. 07 ± 0. 76, 6. 37 ± 0. 83 and 5. 47 ± 1. 23, sequentially, compared with after therapy results, which were 3. 84 ± 0. 86, 3. 57 ± 0. 74, 3. 06 ± 0. 70, 2. 61 ± 0. 77 and 1. 96 ± 0. 88 (p< 0. 01). The interval between Xylocaine demanded gradually increased with time after endotracheal tube intubation, and was also different between the daytime and the night-time on the first day of admission (p< 0. 001). Most of the patients suffered from throat pain due to endotracheal intubation, and they agreed their satisfaction was affected by the factors, the level of throat pain being controlled (correlation: 0. 89, p< 0. 01), and the caregivers’ attitude with regard to the pain control (correlation: 0. 46, p< 0. 05).

When {{the last bit}} of ice is melted, spray the vial with 70 % ethanol and {{transfer}} the contents of the vial into one 75 cm 2 flask (T- 75) containing 20 ml of MEF media. Place the MEFs in a 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, 86 % humidity incubator. Every frozen MEF preparation thaws a little differently. If on Day 1, the MEFs are only 50 % cconfluent, thaw another vial into your ongoing T- 75 MEF flask. It is important for the MEFs to be maintained at a relatively high density, or they will not continue to expand. ### Day 2 MEF passage 1 : Expand the MEFs as follows: The MEFs should be 90 % confluent (if they are not, feed them another day). Split as follows: Suction off old media, rinse flask x 1 with 10 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Add 5 ml Trypsin/EDTA media (0. 05 %/ 0. 02 %) to the flask and incubate for 5 to 10 minutes at 37 oC. After 10 minutes, the cells should be detached from the bottom. Now add 10 ml MEF media to this flask, pipette up and down to disaggregate the cells into a single cell suspension, and add the entire contents of the flask into one 150 cm 2 flask (T- 150). Add 20 ml MEF media to the flask, so that the final volume is 30 to 35 ml. Incubate at 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, 86 % humidity. ### Day 4 You should now have 1 T- 150 flask of confluent MEF cells. MEF passage 2 : Mitotically inactivate cells as follows: Rinse with PBS (10 ml) and harvest with 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA for 10 minutes at 37 oC as above. Add 10 ml of MEF media and pipette cells up and down several times. Take 10 ml of cells from the flask and put in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Refeed the T- 150 ml flask with 25 ml of fresh media. To the 50 ml centrifuge tube containing the MEF cells, add 5 ml MEF media (bringing the final volume up to 15 ml). Take this tube to the blood bank and irradiate (3000 rads). These inactivated MEFs will be used to make two 10 cm dishes of MEF feeder layers for your ES cell thaw on Sunday. Using a hemacytometer, count the MEFs before adding them to your dish. A good monolayer will be formed if you add approximately 1 x 106 MEF cells to each 10 cm dish. Plate inactivated MEFs in 2 - 10 cm dishes having a final concentration of 1 x 106 Mef's per dish and a final volume of 12. 0 ml. We prepare 1 extra 10 cm dish in case of contamination or poor monolayer. ### Sunday, Day 5 Thaw ES cells as follows: Suction the existing MEF media off one of the inactivated MEF 10 cm dishes. Refeed the dish with 12 ml ES media. Thaw one frozen vial of RW 4 cells (1 x 106 cells) in a 37 oC waterbath. When {{the last bit of}} ice has melted, <b>spray</b> the <b>tube</b> with 70 % ethanol and transfer the contents of the vial to the inactivated MEF dish. Rock the dish to evenly disperse the cells. Incubate overnight at 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, and 86 % humidity. The T- 150 flask of ongoing MEFs is ready to be expanded today. Rinse with PBS, add 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA, for 10 minutes, then add 10 ml of MEF media, and pipette up and down several times. Pipette 8 ml of these cells into a new T- 150 flask containing 25 mls of MEF media. Refeed the existing T- 150 with 25 ml MEF media to create 2 T- 150 's of expanding MEFs. ### Day 6 Feed the ES cells with 12 ml ES media. Approximately 60 % of the ES cells will form colonies in the dish. They are football shaped, shiny, and plump. You will need 4 x 10 cm dishes of irradiated MEFs for your electroporation on Day 7. You have 2 T- 150 's ongoing from which to make these 4 dishes. Follow the procedure for mitotically inactivating MEFs on Day 4. However, use both T- 150 s this time. Don't forget to refeed them, or you will not have MEFs {{for the end of the}} week. If the 2 T- 150 flasks of MEF cells are not confluent today, feed them, and then inactivate them on the morning of Day 7. If you inactivate your MEFs on Day 7, you must either give them 2 to 3 hours to attach before changing the MEF media to ES media or initially inactivate and plate them in ES media. ### Day 7 **Electroporation**: Use three of the 10 cm dishes of inactivated MEF cells prepared on Day 6. From each dish, remove the old media and add 10 ml of fresh ES media. Place these dishes back in the incubator. Next, take the 10 cm dish containing the MEFs and ES cells and remove the old media. Rinse the dish x 1 with PBS, then add 2 ml Trypsin/EDTA and incubate for 5 - 10 minutes at 37 oC. After 5 minutes, the cells will look like "bunches of grapes" under the inverted scope. Add 2 ml more Trypsin/EDTA to the dish, pipette up and down to break up the clumps and incubate for 3 more minutes. [You must have single cells for the electroporation. ] Look at the cells again under the inverted microscope. The MEFs are the larger cells, and the ES cells are small and shiny; most if not all should now be single cells. To the 10 cm dish add 7 ml ES media, pipette up and down, and transfer all the cells to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Pellet the cells by centrifuging gently (1000 RPM in a Sorvall tabletop) for 5 minutes at 10 oC. Take off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1. 0 ml ice cold 1 x Hebs (see Reagents, Transfection Buffer 1 X Hebs). Prepare a 5 ml tube of ES media for the cells after electroporation. Get out a sterile "flat pack" 1. 8 mm gap cuvette (BTX order # 485) and insert the cuvette between the safety stand contacts. Make sure there is a good contact between the cuvette and the safety stand contact. Having the safety stand connected to the rear of the unit using the cables supplied, turn on the power switch. Set electroporator (BTX 600 or equivalent) as follows: 500 V/Capacitance and resistance, 500 uF capacitance timing, 360 ohms R 8 Resistance timing, Charging voltage 185 V. Pipette the ES cells up and down with a 5 ml pipette and add to a microfuge tube containing the targeting construct DNA (40 ug of clean linear DNA in 1 X TE @ 1 ug/ul for each electroporation). Pipette cells and construct up and down with a pasteur pipette carefully. Slowly add the cells to the cuvette, taking care not to introduce any bubbles. Slide the cuvette into the electroporation chamber, dial the charging voltage to 185 V and push the pulse button. Wait until the charging is over, then push the reset button, dial down the voltage, and turn the power off. With a sterile pasteur pipette, take the electroporated cells out of the cuvette and place them into the 5. 0 ml of fresh ES media in a centrifuge tube (final vol. = 6 ml total). Take the three 10 cm dishes of inactivated MEFs (freshly fed with ES media) and add 2 ml of the transfected ES cells per dish. Label the dishes with the targeting construct's name and date. Rock the dishes slowly to evenly disperse cells. **Alternate Electroporation Procedure using Safety Chamber 630 A, BTX cuvette, 2 mm gap**: Prepare a 5. 2 ml. tube of ES media for cells after the electroporation. Prepare ES cells for electroporation as described in original text on Day 7, except add only 800 ul cold 1 X Hebs to your pelleted cells. Place a sterile BTX cuvette (2 mm gap) in a 630 A Safety Chamber and attach the electrodes securely to the Electro Cell Manipulator 600. Pipette the cells up and down with a 5 ml pipette, and add 800 ul of cells to a microfuge tube containing the targeting construct (40 ug of clean linear DNA in 1 X TE @ 1 ug/ul for each electroporation). Mix the cells and DNA with a 200 - 1000 ul barrier tip trying not to create bubbles. Add 400 ul of the cell/DNA mixture to a BTX cuvette. Set Electroporator as follows: 500 Vcapacitance and resistance, 500 uF capacitance timing, 360 ohms R 8 Resistance timing, Charging Voltage 160 V. When capacitors are charged hit the pulse button. When charging is complete, with the pipette provided, harvest the electroporated cells and place them into 5. 2 ml of fresh ES media. Repeat the electroporation with the other 400 ul cells/construct in a new BTX cuvette. Add this to the 5. 2 ml yielding a final volume of 6. 0 ml. Take the 3 - 10 cm. dishes containing inactivated MEFs freshly fed with ES media and add 2 ml. of the electroporated cells per dish. Rock the dishes slowly to evenly disperse the cells. Label the dishes and place in the incubator. ### Day 9 Feed the transfected ES cells with Selection Media, 13 ml dish. The clones should now be fairly large. ### Day 10 Feed transfected ES cells with Selection Media as above. You should begin to see some selection in your dishes. Dead cells should be suspended in the media above your ES clones. Using your ongoing T- 150 MEF flasks (2 flasks), you will prepare five, 24 well dishes for the isolation and expansion of your individual clones on Day 13. MEF passage 3 : split ongoing MEFs (90 % confluent) and irradiate as follows: Take off the old media and rinse x 1 with PBS (10 ml). Add 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA and incubate 5 to 10 minutes at 37 oC. Add 10 ml MEF media, and pipette up and down. Transfer all of the MEF cells to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Repeat with the other flask of MEFs. If you wish to keep an ongoing flask of MEF cells at this time, you may leave 5 ml. of cells in one of the flasks and refeed this flask. However after preparing your 24 well dishes today you will not need MEFs again for the completion of this electroporation. Take the MEF cells in the centrifuge tube and irradiate the cells as before (3000 rads) at the blood bank. Using a hemacytometer, count your MEFs. You will need 7 x 10 e 4 MEFs per well. To attain this, you should add 9 x 10 e 6 irradiated cells in a final volume of 125 ml. MEF media into a sterile plastic bottle. Now you will have enough cells to prepare 5 - 24 well dishes. Mix the cells gently so that they are evenly dispersed and add 1. 0 ml of irradiated MEFs to each well of a 24 well dish in a total of 5 dishes. Incubate at 37 oC until Day 13. ### Day 11 / 12 Feed transfected ES cells with 12 ml of Selection Media (G 418). This may be done on Day 11 or Day 12., but does not have to be done both days.|$|R
