40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} location-specific capital-the ties that bind people to a place-in which ex-partners of two-sex couples move after separation or divorce. The study uses data from {{the first and second}} waves of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (N = 361) to test hypotheses on the impact of individual homeownership, prior residential history, and the nearby presence of parents on whether a <b>separated</b> <b>person</b> moves. Who owned the home and whether someone's ex-partner moved in upon partnership formation are of prime importance to whether a <b>separated</b> <b>person</b> moves. Furthermore, separated persons whose parents live nearby and those who {{have a long history of}} living in the same municipality have a smaller probability of moving than other separated persons...|$|E
30|$|The {{literature}} has established socioeconomic and demographic {{factors associated with}} food insecurity in the United States. Among the groups {{of people that are}} found more likely to be food insecure are: households headed by an African American person, Hispanic households, a non-married person, a divorced or <b>separated</b> <b>person,</b> a renter, younger persons, and less educated persons. Moreover, households with children {{are more likely to be}} food insecure than households without children. In previous studies, the aforementioned characteristics are generally positively associated with food insecurity (Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper 2011). However, these authors also recognize that an important factor is the amount of money available to a household, which in some cases is included in estimation methods as income normalized by the poverty line. Similarly, Hager et al. (2010) reports that in the United States, black or Hispanic households with single parents, young children, and incomes below the federal poverty line were identified to have increased risk for food insecurity in 2008.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the reach of}} arguments for saving the greater number without interpersonal aggregation, and argues that interpersonal aggregation is useful to encompass the proper respect due to each <b>separate</b> <b>person.</b> I first give a precise definition of interpersonal aggregation, which many non-utilitarians try to avoid. Then, I show that consequentialism and Scanlon can justify {{the case for the}} greater number without interpersonal aggregation. However, I propose the Aggregation Approach, which justifies the case for the greater number in some cases and the case for tossing a fair coin in other cases. I conclude that interpersonal aggregation does not disrespect the <b>separate</b> <b>person.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of Christians who agree with creeds, the most significant area of departure is the rejection by the LDS Church of certain parts of ecumenical creeds such as the Nicene Creed, which defines the predominant view of the Christian God as a Trinity of three <b>separate</b> <b>persons</b> in [...] "one essence". LDS Church theology includes the belief in a [...] "Godhead" [...] composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three <b>separate</b> <b>Persons</b> who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead. Other significant differences relate to the church's acceptance of additional scripture, doctrine, and practices beyond what {{is found in the}} Catholic, Protestant, or Eastern Orthodox versions of the Bible.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} that {{the construction and}} use of avatars in games such as Second Life and World of Warcraft have for our understanding of personal identity. It asks whether the avatar can meaningfully be experienced as a <b>separate</b> <b>person,</b> existing in parallel to the flesh and blood player. A rehearsal of Cartesian and Lockean accounts of personal identity constructs {{an understanding of the}} self that is challenged by the experience of online play. It will be argued that playful engagement in virtual worlds invites the participant to reflect upon the human being as embodied and social; qualities of which are marginalised by Descartes and Locke. The strangeness of this experience of virtual worlds confronts the player with a challenge to construct a coherent narrative of online life, of which treating the avatar as a <b>separate</b> <b>person</b> is a coherent option. This opens up the virtual world as an important space within which personal identity is explored, but one with complex implications for our understanding of what counts as reasonable and ethical behaviour...|$|R
