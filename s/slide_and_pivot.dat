40|$|We {{make two}} main {{contributions}} in this thesis. First, we present {{our approach to}} robot manipulation, which emphasizes the benefits of making contact with the world across all the surfaces of a manipulator with whole-arm tactile sensing and compliant actuation at the joints. In contrast, many current approaches to mobile manipulation assume most contact is {{a failure of the}} system, restrict contact to only occur at well modeled end effectors, and use stiff, precise control to avoid contact. We develop a controller that enables robots with whole-arm tactile sensing and compliant actuation at the joints to reach to locations in high clutter while regulating contact forces. We assume that low contact forces are benign and our controller does not place any penalty on contact forces below a threshold. Our controller only requires haptic sensing, handles multiple contacts {{across the surface of the}} manipulator, and does not need an explicit model of the environment prior to contact. It uses model predictive control with a time horizon of length one, and a linear quasi-static mechanical model that it constructs at each time step. We show that our controller enables both a real and simulated robots to reach goal locations in high clutter with low contact forces. While doing so, the robots bend, compress, <b>slide,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pivot</b> around objects. To enable experiments on real robots, we also developed an inexpensive, flexible, and stretchable tactile sensor and covered large surfaces of two robot arms with these sensors. With an informal experiment, we show that our controller and sensor have the potential to enable robots to manipulate in close proximity to, and in contact with humans while keeping the contact forces low. Second, we present an approach to give robots common sense about everyday forces in the form of probabilistic data-driven object-centric models of haptic interactions. These models can be shared by different robots for improved manipulation performance. We use pulling open doors, an important task for service robots, as an example to demonstrate our approach. Specifically, we capture and model the statistics of forces while pulling open doors and drawers. Using a portable custom force and motion capture system, we create a database of forces as human operators pull open doors and drawers in six homes and one office. We then build data-driven models of the expected forces while opening a mechanism, given knowledge of either its class (e. g, refrigerator) or the mechanism identity (e. g, a particular cabinet in Advait's kitchen). We demonstrate that these models can enable robots to detect anomalous conditions such as a locked door, or collisions between the door and the environment faster and with lower excess force applied to the door compared to methods that do not use a database of forces.

5000|$|In 1936, Rudolph Bannow (1897-1962) {{conceived}} {{of a major}} improvement to the milling machine. His company commenced manufacturing a new knee-and-column vertical mill in 1938. This was the Bridgeport milling machine, often called a ram-type or turret-type mill because its head has sliding-ram and rotating-turret mounting. The machine became so popular that many other manufacturers created copies and variants. Furthermore, its name came to connote any such variant. The Bridgeport offered enduring advantages over previous models. It was small enough, light enough, and affordable {{enough to be a}} practical acquisition for even the smallest machine shop businesses, yet it was also smartly designed, versatile, well-built, and rigid. Its various directions of <b>sliding</b> <b>and</b> <b>pivoting</b> movement allowed the head to approach the work from any angle. The Bridgeport's design became the dominant form for manual milling machines used by several generations of small- and medium-enterprise machinists. By the 1980s an estimated quarter-million Bridgeport milling machines had been built, and they (and their clones) are still being produced today.|$|R

It is available at: [URL] 10. 1177 / 0278364912471865. Clutter creates challenges for robot manipulation, including a lack of non-contact trajectories and reduced visibility for line-of-sight sensors. We demonstrate that robots can use whole-arm tactile sensing to perceive clutter and maneuver within it, while keeping contact forces low. We first present our approach to manipulation, which emphasizes the benefits of making contact across the entire manipulator and assumes the manipulator has low-stiffness actuation and tactile sensing across its entire surface. We then present a novel controller that exploits these assumptions. The controller only requires haptic sensing, handles multiple contacts, and does not need an explicit model of the environment prior to contact. It uses model predictive control with a time horizon of length one and a linear quasi-static mechanical model. In our experiments, the controller enabled a real robot and a simulated robot to reach goal locations in a variety of environments, including artificial foliage, a cinder block, and randomly generated clutter, while keeping contact forces low. While reaching, the robots performed maneuvers that included bending objects, compressing objects, <b>sliding</b> objects, <b>and</b> <b>pivoting</b> around objects. In simulation, whole-arm tactile sensing also outperformed per-link force–torque sensing in moderate clutter, with the relative benefits increasing with the amount of clutter...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates {{state-of-the-art}} contact models at {{predicting the}} motions and forces involved in simple in-hand robotic manipulations. In particular {{it focuses on}} three primitive actions [...] linear <b>sliding,</b> <b>pivoting,</b> <b>and</b> rolling [...] that involve contacts between a gripper, a rigid object, and their environment. The evaluation is done through thousands of controlled experiments designed to capture the motion of object and gripper, and all contact forces and torques at 250 Hz. We demonstrate that a contact modeling approach based on Coulomb's friction law and maximum energy principle is effective at reasoning about interaction to first order, but limited for making accurate predictions. We attribute the major limitations to 1) the non-uniqueness of force resolution inherent to grasps with multiple hard contacts of complex geometries, 2) unmodeled dynamics due to contact compliance, and 3) unmodeled geometries dueto manufacturing defects.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{manipulation}} of a grasped object by pushing it against its environment. Relying on precise arm motions and detailed models of frictional contact, prehensile pushing enables dexterous manipulation with simple manipulators, such as those currently available in industrial settings, and those likely affordable by service and field robots. This paper {{is concerned with the}} mechanics of the forceful interaction between a gripper, a grasped object, and its environment. In particular, we describe the quasi-dynamic motion of an object held by a set of point, line, or planar rigid frictional contacts and forced by an external pusher (the environment). Our model predicts the force required by the external pusher to “break” the equilibrium of the grasp and estimates the instantaneous motion of the object in the grasp. It also captures interesting behaviors such as the constraining effect of line or planar contacts and the guiding effect of the pusher’s motion on the objects’s motion. We evaluate the algorithm with three primitive prehensile pushing actions—straight <b>sliding,</b> <b>pivoting,</b> <b>and</b> rolling—with the potential to combine into a broader in-hand manipulation capability.
