5|$|Once {{she was in}} a {{respected}} and secure position as first consort and mother to Ieyasu's heir, Lady Saigō used her influence and wealth for charitable purposes. A devout Buddhist, she donated money to temples in Suruga Province, where she resided as the consort of Ieyasu, first in Hamamatsu Castle and later in Sunpu Castle. As <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> near-sighted, she also established a charitable organization that assisted visually impaired women with no other means of support. Lady Saigō died at a fairly young age, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Although murder was suspected, no culprit was identified.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E

The gun-brig , the hired armed brig Ann, and cutter Florence {{were also in}} company but fell behind in the chase.

Of the 67 men aboard, 19 being away in prizes, seven of the Americans promptly joined the crew of Cruizer.|$|E
25|$|The queen now placed Saw Hnit, a 14-year-old son of Kyawswa, on the throne. Though he {{was still}} styled as king, the inexperienced Saw Hnit was {{for all intents and}} {{purposes}} a puppet of the three brothers, his regents. She had to accept the arrangement although she never fully acknowledged the presence of a new dynasty in Upper Burma. Nevertheless, she remained the symbol of the old dynasty, and her imprimatur was still much sought after. According to Hmannan, Thihathu asked her to anoint him as the rightful successor of Pagan at his coronation ceremony at Pinya. The queen flat out refused; in fact, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> insulting in her reply. It was only after Thihathu sent another humble letter that she relented. On 7 February 1313, at Thihathu's coronation ceremony, the dowager queen presented to Thihathu a golden belt and a golden tray, which had been handed down in the royal family since the time of King Anawrahta.|$|E
25|$|While many British {{passenger}} ships {{had been}} called into duty for the war effort, Lusitania remained on her traditional route between Liverpool and New York. She departed Pier 54 in New York on 1 May 1915 on her return trip to Liverpool with 1,959 people aboard. In addition to her crew of 694, she carried 1,265 passengers, mostly British nationals {{as well as a}} large number of Canadians, along with 128 Americans. Her First Class accommodations, for which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> famous on the North Atlantic Run, were booked at just over half capacity at 290. Second Class was severely overbooked with 601 passengers, far exceeding the maximum capacity of 460 which had been designated to Second Class. While a large number of small children and infants helped reduce the squeeze into the limited number of two and four berth cabins, the situation was ultimately rectified by allowing some Second Class passengers to occupy empty First Class cabins. In Third Class, the situation was considered to be the norm for an eastbound crossing, with only 373 travelling in accommodations designed for 1,186.|$|E

25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanying’s family. Compared with her little sisters, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The only way to do was to get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance to get an education.|$|E

500|$|Novel-writing was {{a suspect}} {{occupation}} {{for women in the}} early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that [...] "if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince". Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, Emma was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.|$|E
