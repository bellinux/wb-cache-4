30|$|In 2008, a law {{change was}} {{introduced}} to require self-support of all resident partners requesting entry for existing or new spouses, including Norwegian citizens above 23  years (who had previously been exempted). The requirement was justified {{as a way to}} reduce welfare dependency and to fight forced marriages, reasoning that it would promote economic integration by incentivizing young immigrants to become self-supporting, and further that a <b>self-supporting</b> <b>person</b> would be better equipped to resist family pressure about whom to marry (Eggebø, 2010, p. 302 – 3; Jordheim, 2008). As Helga Eggebø notes, it is ironic that while the new income requirement was intended to incentivize more resident spouses to be independent of their families’ support, the same rule - by not including incoming spouses’ income in the tally of the required amount – assumed the latter to be dependent on their already resident partners (Eggebø, 2010, p. 304). At the same time, she notes, the new rules further amplified this potential dependence by raising from three to five years the time an imported spouse must remain in a marriage to retain the residence permit (Eggebø, 2013).|$|E

40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{performed}} in order to evaluate {{the usefulness of the}} Swiss Toxicological Information Center (STIC) in detecting cases of occupational illness. One hundred and fifty-two symptomatic occupational exposure cases were collected, comprising 3. 2 % of 4830 cases reported to the STIC between 1 April 1992 and 15 August 1992. In 114 cases a follow-up could be performed by a structured telephone interview. On the basis of these interview data it was estimated that 72 % of the cases in small enterprises were reported to the STIC without additional notification to an occupational insurance fund. By contrast, only 28 % of the occupational illness cases that occurred in companies employing more than 15 workers were not reported to an occupational insurance fund. This discrepancy could have resulted in part from the fact that occupational insurance in Switzerland is mandatory only for salaried employees, not for <b>self-supporting</b> <b>persons.</b> It is concluded that the monitoring of the occurrence of occupational illnesses in small-scale enterprises must be improved. Poison control centers could {{play a major role in}} this respect...|$|R
