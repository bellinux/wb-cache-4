5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} <b>senior</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead writer for Mass Effect. Despite {{of the fact that}} each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E

500|$|... "Local Ad" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. [...] Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode a favorable review, saying [...] "This episode {{is a prime}} example of how The Office is able to do broad comedy while at the same time treating its characters as real people." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting of Rainn Wilson as a depressed Dwight, as well as the story's twist. [...] Fickett stated that [...] "A great twist here is that we think we're watching Michael pilot a sinking ship as usual, but in fact – the ad is quite good. There's some clever stuff in there, albeit some of it not exactly professional in its production, but Michael doesn't do such a bad job." [...] Like Fickett, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a favorable review. [...] Fenno said that [...] "The premise of this episode, 'Local Ad' — the Scranton staffers shoot a commercial — was strong, and allowed almost every ensemble member to shine." [...] Fenno also praised the acting work of Ed Helms as Andy, as well as Steve Carell as Michael. [...] Oscar Dahl, a <b>Senior</b> <b>Writer</b> <b>for</b> BuddyTV, praised the episode, but also felt that the episode's thirty-minute length created a stark contrast to the previous four episodes' hour-long run, saying [...] "tonight's episode felt short. [...] Really short." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Survivor Man" [...] {{received}} a 4.9/7 in the Nielsen ratings, meaning that 4.9 {{percent of households}} were tuned in {{at any given moment}} and seven percent of all televisions in use were tuned in to the program. The episode was watched by 8.29 million viewers and achieved a 4.3/10 in the ages 18–49 demographic. Travis Fickett of IGN stated that [...] "Overall, this isn't a terrific episode, but holds up the show's usual standard. Steve Carell is hilarious as usual. Watching him attempt to make shelter and clothing out of his suit over the span of only a few hours is great fun." [...] Fickett also stated that {{a good portion of the}} humor in the episode came from in-jokes that required previous knowledge of the series, specifically pointing out the parallel comparison between Michael and Jim's lives. [...] Like Fickett, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode's comparison between Michael and Jim. [...] Fenno also went on to praise other points of the episode, stating she also enjoyed the overall episode for its [...] "just outdoorsiness with Michael and Dwight, and infighting among the rest of the staff." [...] Oscar Dahl, a <b>Senior</b> <b>Writer</b> <b>for</b> BuddyTV, stated that [...] "What seems like a one and done episode without much character work at first turns into much more by the end." [...] Dahl went on to praise the episode, stating that it was [...] "lighter" [...] in comparison to Carell's previous episode [...] "Casino Night".|$|E
