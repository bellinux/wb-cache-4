2500|$|As Ornea himself {{recalled}} {{later in}} life, his {{confrontation with the}} biography and work of Dobrogeanu-Gherea inaugurated his progressive break with Marxism. He credited his extensive research {{into the history of}} socialism with a [...] "purification" [...] of his convictions, leading him to conclude that Leninism and the October Revolution were indefensible. As a consequence, he grew interested in Reformism, Austromarxism and the non-Leninist Orthodox Marxism of Karl Kautsky, and, according to his colleague Ion Ianoși, had sympathy for the Right Opposition of Nikolai Bukharin (whom he reportedly viewed as a precursor of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev). In the end, Ornea {{came to the conclusion that}} the Eastern Bloc regimes could not be transformed by democratic reforms, and renounced all forms of Marxism. This change reflected gradually on his work. Rizescu and literary critic Daniel Cristea-Enache both noted that, progressively, Ornea replaced the Marxist <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> with the classical liberalism of Eugen Lovinescu and Ștefan Zeletin. Answering on this issue, Ornea himself stated: [...] "when reediting one of my works of synthesis on the various currents of thought , I only had to perform very few modifications, a sure sign that my research method and the thought (vision) guiding me was not at all played out." [...] Despite such ideological choices, Ianoși contends that Ornea was being secretly used by Romanian Communist Party leaders with literary or scientific ambitions, who would employ him as a ghostwriter, signing with their name works on which he had largely contributed his skills and his specialized knowledge.|$|E
60|$|I attach special {{importance}} to the view of geometry which I have just set forth, because without it I should {{have been unable to}} formulate the theory of relativity. Without it the following reflection would have been impossible:--In a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> rotating relatively to an inert system, the laws of disposition of rigid bodies do not correspond to the rules of Euclidean geometry on account of the Lorentz contraction; thus if we admit non-inert systems we must abandon Euclidean geometry. The decisive step in the transition to general co-variant equations would certainly not have been taken if the above interpretation had not served as a stepping-stone. If we deny the relation between the body of axiomatic Euclidean geometry and the practically-rigid body of reality, we readily arrive at the following view, which was entertained by that acute and profound thinker, H. Poincare:--Euclidean geometry is distinguished above all other imaginable axiomatic geometries by its simplicity. Now since axiomatic geometry by itself contains no assertions as to the reality which can be experienced, but can do so only in combination with physical laws, it should be possible and reasonable--whatever may be the nature of reality--to retain Euclidean geometry. For if contradictions between theory and experience manifest themselves, we should rather decide to change physical laws than to change axiomatic Euclidean geometry. If we deny the relation between the practically-rigid body and geometry, we shall indeed not easily free ourselves from the convention that Euclidean geometry is to be retained as the simplest. Why is the equivalence of the practically-rigid body and the body of geometry--which suggests itself so readily--denied by Poincare and other investigators? Simply because under closer inspection the real solid bodies in nature are not rigid, because their geometrical behaviour, that is, their possibilities of relative disposition, depend upon temperature, external forces, etc. Thus the original, immediate relation between geometry and physical reality appears destroyed, and we feel impelled toward the following more general view, which characterizes Poincare's standpoint. Geometry (G) predicates nothing about the relations of real things, but only geometry together with the purport (P) of physical laws can do so. Using symbols, we may say that only the sum of (G) + (P) is subject to the control of experience. Thus (G) may be chosen arbitrarily, and also parts of (P); all these laws are conventions. All that is necessary to avoid contradictions is to choose the remainder of (P) so that (G) and the whole of (P) are together in accord with experience. Envisaged in this way, axiomatic geometry and the part of natural law which has been given a conventional status appear as epistemologically equivalent.|$|E

40|$|Ancient Hebrew is {{compared}} with two languages that use a conjunction or pre-verbal particle to signal {{new developments in}} a narrative. This comparison shows that Hebrew makes a significantly greater number <b>of</b> full NP <b>references</b> to active participants than the other languages. Typically, languages refer to active participants with NPs when the subject remains the same in two contexts: to {{mark the beginning of}} a narrative unit and to highlight a speech or action.

This paper argues that the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>references</b> to active participants in Ancient Hebrew is influenced by the presence in the story of new developments. Many languages employ intersentential conjunctions to indicate whether or not the material concerned represents a new development.

Instead, full NP references to active participants help to identify those events that represent new developments in a narrative.
