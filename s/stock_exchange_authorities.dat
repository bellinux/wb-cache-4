30|$|In {{a typical}} event study, the {{observed}} Abnormal Returns {{are related to}} transactions performed by insiders based either on reports they submit to <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>authorities</b> or, {{in the case of}} prosecuted cases, based on identified transactions (Meulbroek [1992]). These Abnormal Returns then are accumulated to form Cumulated Abnormal Returns (CAR). However, {{in the context of the}} present observation process, this is not possible. As a result, it is assumed that all significant Abnormal Returns within the Pre-Event Window might imply insider trading activity. In order to define significance a Cumulated Abnormal Return benchmark (Fig. 3) is used. Lisa Meulbroek ([1992], p. 1677) reports an average of 3.06  % of Abnormal Returns on Insider Trading days but with values ranging from 0.07  % in restructuring announcement cases to 8.15  % in hostile tender offer cases. In the presented example, it was set to 1.5  %. Consequently, Cumulated Abnormal Returns are the aggregated Abnormal Returns over the selected Cumulated Abnormal Return benchmark.|$|E
40|$|Exchange: {{the first}} few years 1991 - 1996 Abstract. This paper reports a test of the {{changing}} pricing efficiency of the first stage of development of the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE). Emerging stock markets are unlikely to be fully information-efficient, partly due to institutional rigidities which restrict information flows to the market and partly for lack of experienced market participants to rapidly impound new information into security prices. Tests for runs and autocorrelation were conducted for the 1991 - 1996 trading history of the WSE and also to segmented sub-periods during which different institutional arrangements applied. As the number of trading days per week increased, the general level of efficiency, although low, steadily improved (except for the “bubble ” period of 1993 - 1994). Inefficiencies persist in some stocks, possibly explained by opportunities to conduct off-market, out-of-hours transactions in specific stocks, and the <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>authorities</b> ’ continuing power to suspend trading...|$|E

The study aims at doing research work with long-memory data set, as it provides a superior strategy, as well as gives real picture with short-memory data set.
