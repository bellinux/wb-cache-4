25|$|The social status, {{duties and}} legal {{powers of the}} {{headmaster}} depended on the society in which he conducted his school. In a small school, {{he might be the}} only or the chief teacher. In a university-sized school he would be the director of the school, its museum, and its library. Plato as scholiarch owned his school, the land, {{and the rest of the}} property. He had to sponsor the resident foreigners, representing them at law. Aristotle at the foundation of the Lyceum was not, as a resident foreigner, allowed to own property in Athens. He rented the buildings and organized the students into an administration. <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> voluntary consultant who conducted discussions at various times and places, some public, others contributed by interested persons.The scholiarchs of Alexandria were royal officers hired by the king.|$|E
60|$|In like manner, a true belief {{cannot be}} called {{knowledge}} {{when it is}} deduced by a fallacious process of reasoning, even if the premisses from which it is deduced are true. If I know that all Greeks are men and that <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man, and I infer that <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Greek, I cannot be said to know that <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Greek, because, although my premisses and my conclusion are true, the conclusion does not follow from the premisses.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> freethinker; for he disbelieved {{the gods}} of his country, and the common creeds about them, and {{declared}} his dislike when he heard men attribute [...] "repentance, anger, and other passions to the gods, and talk of wars and battles in heaven, and of the gods getting women with child," [...] and such like fabulous and blasphemous stones. I pick out these particulars, {{because they are the}} very same with what the priests have in their Bibles, where repentance and anger are attributed to God; where it is said, there was [...] "war in heaven;" [...] and that [...] "the Virgin Mary was with child by the Holy Ghost," [...] whom the priests call God; all fabulous and blasphemous stories. Now, I affirm Socrates to have been a true Christian. You will ask, perhaps, how that can be, since he lived three or four hundred years before Christ? I answer, with Justin Martyr, that Christ is nothing else but reason, and I hope you do not think Socrates lived before reason. Now, this true Christian Socrates never made notions, speculations, or mysteries, any part of his religion, but demonstrated all men to be fools who troubled themselves with enquiries into heavenly things. Lastly, 'tis plain that <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> freethinker, because he was calumniated for an atheist, as freethinkers generally are, only because he was an enemy to all speculations and inquiries into heavenly things. For I argue thus, that if I never trouble myself to think whether there be a God or no, and forbid others to do it, I am a freethinker, but not an atheist.|$|E

60|$|Thus the Athenians had {{a general}} notion that <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> corrupter {{of youth and}} a despiser of the gods, for in truth some forms of worship, like the orgies of Bacchus, and other still worse rites which had been brought in from the East, were such that no good man could approve them. One of the thirty tyrants had at one time been a pupil of his, and this added to the ill-feeling against him; and while Xenophon was still away in Asia, in the year 399, the philosopher was brought to trial on three points, namely, {{that he did not}} believe in the gods of Athens, that he brought in new gods, and that he misled young men; and for this his accusers demanded that he should be put to death.|$|E
60|$|But let {{us first}} be {{sure what the}} words mean. There is no use talking about a word till we have got at its meaning.

Socrates of old used to tell the young Athenians that the ground of all sound knowledge was--to understand the true meaning of the words which were in their mouths all day long; and <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> wiser man than we shall ever see. So, instead of beginning an oration in praise of heroism, I shall ask my readers to think with me what heroism is.|$|E

With one foot raised up and resting on the cross-bar of his seat he never stopped swinging the other which was well clear of the stone floor. He had unbuttoned the top of his waistcoat and he wore his tall hat very far at the back of his head. He had a full unwrinkled face and such clear-shining eyes that his grey beard looked quite false on him, stuck on for a disguise. You said just now he resembled Socrates--didn't you?

2500|$|It {{is clear}} that nothing would prevent a {{singular}} term occurring in a syllogism—so {{long as it was}} always in the subject position—however, such a syllogism, even if valid, <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> categorical syllogism. An example <b>is</b> <b>Socrates</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man, all men <b>are</b> mortal, therefore <b>Socrates</b> <b>is</b> mortal. Intuitively this is as valid as All Greeks are men, all men are mortal therefore all Greeks are mortals. To argue that its validity {{can be explained by the}} theory of syllogism would require that we show that <b>Socrates</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man <b>is</b> the equivalent of a categorical proposition. [...] It can <b>be</b> argued <b>Socrates</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man <b>is</b> equivalent to All that <b>are</b> identical to <b>Socrates</b> <b>are</b> men, so our non-categorical syllogism can be justified by use of the equivalence above and then citing BARBARA.|$|R

6000|$|Secondly, We may {{answer that}} Christianity itself has very much {{suffered}} by being blended up with Gentile philosophy. The Platonic system, first taken into religion, {{was thought to}} have given matter for some early heresies in the Church. When disputes began to arise, the Peripatetic forms were introduced by Scotus as best fitted for controversy. And however this may now have become necessary, it was surely {{the author of a}} litigious vein, which has since occasioned very pernicious consequences, stopped the progress of Christianity, and been a great promoter of vice; verifying that sentence given by St. James, and mentioned before, [...] "Where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work." [...] This was the fatal stop to the Grecians in their progress both of arts and arms; their wise men were divided under several sects, and their governments under several commonwealths, all in opposition to each other, which engaged them in eternal quarrels among themselves, while they should have been armed against the common enemy. And I wish we had no other examples, from the like causes, less foreign or ancient than that. Diogenes said <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> madman; the disciples of Zeno and Epicurus, nay, of Plato and Aristotle, were engaged in fierce disputes about the most insignificant trifles. And if this be the present language and practice among us Christians no wonder that Christianity does not still produce the same effects which it did at first, when it was received and embraced in its utmost purity and perfection; for such wisdom as this cannot [...] "descend from above," [...] but must be [...] "earthly, sensual, devilish, full of confusion and every evil work," [...] whereas, [...] "the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy." [...] This is the true heavenly wisdom, which Christianity only can boast of, and which the greatest of the heathen wise men could never arrive at.|$|E
60|$|Nor did Mark's provident care limit {{itself to}} this one {{instance}} of forethought. Socrates was sent in the dinghy to the prairie, over which the hogs had now been rooting for fully two months, mixing together mud and sea-weed, somewhat loosely it is true, but very extensively; and there he scattered Timothy-seed in tolerable profusion. <b>Socrates</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long-headed, {{as well as a}} long-footed fellow, and he brought back from this expedition a report that was of material importance to the future husbandry of the colonists. According to his statement, this large deposit of mud and sea-weed lay on a peninsula, that might be barricaded against the inroads of hogs, cattle, &c., by a fence of some two or three rods in length. This was a very favourable circumstance, where wood was to be imported for many years to come, if not for ever; though the black had brought the seeds of certain timbers, from the Peak, and put them into the ground in a hundred places on the Reef, where the depth of deposit, and other circumstances, seemed favourable to their growth. As for the Prairie, could it be made to grow grasses, it would be a treasure to the colony, inasmuch as its extent reached fully to a thousand acres. The examination of Socrates was flattering in other respects. The mud was already dry, and the deposit of salt did riot seem to be very great; little water having been left there after the eruption, or lifting of the earth's crust. The rains had done much, and certain coarse, natural grasses, were beginning to show themselves {{in various parts of the}} field. As the hogs would not be likely to root over the same spot twice, it was not proposed to exclude them, but they were permitted to range over the field at pleasure, in the hope that they would add to its fertility by mixing the materials for soil. In such a climate, every change of a vegetable character was extremely rapid, and now that no one thought of abandoning the settlement, it was very desirable to obtain the different benefits of civilization as soon as possible.|$|E
