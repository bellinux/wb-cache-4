This is then warmed up to roughly [...] in the gas heaters and then blown into the tanks to {{displace}} the [...] "inert gas". This continues until all the CO2 {{is removed from the}} tanks. Initially, the IG (inert gas) is vented to atmosphere. Once the hydrocarbon content reaches 5% (lower flammability range of methane) the inert gas is redirected to shore via a pipeline and manifold connection by the HD (high duty) compressors. The shore terminal then burns this vapour to avoid the dangers of having large amounts of hydrocarbons around which may explode.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} efficient means of conditioning Ponderosa Pine to relieve c a se hardening stresses. Comparative tests revealed that conditioning time could be reduced from 24 hours to 4 hours by cooling lumber prior to conditioning, by injecting water into the steam <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> and by increasing the quantity of steam. Cooling lumber and injecting water are two effective means of achieving saturated conditions at high t e m p era t u r e s during conditioning. Both methods result in savings of steam as well as time. The relationship of steam quantity to the effect on stress relief reaches an economical proportion within the range of 80 to 100 lbs. /hr/M.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the most {{effective}} in a countermeasure for stress corrosion cracking in pipe and nozzle welds is by reducing the residual stress in the portion of the weld exposed to the corrosive environment. An irradiated laser stress improvement process (L-SIP) was introduced as a method to improve residual stress inside steel pipes and nozzles. L-SIP has been applied to the pressurizer nozzles in actual plant, Tsuruga unit 2 Japan, {{for the first time in}} the world. The nozzles to which this process was applied are the surge nozzle (September 2007), safety nozzles, relief nozzle and <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> nozzle (April 2010). L-SIP can be applied without inner surface cooling because the high power laser beam can generate the sufficient temperature difference without such cooling. Where necessary to achieve optimum temperarure difference, water cooling may also be applied at the inner surface.

Of these micro-organisms, erosion bacteria appeared to be most widespread, attacking wood cell walls independently {{as well as in}} combination with tunnelling bacteria and soft-rot fungi. Tunnelling bacteria attacked wood often with soft-rot fungi, and less commonly with erosion bacteria. Wood samples were taken from various locations in the cooling tower, including <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> support, panelling above the spray drift eliminators, and from spray drift elimination slats. Examination of these samples indicated that, among the micro-organisms which attacked the wood, erosion bacteria were most tolerant of oxygen-limiting conditions as bacterial erosion was the only type of decay present in wood constantly saturated with water.

Two doses of conidia (75 and 50 g/ha, being 3. 75 × 1012 and 2. 5 × 1012 conidia/ha, respectively) formulated in 2 litres (70 : 30, kerosene–peanut oil) were applied using a Berthoud ‘Micro Ulva’ to three groups of larvae of cotton bollworms positioned in three rows downwind of a single <b>spray</b> <b>line.</b> Both the distribution of the droplets and the effect of direct contact with spray droplets were quantified. The mean number of droplets decreased from 416 (± 60) droplets per cm 2 (line 1; 0. 4 m) to 45 (± 36) droplets per cm 2 (line 3; 5 m). To achieve 50 % mortality, > 10 and > 13 days were necessary for 75 and 50 g/ha, respectively. From day 15, the difference in mortality rates was significant between the two treatments.

As proven by previous researches the variability of the cotton plants height {{in the field is}} large enough to justify the application of Mepiquat at variable rate. The major advantages of it are: (i) yield increase; (ii) economy of the applied input; (iii) reducing the potential of environmental pollution. The main objective of this project was to develop a prototype device capable to accomplish the application of Mepiquat at variable rate in real time. This project used an equipment previously developed for automatic mapping of the cotton plants height based on ultrasound transducers. An electronic control device for ground sprayers was designed and constructed based on microcontroller PIC, using open source tools as Java, Linux operational system and IDE Netbeans. The device controls the pressure and flow in the <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> and uses Varitarget® nozzles due to its characteristics of linearity of flow and pressure. The calculation of the Mepiquat dosage to be applied is based on the obtained information of the plants heights and the map of previous application.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{range of}} Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, in the USA {{and the threat}} of chikungunya and dengue outbreaks vectored by this species have necessitated novel approaches to control this peridomestic mosquito. Conventional methods such as adulticiding provide temporary relief, but fail to manage this pest on a sustained basis. We explored the use of cold aerosol foggers and misting machines for area-wide applications of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (VectoBac WDG) as a larvicide targeting Aedes albopictus. During 2010 – 2013 we performed initially open field trials and then 19 operational area-wide applications in urban and suburban residential areas in northeastern USA to test three truck-mounted sprayers at two application rates. Area-wide applications of WDG in open field conditions at 400 and 800 g/ha killed on average 87 % of tested larvae. Once techniques were optimized in residential areas, applications with a Buffalo Turbine Mist Sprayer at a rate of 800 g/ha, the best combination, consistently provided over 90 % mortality. Importantly, there was no significant decrease in efficacy with distance from the <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> even in blocks of row homes with trees and bushes in the backyards.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} technique for measuring kiln emissions {{was developed and}} compared to emissions from commercial charges. A schematic of the kiln {{is shown in the}} Figure 1. The kiln box is approximately 4 ' by 4 ' by 4 '. It is indirectly heated by steam. Four dry-bulb thermocouples and two wet-bulb thermocouples are located on the entering-air side of the load. The dry-bulb thermocouples are spaced in a grid. The two wet-bulb thermocouples are under a single sock {{at the center of the}} entering-air side of the load. The airflow can be adjusted up to 1100 ft/min. A single 200 L/min MKS mass flow meter controls and primarily measures the amount of air entering the kiln. Additional flow devices (MKS 0 - 50 Umin flow meter and Dwyer 0 - 200 SCFH flow meter) can be used when high rates of venting are desired. A minimum of 10 Umin enters the kiln at all times, more than removed by the analyzer and methanol formaldehyde sampling train. Putting air into the kiln at a rate of 100 Umin (a typical vent rate) causes the pressure in the kiln be approximately 130 Pa above ambient on the high pressure side and 60 Pa on the low pressure side. Thus, any fugitive leakage should be out of the kiln. The steam <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> is disabled, so no water vapor is added to the kiln atmosphere. Temperature in the kiln is controlled by indirect steam heating. When the average of the four dry-bulb thermocouples is below setpoint, the steam pressure in the coil is increased.

40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} how a separate conditioning chamber can make progressive kilns more efficient. The 2 - zone progressive kilns have a decreasing {{wet bulb depression}} in the second zone, which leads to low moisture spread even without conditioning chamber. With a separate conditioning chamber the capacity can, however, be increased by shortening the drying time. This is possible since the conditioning phase {{can be adapted to}} get a good drying quality without tensions in the cross section of the board. If needed the conditioning chamber can also be used as to extend the drying time which is useful especially when the board dimensions in the kiln is changed. The conditioning face also reduces the moisture spread with 50 % compared to batches from chamber kilns with target moisture content is around 18 %. When the drying is performed in a level of wet bulb temperatures over 60 °C there is less problems with cracks on thicker boards because of the plastic behavior on the wood surface. Progressive kilns with conditioning face can therefore produce greater volumes then from separate chamber kilns with equal quality concerning slicing test gap and even moisture spread. The technical performance of the conditioning chamber was very god on the pilot kiln. The conditioning chamber opens one door on each side when the loading starts, which influence the climate. It was, however, not any problem to get a stable climate after loading/unloading a tray in the conditioning chamber throughout the experiments, but the <b>spray</b> <b>line</b> must be in perfect condition to reach the wet bulb temperature fast enough. Finally the control system to support the kiln operator in his daily work must be developed with more functions when adding a conditioning chamber to the progressive kiln. This system should give some guidance of how to adjust the climate in the conditioning chamber when changing board-dimensions to be able to achieve a good accuracy around the target moisture...|$|E
40|$|During the {{manufacture}} of wood composites, paper, {{and to a lesser}} extent, lumber, large amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as terpenes, formaldehyde, and methanol are emitted to air. Some of these compounds are hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The air pollutants produced in the forest products industry are difficult to manage because the concentrations are very low. Presently, regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs and RCOs) are commonly used for the destruction of VOCs and HAPs. RTOs consume large amounts of natural gas to heat air and moisture. The combustion of natural gas generates increased CO 2 and NOx, which have negative implications for global warming and air quality. The aforementioned problems are addressed by an absorption system containing a room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) as an absorbent. RTILs are salts, but are in liquid states at room temperature. RTILs, an emerging technology, are receiving much attention as replacements for organic solvents in industrial processes with significant cost and environmental benefits. Some of these processes include organic synthesis, extraction, and metal deposition. RTILs would be excellent absorbents for exhausts from wood products facilities because of their unique properties: no measurable vapor pressure, high solubility of wide range of organic compounds, thermal stability to 200 °C (almost 400 °F), and immisciblity with water. Room temperature ionic liquids were tested as possible absorbents. Four were imidizolium-based and were eight phosphonium-based. The imidizolium-based ionic liquids proved to be unstable at the conditions tested and in the presence of water. The phosphonium-based ionic liquids were stable. Most were good absorbents; however, cleaning the contaminates from the ionic liquids was problematic. This was overcome with a higher temperature (120 °C) than originally proposed and a very low pressure (1 kPa. Absorption trials were conducted with tetradecy(trihexyl) phosphonium dicyanamide as the RTIL. It was determined that it has good absorption properties for methanol and α-pinene, is thermally stable, and is relatively easy to synthesize. It has a density of 0. 89 g/mL at 20 °C and a molecular weight of 549. 9 g/mol. Trials were conducted with a small absorption system and a larger absorption system. Methanol, formaldehyde, and other HAPs were absorbed well, nearly 100 %. Acetaldehyde was difficult to capture. Total VOC capture, while satisfactory on methanol and α-pinene in a lab system, was less than expected in the field, 60 - 80 %. The inability to capture the broad spectrum of total organics is likely due to difficulties in cleaning them from the ionic liquid rather than the ability of the ionic liquid to absorb. It’s likely that a commercial system could be constructed to remove 90 to 100 % of the gas contaminates. Selecting the correct ionic liquid would be key to this. Absorption may not be the main selection criterion, but rather how easily the ionic liquid can be cleaned is very important. The ionic liquid absorption system might work very well in a system with a limited spectrum of pollutants, such as a paint <b>spray</b> <b>line,</b> where there are not very high molecular weight, non volatile, compounds in the exhaust...|$|E

It is concluded that composite SCL beams have high residual flexural capacity; spray-applied membrane can maintain its integrity under big cracks; although the ageing effect reduces the ductility ratio of composite SCL beams in the long term, the absolute residual flexural strength increases.

This is characterised by detailed ground investigation, risk assessments and the use of sophisticated numerical models to produce a robust, fully-engineered design. A tightly controlled risk management process during construction is implemented that relies on both predictions and observations to monitor and verify the works.

The article analyzes the methods of trenchless renovation for applying protective coatings: routing in the old pipeline of new pipes made of polymeric materials or polymeric sleeves, centrifugal spraying on the inner surface of pipelines’ inorganic and organic protective coatings. Special attention was paid to bag technology, providing the required strength properties at specific values of the modulus of elasticity and a number of external factors such as the depth of the existing pipe, the existence and magnitude of the horizon groundwater over it. Also attention is paid to the application technology of tape coatings ribbed profile on the inner surface of pipelines. This technology has a unique feature, which is the ability of recoverable pipeline functioning during its renovation by winding an endless belt and the formation of a new pipe. The tape coating winding is carried out by different types of spiral winding machines. The thickness of the protective coating layer forming the tube remains minimal. Inorganic cement-sand and organic coatings were considered as alternative options for repair of pipelines, which allow to localize the defects {{in the form of a}} fistula, minor cracks and other damages. However it is noted that a cement-sandy covering is inferior to organic, because it does not provide the strength characteristics of the pipeline system. The main advantage of the organic coating is mudding fistula of a large diameter, making a high wear-resisting pipe, ensuring a smooth surface. Then the protective coating almost merges with the old pipeline. The conclusion is made on the necessity of taking account of the potential for energy saving in case of various protective coatings and implemented trenchless technologies application...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of a spray-applied waterproofing membrane between the primary and secondary lining layers {{is important to the}} behaviour of a composite <b>sprayed</b> concrete <b>lined</b> (SCL) tunnel in soft ground. In order to confirm the feasibility of the composite shell lining concept, the structural adequacy of the concrete-membrane interfaces under the effects experienced in a typical tunnel needs to be investigated. This paper presents a series of laboratory tests on samples cut from composite sprayed concrete panels, to which uniaxial compression, direct tension and direct shear loadings are applied over both short and long-term timeframes under conditions of ambient atmospheric humidity. Test results show that the interfaces are capable of resisting significant compression, tension and shear in both short- and long-term. Failures under these actions should not occur in a typical shallow SCL tunnel, and a degree of composite action between primary and secondary layers should be expected. Influence of substrate roughness and membrane thickness on the measured interface properties has been quantified. Overall, this investigation confirms the existence of composite action for composite sprayed concrete linings in soft ground, and provides parameters based on test results for further research and design...|$|R

The elbow assemblies were found to contain multiple intergranular cracks in the weld heat-affected zones. The cracking was predominantly axial in orientation in the forged elbow and wedge components, whereas mixed axial and circumferential cracking was seen in the wrought piping pieces. In at least two instances, axial cracks completely penetrated the circumferential weld joining adjacent components. Based upon the observations made in the present study, the failures were attributed to intergranular stress corrosion cracking caused by the weld-induced sensitized microstructure and residual stresses present; dissolved oxygen in the reactor coolant apparently served as the corrosive species. The predominantly axial orientation of the cracks present in the forged components is believed to be related to the banded microstructure present in these components.

It then became {{an integral part of the}} site supervision workflow, being updated daily with data from the tunnel face. This dynamic model became a ‘live’ geological database of increasing accuracy with time, allowing for geological predictions for the forthcoming tunnel excavations. In parallel, the understanding of the complexity of the Lambeth Group geology was significantly improved, refining the location and characteristics of the multiple faults and the thickness and continuity of the high-risk sand lenses. This paper aims to describe how a BGS 3 D geological model was developed to be used in combination with tunnelling works for the first time, the benefits from its use and the lessons learned with respect to the geology of the Lambeth Group...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} was performed of radiological and toxicological consequences of a worst-case leak from a 2 -inch diameter flush connection in a pit over tank AY- 102. The unmitigated (without controls) flush <b>line</b> <b>spray</b> leak assumes that the blank connector and the removable plug in the pit cover block have been removed so that the maximum system flow is directed out of the open 2 -inch line vertically into the air above the pit. The mitigated (with controls) spray scenario assumes the removable plug is in place and the flow is directed against {{the underside of the}} pit cover block. The unmitigated scenario exceeded both onsite and offsite risk guidelines for an anticipated accident. For the mitigated case all consequences are well within guidelines and so no additional controls are needed beyond the existing control of having all pit covers and removable plugs in place during any waste transfer...|$|R
