An example of this is the claim that geological <b>strata</b> are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the <b>strata</b> they are in. However, in most cases <b>strata</b> are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other <b>strata</b> and by radiometric dating, and most <b>strata</b> were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stratum</b> corneum chymotryptic enzyme may be {{important}} in desquamation. It has also been suggested that other proteases, especially <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme, may be involved. <b>Stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme has been purified and its cDNA has been cloned. Results from expression analyses indicate that <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme is as skin specific as <b>stratum</b> corneum chymotryptic enzyme. In this work we have produced and characterized antibodies specific for <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme. We have also by means of biochemical, immunochemical, and immunohistochemical methods performed studies on <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme in normal human epidermis. Antibodies against bacterial recombinant <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme were produced and purified by affinity chromatography. Two types of antibodies were obtained: one reacting only with pro-stratum corneum tryptic enzyme and one specific for the catalytically active part of <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme. Immunohistochemistry with the antibodies reacting with pro-stratum corneum tryptic enzyme showed a staining pattern similar to <b>stratum</b> corneum chymotryptic enzyme-specific antibodies, i. e., the expression was confined to cornifying epithelia with a need of desquamation-like processes. Extracts of tape strips with superficial human <b>stratum</b> corneum were found to contain precursors as well as active forms of <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme and <b>stratum</b> corneum chymotryptic enzyme. The enzymes had maximal activity at pH 8, but both had considerable activity also at pH 5. 5. The results were compatible for a role of <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme in desquamation. <b>Stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme may act in concert with <b>stratum</b> corneum chymotryptic enzyme and/or function as a <b>stratum</b> corneum chymotryptic enzyme-activating enzyme. The presence in normal superficial <b>stratum</b> corneum of precursors {{as well as of}} active forms of <b>stratum</b> corneum chymotryptic enzyme and <b>stratum</b> corneum tryptic enzyme, and the activity of both enzymes over a broad range of pH-values, suggest some possible ways by which the desquamation may be regulated...|$|R

The thickness of the epidermis ranges from 0.08mm to greater than 0.6mm (from 0.003 to 0.024 inches). The epidermis comprises five strata; from outer to inner, they are the <b>stratum</b> corneum, <b>stratum</b> lucidum, <b>stratum</b> granulosum, <b>stratum</b> spinosum, and <b>stratum</b> basale.

5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno <b>Strata,</b> the younger John Day <b>Strata</b> consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day <b>Strata</b> include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these <b>strata,</b> such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

50|$|Lamellar {{bodies are}} tubular or ovoid-shaped {{secretory}} organelles {{derived from the}} Golgi apparatus of keratinocytes in {{the upper part of}} <b>stratum</b> spinosum.

The lipids ultimately form the lamellar lipid bilayer that surrounds corneocytes and also contribute to permeability barrier homeostasis of the <b>stratum</b> corneum. The homeostasis function is regulated by the calcium gradient in the epidermis. Usually the calcium level is very low in <b>stratum</b> corneum, but high in <b>stratum</b> granulosum. Once the permeability barrier is disrupted an influx of water occurs in the <b>stratum</b> corneum, which in turn increases the calcium levels in the <b>stratum</b> corneum but decreases it in the <b>stratum</b> granulosum. This perturbation induces lamellar bodies to undergo exocytosis and secrete lipids such as glycosylceramides, cholesterol and phospholipids to retrieve the permeability barrier function of <b>stratum</b> corneum.|$|R
