40|$|This {{automated}} {{analytical procedure}} involves a single 27 cm X 0. 9 cm column of UR- 40 resin and a stepwise elution with sodium citrate buffers. In one sequential run more than 35 acidic, neutral, and {{basic amino acids}} {{can be measured in}} phys-iological fluids in 6 h. Thus, a minimum of three runs can be performed per 24 h, during which the analysis can be unattended. Increased sensitivity allows the use of small samples (such as 0. 2 ml of plasma ultrafiltrate). Picric, <b>sulfosalicylic,</b> or per-Chloric <b>acids</b> are not required for sample prepara-tion. Ultrafiltration under nitrogen pressure is used instead and gives a clear solution containing the free amino acids. Ultrafiltration rate is 1 ml per 1. 5 h; 10 samples can be processed simultaneously. During the last 10 - 15 years, highly quantitative systems and procedures have been developed for determination of amino acids in hydrolysates and physiological fluids (1 - 8), and in many instances early diagnostic techniques and treatment are available now (9, 10). Although excellent, the ex-isting systems are extremely time-consuming. Efron’s procedure (5), published several years ago, was an advance in amino acid analysis; Hamilton’s excellent chromatograms of the amino acids that are encountered in physiological fluids (2) cannot be superseded, but his method requires elaborate apparatus and takes 21 h, through elution of argi-nine.

40|$|Background Proteinuria is a {{condition}} when protein is found in urine, a common symptom in children with renal disorders. Proteinuria {{can also be found}} in nonnal children and in those with non-renal disorders. A high sensitivity test is needed to detect proteinuria. Spectrophotometry {{has been used as a}} standard to detect proteinuria, however, it is expensive and not readily available in health clinics. We tested the use of 20 % sulfosalicylic add to detect proteinuria, and compared it to spectrophotometry. The sulfosalicylic add test is inexpensive, rapid, and easily performed in primary community health centers. Objective To compare 2 0 % <b>sulfosalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> test t o spectrophotometry as a diagnostic test for proteinuria. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in Adam Malik Hospital from September 2009 until December 2009. Inclusion criteria were children aged 3 to 18 years who experienced kidney disease. We collected 24 hour urine specimens from 55 children by consecutive sampling. Urine specimens were tested for proteinuria by 20 % <b>sulfosalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> test and spectrophotometry. Results Sensitivity and specificity of 20 % <b>sulfosalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> test compared to spectrophotometry were 88. 1 % and 69. 2 %, respectively, with a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value of 90. 2 % and 64. 3 %, respectively.

Monitoring of decomposed components of SF 6, insulating medium of gas-insulated switchgear, is a feasible method of early-warning to avoid the occurrence of sudden fault.

Polyaniline thin-film sensors with only <b>sulfosalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> deposited and with both hydrochloric acid and <b>sulfosalicylic</b> <b>acid</b> deposited were prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization method.
