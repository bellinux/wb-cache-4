5|$|In an interview, Borten {{revealed}} that he met Melisa Wallack in 2000 {{and asked her to}} help with the script, to which <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> In 2001, after one year of working on the script, they sold it to producer Robbie Brenner, who then set Marc Forster to direct the film for Universal Pictures, but left due to some personal delays. In June 2008, Craig Gillespie and Ryan Gosling were in talks to join the film, which was to be produced by David Bushell and Marc Abraham for Universal Pictures and Strike Entertainment. Chase Palmer was writing the script that time around, and screenwriters Guillermo Arriaga and Stephen Belber had reportedly also written the subsequent drafts for the film. In 2009, producer Robbie Brenner got involved again and rejected all the rewrites of the script, and the original version by Borten and Wallack was sent to actor Matthew McConaughey to see if the Dallas native would be interested in playing the role. On March 9, 2011, Jean-Marc Vallée was confirmed to direct the film based on the script by Borten and Wallack. Rachel Winter also attached to produce the film.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, Harvey married Lynne Cooper of St. Louis. She was {{inducted}} into Phi Beta Kappa at Washington University in St. Louis and a former schoolteacher. They met when Harvey was working at KXOK and Cooper came to the station for a school news program. Harvey invited her to dinner, proposed to her {{after a few minutes}} of conversation and from then on called her [...] "Angel," [...] even on his radio show. A year later <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> The couple moved to Chicago in 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Alice's wit {{could have}} a {{political}} effect on friend and foe alike. When columnist and cousin Joseph Wright Alsop V claimed that there was grass-roots support for Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie, the Republican hope to defeat F.D.R. in 1940, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> [...] "the grass roots of 10,000 country clubs." [...] During the 1940 Presidential campaign, she publicly proclaimed that she'd [...] "rather vote for Hitler than vote for Franklin for a third term." [...] Alice demolished Thomas Dewey, the 1944 opponent of her cousin Franklin, by comparing the pencil-mustached Republican to [...] "the bridegroom on the wedding cake." [...] The image stuck and Governor Dewey lost two consecutive presidential elections.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 May 2009, Baillie was a {{guest on}} the BBC {{politics}} and current affairs programme This Week. She was questioned by host Andrew Neil and regular guests Michael Portillo and Diane Abbott about the Brand row within discussion of the general subject of the present day worth and genuineness of public figures saying sorry, {{in the wake of}} public apologies from members of parliament (MP's) and Prime Minister Gordon Brown following the events of the MP's expenses row. Asked by Neil if receiving an apology from Brand and Ross had mattered to her, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> as she had been [...] "publicly offended and humiliated", and her father [...] "had been humiliated too". When asked by Abbott if all the publicity surrounding the Brand row had helped her career, she responded [...] "not necessarily ... one would think so, but not really." [...] Neil further asked if the apology she received had helped, she replied yes, stating [...] "definitely" [...] to the follow-up comment from Neil of [...] "better to get it than not get it?" [...] When asked finally on the row by Neil if she thought the apologies from Brand and Ross were genuine, she replied that she thought Ross's was, but the fact that Brand had joked about the row on his later tour negated his apology.|$|E
2500|$|Hushovd {{was again}} named as a pre-race {{favorite}} for the season's third monument, Paris–Roubaix. Farrar and Haussler also rode this race, {{but they have}} not had the track record of successes in it that Hushovd has, considering that the Norwegian finished on the podium in both the 2009 and 2010 editions. The race was run aggressively, with nearly [...] covered, incidentally almost the exact distance to the first cobbled sector, in the first two hours of racing. After a flurry of attacks and counter-attacks on and around the Arenberg Trench, the race's most storied and difficult cobbled sector, 21 riders had opened up a gap of two and a half minutes on the race's main favorites, namely Hushovd and Fabian Cancellara. Garmin-Cervélo had Vansummeren and Rasch in this group. Cancellara tried several times to get clear of the group of favorites, but succeeded only in having Hushovd, 's Alessandro Ballan, and Juan Antonio Flecha of [...] follow his wheel while contributing no work themselves. After a while, Cancellara gave up his efforts, deciding that it was not to his advantage to pull Hushovd, a superior sprinter, {{to the front of the}} race. At the Mons-en-Pévèle sector [...] from the finish, Vanmarcke and 's Tomas Vaitkus got clear of the Cancellara group for a time. When they were later brought back, Vanmarcke stayed on the front and did work to help pull the group of favorites nearer to the leaders out front. With [...] remaining, Vansummeren surged clear at the front of the race, and quickly took a time gap. Around that same time, Cancellara put in his most intensive pull. Only Hushovd and Ballan could follow, and the Swiss time trial ace very quickly caught every member of the early breakaway that was still out front, with the exception of Vansummeren. There was simply not enough road left to bring back the Belgian. He entered the Roubaix Velodrome alone and took the biggest win of his career 19 seconds ahead of a rapidly closing Cancellara in second. Hushovd finished eighth, fading slightly towards the finish. Vanmarcke held on for 20th despite taking a strong pull at the front of the favorites group. Only [...] also placed three finishers in the top 20. The win was only the second professional race Vansummeren had ever won, after a stage in the 2007 Tour de Pologne. He proposed marriage to his longtime girlfriend after the race – <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> Vaughters praised Vansummeren's ride, finding it appropriate with the team's character that a rider who spends almost his entire career in the service of other riders would attain such a prestigious win. He stated that though Cancellara was clearly the strongest rider in the race, Garmin-Cervélo had been the strongest team. He called it his proudest moment as a team boss and said that the result had fulfilled his personal goal of winning one monument race in 2011. Post-race analysis concurred that the result had redeemed the team for their lackluster showings earlier in the spring season.|$|E

60|$|She {{had never}} dreamt of meeting Algernon at Brighton--it was quite by chance {{that she came}} upon him at the officers' ball when he was staying with Captain Greenaway. He asked her to dance, and <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> all on a sudden, without thinking, and then she fancied he would go away; she begged him not to come again, but {{whenever}} she {{went out on the}} chain-pier before breakfast, there he was.|$|R
50|$|Ethel Shannon {{was born}} in Denver, Colorado, the {{daughter}} of James Shannon and Agnes Knight. After finishing school, she moved to Hollywood. Not long afterward, she was asked by a friend {{if she wanted to}} work as an extra in a movie and <b>she</b> readily <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> The extra part lasted several days and, before she left the studio, Shannon was offered a role in a Bert Lytell comedy, Easy to Make Money (1919), which sparked her career.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] Good Morning America, Robertson talked about his wife. He said, [...] "One woman has already got my heart, we've been married for 43 years and her name is Miss Christine Robertson". He has talked about how after he had asked for her hand in marriage about 70 times, <b>she</b> finally <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> The two married in 1971, {{and they had a}} daughter, Trasa, and a son, Scott.

60|$|My lady {{burst out}} laughing, {{and said she}} didn't know which to be most shocked at--my {{language}} or my principles.

Understanding nothing myself but that I was free to put it next to Selina, I went and put it accordingly. And what did Selina say? Lord! how little you must know of women, if you ask that.

60|$|He uttered some {{of these}} exalted thoughts, {{and they did not}} seem to appear crazy to her. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> they must make their {{separate}} lives offerings to each other, and their joint lives an offering to God. The tears came into his eyes at these words of hers: they were so beautiful and holy and wise. He agreed that one ought always to go to church, and that now he should never miss a service. He owned that he had been culpable in the past. He drew her closer to him--if that were possible--and sealed his words with a kiss.|$|E
50|$|Rebecca Christian wrote a one-woman {{play about}} Ruth Suckow, called “Just Suppose,” {{and to prepare}} for it, read much of the {{correspondence}} of Suckow and Nuhn, now housed in the Special Collections of the University of Iowa’s library, where it fills 56 boxes. Christian wrote, “During this period (of bee keeping) a letter arrived from a young literary critic in Cedar Falls who asked for ‘disposition towards pilgrims visiting you: if or when you are at ‘home.’” <b>She</b> apparently <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> because he drove his Model T to Earlville, beginning a relationship that lasted both of their lives.|$|R
60|$|With downcast {{eyes and}} {{speaking}} {{with an almost}} painstaking precision (her very lips, her red lips, seemed to move just enough to be heard and no more), <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that, <b>yes,</b> the thought came into her head. This makes one shudder at the mysterious ways girls acquire knowledge. For this was a thought, wild enough, I admit, but which could only {{have come from the}} depths of that sort of experience which she had not had, and went far beyond a young girl's possible conception of the strongest and most veiled of human emotions.|$|R
25|$|Mother {{is picked}} up by Rufus, Knight's pilot, and goes to help Knight while Schofield is {{captured}} by the French and brought to an aircraft carrier {{to explain to him}} why he is to be terminated.

60|$|Matters were {{accordingly}} {{arranged on}} these lines, {{and for some}} minutes we continued chatting in desultory fashion. Then the conversation petered out. I made a few observations in re the scenic effects, featuring the twilight hush, the peeping stars, and the soft glimmer of {{the waters of the}} lake, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes.</b> Something rustled in the bushes in front of us, and I advanced the theory that it was possibly a weasel, and she said it might be.

6000|$|The {{few days}} that yet {{remained}} of their voyage were {{falling in the}} latter half of September, and Staniford tried to make the young girl see the surpassing loveliness of that season under Italian skies; the fierceness of the summer is then past, and at night, when chiefly they inspected the firmament, the heaven has begun to assume something of the intense blue it wears in winter. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> it was very beautiful, but she could not see that the days were finer, or the skies bluer, than those of September at home; and he laughed at her loyalty to the American weather. [...] "Don't you think so, too?" [...] she asked, as if it pained her that he should like Italian weather better.|$|E
6000|$|There was no hope, {{no way out}} of the dilemma; {{for whether}} <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> or whether she said no, it would be all the same--a {{disastrous}} answer, for the Scriptures had said one cannot know this thing. Think what hard hearts they were to set this fatal snare for that ignorant young girl and be proud of such work and happy in it. It was a miserable moment for me while we waited; it seemed a year. All the house showed excitement; and mainly it was glad excitement. Joan looked out upon these hungering faces with innocent, untroubled eyes, and then humbly and gently she brought out that immortal answer which brushed the formidable snare away as it had been but a cobweb: ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} moment she put the mare into a canter and went down the road without a {{backward}} glance, intent on an analysis of her own feelings.

She had not intended to consent. Then why had she? Her first surprise and bewilderment at so wholly unpremeditated an act gave way to consternation as she considered its consequences. She knew that Burning Daylight was not a man to be trifled with, that under his simplicity and boyishness he was essentially a dominant male creature, and that she had pledged herself to a future of inevitable stress and storm. And again she demanded of herself why <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> at the very moment when it had been farthest from her intention.|$|R
50|$|Despite their revelations, {{the three}} friends {{still go to}} the Nutcracker Ball. Upon arriving, Chris learns that his {{teammates}} did not need the marijuana he struggled to obtain, and they also make fun of him for a video shot of him earlier, with his friends. Isaac retrieves his phone, and learns that Sarah never revealed the video message he recorded. Ethan finds Diana and, in an improvised moment, proposes to {{her in front of}} the entire party. While she accepts publicly, in private she declines, saying <b>she</b> only <b>said</b> <b>yes</b> because he put her on the spot, and thinks that the only reason why he proposed is because of his fear of losing his friends.|$|R
50|$|In March, Michelle {{discovers that}} Steve owes £10,000 in tax {{which he had}} been ignoring.

60|$|They {{sat down}} before the fire, hand in hand, and talked {{of the light}} things that swim to the top, and eddy round and round {{on the surface of}} our deepest moods. They made merry over the old minister's perturbation, which Bartley found {{endlessly}} amusing. Then he noticed that the dress Marcia had on was the one she had worn to the sociable in Lower Equity, and <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>yes,</b> she had put it on because he once said he liked it. He asked her when, and she said, oh, she knew; but if he could not remember, {{she was not going to}} tell him.

60|$|At {{an early}} stage in their {{friendship}} {{the young man had}} told her the plot of the piece; and if he had not unfortunately forgotten several important episodes and had to leap back to them across a gulf of one or two acts, and if he had referred to his characters by name instead of by such descriptions as 'the fellow who's in love with the girl--not what's-his-name but the other chap'--she would no doubt have got that mental half-Nelson on it which is such a help towards the proper understanding of a four-act comedy. As it was, his precis had left her a little vague; but she said it was perfectly splendid, and he said did she really think so. And <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>yes,</b> she did, and they were both happy.|$|E
