30|$|The FT-IR {{spectra of}} Sgc 8, FSNPs, and Sgc 8 -FSNPs {{are shown in}} Fig.  2 c.

The peak at 1554  cm− 1 was observed at the spectrum for Sgc 8 -FSNPs, so it likely reflects the attachment of the amine-labeled aptamer Sgc 8 {{to the surface of}} FSNPs-COOH.|$|R

Samples calcined at 100 and 200  °C show broad absorption bands of the asymmetric and symmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> of OHO, placed at 3080 – 3700  cm− 1. The IR absorption peaks at 2900  cm− 1 are assigned to C–H <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations.</b> The bands at 1650 – 1540  cm− 1 and 1447 – 1340  cm− 1 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the bound carboxylic groups (COO−).

The spectra obtained from samples annealed at 200 and 300  °C show the characteristic band of Ce–O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations,</b> located at around 500  cm− 1 [32]. The spectrum of a sample calcined at 300  °C shows the presence of a small amount of organic matter.|$|R

50|$|An {{advantage}} of Resonance Raman Spectroscopy over (normal) Raman spectroscopy {{is that the}} effect has much higher intensity. An application that illustrates this advantage {{is the study of}} the dioxygen molecule in Cytochrome c oxidase.

5000|$|As {{an example}} from {{inorganic}} chemistry the permanganate ion, , in aqueous solution has an intense purple colour due to an O → Mn ligand-to-metal charge transfer band (LMCT) {{in much of the}} visible region.

50|$|The C-Cl <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of methyl chloride, CH3Cl, gives a {{parallel}} band since the dipole moment change is {{aligned with the}} 3-fold rotation axis.

A comparison is made with the spectra of the minerals nepouite and chrysotile and a synthetic pecoraite. Pecoraite is characterised by OH <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> at 3645 and 3683 cm- 1 attributed to the inner and inner surface hydroxyl <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Intense infrared bands at around 3288 and 3425 cm- 1 are assigned to the <b>stretching</b> <b>vibrations</b> of water strongly hydrogen bonded {{to the surface of the}} pecoraite.

50|$|The {{dynamics}} of hydrogen bond structures in {{water can be}} probed by the IR spectrum of OH <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration.</b> In the hydrogen bonding network in protic organic ionic plastic crystals (POIPCs), which are a type of phase change material exhibiting solid-solid phase transitions prior to melting, variable-temperature infrared spectroscopy can reveal the temperature dependence of hydrogen bonds and the {{dynamics of}} both the anions and the cations. The sudden weakening of hydrogen bonds during the solid-solid phase transition seems to be coupled {{with the onset of}} orientational or rotational disorder of the ions.|$|E
50|$|For polyatomic molecules, progressions {{are most}} often {{observed}} when the change in bond lengths upon electronic excitation coincides with the change due to a ″totally symmetric″ vibration. This is the same process that occurs in resonance Raman spectroscopy. For example, in formaldehyde (methanal), H2CO, the n → π* transition involves excitation of an electron from a non-bonding orbital to an antibonding pi orbital which weakens and lengthens the C-O bond. This produces a long progression in the C-O <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration.</b> Another example is furnished by benzene, C6H6. In both gas and liquid phase the band around 250 nm shows a progression in the symmetric ring-breathing vibration.|$|E

This will apply to octahedral coordination compounds {{of the transition}} metals. The spectra {{of many of these}} complexes have some vibronic character. The same rule also applies to f-f transitions in centrosymmetric complexes of lanthanides and actinides. In the case of the octahedral actinide chloro-complex of uranium(IV), UCl62− the observed electronic spectrum is entirely vibronic. At the temperature of liquid helium, 4K, the vibronic structure was completely resolved, with zero intensity for the purely electronic transition, and three side-lines corresponding to the asymmetric U-Cl <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> and two asymmetric Cl-U-Cl bending modes. Later studies on the same anion were also able to account for vibronic transitions involving low-frequency lattice vibrations.|$|E

5000|$|The {{analysis}} of vibronic spectra of diatomic molecules provides information concerning both the ground electronic {{state and the}} excited electronic state. Data for the ground state can also be obtained by vibrational or pure rotational spectroscopy, but data for the excited state can only {{be obtained from the}} {{analysis of}} vibronic spectra. For example, the bond length in the excited state may be derived from the value of the rotational constant B′.In addition to stable diatomic molecules, vibronic spectroscopy has been used to study unstable species, including CH, NH, hydroxyl radical, OH, and cyano radical, CN. The Swan bands in hydrocarbon flame spectra are a progression in the C-C <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration</b> of the dicarbon radical, C2 for the [...] electronic transition.

The O-H stretching vibrations {{give rise to}} absorption bands with band origins at 3657 cm−1 (ν1, 2.734 μm) and 3756 cm−1 (ν3, 2.662 μm) in the gas phase. The asymmetric <b>stretching</b> <b>vibration,</b> of B2 symmetry in the point group C2v is a normal vibration. The H-O-H bending mode origin is at 1595 cm−1 (ν2, 6.269 μm). Both symmetric stretching and bending vibrations have A1 symmetry, but the frequency difference between them is so large that mixing is effectively zero. In the gas phase all three bands show extensive rotational fine structure.ν3 has a series of overtones at wavenumbers somewhat less than n ν3, n=2,3,4,5... Combination bands, such as ν2 + ν3 are also easily observed in the near infrared region. The presence of water vapor in the atmosphere is important for atmospheric chemistry especially as the infrared and near infrared spectra are easy to observe. Standard (atmospheric optical) codes are assigned to absorption bands as follows. 0.718 μm (visible): α, 0.810 μm: μ, 0.935 μm: ρστ, 1.13 μm: φ, 1.38 μm: ψ, 1.88 μm: Ω, 2.68 μm: X.
