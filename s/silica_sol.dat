40|$|The {{impact of}} {{depositing}} sol-gel coatings on the hydrophobicity of a bio-based material {{was investigated in}} this study. Bio-based materials have tendency to absorb large amounts of water due to their highly porous structure and presence of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups in their structure. For this purpose, two sets of <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> were prepared to study the influence of catalysts and solvent concentration on the hydrophobicity of hemp shiv. The first set of <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> were prepared using different acidic (hydrochloric acid and nitric acid) and basic (sodium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide) catalysts while keeping the concentration of precursors and solvents constant. The hydrophobicity of sol-gel coated hemp shiv increased significantly when using acid catalysed sols resulting in water contact angles of up to 100 ° using sessile drop method. Therefore, {{the next set of}} <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> were prepared with acidic catalysts using higher concentration of solvent. Hemp shiv coated with ethanol diluted sols showed better hydrophobicity when compared to undiluted sols. This difference in hydrophobicity {{can be attributed to the}} change in surface roughness. It was found that <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> containing higher concentration of solvent provide a uniform coating layer covering the hemp shiv entirely. In contrast, undiluted sol coatings developed minor cracks on the hemp shiv surface as observed under 3 D optical profilometer. Therefore, the use of diluted hydrophobic <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> offers potential for treatment of extremely hydrophilic bio-based materials by sol-gel technology. For practical application of coatings on bio-based materials, diluted <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> are of interest due to longer shelf life, reduced cost and lower environmental impact of precursors...|$|R

5000|$|Apply {{investment}} materials: The ceramic mould, {{known as}} the investment, is produced by repeating a series of steps—coating, stuccoing, and hardening—until a desired thickness is achieved. Coating involves dipping a pattern cluster into a slurry of fine refractory material and then draining to create a uniform surface coating. Fine materials are used in this first step, also called a prime coat, to preserve fine details from the mould. Stuccoing applies coarse ceramic particles by dipping patterns into a fluidised bed, placing it in a rainfall-sander, or by applying materials by hand. Hardening allows coatings to cure. These steps are repeated until the investment reaches its required thickness—usually 5 to 15 mm. Investment moulds are left to dry completely, which can take 16 to 48 hours. Drying can be accelerated by applying a vacuum or minimizing environmental humidity. Investment moulds can also be created by placing the pattern clusters into a flask and then pouring liquid investment material from above. The flask is then vibrated to allow entrapped air to escape and help the investment material fill any small voids. [...] Common refractory materials used to create the investments are: silica, zircon, various aluminium silicates, and alumina. Silica is usually used in the fused silica form, but sometimes quartz is used because it is less expensive. Aluminium silicates are a mixture of alumina and silica, where commonly used mixtures have an alumina content from 42 to 72%; at 72% alumina the compound is known as mullite. During the primary coat(s), zircon-based refractories are commonly used, because zirconium {{is less likely to}} react with the molten metal. Prior to silica, a mixture of plaster and ground up old molds (chamotte) was used. The binders used to hold the refractory material in place include: ethyl silicate (alcohol-based and chemically set), colloidal silica (water-based, also known as <b>silica</b> <b>sol,</b> set by drying), sodium silicate, and a hybrid of these controlled for pH and viscosity.|$|E
40|$|A {{recently}} introduced non-cementitious grout <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> is a refined product of colloidal silica, where the particle sizes {{have been reduced}} to between 5 and 100 nm. Laboratory tests were performed to determine the behaviour of <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> as a permeation grout in hard rock. The tests have involved methods Such as fall-cone, unconfined compression, triaxial, and oedometer tests. Samples were tested at different time intervals and in different storage environments. Results showed that the initial strength of <b>silica</b> <b>sol,</b> a few kPa, increases over time. <b>Silica</b> <b>sol</b> has a ductile behaviour during the first few days and then becomes elastic-plastic. Its hydraulic conductivity ranges from 10 (- 10) to 10 (- 11) m/s. When immersed in water, <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> hardens and a thin layer of weaker strength is formed at the surface. However, this layer only extends a couple of millimetres into the sample; beyond that the <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> is not affected, rendering breakdown by erosion a negligible risk. The conclusions are: (1) the strength obtained in <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> after hardening is sufficient to withstand most grouting conditions; (2) when sufficiently confined, <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> is able to withstand loading and unloading cycles: (3) a pH environment of around 11 does not appreciably change the strength of the silica sol; (4) <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> is a material with low risk of failure under blasting vibrations: and (5) due to its low hydraulic conductivity, <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> can be compared to low permeable clays...|$|E

The rheological measurement indicated that PSBM emulsions exhibited shear-thinning behavior, and the phenomena became more pronounced with increasing <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> concentration. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) demonstrated that the stronger interfacial interaction between <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> and polymer matrix, but microphase separation took place with excess <b>silica</b> <b>sol.</b> Thereby the tensile strength and thermal stability of emulsion films were increased with desirable <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> concentration, and when <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> concentration was greater than 6 wt%, the tensile strength leveled off and the decomposition temperature decreased from 351. 19 ℃ to 331. 63 ℃.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study methods of {{reacting}} the surface of the particles of <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> with silanes, primarily gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and study some basic properties of the modified sols and the nature and structure of the silane groups attached to the particle surface. Design/methodology/approach - The surface of the silica particles was modified by reacting the <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> with aqueous solutions of silanes, chiefly GPTMS. The presence and structure of silane groups on the particle surface were established by Si-NMR and C-NMR, respectively. Findings - Several silanes were studied but <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> could be readily modified only with GPTMS and glycidoxypropylmethoxydiethoxysilane (GPMDES), most readily if the silanes were pre-hydrolysed in water. Higher degrees of silylation were preferably done by continuous addition of silane. Lower degrees of modification can be achieved at room temperature by the stepwise addition of the silane solution. The silylation of the silica surface with GPTMS significantly reduces the number of charged surface groups and silanol groups. GPTMS binds covalently to the silica surface and the epoxy ring opens and transforms into a diol. <b>Silica</b> <b>sols</b> modified with GPTMS and GPMDES are stable toward aggregation. Research limitations/implications - Only organo-reactive silanes were studied. Originality/value - This is the first work to study the modification by silanes of silica aquasols with high concentrations of silica. The silane modification can extend the use of silica to areas of applications previously inaccessible to <b>silica</b> <b>sols...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} part of the project Non-cementitious low-pH {{injection}} grout for smaller fractures that is a sub-project under the main project Injection grout for deep repositories. The project is financed by SKB (Sweden), Posiva (Finland) and NUMO (Japan). The aim of these laboratory experiments is to increase the knowledge of the characteristics of <b>silica</b> <b>sol.</b> These experiments can be seen as an introductory study of the mechanical aspects of <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> and should be followed up with measurements on issues that are surveyed in this report. The different aspects of the characteristics for <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> that have been studied are: -	Drying shrinkage -	Flexural strength -	Compressive strength -	Youngs modulus (Modulus of elasticity) -	Shear strength All of the tests were made with the same <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> that consisted of 35 % by weight SiO 2 and the accelerator were CaCl 2 with a concentration of 2. 9 %. The pH was around 10 and the <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> was aluminium modified. The test samples were moulded with a ratio between the <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> and the accelerator of 8 : 1 by weight. A total of 117 test samples were moulded. The test samples were stored in four different environments. In a climate room that had a temperature of 8 °C three environments were created with humidities of 75 %, 95 % and 100 %. These environments were created to imitate the environment in the rock. The fourth environment was 20 °C and 50 % relative humidity, which is a standard environment for concrete shrinkage tests. The results show that the strength of <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> increases over a long time. The increase in strength depends on the humidity that <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> is exposed to. Lower humidity results in a more rapid strength increase. Though in low humidities <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> also have a tendency to shrink. The development of the compressive, flexural and shear strength seems to be rather attuned for each storage environment. The strength of <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> increases over a long time. The increase of strength depends on the humidity that <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> is exposed to. Less humidity will give a faster strength increase. Though in low humidities <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> also have a tendency to shrink. With the use of Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria a value of the friction angle could be estimated for <b>silica</b> <b>sol.</b> Generally the friction angle increased with time, from around 20 º after three weeks to around 50 º after six months. It seems that <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> reasonable well could be described by Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria. To imitate the effect of drying shrinkage of <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> in a grouted fracture, an experiment with water pressure on one side and air {{on the other side of}} a <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> grouted borehole was conducted. The hypothesis is that some shrinkage will occur near the tunnel due to the lower moisture content in the air than the water in the fractures. The result of this experiment was that the specific flow decreases over time. Calculations were done to verify the crack width that causes the flow of water. The magnitude of the width of this crack are 1 - 14 &# 956;m, this should be compared with the originally width of the grouted borehole of 86 mm...|$|E

40|$|Micro- and batch {{flotation}} {{tests were}} conducted to explore the use of <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> to control metal ions to reduce accidental activation and misplacement of minerals. As a comparison other 'metal control reagents', ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and polyphosphate were also tested. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to probe the silica sol-mineral interaction mechanism. Micro flotation was performed on single mineral samples over a pH range 7 to 11. It was found that <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> depressed all Cu minerals, Cu and Pb activated pyrite and Pb activated sphalerite but did not depress Cu activated sphalerite. XPS analysis revealed that <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> adsorbed on all Cu minerals and Cu and Pb activated pyrite. <b>Silica</b> <b>sol</b> partially removed Pb from Pb activated sphalerite and had no apparent interaction with Cu activated sphalerite. The depressant action, therefore, appeared to be primarily adsorption of <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> to form hydrophilic sites. In the batch tests, generally, <b>silica</b> <b>sol,</b> polyphosphate and EDTA increased the rate of flotation in the Cu stage and in the Zn stage. This is attributed to removal of hydrophilic metal hydroxy species, i. e., surface 'cleaning'. Polyphosphate, {{and to a lesser}} extent EDTA, improved selectivity in the Zn stage for Les Mines Selbaie and Mine Louvicourt and arguably for Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting. This selectivity was not identified in the trials at Brunswick Mine directly on Zn stage flotation feed. The varying effect of polyphosphate on selectivity is attributed to the level of 'excess Cu' used in Zn activation: the higher the excess, the greater the effect of polyphosphate. In conclusion, <b>silica</b> <b>sol</b> has some metal ion control capability but seems less attractive in this role than say polyphosphate...|$|E

30|$|The {{stabilization}} of the silica particles is mainly {{dependent on the}} composition of the particle surface. Common stabilizers are either Na 2 O or substitution of (Si(OH) 4) with (Al(OH) 4) during particle production. The aim of the stabilization is to reduce the increase in viscosity, which is otherwise experienced in concentrated <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> due to the strong hydrophilicity. <b>Silica</b> <b>sols</b> usually have a pH of 10 and at this pH the particles are negatively charged. The stability of particles is achieved by controlling the amount of Na+ as counter ions which are produced by the dissociation of Na 2 O. An optimal stability is achieved by perfectly balancing the negative charge on the surface, therefore the amount of Na+ ions can be varied depending on the number of charged groups present on the surface [16]. Substituted silica nanoparticles i.e. particles where some silica atoms have been substituted by aluminium atoms are also commercially available. The substitution of aluminium at the surface has the effect of adding negative charge to the surface, which is pH independent and renders the particles stable at low pH i.e., <  8 [10]. On the other hand <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> using Na 2 O as stabilizers are kept at a pH around 10 where the surface charge is high and the electrostatic repulsions are large.|$|R

The process of coating <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> was dependent on an acid solution of low pH, which influenced the electrostatic interactions between nanoparticles and wool fibers. The morphology and composition of silica-sol-coated wool fabrics were characterized {{by a combination of}} SEM, TEM, EDX, FTIR, and XPS measurements. The possible mechanism and size effect of silica nanoparticles on the hydrophilic property of wool fabric were discussed. The washing fastness of the superhydrophilic wool fabrics in perchlorethylene and water was also evaluated. This study shows that wool fabrics modified by optical transparence, chemical stability, and nontoxic <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> are promising in constructing smart textiles.

40|$|Today, great {{emphasis}} {{has been}} placed on waste produced by the metals industry. Until recently, hydroxide precipitation was considered the ideal choice for handling metallurgical effluents. Metal hydroxides are stored in landfills, although they are not ultimately stable and may redissolve into groundwater with slight changes in pH. An alternative is to adsorb dissolved metals onto stabilized <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> ("activated silica"), which are colloidal polymers produced by acidifying silicate solutions. Metal-loaded sol may subsequently be desorbed with concentrated acid. The products are a potentially valuable concentrated metal solution and recyclable sol. Dissolved metal adsorption with <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> was compared with precipitation, either with lime or sodium hydroxide. Optimum adsorption and desorption conditions were determined for cobalt. Dissolved metals separation by selective adsorption was demonstrated for cobalt/copper and cobalt/iron (ferric) combinations. A cadmium ion selective electrode was used to examine the adsorption/desorption process "in situ"...|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanical}} {{property of the}} final gel is of critical importance for the materials application in grouting. Therefore in this section the gel strength, hydraulic conductivity, and durability of the gels will be discussed. These properties {{are connected to the}} previously discussed chemical properties of the <b>silica</b> <b>sols</b> and an attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} the two fields is made.|$|R
