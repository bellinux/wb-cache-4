40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{performance}} and carcass characteristics of broilers fed diets with different Dietary Electrolyte balances (DEB) during the summer season. A total of 1, 280 one-day-old Ross <b>sexed</b> <b>chicks</b> were distributed in 32 experimental units according to a randomized block design in a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement (4 levels and 2 sexes) and 4 replicates per treatment (40 birds per replicate). Feed program consisted of 3 phases (1 - 21, 22 - 42, 43 - 49 days of age). Experimental diets were formulated based on corn and soybean meal and adjusted to 210, 250, 290 and 330 mEq/kg of Na + K - Cl through the addition of sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and ammonium chloride. Weekly measurements of body weight gain and feed intake were done, and at 49 days, birds were slaughtered to evaluate the dressing percentage and parts yield. Weight gain during the starter phase increased linearly (p< 0. 01) as DEB increased. Different DEB levels did not affect feed intake or mortality. Carcass characteristics were not affected by treatments. Dietary electrolytic balance influenced weight gain and feed gain ratio from 1 to 21 days, and best results were observed when diets contained 290 and 330 mEq/kg...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum {{is used as}} {{a source}} of energy {{alternative}} to corn, however, its low pigments content are considered hindrance to the use of this feedstuff for poultry. The inclusion of annatto seed by-product (ASB) may solve this problem. In this context, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of ASB inclusion in diets containing sorghum as the main source of energy on performance, carcass traits, meat color, and economic viability in the production of slow-growth broilers. A total of 420 <b>sexed</b> <b>chicks</b> of the Carijó Pesadão line were distributed in a completely randomized design according to a 2 × 7 factorial arrangement, with three replicates of 10 birds per treatment. Studied factors were two sexes (males and females) and seven diets, wherein one had corn as source of energy and the others contained sorghum plus inclusion of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 % of ASB. Irrespective of the sex, diets did not affect feed intake (g/bird), feed conversion (g/g), yields (%) of carcass, breast and drumstick+thigh, percentage of abdominal fat, or relative weight of the liver. However, the inclusion of ASB influenced the color parameters of the meat making it more pigmented and improved the economic viability parameters. In diets for slow-growth birds containing sorghum as the main source of energy, ASB can be included up to 15 %, and meat pigmentation problems can be reduced with total substitution of corn by sorghum with inclusion of ASB from 3 %...|$|R
40|$|The goal {{of present}} study, {{carried out at}} Gbadolite city, was to {{incorporate}} the papaya leaves flour into the food diet of chicks from 0 to 8 weeks and to evaluate its effects on some zootechnical parameters. We used one day- 80 non <b>sexed</b> <b>chicks</b> from the artisanal incubator. Those chicks have been divided in two groups: the first group with 40 chicks fed with the diet incorporating papaya leaves flour (Carica papaya L.) (L 1) and the second group with 40 others chicks fed with the diet lacking the aforementioned flour and served as control (L 0). The obtained results indicated that papaya leaves flour based diet was more provided (1337. 5 g) than the control diet (1025 g); The test diet (L 1) had brought about fewer cases of mortality (10 %) than the control diet (L 0) (17 %); The diet enriched with the Carica papaya L. flour is quite better according to its consumption index (1. 4 versus 1. 6 for control diet); The test diet (L 1) has favored more medium live weight (156. 7 g) and average live weight gain (33. 8 g) than the control diet (L 0) with 87. 9 g and 23. 5 g respectively. The results obtained seem to be comparable to those obtained with other foods. For this purpose, it is encouraging to feed chicks using the diet seasoned with papaya leaves as source of antibiotics, proteins, vitamins and anti-helminthes because the imported balanced diet is expensive and has been the stumbling block of development projects in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the relationship between the growth of chicks and size of eggs, from which they were hatched, in the large meat-type breeds. Prior to incubation, hatching eggs taken from three breeds, White Cornishes, White Rocks, and their crossbreds (F_ 1 s), were classified into six groups based on the individual weight, i. e., 50 - 53, 54 - 57, 58 - 61, 62 - 65, 66 - 69, and above 70 g, and hatched in a single basket. The batteries controlled for the space per bird were assigned at random to each group of the <b>sexed</b> <b>chicks</b> through the test period. The percentage of chick weight involved both sexes at hatching time to the original egg weight averaged 70. 4 % for Cornishes, 72. 2 % for White Rocks, and 73. 8 % for F_ 1 s. Significantly high correlation coefficients above 0. 83 in all the breeds were found between chick weight at hatching time and egg weight. The correlation coefficients in the 2 nd-week of age rapidly declined to about 0. 35, and thereafter these decreased to the level of 0. 1. However, the correlations in White Rocks and F_ 1 s were significant even at the broiler age. The effect of the egg weight to the variances of body weight which were estimated from the formula of ((Σxy) ^ 2 /Σx^ 2) /Σy^ 2 =r^ 2 were 70 % at hatching time, but these abruptly decreased to below 17 % after two weeks of age.

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the changes in hemato-biochemical indices in male and female Vanaraja chickens under tropical environment during summer and winter season. Materials and Methods: A total of 120 day-old <b>sexed</b> Vanaraja <b>chicks</b> were selected as experimental chickens and distributed equally in two groups having 60 female and 60 male chickens in each group, respectively. The experiment was continued for 8 weeks (56 days) and both male and female chickens were slaughtered by cervical dislocation method. All parameters were estimated at the end of the experiment in both seasons. Results: Male had higher blood glucose, Ca and P level. Blood glucose level significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced in summer. Female had higher total protein, albumin, globulin, and albumin/globulin ratio. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase enzyme concentration were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in summer. Total erythrocyte count, total leukocyte count, hemoglobin (Hb), Hb/lymphocyte ratio, and packed cell volume were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in males. Mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular Hb were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in females. Conclusion: Sex of chickens had a significant (p 0. 05) effect in most of the observed parameters.

Nine hundred and ninety <b>sexed,</b> one-day <b>chicks</b> were utilized; belonged to the following genetic groups: Cobb 500, Hubbard Flex, and Ross 308. The study evaluated the daily average weight gain, the daily average ration consumption, feed conversion, body weight, weight and performance for breast, and carcass over the period from 1 to 35, and from 1 to 42 days of age. Performance of the genetic groups was evaluated by means of multivariate analysis of variance and by Fisher's linear discriminant function, using Roy's largest eigenvalue and Roy's union-intersection test for multiple comparisons. The genetic divergence study was carried out through the analysis of canonical variables and through Tocher method. Female animals from Cobb 500, Hubbard Flex, and Ross 308 genetic groups presented different canonical averages from males of the same groups. First two canonical variables explained 88. 10 % of variation between genetic groups.

40|$|Visually {{identifying}} {{the sex of}} a bird can be difficult. It cannot be done in half the world’s species when they are adults, and virtually none can be <b>sexed</b> as <b>chicks.</b> Despite this, the sex of a bird is vital for captive breeding. An increased number of birds are being sexed using DNA amplification techniques. In this approach, the CHD-W and CHD-Z are distinguished by the amplification of an intron present in both genes. PCR products on the gel electrophoresis vary in size revealing one band in males at the CHD-Z, and two bands in females corresponding to both the CHD-W and CHD-Z. Two independent sets of primer (P 8 /P 2 and 2550 F/ 2718 R) were used to amplify the CHD gene region from both the Z and W chromosome. One hundred and ten (110) birds were sexed using first pair of primers: (P 8 /P 2). Sexing results indicated that 81. 8 % were successfully determined, 12. 7 % failed to be amplified and 5. 5 % were not perfectly determined because the PCR products showed thick band.

Boron improved the overall feed conversion ratio, but increased body weight only at 21 days of age (p 0. 05). Dietary Ca and P deprivation reduced body weight and feed consumption significantly, but did not influence the feed conversion ratio and mortality (p> 0. 05). Serum Ca level, ALP and ALT activities were not influenced either by dietary Ca and P deficiency or boron supplementation. Serum P content increased with respect to boron at 30 ppm.
