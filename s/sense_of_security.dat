This gave American and British commanders a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> believing that the Wehrmacht {{did not have the}} strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts {{on the summit}} plateau to assist walkers {{attempting}} the descent in foggy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions. Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and could lessen mountaineers' sense of {{responsibility for their own}} safety. Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play. A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks {{the upper reaches of the}} Pony Track.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionSecurity {{is one of}} the man’s {{fundamental}} {{needs and}} is considered as the first condition for sustainable development in a civilized society. One of the institutions which has an important role on the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> is religion. Religion, religiosity and believe in God guide people to obey rules and prevent them from moral abnormality and anomy. Also, in today’s world, media exercises an extraordinary power on human’s life. Media has a paradoxical impact on society. It can change the truth or show the right, wrong and vice versa. Buzan introduces social security as a set of qualities upon which people consider themselves as members of a special group. In fact, social security is oriented towards dimensions of one's life and one's identity. Of course, feeling <b>of</b> <b>security</b> is related to one's state of mind rather than real life. Materials and MethodsResearch show that religiosity and the rate of using media are the effective cultural factors that influence feeling <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> On this base, this study aims at investigating the impacts of religiosity and mass media on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security.</b> In fact, in this research <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> is the dependent variable. The method of research is survey. All Mazandaran’s students are research population, of whom a sample of 400 individuals were randomly selected. 57. 6 percent of respondents were female and 42. 4 percent were male. Also, the age mean is 22. 63. The research data was gathered through questionnaires. Content validity of questionnaire was achieved. For reliability test, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated. The analysis of data is carried out at descriptive and inferential statistics levels. It should be mentioned that the variables such as level <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security,</b> religiosity and using mass media are examined through Likert scale. Total scores in each scale is calculated and considered as interval variables. Discussion of results and conclusionsDescriptive findings show that although rate of religiosity is high but the rate <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> among respondents is low. The mean <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> is 9. 04 and the mean of religiosity is 21. 36. Using media is at an average level with its mean being 9. 99. Findings based on tests show that religiosity and all its dimensions (belief, emotional, outcomes, ritual) have a meaningful and direct relationship with <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security.</b> <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> Social <b>security</b> also has a meaningful relationship with using domestic media, TV, radio and satellite. However, it does not have a relationship with internet, magazines and newspaper usage. Generally speaking, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> has a direct relationship with TV and radio (domestic media) but is in a reversed relationship with satellite usage. Findings on multiple regression technique show that, the rate of watching TV and dimension of belief in religiosity have the most impacts on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security,</b> respectively. R squared is 0 / 33 which shows that using TV and dimension of belief explain 33 percent <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> variance. To sum up, the results show that religiosity has a great effect on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security.</b> That means by reinforcing religiosity among people we have a greater <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security.</b> As Marx said religion is the heart of heartless world. Religion can control one's ambitions. Also, as we mentioned, there is a direct relationship between <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> and domestic media but, with satellite usage this relationship is negative. This finding is in line with Raff and Janbaz’s research (2011), who argued that satellite programs have negative effect on feeling <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and national interests. Among the domestic media, TV has the greatest impact on <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security.</b> TV {{is one of the}} most effective media by witch society reproduce its values and norms. Comparing with TV, radio has less effect on dependent variable but still its role in <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> is important. Some people say it is the age of media which means truth would be made by the power of super media...|$|R

5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a formal agreement exists, and the evidence is {{based solely on the}} joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{and other}} Atari {{executives}} presented this design to Spielberg, {{who did not}} express enthusiasm. Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to Namco's Pac-Man. Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality {{he saw in the}} original film. In retrospect, however, Warshaw stated that Spielberg's idea might have had merit. He spent the remaining time programming the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film, as well as the stability the video game industry was experiencing in 1982. Due to time limitations, Atari decided to skip audience testing for the game. Emanual Gerard, co-chief operating officer of Warner at the time, later suggested that the company had fallen into a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> by the success of its previous releases, particularly its console version of Pac-Man, which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction.|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the thesis}} is {{to analyze the}} ability of media to provide a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ontological <b>security</b> to their users. Changes, related to the {{transformation}} of traditional society into a modern society caused {{in the opinion of}} Anthony Giddens a weakening <b>of</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ontological <b>security</b> <b>of</b> individuals. Such an outcome was a result of the space-time distanciation and individuals opting out of social systems as an impact of some globalization processes. Mass media in the modern society work as a main factor of social integration and differentiation. The ability to construct the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ontological <b>security</b> among its recipients is attributing in the field of television studies attributed to the traditional medium, television. But some basic characteristics of television broadcast and the role of television in households have changed with a digital television transition. Employing the methods of qualitative sociological research I will analyze whether new media have the potential to substitute television in the role <b>of</b> providing the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ontological <b>security</b> among its users.

5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> As a result, 1 ATF now turned its attention to expanding its area of operations.|$|E

He also tries to win back Blair's affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> Victor admits that he poisoned Todd's scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and Téa devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future. Todd receives another note by the Tattoo Organization, this time telling him that he failed them and that Victor has been recaptured. Todd is told that he must leave Llanview and go to the address given on the note. Todd and Blair are devastated. Todd says goodbye to Viki and his children, but does not tell them the real reason he is leaving is to protect their family. Before Todd leaves, he and Blair make love one last time, and it is revealed that they have remarried.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} his autocracy and iron rule, Cẩn earned praise from Huế-based US {{officials}} for his relatively high levels of success against the Việt Cộng insurgency. Cẩn's central region was much more peaceful than the restive areas near Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Cẩn created the Popular Force organisation to operate in central Vietnam. The Popular Force was {{an alternative to the}} Strategic Hamlet Program which was used on a much larger scale in the south by Nhu, who moved peasants into fortified camps in an attempt to isolate Vietcong cadres from accessing the rural populace and intimidating or otherwise gaining their support. Cẩn assumed a third or so of the rural peasantry were Việt Cộng sympathisers, significant enough to render the hamlets ineffective by intimidating other villagers from within. Cẩn's Popular Force were a group of volunteers who underwent rigorous training similar to United States Marine Corps Recruit Training. Those who passed the training were put into units of 150 men and assigned to live and work in the villages by day. At night, they did defense patrols, using hit-and-run tactics against the Việt Cộng. According to the report by US officials in central Vietnam, the program aroused popular support because of the integration of the Popular Force's personnel into the daily life of the village and the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> that the force provided. The units were generally regarded as being successful in their six-month deployments, allowing them to be deployed to the next trouble spot. Officials in Washington disagreed with the assessment of their subordinates in central Vietnam, alleging that Cẩn was mainly using the Popular Force for repressing dissidents.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts to increase production, but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E
5|$|Yet such flaws {{were not}} {{immediately}} obvious {{and by the}} second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away, abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted Graham to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian operations in the province which had increased the population's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> During his tour of duty the task force had conducted 32 operations before he handed over command in October 1967. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E
