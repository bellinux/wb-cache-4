5|$|Copper(I) chloride, {{commonly}} called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance {{is a white}} solid <b>sparingly</b> soluble in water, but very soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Impure samples appear green due {{to the presence of}} copper(II) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Davidson passed 25 in the Tests {{only once}} took two wickets on three occasions. He {{finished}} the series with 182runs at 22.75 and his <b>sparingly</b> used bowling yielded eight wickets at 26.50. Despite this, he was Australia's sixth-highest run-scorer and third-leading wicket-taker.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015–16 season, having played <b>sparingly</b> in 14 {{games with}} the Jets, Pardy was placed on waivers and claimed by the Edmonton Oilers on February 29, 2016. Pardy {{appeared}} in 9 further {{games with the}} Oilers for 3 assists.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{original}} visions, Wheatley was used <b>sparingly</b> and started only eight games {{over the course}} of four seasons with the Giants. Off the field, Wheatley moved his half-brother with him to New Jersey to keep him out of the tumultuous environment and to provide him a strong learning environment.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{fragility}} of his knee, Toshack was used <b>sparingly</b> in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour, the least of any player. Toshack was unable {{to play in the}} last nine matches of the tour, having injured himself in the second match against Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Figures are {{introduced}} <b>sparingly</b> into Ruisdael's compositions, and are by this period rarely {{from his own}} hand but executed by various artists, including his pupil Meindert Hobbema, Nicolaes Berchem, Adriaen van de Velde, Philips Wouwerman, Jan Vonck, Thomas de Keyser, Gerard van Battum and Jan Lingelbach.|$|E
5|$|London was {{utilised}} <b>sparingly</b> {{during the}} next few months, making his only television appearance in a loss to Lance Cade on the July 21 episode of Raw. London was subsequently released from his WWE contract on November 7, 2008. On July 31, 2009, Kendrick was also released.|$|E
5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used <b>sparingly</b> and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons, however, Hamels {{suffered}} through several injuries, and pitched only <b>sparingly.</b> He missed most of the 2004 season with elbow tendinitis, making only four starts. In 2005, he broke his pitching hand in a bar fight before the season began; after rehabilitation, {{he was assigned to}} Clearwater. In July, the Phillies promoted him to the Class AA Reading Phillies of the Eastern League, where he surrendered the first home run of his professional career in his first start. Subsequently, he was shut down {{for the remainder of the}} season with back spasms.|$|E
5|$|Having {{developed}} a slower ball, {{and using the}} yorker more <b>sparingly,</b> Ambrose took five wickets in three games as West Indies won an ODI tournament in Sharjah in late October and November 1993. The team competed in another tournament, this time in India, later that November. They finished as runners-up, and Ambrose took four wickets in five matches. Immediately following this, West Indies toured Sri Lanka to play three ODIs and a Test, a rain-ruined match in which Ambrose took three wickets.|$|E
5|$|Pitching in {{minor league}} baseball, Pennock began to regain confidence. However, Boston manager Jack Barry used Pennock <b>sparingly</b> in the 1917 season, and Pennock {{enlisted in the}} United States Navy in 1918. Pennock pitched for a team fielded by the Navy, {{defeating}} a team composed {{of members of the}} United States Army in an exhibition for George VI, the King of England, in Stamford Bridge. After the game, Ed Barrow, the new manager of the Red Sox, signed Pennock to a new contract after promising to use him regularly during the 1919 season.|$|E
5|$|Playing college {{football}} for Louisiana State University (LSU), Taylor led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in scoring in 1956 and 1957 and earned first-team All-America honors as a senior. He {{was selected by}} the Packers {{in the second round}} of the 1958 NFL Draft and was used <b>sparingly</b> as a rookie, but with the arrival of coach Vince Lombardi in 1959 Taylor soon became the team's all-purpose back, especially when only a few yards were needed. In this role, his spirited performance against the Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical toughness.|$|E
5|$|Seymour {{subsequently}} {{signed as}} a free agent with the Boston Braves on February 25, 1913. After playing <b>sparingly</b> for the Braves during the 1913 season, the Braves released him on July 19, 1913, as they were carrying 26 players on their roster, though league rules permitted a maximum roster of 25. Seymour played for the Buffalo Bisons of the Class-A International League after being released by the Braves. He returned to professional baseball in 1918, playing in 13 games for the Newark Bears of the International League.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a total length of , {{including}} the atrium. It was mostly built of rectangular limestone blocks <b>sparingly</b> joined with mortar. Inside the apse, the mortar is red-coloured. The floor {{was covered by}} marble and stone tiles glued on top of red mortar in the narthex and white mortar elsewhere. Red and yellow bricks and pieces of bricks {{were used for the}} atrium, the arches, and possibly the dome; some brick pieces were used to fill spaces between the stones on the walls.|$|E
5|$|Utricularia purpurea, a bladderwort, {{comes from}} another genus of {{carnivorous}} plants {{and may have}} lost its appetite for carnivory, at least in part. This species can still trap and digest arthropod prey in its specialized bladder traps, but does so <b>sparingly.</b> Instead, it harbors a community of algae, zooplankton, and debris in the bladders, giving rise to {{the hypothesis that the}} bladders of U. purpurea favor a mutualistic interaction in place of a predator-prey relationship.|$|E
5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was the Second Coming of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only <b>sparingly.</b> He died in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Connie Mack signed Pennock to his Philadelphia Athletics in 1912. After using Pennock <b>sparingly,</b> and {{questioning}} his competitive drive, Mack sold Pennock to the Boston Red Sox in 1915. After returning from military service in 1919, Pennock became {{a regular contributor}} for the Red Sox. The Yankees acquired Pennock from the Red Sox after the 1922 season, and {{he served as a}} key member of the pitching staff as the Yankees won four World Series championships during his tenure with the team. After retiring as a player, Pennock served as a coach and farm system director for the Red Sox, and as general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5|$|Drafted by the Baltimore Colts in {{the twentieth}} round as the 203rd overall pick of the 1954 NFL Draft, Berry was {{considered}} a long-shot {{to make the team}} roster. After being used <b>sparingly</b> as a rookie, catching only 13 passes, he became a permanent starter on the team by his second NFL season when the Colts acquired quarterback Johnny Unitas. Over the next 12 seasons together, the two {{became one of the most}} dominant passing and catching duos in NFL history. Berry, who did not miss a single game until his eighth year in the league, led the NFL in receptions and receiving yards three times and in receiving touchdowns twice.|$|E
5|$|Harley {{continued}} to ply his {{trade in the}} SANFL reserves during the 1998 season, before being rewarded mid-season with a senior team debut for Port Adelaide in round fourteen against Geelong. The team opted to use Harley <b>sparingly</b> off the bench, with Harley's only meaningful contribution being a late goal scored with his only kick for the game. Returning to the Norwood reserves team, Harley helped the team reach their second successive Grand Final appearance against the Port Magpies and capture the reserves premiership. However, after struggling {{to break into the}} senior side, Harley was traded to Geelong during the off-season for the 37th pick in the 1998 AFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{selected}} by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) with the second pick in the 1946 NFL Draft, but did not sign with the team as he pondered returning to LSU to finish his studies. When the Miami Seahawks of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) offered him a $12,000 contract, however, he accepted it and joined the team. The Seahawks won just three games in 1946, the AAFC's first season of play, and Jones was traded along with two other players to the Brooklyn Dodgers, another AAFC team, in December. The Seahawks, meanwhile, folded and were moved to Baltimore after the season because of poor attendance and shaky finances. Jones played <b>sparingly</b> for the Dodgers {{in the last three}} games of the 1946 season, rushing for 62 yards on 19 carries.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{confirmed}} on 18 October 2011 {{that the}} 2011–12 season would be Del Piero's last with the club. The 2011–12 season under new manager Antonio Conte, his former Juventus teammate, saw Del Piero being used <b>sparingly,</b> and mainly as a substitute, {{because of the}} summer arrival of forward Mirko Vučinić from Roma. Del Piero scored his first goal in the new Juventus Stadium on 24 January 2012, in a 3–0 win over Roma in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia. Later in the season, Del Piero stated that he was surprised at Juventus president Andrea Agnelli's announcement regarding the club's decision not to offer him a new contract.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{employed as}} a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. His slow underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, but {{in an era when}} overarm bowling was becoming the standard, he was used <b>sparingly</b> in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results {{and not being able to}} raise a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only <b>sparingly</b> for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|The game runs on an {{upgraded}} version of Valve's proprietary Source engine, and features both the engine's advanced lighting effects, {{and a new}} version of its facial animation/expression technology. Upgrades to enemy AI allow Combine soldiers to utilize tactics previously unavailable to them. For example, Combine soldiers were given the ability to crouch while being fired upon in order to duck underneath the player's line of fire. The game's soundtrack was composed by Kelly Bailey. The music is used <b>sparingly</b> throughout; it plays primarily during scenes of major plot developments or particularly important action sequences such as large battles or when encountering a new enemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, {{as the second}} entry in a planned Ace Attorney trilogy. It was originally intended to feature the first game's prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, in all episodes; Franziska was created when the development team learned that Edgeworth had become popular among players, and Takumi {{wanted to use the}} character more carefully and <b>sparingly.</b> They only introduced one new gameplay mechanic in the game; Takumi wanted to keep the game focused on the core concept of finding lies, and to keep it simple enough for his mother to play. The game was positively received by critics, who generally liked the writing, but criticized the game's short length and the lack of the Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay mechanics that appeared in the previous game.|$|E
5|$|The three Nasser brothers, William, Elias and George, {{specifically}} requested Pflueger in 1920 {{after they}} received financing {{for a grand}} movie palace on Castro Street. In a hurry to see the 2,000-seat project completed, the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design. The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $300,000 ($ in today's dollars) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico. Churrigueresque elements were used <b>sparingly</b> on the facade, and ornate tile detailing was employed in the vestibule, ticket booth and the lobby. A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area. The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can procure various weapons, {{including}} melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break {{if they are}} not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, each of which is most damaging to a specific enemy. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical foes are weak against armor-piercing rounds. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful to organic targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player must use it <b>sparingly</b> and carefully search rooms for supplies.|$|E
5|$|U-30 {{began her}} first patrol {{operating}} from Lorient and her seventh overall on 13 July 1940. During {{a period of}} 12 days, she traveled {{as far south as}} Portugal and sank the 712-ton British ship Ellaroy on the 21st. Three days later, on 24 July, U-30 returned to Lorient, having experienced a malfunction in one of her engines. It then became clear that the boat was suffering a number of mechanical difficulties and as a result it was decided that she would need to be used <b>sparingly.</b> For her next patrol it was decided that she would leave from Lorient, but would return to Germany.|$|E
5|$|While some 55 ionic {{species have}} been {{reported}} in fresh ash leachates the most abundant species usually found are the cations Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and the anions Cl−, F− and SO42−. Molar ratios between ions present in leachates suggest that in many cases these elements are present as simple salts such as NaCl and CaSO4. In a sequential leaching experiment on ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, chloride salts were found to be the most readily soluble, followed by sulfate salts Fluoride compounds are in general only <b>sparingly</b> soluble (e.g., CaF2, MgF2), with the exception of fluoride salts of alkali metals and compounds such as calcium hexafluorosilicate (CaSiF6). The pH of fresh ash leachates is highly variable, depending on the presence of an acidic gas condensate (primarily {{as a consequence of the}} gases SO2, HCl and HF in the eruption plume) on the ash surface.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries <b>sparingly,</b> although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rested Lindwall for {{the second}} tour match against Leicestershire, which ended in an innings victory for the Australians. Lindwall {{returned}} for the next fixture against Yorkshire at Bradford, but bowled only nine overs {{for a total of}} 1/16. He made a duck in the first innings on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling, as Australia scraped home by four wickets. Lindwall was due in next when Australia collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory in the second innings. The tourists were effectively seven wickets down with the injured Sam Loxton unable to bat, but Neil Harvey and Don Tallon saw Australia to the target without further loss. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. They batted first and Lindwall managed only four, clean bowled by Alec Bedser, as Australia amassed 632. He then took the first two wickets to reduce Surrey to 2/15 in the first innings. Bradman used Lindwall <b>sparingly,</b> taking a match total of 3/45 from 25 overs as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Fingleton felt that Lindwall was at his fastest for the season during the Surrey match. One of Lindwall's bouncers flew over three feet above the batsman's head.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very <b>sparingly).</b> Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century the pursuit of {{witchcraft}} was largely {{taken over by the}} kirk sessions and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. The most intense witch hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more <b>sparingly</b> used and standards of evidence were raised. B. P. Levack suggests that there may also have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence {{due to the}} {{strength}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), which are <b>sparingly</b> water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted persistent organic pollutants; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are most often researched. PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|Prosecutions {{began to}} decline as trials were more tightly {{controlled}} by the judiciary and government, torture was more <b>sparingly</b> used and standards of evidence were raised. The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence. The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective. There {{may also have been}} a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, the economic and social tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at Dornoch in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736, making the legal pursuit of witches impossible. Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won their}} rematch with San Francisco 14–7 {{two weeks after}} losing to the 49ers at home. Cleveland rebounded from two poor rushing games. Runs by halfback Bill Lund and fullback Marion Motley set up touchdowns in the first half. Lund {{had a series of}} {{successful}} carries that set up the first touchdown in the first quarter, a short pass to Dante Lavelli from Otto Graham. Motley's 64-yard run in the second quarter was followed by a three-yard touchdown run by Gaylon Smith. Lund, however, turned his ankle in the first quarter and did not return to the game. Motley also suffered a pulled leg muscle in the second quarter and played <b>sparingly</b> thereafter. The 49ers came back in the fourth quarter with strong rushing from fullback Norm Standlee and Earle Parsons. Frankie Albert scored the team's lone touchdown on a one-yard run. San Francisco threatened to tie the game, reaching the Cleveland 19-yard line with five minutes to play, but the Browns defense stood firm and stopped the advance. The win put the Browns two games ahead of the 49ers in the AAFC's western conference with four games to play.|$|E
