However, in recent articles such as by ‘The Jakarta Post’, a more in depth and complex story is recognized by the media offering conflicting views on who the blame <b>should</b> <b>really</b> fall on.|$|E
25|$|Gluck {{had long}} pondered the {{fundamental}} problem of form and content in opera. He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres – opera buffa and opera seria – had strayed too far from what opera <b>should</b> <b>really</b> be and seemed unnatural. Opera buffa had long lost its original freshness. Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised. As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.|$|E

25|$|Some questionnaires, {{such as the}} Religious Orientation Scale, {{relate to}} {{different}} religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion {{for the purpose of}} psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion <b>should</b> <b>really</b> be seen as multidimensional.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{journalist}} Matt Taibbi {{had previously}} covered four other presidential campaigns prior to 2016. Taibbi documented the 2016 presidential campaign {{in a series}} of contemporaneous reports for Rolling Stone. He combined these dispatches into one publication for Insane Clown President. The book contains illustrations by Victor Juhasz, an artist for Rolling Stone. In a pre-inauguration interview with PBS, Taibbi explained his choice of Insane Clown President as the title, [...] "If the president-elect and his followers have complaints about the title, they <b>should</b> <b>really</b> blame Trump himself.

[...] For most viewers, it {{is a chance to}} catch up on the major awards contenders released in December. But studios and the filmgoers who have already seen those two films can benefit from creative risk-taking by filmmakers. He points to Cloverfield as one such gamble that succeeded.

500|$|Barrymore's alcohol {{dependence}} meant most studios {{were unwilling to}} employ him, but MGM risked casting him {{in the role of}} Mercutio in their 1936 film Romeo and Juliet. To minimize disruption to the schedule, the studio put Barrymore in Kelley's Rest Home, a sanatorium for alcoholics, but he continued to drink covertly and was disruptive on set. Basil Rathbone, who was playing Tybalt, later recounted that [...] "he was drinking and unreliable on the set... It was sad to see him in such a state." [...] Opinions on his portrayal were divided. Some critics, such as Welford Beaton of the Hollywood Spectator, thought [...] "Barrymore is an acting gem", although Gielgud was uncomplimentary, writing to Peggy Ashcroft that [...] "Barrymore, who is like a monstrous old male impersonator jumping through a hoop, <b>should</b> <b>really</b> have been shot." ...|$|E

Describing the filming process, Blair stated: [...] "Shooting the scenes for the bush fire and {{everything}} surrounding it - the wedding - the funeral - was so draining. It was full on." [...] Blair had to film scenes involving Carmella singing at Marco's funeral, which she deemed [...] "close to home" [...] because she had done it at her grandmother's funeral. She found it distressing, as they filmed in a real graveyard. She had previously been reluctant to sing on-screen but felt it was justified for Marco's funeral. Blair commented on Carmella's repetitive bad luck, stating: [...] "She's gone through so much already, just {{to get to this}} point. This <b>should</b> <b>really</b> be a happy time for her, but it's not." [...] After all the hurdles she faced, Carmella became a stronger person. Blair said it saw her become well-equipped to look after her child.|$|E

He credited this to the direction and improvements in the lighting, {{as well as the}} improved special effects. Pascale said that the guest appearances of Moses and Takei [...] "fits in the fine tradition of memorable Trek guest characters", saying that the [...] "alluring" [...] Moses played Alana with a [...] "subtle charm".

Of the series' use of green screen for sets, Blackwell stated [...] "{{sometimes}} it really works and sometimes the CGI sets could use improvement". He also felt that Amanda Tapping was convincing as a British scientist. In conclusion, Blackwell stated [...] "Sanctuary does {{take a while to}} kick in, but it is a very good series once the writers actually write something with depth." [...] Alex Walker of Den of Geek rated the first season three stars out of five, stating [...] "the acting and scripting is good, but Sanctuary lacks the wit and charm of the genre's top shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica. Also, the way some episodes alternate between fighting and exposition gives the impression of watching someone else play a videogame." [...] Walker also dubbed it a [...] "poor man's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but said that it [...] "makes for [...] "agreeable early-evening viewing". Walker also believed that the DVD of the first season <b>should</b> <b>really</b> be for [...] "die-hard fans only".|$|E

Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of why we <b>should</b> <b>really</b> care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Born Villain was {{released}} worldwide from April 30, {{with a cover}} of Carly Simon's [...] "You're So Vain" [...] included on all editions as a bonus track. This cover was recorded after the album had been completed, and features Johnny Depp performing guitar. The pair were introduced when Manson appeared as an extra on 21 Jump Street when he was 19, although [...] "You're So Vain" [...] is their first musical collaboration. The cover originated from a jam session, with Manson explaining that they [...] "started playing old blues songs and I said, 'My record's done, but we <b>should</b> <b>really</b> do a song {{to add to the}} end of it, {{as if it were a}} movie.'" [...] He described the cover's placement on the album as: [...] "It's like the movie's over, and this is playing at the end title credits." [...] It was later included on the soundtrack to the documentary West of Memphis. Dean Karr, who served as the photographer on Manson's cover shoot for the March 2012 issue of Revolver, was commissioned to create the album's cover art. He had previously worked on the artwork accompanying Antichrist Superstar. However, the cover image would later be revealed to be the work of photographer Lindsay Usich, with Karr's photography being used for the album's first single, [...] "No Reflection".|$|E

500|$|After {{pictures}} of Spears and Trawick carrying replica guns on set surfaced online, the Hackney London Borough Council criticized her for [...] "promoting gun violence", since {{the area had}} been badly affected by the 2011 England riots. The Council told London Tonight {{that they had not}} agreed to the use of replica guns at Stoke Newington Town Hall, and that they would be raising the matter with the production company. Councillor Ian Rathbone added that Spears should apologize and make a sizeable donation to a Hackney charity [...] "for the rudeness and damage she's done to this community." [...] When asked if she thought the council was overreacting, Hackney MP Diane Abbott insisted: [...] "It is only a music video but it's images like this, with popstars glamorising gangs, which means that some young people... get drawn in. Britney <b>should</b> <b>really</b> know better." [...] Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly explained that the United Kingdom [...] "is not a place that readily embraces guns. Rather, it's a place where guns are rare, gun licensing is tightly controlled, and the entire establishment has been in a panic about gun use on its streets for the last three years." [...] On September 26, 2011, Spears' representatives released a statement to MTV News saying, [...] "The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened."

500|$|Madonna first {{performed}} [...] "Living for Love" [...] at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015. She confirmed {{her appearance}} at the ceremony, by uploading {{an image of the}} Grammy trophy wrapped with black strings like the Internet memes for the cover art of Rebel Heart. The singer was dressed in a one-piece outfit in matador red, surrounded by male dancers as Minotaurs similar to the song's music video. It was developed by designer Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy and styled by Akerlund. The performance was described as a [...] "beautiful story for why the matadors fight the bulls and that also reflects life". After being introduced by singers Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj, the performance began with images of Madonna on a kabuki screen talking about starting a revolution. She emerged from the screen and started singing, surrounded by the dancers. Near the end, the singer encouraged the audience to sing-along with her, finally being pulled atop the stage on a wire. Dina Gachman from Forbes reported that Madonna's performance was the most-watched moment of the night. Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone described it as [...] "the legendary singer was out for blood with her first live performance [...] ". Shauna Murphy from MTV News observed Illuminati symbolism with the performance, including rituals, organized religion homage and a metaphor for death. MuuMuse's Bradley Stern listed it as the best performance of the Grammys, saying that [...] "this is how a major pop performance <b>should</b> <b>really</b> look". Her effort to sing live without Auto-Tune during the choreographed performance was also heavily praised.|$|E
500|$|NXT Arrival {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Aaron Oster of the Baltimore Sun described the event as fantastic, but [...] "marred by technical issues". He streamed the show live and the stream cut out from Breeze-Woods, which {{caused him to}} miss that match {{and half of the}} main event. Technical issues aside, Oster felt that Arrival [...] "was a phenomenal show that gave the WWE a chance to show off the NXT roster". He also stated that all three promoted matches met or exceeded his expectations. Cesaro and Zayn's match [...] "wasn't the same as their previous encounters, and they actually built on it" [...] and that [...] "they actually told the story that they knew each other well in the ring, and used it to put on a fantastic 20-minute match". Oster gave high praise to the women's match, he thought it [...] "was better than nearly all of the Divas matches on the main roster for the past few years, featuring some strong chain wrestling and submission moves." [...] He also noted that Emma's sitout powerbomb sparked the crowd to chant [...] "Better than Batista". For the main event, Oster felt that there were [...] "some interesting spots with some good storytelling, even if there weren't the typical brutal spots associated with a ladder match", so it was not [...] "overly special" [...] but still [...] "pretty good". Lastly, Oster praised the announcers, who [...] "worked perfectly together in a traditional sports style, which truly added to the broadcast. WWE <b>should</b> <b>really</b> consider going back to this format for the main shows".|$|E
