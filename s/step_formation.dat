25|$|The {{addition}} and its counterpart, the elimination, are reactions which {{change the}} number of substitutents on the carbon atom, and form or cleave multiple bonds. Double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group. Similar to the nucleophilic substitution, there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order. In the E1 mechanism, the leaving group is ejected first, forming a carbocation. The next <b>step,</b> <b>formation</b> of the double bond, takes place with elimination of a proton (deprotonation). The leaving order is reversed in the E1cb mechanism, that is the proton is split off first. This mechanism requires participation of a base. Because of the similar conditions, both reactions in the E1 or E1cb elimination always compete with the SN1 substitution.|$|E

40|$|Double-layer <b>step</b> <b>formation</b> on Si(100) {{substrates}} is {{a crucial}} prerequisite for antiphase-domain free III–V compound semiconductor heteroepitaxy. Due to its unequaled relevance in microelectronics, the (100) oriented surface of silicon {{is by far the}} most studied semiconductor surface. However, Si(100) preparation in hydrogen process gas ambient, which is commonly employed for Si and III–V device preparation, is completely different from preparation in ultra-high vacuum due to strong interaction between H 2 and the Si surface, leading to a kinetically driven different <b>step</b> <b>formation.</b> Here, we observe chemical layer-by-layer removal of surface atoms from the terraces at the Si(100) surface during annealing in hydrogen ambient. Mutually perpendicularly oriented dimers on subsequently removed monolayers induce oscillations in the in situ reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS) signal. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements support a model, where surface atom removal proceeds by formation and anisotropic expansion of vacancy islands on the terraces. We determined an activation energy E d of 2. 75 ± 0. 20 eV for Si etching in H 2 ambient by transient in situ RAS measurements.

40|$|The {{results of}} a density-functional-theory study of the {{formation}} energies of (100) - and (111) -faceted steps on the Pt(111) surface, {{as well as of the}} barrier for diffusion of an adatom on the flat surface, are presented. The <b>step</b> <b>formation</b> energies are found to be in a ratio of 0. 88 in favour of the (111) -faceted step, in excellent agreement with experiment; the equilibrium shape of islands should therefore clearly be non-hexagonal. The origin of the difference between the two steps is discussed in terms of the release of stress at the surface through relaxation. For the diffusion barrier, we also find relaxation to be important, leading to a 20 % decrease of its energy. The value we obtain, 0. 33 eV, however remains higher than available experimental data; possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. We find the ratio of <b>step</b> <b>formation</b> energies and the diffusion barrier to be the same whether using the local-density approximation or the generalized-gradient approximation for the exchange-and-correlation energy.
