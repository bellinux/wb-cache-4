40|$|International audienceInsecticides {{have long}} been used as the main method in {{limiting}} agricultural pests, but their widespread use has resulted in environmental pollution, development of resistances, and biodiversity reduction. The effects of insecticides at low residual doses on both the targeted crop pest species and beneficial insects have become a major concern. In particular, these low doses can induce unexpected positive (hormetic) effects on pest insects, such as surges in population growth exceeding {{what would have been}} observed without pesticide application. Methomyl and chlorpyrifos are two insecticides commonly used to control the population levels of the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis, a major pest moth. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effects of <b>sublethal</b> <b>doses</b> of these two pesticides, known to present a residual activity and persistence in the environment, on the moth physiology. Using a metabolomic approach, we showed that <b>sublethal</b> <b>doses</b> of methomyl and chlorpyrifos have a systemic effect on the treated insects. We also demonstrated a behavioral disruption of S. littoralis larvae exposed to <b>sublethal</b> <b>doses</b> of methomyl, whereas no effects were observed for the same doses of chlorpyrifos. Interestingly, we highlighted that <b>sublethal</b> <b>doses</b> of both pesticides did not induce a change in acetylcholinesterase activity in head of exposed larva...|$|R

50|$|Paddy and Afghan melons (collectively {{referred}} to as wild melons) sometimes occur in mixed infestations in Australia. They vary only slightly in colour and appearance, with the Citrullus lanatus leaves slightly more variegated than those of Cucumis myriocarpus. Fruit size is the clearest identifying factor. However, management of all wild melons is similar, apart from some variation in sensitivity to the herbicide glyphosate. Mechanical removal of small infestations is the simplest control method, and cultivation at early stages of growth can be effective. Large infestations are sometimes controlled by the spray-graze method, in which plants are sprayed with a <b>sublethal</b> <b>dose</b> of hormone herbicide {{to make them more}} palatable to stock, and the area is heavily grazed three days later. Toxicity is managed by making other feed available.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Time-course {{growth chamber}} studies were {{conducted}} on little mallow (Malva parviflora L.) to determine whether <b>sublethal</b> <b>doses</b> of lactofen (1 '-(carboethoxy) ethyl- 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 2 - nitrobenzoate) would enhance uptake of glyphosate (N'-(phosphonomethyl) glycine) by altering membrane permeability. Lactofen-induced membrane peroxidation was determined by harvesting leaf discs, measuring stress ethylene evolution, and recording increases in electrical conductivity. <b>Sublethal</b> <b>doses</b> were established by determining {{the point at which}} stress ethylene was evolved, but increases in electrical conductivity were not significant; dosages above this point caused significant disruption of membrane integrity. Because shikimate accumulation requires biochemically active cells and shikimic acid concentration is directly correlated with glyphosate dose, glyphosate entry into cells was determined by measuring increases in shikimic acid content over time. By 84 h after application, shikimate accumulation in little mallow increased three- to four-fold when <b>sublethal</b> <b>doses</b> of lactofen were added to glyphosate spray solutions compared with glyphosate alone. Because light-activation of lactofen was not required, enhancement of cellular uptake of glyphosate was not attributed to subtle membrane perturbations induced by the peroxidative mechanism of action of <b>sublethal</b> lactofen <b>doses.</b> The absence of thick epicuticular wax deposits on little mallow leaf surfaces was revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Abrading cuticles physically did not enhance shikimate levels when glyphosate was applied alone or in combination with lactofen. The cuticle therefore was not a significant barrier to glyphosate uptake in little mallow grown under conditions of these experiments. The enhancing effect of lactofen on cellular uptake of glyphosate occurred at the cellular level but was not due to the normal light-activated mechanism of lactofen action...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{possibility}} that ricin may be used as a bioweapon against human populations, we examined the pathological consequences that occur in mice after introduction of ricin into the pulmonary system. Intratracheal instillation of a lethal dose of ricin (20 μg/ 100 g body weight) resulted in a hemorrhagic inflammatory response in multiple organs, accompanied by activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, increased synthesis of proinflammatory RNA transcripts, and increased levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines. A <b>sublethal</b> <b>dose</b> of instilled ricin (2 μg/ 100 g body weight) induced a similar response in lungs but did not cause detectable damage in other organs. Lungs of mice that recovered from a <b>sublethal</b> <b>dose</b> of ricin displayed evidence of fibrosis and residual damage. A lethal dose of ricin caused accumulation of proinflammatory RNA transcripts and substantial damage to 28 S rRNA of multiple organs, including lung, kidney, spleen, liver, and blood, demonstrating that instilled ricin gained access to the circulation. The kidneys of mice instilled with a lethal dose of ricin showed accumulation of fibrin/fibrinogen in glomerular capillaries, increased numbers of glomerular leukocytes, and impairment of kidney function.
