5000|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, a <b>slip</b> fielder (collectively, a <b>slip</b> cordon or the <b>slips)</b> is placed behind the batsman on the off side of the field. They are placed {{with the aim of}} {{catching}} an edged ball which is beyond the wicket-keeper's reach. Many teams employ two or three <b>slips</b> (numbered from the <b>slip</b> fielder closest to the wicket-keeper: first <b>slip,</b> second <b>slip,</b> etc.). A floating <b>slip</b> is sometimes employed, usually in limited over games, who patrols an area in the <b>slip</b> cordon that would ordinarily be occupied by more than one fielder. The <b>slip</b> cordon's distance from the batsman increases with the pace of the bowler; generally they will be marginally further away from the batsman than the wicketkeeper is. Because of the resulting geometry, spin bowlers generally have fewer <b>slips</b> in the cordon than a fast bowler would in an equivalent game situation. As fielding in the <b>slips</b> requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept catchers in the team will make up the <b>slip</b> cordon. Most <b>slip</b> fielders are top order batsmen. Specialist <b>slip</b> fielders are sometimes called [...] "slippers".|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{find the}} {{difference}} between the <b>slip</b> surface having minimum factor of safety(called critical <b>slip</b> surface in deterministic analysis of slopes) and the <b>slip</b> surface having minimum reliability index(called critical reliability <b>slip</b> surface). The performance function used in reliability analysis was formulated by unbalanced thrust force method and the value of reliability index regarding given potential <b>slip</b> surface was obtained by Rosenbleuth method. The harmony search algorithm was adopted to alter the potential <b>slip</b> surface in order to locate the critical reliability <b>slip</b> surface. One complicated soil slope was analyzed and the results have shown that the critical <b>slip</b> surface is considerably different from critical reliability <b>slip</b> surface for multi-layer slopes and the reliability index of critical <b>slip</b> surface is larger than that of critical reliability <b>slip</b> surface...|$|R
50|$|In {{materials}} science, a <b>slip</b> system {{describes the}} set of symmetrically identical <b>slip</b> planes and associated family of <b>slip</b> directions for which dislocation motion can easily occur and lead to plastic deformation.An external force makes parts of the crystal lattice glide along each other, changing the material's geometry.Depending {{on the type of}} lattice, different <b>slip</b> systems are present in the material.More specifically, <b>slip</b> occurs on close-packed planes (those containing the greatest number of atoms per area), and in close-packed directions (most atoms per length). The magnitude and direction of <b>slip</b> are represented by the Burgers vector.The picture on the right shows a schematic view of the <b>slip</b> mechanism.The <b>slip</b> planes and <b>slip</b> directions in a crystal have specific crystallographic forms.The <b>slip</b> planes are normally the planes with the highest density of atoms, i.e., those most closely spaced, and the direction of the <b>slip</b> is the direction in the <b>slip</b> plane that corresponds to one of the shortest lattice translation vectors.Often, this is the direction in which atoms are most closely spaced.A <b>slip</b> plane and a <b>slip</b> direction constitute a <b>slip</b> system.A critical resolved shear stress is required to initiate a <b>slip.</b> <b>Slip</b> is an important mode of deformation mechanism in crystals.For metals and technically used metallic alloys it {{is by far the most}} important deformation mechanism and subject to current research in materials science.|$|R
5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays <b>slipped</b> {{and fell}} {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged {{themselves}} into the wall {{where he had been}} standing moments before. While the attackers reloaded, Hays <b>slipped</b> inside and for about an hour an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped the attackers injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E

To get better resolution for co-seismic and post-seismic <b>slip</b> distribution, we imposed a weak constraint as a priori information of the co-seismic <b>slip</b> determined by seismic wave analyses. We found that the post-seismic <b>slip</b> during 100 days following the main-shock amount to as much moment release as the main-shock, and that the sites of co-seismic <b>slip</b> and post-seismic <b>slip</b> are partitioning on a plate boundary region in complimentary fashion. The major post-seismic <b>slip</b> was triggered by the mainshock in {{western side of the}} co-seismic <b>slip,</b> and the extent of the post-seismic <b>slip</b> is almost unchanged with time. It rapidly developed a shear stress concentration ahead of the <b>slip</b> area, and triggered the largest aftershock. ...|$|R
40|$|A 2 -D {{model of}} a fault plane with inhomgeneous <b>slip</b> {{resistance}} is investigated using a finite element method. <b>Slip</b> is nucleated at a weak spot, and propagates initially in both directions. At {{one side of the}} nucleation point, the resistance to <b>slip</b> is assumed t o increase along the fault. This causes the <b>slipping</b> edge to reverse its direction. In this way unidirectional <b>slip</b> with o n e leading and one trailing edge emerges. At the leading edge <b>slip</b> is assumed to propagate according to a critical shear stress criterion combined with a <b>slip</b> weakening law. At the trailing edge, where the process of healing occurs, <b>slip</b> is assumed to be arrested in a n energy-neutral way. The simulations indicate that a steady state unidirectional <b>slip</b> is approached. The edge velocities can be very high and even overshoot the shear wave velocity.

40|$|Local <b>slip</b> {{velocity}} is {{an important}} factor in mass,momentum and heat transfer of riser reactors. Based on the EMMS model, the qualitative and quantitative analysis is made for local <b>slip</b> velocity and its components (the <b>slip</b> velocity in the dense phase (cluster), the <b>slip</b> velocity in the dilute phase and the <b>slip</b> velocity between dense phase and dilute phase). It is found that the <b>slip</b> velocity between dense phase and dilute phase makes the most contribution to the local <b>slip</b> velocity and clusters lead to the high local <b>slip</b> velocity, from which the correlation of local <b>slip</b> velocity with local voidage is derived. Using this correlation, the local gas-solids <b>slip</b> velocities in gas-solids up-risers are predicted. Calculation results are well consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, the effects of operating conditions on local <b>slip</b> velocities are discussed. It is concluded that local <b>slip</b> velocity increases with the increase of solids circulating rate and decreases with the increase of superficial gas velocity...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>slip</b> bands and grain boundaries in commercial-purity titanium was examined using cross-correlation-based electron backscatter diffraction. At a low strain level, {{three types of}} interactions were observed: blocked <b>slip</b> band with stress concentration; <b>slip</b> transfer; and blocked <b>slip</b> band with no stress concentration. The stress concentration induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> band was fitted with Eshelby's theoretical model, from which a Hall-Petch coefficient was deduced. It {{was found that the}} Hall-Petch coefficient varies with the individual grain boundary. We investigated the geometric alignment between the <b>slip</b> band and various <b>slip</b> systems to the neighbouring grain. Stress concentration can be induced by the blocked <b>slip</b> band if the <b>slip</b> system is poorly aligned with prismatic, pyramidal or basal <b>slip</b> systems in the neighbouring grain. Transfer of <b>slip</b> across the boundary occurs when there is good alignment on prismatic or pyramidal <b>slip</b> systems. Other stress-relieving mechanisms are possible when the best alignment is not with the <b>slip</b> system that has the lower critical resolved shear stress. © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.
