In the first one, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> a model {{and were asked to}} evaluate and improve it. In the second activity, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> neither an initial model, nor any data. The results show that when <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> an initial model, their improved model emulated the form of the initial model. When the students did not receive an initial model, they developed a variety of models which included polynomial, piecewise define function and sinusoidal functions. In this case students focused more on the movement of the elevator and on understanding its operation...|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the language policy for Mandarin and Malay, Indian <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> {{a wider variety of}} Indian languages to choose from. For example, Indian students speaking Dravidian languages study Tamil as a Mother Tongue. However, schools with low numbers of Tamil students might not provide Tamil language classes. As a result, students from such schools will attend Tamil language classes at the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre (UPTLC). On the other hand, Indian students who speak non-Dravidian languages can choose from Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu. However, as with Tamil, only certain schools offer these non-Dravidian languages. Thus, students will attend their respective language classes at designated language centres, held by the Board for the Teaching and Testing of South Asian Languages (BTTSAL).|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} quotas was largely {{reported}} to have resulted {{in an increase in}} the percentage of Bumiputra entering public universities. The perceived bias towards Bumiputras has meant that non-Bumiputra who can afford to do so choose to enter private colleges or to go overseas to further their education. There is a significant proportion of non-Bumiputra who do not enter into contention for admission to public universities. It is also alleged that during the marking of examination scripts in the Government exams, that Malay/Bumiputra <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> additional points even before the students sit for the exams. As a result, despite the removal of the Quota system, this alleged unfair advantage gives more places to undeserving students of Malay origin.|$|E
