25|$|It was {{pleasant}} {{to see the}} women riding alone on horseback, managing their mounts to perfection. They formed a sharp contrast to their Persian sisters, who either <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> their husbands or have their steeds led by the bridle; and instead of keeping silence in public, as is the rule for the shrouded women of Iran, these farmers' wives chaffered and haggled with {{the men in the}} bazar outside the city, transacting business with their veils thrown back.|$|E
25|$|The Streltsy made it {{possible}} for Sophia, the Miloslavskys (the clan of Ivan) and their allies to insist that Peter and Ivan be proclaimed joint Tsars, with Ivan being acclaimed as the senior. Sophia acted as regent during the minority of the sovereigns and exercised all power. For seven years, she ruled as an autocrat. A large hole was cut {{in the back of the}} dual-seated throne used by Ivan and Peter. Sophia would <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> the throne and listen as Peter conversed with nobles, while feeding him information and giving him responses to questions and problems. This throne can be seen in the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow.|$|E

25|$|There may be many drums at a pow wow, {{especially}} weekend or {{week long}} ones, but each pow wow features a host drum which is accorded great respect {{and the most}} authority. The members of drum groups are often family, extended family, or friends. Groups are then often named for families, geographic locations, tribal societies, or more colorful names. Many groups display their names on jackets, caps, vehicles, and chairs. Traditionally only men would drum and women would <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> the men singing high harmonies. Beginning in the mid-1970s, women began drumming with men and seconding, or singing, an octave higher, the song. Today, there are mixed-gender and all-female drum groups.|$|E
25|$|Members {{sit in a}} {{hemicycle}} {{according to}} their political groups arranged mainly from left to right, although with the non-attached members towards the back and right of the chamber. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for interpretation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining segment of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff <b>sit.</b> <b>Behind</b> them there is an EU flag attached to the wall with national flags in rows each side of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{provision}} of athletics stadiums in England is very poor compared to most other developed countries. The {{main reason for}} this is that it is not considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> an athletics track. This means that athletics stadiums have to be separately financed and this can only be done with public funds, which have not been forthcoming on a large scale. The largest athletics stadium built in the UK since the Second World War, the 38,000-capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, was reconfigured for football-only use after that event. The largest existing stadium is the 25,000 seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield. London's largest athletics venue is Crystal Palace, which has just 15,500 permanent seats. It will be superseded by the Olympic Stadium, which will be built as an 80,000 seater for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but will most likely be reduced to 60,000 seats after the Games with the London organising committee's decision to accept West Ham United's bid to take over the stadium. There are two Athletic stadiums in Birmingham the Alexander Stadium (12,700 capacity) which is home to UK Athletics and there is also the National Indoor Arena (14,150) which is also used for other events.|$|E

By the time West Ham moved in, the capacity was reduced to 60,000, and the track remained in place, with movable seating added to allow optimal configurations for both athletics and football. Since the retention of the track was a necessary condition for tenancy, the Olympic Stadium won the right to host the 2017 World Championships in Athletics.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Adrian Boult succeeded Pitt as {{director}} of music for the BBC, the violinist Albert Sammons and the violist Lionel Tertis had scouted for new talent around the country {{on behalf of the}} corporation. Twenty-seven players had been offered positions in the new orchestra. Among those who joined were Aubrey Brain, Arthur Catterall, Eugene Cruft, Sidonie Goossens, Lauri Kennedy and Frederick Thurston. Although many of the principals were stars recruited from the LSO, the Hallé and other orchestras, a high proportion of the rank and file members were fresh from music colleges. Boult wrote, [...] "a brilliant group of young and inexperienced players came to <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> the well-known old stagers." ...|$|E

Images of figures connected to music are carved into the front (west), where the choir would sit, and images of scholars are carved into the back (east), where faculty would <b>sit.</b> <b>Behind</b> the altar are carved images of eight religious figures: four Catholic saints to the north, and four leaders of Protestantism to the south. The epic windows reinforce the idea of a [...] "Catholic north" [...] and a [...] "Protestant south": Catholics wrote the north epics and Protestants the south epics.

2500|$|The simple, flat-sided {{fuselage}} was a steel-tube {{structure with}} four longerons, linked by welded struts, defining the shape. Internal piano wire bracing stiffened the fuselage, which was fabric-covered. [...] The open cockpit {{was over the}} rear wing and was large enough for a passenger to <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> the pilot, straddling a box seat.

All of these roles were opposite Palin (who Cleese often claims is his favourite Python to work with)—the comic contrast between the towering Cleese's crazed aggression and the shorter Palin's shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese–Palin dynamic is reversed, as in [...] "Fish Licence", wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the death}} rate among the air gunners {{remained}} exceptionally high and not until late models produced after 1944, was the 13mm (.5 in) rear plate of the armour shell moved rearwards into the (wooden) rear fuselage to allow a gunner to <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> the fuel tank. The armour did not extend to the rear or below although side armour panels were riveted to the rear armour plate to protect the ammunition tank for the UBT machine gun, providing some measure of protection.

During a week of shows from Los Angeles, Letterman was having Larry [...] "Bud" [...] Melman (Calvert DeForest) deliver his [...] "Top Ten Lists" [...] under the guise that a famous personality would be delivering the list, instead. On the last show of the week, Letterman indicated that Carson would be delivering the list. Instead, DeForest delivered the list, insulted the audience (in keeping with the gag), and walked off to polite applause. Letterman then indicated that the card he was given {{did not have the}} proper list on it and asked that the [...] "real" [...] list be brought out. On that cue, the real Carson emerged from behind the curtain (as Letterman's band played [...] "Johnny's Theme"), an appearance that prompted a standing ovation from the audience. Carson then asked to <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> Letterman's desk; Letterman obliged, as the audience continued to cheer and applaud. After some moments, Carson departed from the show without having spoken to the audience. He later cited acute laryngitis as the reason for his silence. This turned out to be Carson's last television appearance.|$|E
2500|$|By 664, Empress Wu, {{who felt}} that her power was well established, was {{extending}} her influence further in the political arena, and when the eunuch Wang Fusheng (王伏勝) reported to Emperor Gaozong that she had engaged the sorcerer Guo Xingzhen (郭行真) – an act that was strictly forbidden—Emperor Gaozong, in anger, summoned the chancellor Shangguan Yi to consult Shangguan. [...] Shangguan suggested that he depose Empress Wu. [...] He agreed, and had Shangguan draft an edict to that effect. [...] However, Empress Wu had received information that that was happening, and she emerged to defend herself. [...] Emperor Gaozong could not carry out the removal, and instead blamed Shangguan. [...] As both Shangguan and Wang had previously served the former crown prince Li Zhong, Empress Wu had Xu Jingzong falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of conspiring against Emperor Gaozong's life. [...] Around the new year 665, Shangguan and Wang were executed, and Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide. [...] From this point on, whenever Emperor Gaozong presided over imperial meetings, Empress Wu would <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> a pearl screen behind him to hear the reports as well, and political power largely fell into her hands.

Before you rise [...] a vine covered garden wall, broken here and there with graceful arches. Through the archways spreads the soft light of a harvest moon and the dim glow casts shadows over the somber colored walls. [...] Overhead myriads of stars are twinkling in an azure blue sky and soft, fleecy clouds are drifting gently with the breeze. Picture all this in your mind and you have a fair conception of the interior of the Palace theater—Marion's new half million dollar playhouse. The new theater is Spanish in design in all its details. From the walls and the mural decorations to the reproduction of period furniture in the lounges the Spanish design is followed.... the designer of the theater has let his fancy take full flight. Here and there patches of red brick appear, as through [...] the plaster had fallen from the walls. A niche in the wall is cleverly adapted to hold a drinking fountain. The view from the balcony is even better than the lower floor. As in the lower floor view of the stage is unobstructed by pillars. he balcony being of cantilever construction removes the necessity of supporting it with posts and pillars which necessarily cut off the view of the unfortunate patron who is forced to <b>sit</b> <b>behind</b> one.|$|E
