5|$|The Category A listed ruined Old St Peter's Church (St. Peter's Kirk) {{is one of}} {{the older}} churches in Scotland, dated to at least 1125, and at one time it was the {{principal}} church for the county, administered by the Bishops of Caithness. The church held hearings against criminal activity and determined how those caught <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> In 1701, a woman who had a relationship with a Dutch sailor had her head shaved and was publicly shamed, paraded through the town by the local hangman.|$|E
5|$|Further unrest was {{triggered}} when an Imperial slave named Stephanus was robbed while travelling near Beth-horon. Troops sent by Cumanus {{to arrest the}} leading men of the nearby villages began plundering the area. One of them, finding {{a copy of the}} Torah, destroyed it in view of the villagers while shouting blasphemies. Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion, a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima, demanding that the guilty party <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded in front of his accusers, temporarily restoring the calm.|$|E

5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that this policy affords the public {{a sense of}} revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished.

David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.|$|E
25|$|In medieval England, {{the penalty}} for {{a vast number of}} serious crimes, {{including}} murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. If the jury has only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> somehow, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.|$|E

25|$|For unclear reasons, the {{treatment}} of homosexuality in Twelver Shia jurisprudence is generally harsher than in Sunni fiqh, while Zaydi and Isma'ili Shia jurists took positions similar to the Sunnis. Where flogging is prescribed, {{there is a tendency}} for indulgence and some recommend that the prescribed penalty should not be applied in full, with Ibn Hazm reducing the number of strokes to 10. There was debate as to whether the active and passive partners in anal sex <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> equally. Beyond penetrative anal sex, there was “general agreement” that “other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offenses, subject only to discretionary punishment.” Some jurists viewed sexual intercourse as possible only for an individual who possesses a phallus; hence those definitions of sexual intercourse that rely on the entry of as little of the corona of the phallus into a partner's orifice. Since women do not possess a phallus and cannot have intercourse with one another, they are, in this interpretation, physically incapable of committing zinā.|$|E
500|$|The Boston elites were mortified at this resistance. [...] Governor Bowdoin {{commanded}} {{the legislature to}} [...] "vindicate the insulted dignity of government." [...] Samuel Adams claimed that foreigners ("British emissaries") were instigating treason among the commoners, and he helped draw up a Riot Act, and a resolution suspending habeas corpus in order to permit the authorities to keep people in jail without trial. Adams proposed a new legal distinction: that rebellion in a republic, unlike in a monarchy, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> by execution.|$|E
500|$|Ali's {{caliphate}} was coincident with First Fitna. Though Ali {{was elected}} as the fourth Rashidun (the [...] "rightly guided") caliph {{five days after}} Uthman's death, he faced opposition during his rule. On one hand, A'isha, Talhah and Al-Zubayr revolted against him in Mecca {{and on the other}} hand Muawiyah I, the Umayyad governor of Levant, refused to pledge allegiance to him as the new caliph. Therefore, a civil war about succession to the office of the caliphate took place. Ali's opponents asked the killers of Uthman <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> Ali, first emerged victorious at the Battle of Camel in 656, against an army primarily led by Muhammad's wife Aisha and other sahaba. Then, Ali also fought the Battle of Siffin in 657 against Muawiyah. The battle ended in a stalemate with Ali entering into arbitration with Muawiyah.|$|E

50|$|The {{situation}} of the Roman Empire became dire in 235 AD, when emperor Alexander Severus was murdered by his own troops. Many Roman legions had been defeated during a campaign against Germanic peoples raiding across the borders, while the emperor was focused primarily on the dangers from the Sassanid Persian Empire. Leading his troops personally, Alexander Severus resorted to diplomacy and paying tribute {{in an attempt to}} pacify the Germanic chieftains quickly. According to Herodian this cost him the respect of his troops, who may have felt they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punishing</b> the tribes who were intruding on Rome's territory.|$|R

[...] Narendra said, [...] "We will appeal in High Court for death penalty to the main accused, Ganga Raj.

[...] Seema seconded Narendra's concerns, [...] "We would have been happier if the main accused was also given the death sentence.

500|$|In February 1768, the British {{captured}} Mangalore and Canara from Hyder. At {{the end of}} {{the same}} year, Hyder, along with his son Tipu Sultan, defeated the British and recaptured Mangalore. After the conquest, Hyder was informed ( [...] name of the informed was not known hence not reliable on the following concept)that the Mangalorean Catholics had helped the British in their conquest of Mangalore. Hyder believed that this behaviour amounted to treachery against the sovereign [...] Summoning a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore, he asked for suggestions as to how the Mangalorean Catholics <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> The Portuguese officer ( [...] Portuguese officer name still questionable on credibility) suggested the death penalty for those Catholics who had helped the British, as it was the standard punishment for betraying a sovereign. Rather than follow this advice, Hyder chose a diplomatic stance and imprisoned Christians found guilty of treachery instead of executing them ( [...] Not a single person was executed is Questionable) [...] Later, he opened negotiations with the Portuguese. Agreement was reached and suspicions against the clergy and the Christians were removed and they were no longer chastised. During Hyder's regime, Roman Catholicism in Mangalore and the Mangalorean Catholic community continued to flourish.|$|E
500|$|Kant viewed {{humans as}} being {{subject to the}} animalistic desires of self-{{preservation}}, species-preservation, and the preservation of enjoyment. He argued that humans {{have a duty to}} avoid maxims that harm or degrade themselves, including suicide, sexual degradation, and drunkenness. This led Kant to regard sexual intercourse as degrading because it reduces humans to an object of pleasure. He admitted sex only within marriage, which he regarded as [...] "a merely animal union". He believed that masturbation is worse than suicide, reducing a person's status to below that of an animal; he argued that rape <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> with castration and that bestiality requires expulsion from society. Feminist philosopher Catharine MacKinnon has argued that many contemporary practices would be deemed immoral by Kant's standards because they dehumanize women. Sexual harassment, prostitution and pornography, she argues, objectify women and do not meet Kant's standard of human autonomy. Commercial sex has been criticised for turning both parties into objects (and thus using them as a means to an end); mutual consent is problematic because in consenting, people choose to objectify themselves. Alan Soble has noted that more liberal Kantian ethicists believe that, depending on other contextual factors, the consent of women can vindicate their participation in pornography and prostitution.|$|E
