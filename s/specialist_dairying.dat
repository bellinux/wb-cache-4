The study backed up for results from the system of collecting accountancy data agricultural farms (FADN). This data was collected from agricultural holdings with the economic size below 4, 4 - 8, 8 - 16, 16 - 40, 40 - 100 and higher than 100 ESU (European Size Unit) in 2008 and 2009. The field of ob-servation of this article included specialist cereals, oilseed and protein crops farms, specialist permanent crops farms, <b>specialist</b> <b>dairying</b> farms and specialist granivores farms. The indicators of effectiveness and competitiveness was income per FWU (Family Work Unit) and management income. The competitive specialist cereal farms have 16 - 40 ESU and about 100 hectare UAA (utilised agricultural area), specialist permanent crops farms have 40 - 100 ESU and about 7 hectare UAA and <b>specialist</b> <b>dairying</b> farm have 28 dairy cows. Moreover, the competitive specialist granivores farms have 36 cows or 400 - 600 tones of poultry meat from farm. The estimate number of competitive farms in 2010 equalled to two hundred twenty thousands, also their share in total number of farms under 1 hectare amounted to about 14 %.

40|$|Technical {{efficiency}} {{refers to}} the situation where {{it is impossible for}} a firm to produce, with the given know-how, (1) a larger output from the same inputs or (2) the same output with less of one or more inputs without increasing the amount of other inputs. In practice, the interest is on the relative position in terms of efficiency of a particular firm with respect to others. Therefore, technical efficiency is characterised by the relationship between observed production and some ideal or potential production (Greene, 1993). Although the beginning of the efficiency work {{can be traced to the}} 1950 s (Farrell, 1957), there have been a growing interest on its use in benchmarking performance, predominantly as a means of identifying best practice and improving the efficiency of resource use within the agricultural industry (e. g., Defra 2004, SAC 2009). This paper deals with the estimation of technical efficiency for the agricultural sectors in several European countries and moreover, it aims to compare the efficiency amongst them using a metafrontier analysis. The use of this type of analysis is justified because a frontier, which represents the best available technology within a particular region/country cannot be strictly compared across other regions/countries, unless they operate under the same production set. The metafrontier analysis has been developed in a number of studies (Battese and Rao, 2002; Nkamleu et al., 2006; Chen and Song, 2006; Oâ€ŸDonnell et al., 2008.) The metafrontier analysis in this paper, which uses data from the Farm Accountancy data Network (FADN), was focused on four farm types: two specialised farming types (i. e., specialist cereals, oilseed and protein crops and <b>specialist</b> <b>dairying)</b> and two more mixed farming sets (i. e., general field cropping and mixed farms), and was applied to a total of 11 countries namely Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the UK. For most of the countries the information was available from 1995 until 2007, excepting Hungary and Poland, for which it was available only since 2004. Also note that not all the farm types were available for all the countries. The structure of the paper is as follows: it starts presenting an overview of the metafrontier analysis used to compare technical efficiency amongst the European countries. It is followed by the empirical work, which comprises a description of the data used, the estimation and discussion of the results. Finally we present conclusions.

40|$|Organic systems seek {{to reduce}} {{reliance}} on external inputs, and develop sustainable methods of production which balance output with {{high standards of}} animal welfare. The standards for organic production emphasise preventive control strategies based on grazing management, appropriate breeding and good nutrition. The {{ultimate goal is to}} eliminate dependence on anti-parasitic drugs, however this is rarely achieved in practice. The overall objective of this research was to develop organic farming systems, which do not rely on pharmaceutical control of roundworm parasites. Focussing on management and nutrition, the approach was to combine on-farm epidemiological studies, with replicated experiments, in order to develop and demonstrate better systems of control applicable to UK organic farms. The project was a collaborative study involving ADAS, Institute of Rural Science (IRS), Moredun Research Institute (MRI) and Scottish Agriculture Colleges (SAC). Specific objectives: 1. To study the epidemiology of parasitic gastro-enteritis (PGE) on selected 'focus' farms, representing a range of organic systems 2. To quantify the effect of dietary manipulation, novel crops, and drenching with tannins, on the development of PGE in organic sheep and cattle systems 3. To evaluate the role of crop type and pasture larval ecology on the development of PGE 4. To develop the application of alternative approaches on 'focus' farms, under best management practice 5. To ensure effective technology transfer Five commercial organic farms, reflecting a range of production systems (specialist hill sheep, upland beef and sheep, lowland specialist sheep, <b>specialist</b> <b>dairying,</b> and lowland mixed arable / livestock) were selected for detailed epidemiological study. The aim was to assess the level and pattern of parasite challenge, critical points for disease control, and the degree of success achieved with current management practices. The study combined the use of standard epidemiological techniques, with close collaboration of the researchers, participating farmers and their veterinary advisers. Comprehensive epidemiological data were collected over two contrasting seasons (2002 and 2003). Without recourse to routine anthelmintic, control was generally underpinned by grazing management, within the constraints of land/crop resources and diversity of enterprises available for each farm. Role of nutrition: Previous studies, using tightly controlled nutritional protocols and a known parasite challenge, developed a nutritional hypothesis for understanding nutritional influences on the host response to parasites. A replicated experiment was set up to test whether this framework could be extended to organically managed ewes carrying a mixed naturally-acquired infection. Novel crops: A series of experiments were undertaken to determine the potential of several novel crops for parasite control. Parasite pasture ecology: Nematode larvae populations have also been shown to differ between herbage species, potentially due to differences in crop morphology or microclimate beneath the sward (which may affect larval development and survival, or the number of coprophagous or nematophagous organisms at soil level). Several small plot and pot experiments were undertaken to assess the effect of crop type on larval survival, rates of faecal degradation, and soil dwelling invertebrates. Overall, the results from this study indicate that with sufficient diversity of cropping and stocking, it is possible to virtually eliminate anthelmintic usage. However, many farms still face significant difficulties, particularly those systems dominated by sheep. The extent to which control can be achieved by management alone, depends on the farming system, with the greatest opportunity for control in the more mixed, or very extensive production systems. Many of the issues faced by the organic sector are increasingly relevant to conventional farmers where anthelmintic resistance is becoming increasingly prevalent. More integrated strategies are required, not only for organic producers, but also to prolong the life of drenches currently used in conventional farming. Practical recommendations have been derived from this research, and promoted to organic and conventional farmers, based around key messages of system planning, parasite monitoring and maintaining biosecurity...|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> farming in Burdur region of Turkey was {{determined}} by the analysis of nutritional, husbandry, breeding, health and product safety and quality parameters. A face-to-face questionnaire was conducted. The data obtained were classified and transformed to numerical values before statistical analysis. A multiple-response analysis was performed to define the classification of dairy farms into qualified, averaged and unqualified, which were established by algorithmic rules within each set of parameters. The results revealed that the level of <b>specialist</b> (qualified) <b>dairy</b> farms was only 47 %, whereas 33 % unqualified and 20 % averaged. The nutritional expertise levels of farmers were not at a satisfactory level: 50 % of farmers were qualified, 23 % averaged and 27 % were unqualified. The expertise level of farmers in feeds and feedings was dramatic: only 38 % were qualified, 20 % averaged and 42 % unqualified. On the other hand, for animal husbandry, animal health and product safety criteria the farmers were not highly-skilled experts: 51 % were qualified, 19 % averaged and 30 % unqualified. In conclusion the <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> farming system in Burdur accounts only 47 % of the total. This figure is lower than an overall European figure of 83 %.

40|$|Economic {{research}} {{reported here}} analysed the likely impact on farm incomes of policies {{aimed at reducing}} nitrogen (N) applications on farms. Three types of policy were considered. First was a restriction of the intensity of livestock production to control amounts of organic nitrogenous material going on the land. That in the EU Nitrates Directive of 170 kg N per hectare was used (equivalent to 2 dairy cows per hectare). To this was added a restriction on {{the total amount of}} nitrogen applied of 260 kg N/ha reflecting rules in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS). The third measure considered was a 10 percent tax on sales of manufactured nitrogenous fertilisers. These measures to address nitrate pollution are under discussion in Ireland as the concentration of nitrates in waters in some areas has increased significantly. Particular attention was paid to estimating the impact of the three constraints on <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> farms, as they were most likely to have to restrict applications of N to comply. Many of these farms were in the five Munster counties selected for the study, namely Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford. In these counties 39 percent of <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> farms would have been affected both by Nitrates Directive restrictions on applications of nitrogen as organic material (animal wastes) and REPS rules on the total amount of nitrogenous material spread on farm land. A further 30 percent of these farms would be affected only by the restriction on total applications of N, as in the REPS rules. The remaining 31 percent of the <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> farms would not have been affected by restrictions on N use under either the Nitrates Directive or REPS rules. The potential economic impact of policies to constrain nitrogen use was simulated for a sample of <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> farms in Munster. All of these farms started with levels of N applications in excess of {{one or both of the}} restrictions being considered. This policy simulation was carried out using individual farm Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) models. The results showed that compliance with restrictions on N use would reduce income on all of the selected farms. The results also indicate that these farms could partly or wholly offset the loss by increasing the efficiency of N use, or by increasing milk production per cow. However, the more a farm was above the regulation 2 Livestock Units (dairy cows) per hectare the larger the potential loss of income and the more difficult it would be to make good this loss. Farms starting with fewer than 2 LU/ha but applying in total more than 260 kgN/ha (REPS rule) would find that meeting this target would cause a lesser reduction in income. This loss would also be easier to offset by efficiency increasing measures. With regard to the third scenario of imposing a 10 % tax on sales of manufactured N fertilizers, the results showed this to be very ineffective in reducing the amounts used. In some cases the imposition of a tax would have no effect whatsoever on the amount of N used yet would slightly reduce incomes on all of the nation's farmsEnd of Project Repor...|$|R

This study estimates farm gate phosphorus balances and use efficiencies across 150 <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> farms over the seven year period since these controls were introduced (2006 â€“ 2012) using nationally representative data. Results indicate that P balances declined by 50 % over the study period from 11. 9 in 2006 to 6. 0 kg haâˆ’ 1 in 2012. This decline was driven by a reduction in chemical fertiliser imports of 6. 5 kg haâˆ’ 1. This is equivalent to a reduction of 281 kg of P and represents a cost saving of â‚¬ 812 per annum across the average farm. Phosphorus use efficiency also improved over the period from 60 % in 2006 to 78 % in 2012, peaking in 2011 at 88. 3 %. This was achieved while increasing milk solids output per hectare and per cow.

This paper concentrates on <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> and tillage farms stratified by land use potential as these agricultural systems are the most intensive and may pose the greatest risk in terms of managing nutrient transfer from agricultural land to water courses. Results demonstrate considerable inefficiency in the utilisation of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers across these systems.

Livestock density is {{significantly higher than the}} EU- 27 average (Eurostat 2015). Crop protection cost is very low compared to the sample of French and Italian farms used by Enjolras et al. (2014). This highlights the importance of livestock relative to tillage farming in Ireland. Mean farm size is small but is similar to the mean size of the Italian farms in the sample used by Enjolras et al. (2014). Even though farm sizes are small in Ireland, land values are among the highest in Europe making the land wealth of Irish farmers significantly higher than that of Italian or French farmers (Keith 2013). A significant number of farmers and their spouses were employed off the farm during the study period. In TableÂ  1, the off-farm employment statistics refer to the initial condition when the farm first entered the sample. TableÂ  1 shows that 40 % of the sampled farms were primarily involved in beef production.

50|$|The British Milksheep {{originally}} {{was known as}} the Alderbred and is a breed of domesticated sheep developed by Lawrence Alderson in Wiltshire and Northumberland. It was exported to several countries including Hungary, France and Greece, and from there other neighbouring countries. It now can be found mainly in the UK, Hungary and Canada, although the population in Britain was decimated during the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. The exact composition of the breed has never been declared but it was based on high-performance animals in existing flocks of Dorset Horn, Bluefaced Leicester and Eastrip Prolific sheep kept by the Alderson family. Additional individual animals were selected from Lleyn, Texel and East Friesian breeds. Subsequent selection was based on measures of productivity, without regard for uniformity of appearance. A standardised breed type emerged gradually as the blending process continued. The animals were exposed to rugged conditions in the upper Pennines in northern England to develop robustness and adaptability. Progeny testing from the initial stages laid the foundation for continuous genetic improvement. Initially, total ownership of females of the breed was retained by the family and only rams were sold, but groups of females were released to other breeders in 1981. Numbers of flocks and animals increased rapidly and there were more than 5,000 breeding ewes by the mid-1980s with flocks widespread in Britain. A flock book was published in 1986. As the name of the breed suggests, it is a prolific milk producer, and several large dairy flocks were established. However, it is a robust, general-purpose sheep rather than a <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> breed. It is known for its extremely high prolificacy, and rams are used to sire high-performance crossbred daughters. The quality of its carcase and wool are extra beneficial traits. In all countries outside Britain, the British Milksheep is used more as a dairying breed with dual-purpose qualities, but it is used also in most countries as a crossing sire; in Britain on hill and longwool breeds, in France in the Alps and Pyrenees on mountain breeds, in Greece on Chios dairy ewes, and in Hungary on the predominant Merino population.

Cornell Cooperative Extension (CUCE) in New York City began this project with the University of Illinois in 2007, and today the CUCE MarketMaker web site contains information on 3, 391 food producers representing vegetables, fruits and nuts, dairy, grains, herbs, wine, and meat products from 56 counties. Our site, which contains over 84, 000 New York food-related references, is part of a national network of state web sites that currently includes 15 states. MarketMaker is a FREE in-depth marketing tool to help small and mid-sized producers get sophisticated data to help them reach thousands of potential buyers. New York State producers can get listed on the site at no charge, access census data to determine where targeted buyers are located in a given area, and find markets for products â€“ such as farmersâ€Ÿ markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and other retail locations- in a map-based format. We created our own educational outreach program that would teach food entrepreneurs how to use the site and the basics of marketing value added food products. The main purpose of MarketMaker is to level the playing field. With this tool, small and mid-sized producers have similar market intelligence as the bigger producers. From July 2007 to December 2009, a total of 45 hands-on MarketMaker presentations were given for producers at conferences, meetings, expos, harvest fairs and Empire Farm Days; New York MarketMaker received 934 new registrations and over 1. 5 million hits. Many buyers and sellers actively posted advertisements at the MarketPlace. CUCE staff members conducted 23 online training sessions; participants were farm business management specialists, agricultural economic development specialists, fruits and vegetables <b>specialists,</b> and <b>dairy</b> <b>specialists</b> from across the state.

40|$|The UK {{dairy sector}} has {{undergone}} considerable structural change in recent years, with {{a decrease in}} the number of producers accompanied by an increased average herd size and increased concentrate use and milk yields. One of the key drivers to producers remaining in the industry is the profitability of their herds. The current paper adopts a holistic approach to decomposing the variation in dairy profitability through an analysis of net margin data explained by physical inputâ€“output measures, milk price variation, labour utilization and managerial behaviours and characteristics. Data are drawn from the Farm Business Survey (FBS) for England in 2007 / 08 for 228 dairy enterprises. Average yields are 7100 litres/cow/yr, from a herd size of 110 cows that use 0 Â· 56 forage ha/cow/yr and 43 Â· 2 labour h/cow/yr. An average milk price of 22 Â· 57 pence per litre (ppl) produced milk output of Â£ 1602 /cow/yr, which after accounting for calf sales, herd replacements and quota leasing costs, gave an average dairy output of Â£ 1516 /cow/yr. After total costs of Â£ 1464 /cow/yr this left an economic return of Â£ 52 /cow/yr (0 Â· 73 ppl) net margin profit. There is wide variation in performance, with the most profitable (as measured by net margin per cow) quartile of producers achieving 2000 litres/cow/yr more than the least profitable quartile, returning a net margin of Â£ 335 /cow/yr compared to a loss of Â£ 361 /cow/yr for the least profitable. The most profitable producers operate larger, higher yielding herds and achieve a greater milk price for their output. In addition, a significantly greater number of the most profitable producers undertake financial benchmarking within their businesses and operate <b>specialist</b> <b>dairy</b> farms. When examining the full data set, the most profitable enterprises included significantly greater numbers of organic producers. The most profitable tend to have a greater reliance on independent technical advice, but this finding is not statistically significant. Decomposing the variation in net margin performance between the most and least profitable groups, an approximate ratio of 65 : 23 : 12 is observed for higher yields: lower costs: higher milk price. This result indicates that yield differentials are the key performance driver in dairy profitability. Lower costs per cow are dominated by the significantly lower cost of farmer and spouse labour per cow of the most profitable group, flowing directly from the upper quartile expending 37 Â· 7 labour h/cow/yr in comparison with 58 Â· 8 h/cow/yr for the lower quartile. The upper quartile's greater milk price is argued to be achieved through contract negotiations and higher milk quality, and this accounts for 0 Â· 12 of the variation in net margin performance. The average economic return to the sample of dairy enterprises in this survey year was less than Â£ 6000 /farm/yr. However, the most profitable quartile returned an average economic return of approximately Â£ 50 â€Š 000 per farm/yr. Structural change in the UK dairy sector is likely to continue with the least profitable and typically smaller dairy enterprises being replaced by a smaller number of expanding dairy production units...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{are just two}} examples {{of the work of}} the Fonds. With the conservation project for the Santa Marta conure in Colombia the Fonds promotes a project of the Colombian foundation Alianza para EcosÃ­stemas CrÃ­ticos. The latter strives for close co-operation with the Indigenous people of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The endemic Santa Marta conure is a keystone species for education on the uniqueness of the flora and fauna of the mountain chain. The conservation project means that all involved work as equal partners in observation activities within the Indian reservation and in the determination of distribution patterns, the identification of breeding areas and migratory routes as well as the analysis of population and causes of decline. By optimizing cheese production among the small farmers in the distribution area of the conure through a <b>dairy</b> <b>specialist</b> working on behalf of the Fonds and the establishment of a brand for this production the long-term security of the habitat structure of the conure is assured at the same time.|$|R
40|$|All too often, the {{attention}} dairy farmers give to rearing their young stock declines markedly after weaning. The weight of heifers at mating has effects on ease of calving, subsequent milk production and their longevity in the milking herd. For example, calving 2 year old Friesian heifers at 550 kg compared to 450 kg liveweight {{can reduce the}} time between calving and conception in their first lactation by 17 days and should increase lifetime milk yields by about 2300 L. In year-round calving herds, better feeding of young stock can reduce age at first calving, which also increases lifetime productivity. Despite the higher costs involved in improved heifer management systems, computer studies have shown it to be profitable to rear heifers to heavier pre-calving liveweights and/or younger ages at first calving. This review summarises {{much of the information}} generated from Australian studies, then describes many of the current systems of heifer management, highlighting some of their shortcomings and suggesting where improvements could be made. The costs of rearing heifer replacements are briefly discussed together with the economic benefits of better rearing systems. Finally, details are provided of a technical information package currently being prepared by <b>dairy</b> <b>specialists</b> for dissemination amongst dairy farmers throughout eastern Australia, {{under the auspices of the}} Project 21 (NSW) and Target 10 (Victoria) dairy extension programmes...|$|R

The United Nations Development Programme Area Development Scheme together with the Sudan government have cooperated in the trials. An acidified cheese produced by direct acidification of the milk at high temperatures was introduced on a commercial basis in the ADFS field station of El Obeid, Kordofan, {{and elsewhere in the}} Sudan. Natural route is stirred in slowly in different batches at 80 - 90 C at a ratio of 10 - 1 A coagulum is instantly formed and then stirred for one or two minutes, and then left for a further five to seven minutes to enhance the coagulation of the proteins and the consolidation of the protein particles at the bottom. The whey is poured off and the curd distributed into cheese moulds and pressed for 12 - 15 hours. The cheese is then transferred to a brine solution. The action of heat and acid enable the casein and whey proteins to be recovered, which results in increased yield.

40|$|The New Zealand Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme {{develops}} emerging agribusiness {{leaders to}} help shape {{the future of}} New Zealand agribusiness and rural affairs. Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. The NZ dairy industry has successfully, in the past, provided a pathway to land ownership. This has been mainly via the sharemilking system. The "carrot" or opportunity of land ownership has seen the industry successfully attract and retain motivated people. The average age of the NZ dairy farm owner is at present 50 - 55 years. Innovation and enthusiasm. from young blood is a prerequisite for any industry to remain vibrant and dynamic. Rural leaders and <b>dairy</b> <b>specialists</b> are now stating that due to the increase in land values, the chance for individuals to own a farm, using the accumulated wealth they have built up while in the industry, is highly unlikely. They speculate that in the future, more people will move into equity type roles, with an increase in off-farm owners. Given this scenario, what then motivates people to enter the dairy industry. To better understand this question, in July 2006 I conducted an independent survey of employees in the dairy industry to establish their current career expectations. How far do they expect to go, and what will keep them motivated? Is farm ownership still their ultimate goal...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the effort}} {{expended}} on nutrient management {{has focused on the}} post-excretion product. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that management of the diet can have important impacts on quantitative and qualitative aspects of the excreted nutrients. Surveys of nutritionists and extension <b>specialists</b> show that <b>dairy</b> producers are advised to feed 0. 45 to 0. 50 % phosphorus (P) (DM basis) in their lactating cow diets. This is 20 % in excess of NRC (2001) requirements. Feeding to requirement would reduce P excretion by 25 to 30 % and would reduce solubility and potential for runoff of the P that is applied to fields. Nitrogen (N) excretion by dairy cows can also be decreased, but by a lesser amount. Balancing ruminally undegraded and degraded protein and use of protected methionine along with strategic selection of protein supplements that are relatively rich in lysine, may permit a 10 to 15 % reduction in total N excretion, with most of the reduction occurring in urinary N. Urinary urea, following conversion to ammonia, is the N excretion product most vulnerable for loss to the environment. Feedlot cattle routinely consume P in excess of NRC (1996) predicted requirements, and recent research suggests the NRC estimates of the P requirements are high. Decreasing dietary P from the industry average (0. 35 % P) to the NRC predicted requirement (0. 22 to 0. 28 %) decreased P input by 33 to 45 % and excretion by 40 to 50 % in nutrient balance studies. With grain-based feedlot diets, overfeeding P is inevitable. At minimum, supplemental P sources should be removed from diet formulations. More accurate formulation of feedlot diets for protein provides opportunity for reducing N excretion. By using the NRC model for metabolizable protein, and by employing phase-feeding, N inputs may be decreased by 10 to 20 % from the feedlot industry average of 13. 5 % dietary CP. This translates into a 12 to 21 % reduction in N excretion, and 15 to 33 % reduction in ammonia volatilization in open-dirt feedlot pens. Diet formulation can have an important impact on the amount of N and P excreted in both dairy and beef. It is much easier to control potential pollutants by managing their release into the environment than to recover or confine them once they are released...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out with the {{objective}} of improving dairy farms in Cameroon using an integrated method. Research done in the area on milk production in the country was reviewed. A participatory rural appraisal was conducted in dairy farms of the North West Region of Cameroon. An economic opportunity survey {{was carried out}} on 61 dairy farms in the same region. Interventions aimed at solving main constraints were planned. An on-farm study on the effect of feed supplementation before calving on milk production, ovarian activity and calf growth of Holstein, indigenous Red Fulani cows and their crosses was conducted. Corresponding blood samples were analyzed using ELISA Progesterone kits. Animal health studies involved screening for Brucella abortus antibodies in 21 villages by ELISA. Partial budgeting was used to evaluate the financial impact of interventions. Results show that five small scale dairy production systems are found in the region: transhumance, improved extensive, semi intensive, zero grazing and peri-urban. Main constraints to dairy production include in order of importance: poor marketing opportunities and long distances to market, limited grazing land and poor supplementation of cattle, limited health control, inadequate knowledge in processing, conservation and storage of milk, poor 19 reproductive management and prolonged calving interval, lack of water in the dry season, poor housing, poor organization of group, limited number of dairy cows and poor record keeping. Milk production per cow on-one-day and average calf production interval account for the greater part of economic opportunity. A human progesterone ELISA kit was validated for use in cattle. Brucella screening showed a general seroprevalence of 8. 4 %. It is recommended that infected cattle should be slaughtered. A specific control programme should be organized and an effort should be made to determine the causes of the spread of brucellosis. A regular Brucella testing should be instituted. Farmers adopting interventions had returns of 193 and 232 % without and with opportunity costs proving the positive impact of interventions using the integrated method. These interventions need to be spread to more farms in the country. The integrated method was proven to be effective in ensuring improvement of dairy systems in Cameroon. This method needs to be adopted for further dairy production improvement by the creation of multidisciplinary intervention teams and the training of integrated intervention <b>specialists</b> in the <b>dairy</b> sector.
