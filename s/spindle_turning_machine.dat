40|$|A {{water drive}} <b>spindle</b> for diamond <b>turning</b> <b>machines</b> is proposed. The spindle uses water flow for driving the rotor by a water drive motor, for {{supporting}} the rotor by water hydrostatic bearings, {{as well as for}} coolant. As water is not only incompressible and clean but also low viscosity fluid, it is considered that a high-speed and precise rotational motion will achieve in the clean environments for ultra-precision machinings. The present paper reports a structure of the spindle as well as the operational principle of the spindle. In the present paper, theoretical equations used for designing the spindle is derived. The characteristics of the spindle are studied theoretically and experimentally...|$|R
30|$|According to Eq. (24), {{the feeding}} per tooth f is {{inversely}} proportional to the <b>spindle</b> <b>turning</b> speed n, thus the cutting forces decrease {{with the increase of}} <b>spindle</b> <b>turning</b> speed n. On the other hand, the cutting velocity v increases with <b>spindle</b> <b>turning</b> speed n, which can in turn increase the shear strain rate γ̇ of shear zone (Eq. (16)). According to the quasi-solid–liquid transition constitutive equation of sand mould cutting (Eq. (23)), the stress in the shear zone will increase the cutting forces. Based on a comprehensive consideration of the above two factors, the cutting forces, therefore, decrease with the increase of <b>spindle</b> <b>turning</b> speed n but disproportionately, as Figure  10 (c) shows.|$|R

50|$|SFM is a {{combination}} of diameter and the velocity (RPM) of the material measured in feet-per-minute as the spindle of a milling machine or lathe. 1 SFM equals 0.00508 m/s (meter per second, the SI unit of speed). The faster the <b>spindle</b> <b>turns,</b> and/or the larger the diameter, the higher the SFM. The goal is to tool a job to run the SFM as high as possible to increase hourly part production. However some materials will run better at specific SFMs. When the SFM is known for a specific material (ex 303 annealed stainless steel = 120 SFM for high speed steel tooling), a formula can be used to determine spindle speed for live tools or <b>spindle</b> speeds for <b>turning</b> materials.|$|R

The deterministic autoregressive moving average (DARMA) model with auxiliary input is introduced to cope with any disturbances of the controlled system. The parameters of the DARMA model are obtained using {{the structure of a}} lattice adaptive control system. The robustness of the proposed controller copes with any changes in depth of cut and/or the cutting speed. These changes are embedded in the linearized model of the CNC machine and are considered as system parameters. Extensive computer simulations are made to prove the applicability of the proposed controller for controlling the cutting force over different operating conditions.
