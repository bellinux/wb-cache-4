There has been limited success in identifying the drivers <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> for experiential services. This research aimed to identify the key drivers <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> and more clearly identify the role of emotion. Twenty-six in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} consumers interested in the cultural performing arts. The findings identified service experience, price, service quality, venue quality and value as the main drivers. Emotion was a driver for a small segment of highly involved patrons. The comparison standards model was found to be the main predictor <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> and experiential aspects were positive but not critical predictors.

40|$|This paper re-examines the {{evidence}} on open market share repurchase activity reported by Rau and Vermaelen (2002) for the UK. Using data from the Securities Data Corporation (SDC), Rau and Vermaelen conclude that the level <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> activity is trivial. They attribute the low repurchase volume to regulatory restrictions that limit companies' ability {{to take advantage of}} an undervalued stock price and conclude that the bulk <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> activity that does occur is driven by the desire to generate tax credits for pension funds. Using data collected from a variety of sources, we find that the SDC substantially understates UK open market buyback activity. Based on our more comprehensive dataset we conclude that (a) pension funds' tax considerations are not the primary cause <b>of</b> UK share <b>repurchases</b> and (b) despite the prevailing regulatory environment, underpricing still represents an important determinant <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> activity.

40|$|This article aims {{to present}} the results of {{empirical}} studies {{on the evolution of}} abnormal rates of return on undervalued shares of Polish public companies on notice <b>of</b> planned <b>repurchases</b> <b>of</b> these securities. The study assumed a signaling hypothesis, which states that the share repurchasing may be used by managers as a tool for sending information to the market about undervaluation of these assets. This hypothesis seems to be justified in terms of signaling theory and the theory of information asymmetry. This article is divided into two main parts.

40|$|Recent {{research}} into experiential {{services such as}} extreme sports and fine arts {{has focused on the}} subjective attributes of the encounter, with emotion as the key driver of consumption and with little attention paid to purchase intention. As repurchase intention is acknowledged as driving profitability and sustainability, it is essential that we understand its role and its relationship to both subjective attributes and utilitarian aspects. Since little work has been conducted in the arts specific to repurchase intention, this exploratory study used 26 in-depth interviews to identify the key drivers <b>of</b> <b>repurchase.</b> By identifying the roles of attributes such as emotion, value, service quality, and satisfaction and how these interact within the service encounter, the study enhances our {{understanding of the nature of}} a performing arts encounter and how to position it for maximum repeat patronage. The article concludes with a conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> intention in the performing arts that can serve as a foundation for future research. The findings suggest that goal-directed emotion is a weak driver <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> intention, existing only in a small segment of highly involved frequent attendees.

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} effects <b>of</b> stock <b>repurchase</b> annnouncements {{on the value of}} the announcing {{insurance}} firms and on the value of rival insurance firms. We find that insurance firms experience a significant increase in value at the time <b>of</b> the announce-ment. <b>Repurchasing</b> firms continue to earn excess returns for several months after the announcement. We study the intra-industry effect of the announcements and find that there is a significant decrease in value of rival insurance firms. This suggests that perceived changes in the competitive positions <b>of</b> <b>repurchasing</b> firms occur at the expense of rival firms and dominate any signals of favorable industry conditions. Cross-sectional tests show that the increase in the value <b>of</b> <b>repurchasing</b> firms is related to the relative size of the buyback, stock returns prior to the announcement, and the market-to-book ratio.

40|$|Abstract: The {{announcement}} <b>of</b> a share <b>repurchase</b> {{provides a}} firm’s management {{with the opportunity}} to communicate with existing and potential shareholders. Our results indicate that voluntary information disclosed by management in an insurance compa-ny’s repurchase announcement concerning the future prospects of the firm has little marginal impact on the market’s reaction to the repurchase announcement. The one exception is management statements indicating that the <b>repurchase</b> <b>of</b> common shares represents a good investment for the firm. In contrast, our results indicate that information disclosed by management about the details <b>of</b> the <b>repurchase</b> program does have a marginal impact on the market’s reaction to the repurchase announcement. For example, if the firm’s management mentions the method <b>of</b> <b>repurchase</b> there is an increase in the market’s reaction to the announcement, regardless of the method. In addition, the usage of a tender offer to repurchase stock has a large statistically significant positive effect on the market’s reaction to the announcement of a repur-chase.

40|$|We {{employ a}} {{regression}} discontinuity design {{to identify the}} real effects <b>of</b> share <b>repurchases</b> on other firm outcomes. The probability <b>of</b> share <b>repurchases</b> that increase earnings per share (EPS) is sharply higher for firms that would have just missed the EPS forecast in the absence <b>of</b> the <b>repurchase,</b> when compared with firms that “just beat ” the EPS forecast. This discontinuity allows us to measure the causal effect <b>of</b> <b>repurchases</b> on other corporate policies in a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) framework. EPS-motivated repurchases are associated with reductions in employment and investment {{and a decrease in}} financial slack in the four quarters following the repurchase. Our evidence suggests that managers are willing to trade off investments and employment for stock repurchases that allow them to meet analyst EPS forecasts.

An objective {{of the study is}} to use Tobin's Q ratio to determine if there is a change in the pre and post performance of companies with stock repurchase programs. A second objective is to determine if companies that repurchase shares outperform companies that do not repurchase shares, based on the performance of Tobin's Q ratio. A large sample <b>of</b> <b>repurchasing</b> companies is compared to a matched sample <b>of</b> companies not <b>repurchasing</b> shares. The sample data covers the period 1976 through 1995. The findings weakly support the hypothesis that a repurchasing strategy resulted in an improvement in firm performance, as reflected in a higher Tobin's Q ratio. This finding is contrary to a recent study. The results did not support the hypothesis that firms repurchasing shares would have a higher Tobin's Q ratio than firms not repurchasing shares. In response to the two fundamental questions posed in the opening statement, we conclude that the study provides very weak support for the signalling hypothesis.
