Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity we know today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century southeastern Europe, when verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published.

Patañjali's Yoga Sutras accept the Samkhya's division of the world and phenomena into twenty-five tattvas or principles, of which one is Purusha meaning Self or consciousness, the others being Prakriti (primal nature), Buddhi (intellect or will), Ahamkara (ego), Manas (mind), five buddhindriyas (sensory capabilities), five karmendriyas (action-capabilities) and ten elements.

Houphouët-Boigny, who was already serving as a minister in France, as President of the Territorial Assembly and as mayor of Abidjan, chose Auguste Denise to serve as Vice President of the Government Council of Côte d'Ivoire, even though Houphouët-Boigny remained, the only interlocutor in the colony for France.

The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds.

40|$|The {{last years}} have been {{characterized}} by an increasing interest in the grid and cloud computing that allow the implementation of high performance computing structures in a distributed way by exploiting multiple processing resources. The presence of mobile terminals has extended the paradigm to the <b>so</b> called <b>pervasive</b> grid networks, where multiple heterogeneous devices are interconnected to form a distributed computing resource. In such a scenario, there is the need of efficient techniques for providing reliable wireless connections among network nodes.

The proposed solutions have been considered within two different parallelization processing schemes, and their effectiveness has been verified by resorting to computer simulations.

Sociolinguistics and anthropological linguistics are disciplines that increasingly theorize and analyze within the solidarity paradigm. It is suggested that a systematic uprooting of competition as taken-for-granted grounding of scientific research should allow for the development of theorization and successful applications of solidarity ideologies.
