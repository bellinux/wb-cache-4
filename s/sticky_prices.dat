5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s, new Keynesian {{researchers}} investigated how market imperfections like monopolistic competition, nominal frictions like <b>sticky</b> <b>prices,</b> and other frictions made microeconomics consistent with Keynesian macroeconomics. New Keynesians often formulated models with rational expectations, {{which had been}} proposed by Lucas and adopted by new classical economists.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 1950s, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of economists had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted the synthesis view; however, room for disagreement remained. The synthesis attributed problems with market clearing to <b>sticky</b> <b>prices</b> that failed to adjust to changes in supply and demand. Another group of Keynesians focused on disequilibrium economics and tried to reconcile the concept of equilibrium with the absence of market clearing.|$|E
5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on <b>sticky</b> <b>prices</b> and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think <b>sticky</b> <b>prices</b> and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} in both {{time-dependent}} and state-dependent <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> models, <b>prices</b> of <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> products (i. e. whose price changes rarely) contain more information about medium term inflation developments than those of flexible price products (i. e. whose price changes frequently). We do this by establishing a novel measure for the extent of forwardlookingness of newly set prices, and showing that {{it is at least}} 60 % when the monthly price change frequency is less than 15 %. This result is robust across various <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> models. On the empirical front, we show that the Hungarian <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> inflation index indeed has a forward-looking component, as it has favorable inflation forecasting properties on the policy horizon of 1 - 2 years to alternative inflation indicators (including core inflation). Both theoretical and empirical results suggest that the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> inflation index is a useful indicator for inflation targeting central banks...|$|R
40|$|I {{develop a}} {{structural}} model of inflation by combining two different models of price setting behavior: the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> {{model of the}} New Keynesian literature and the sticky information model of Mankiw and Reis. In a framework similar to the Calvo model, I assume {{that there are two}} types of firms. One type of firm chooses its prices optimally through forward-looking behavior [...] -as assumed in the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> model. It uses all available information when deciding on prices. The other type of firm sets its prices under the constraint that the information it uses is ``sticky'' [...] -as assumed in the sticky information model. It collects and processes the information necessary to choose its optimal prices with a delay. This leads to the sticky price-sticky information (SP/SI) Phillips curve that nests the standard <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> and <b>sticky</b> information models. Estimations of this structural model show that both <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> and <b>sticky</b> information models are statistically and quantitatively important for price setting. However, the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> firms make up the majority of the firms in the economy. The resultant SP/SI Phillips curve models inflation better than either the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> or <b>sticky</b> information models. The results are robust to alternative sub-samples and estimation methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Mankiw and Reis (2002) have revived {{imperfect}} information {{explanations for}} the short run real effects of monetary policy. This paper contrasts their sticky information model with the standard <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> model. First, I utilize a theoretical relation between aggregate prices and unit labor cost that allows me to leave unspecified household preferences, wage setting and money demand. Second, I introduce a modeling approach that allows me to nest the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> and the <b>sticky</b> information models within a single empirical framework. Third, I propose a single-step estimation method that provides consistent estimates of adjustment speeds and reliable confidence bands that enable me to reject flexible prices.

5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of <b>sticky</b> <b>prices</b> that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E
25|$|The first {{criticism}} is that, following Say's {{law and the}} related circle of ideas, if demand slackens, prices will fall (barring government intervention), and the resulting lower price will stimulate demand (though at lower profit or cost – possibly even lower wages). This criticism in turn has been questioned by New Keynesian economists, who reject Say's law and instead point to evidence of <b>sticky</b> <b>prices</b> as a reason why prices do not fall in recession; this remains a debated point.|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became {{dissatisfied}} with these early nominal wage contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise {{when the economy}} fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make sense from a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. Instead of looking for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted {{their attention to the}} goods market and the <b>sticky</b> <b>prices</b> that resulted from [...] "menu cost" [...] models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it wants to change prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more general costs associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the economy may be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months.|$|E

In contrast to most of the existing literature for the US, evidence of a positive response of hours to technology shocks is found, which is consistent with the conventional real business cycle interpretation and at odds with <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> models.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to provide a fair {{empirical}} comparison of two alternative explanations of the relationship between aggregate price and output. We compare the empirical performance of the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> and the Mankiw and Reis (2002) sticky information models. We put both models in a similar analytical form and use the same data set on unit labor cost and aggregate prices in the U. S. after WWII to evaluate the models. We use the Bayesian full information likelihood approach for parameter estimation, uncertainty evaluation, and model comparison. Statistical comparison of the two non-nested models and estimates of the empirical encompassing model lead to the same result - the sticky information model is dominated by the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> model. <b>sticky</b> <b>price,</b> <b>sticky</b> information, model selection, full information likelihood, Bayesian model comparison...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{add to the}} {{literature}} on the assessment of how well data simulated from new-Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models reproduce the dynamic features of historical data.

One of our main findings is that for a standard level of stickiness (i. e. annual price or information adjustment), the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> model with indexation dominates other models. We also find that when a lower level of information and price stickiness is used (i. e. bi-annual adjustment), there is much less to choose between the models (see Bils and Klenow (2004) for evidence in favor of lower levels of stickiness).

40|$|Many {{economists have}} worried {{about changes in}} the demand for money, since money demand shocks can affect output {{variability}} and have implications for monetary policy. This paper studies the theoretical implications of changes in money demand for the nonneutrality {{of money in the}} limited participation (liquidity) model and the predetermined (<b>sticky)</b> <b>price</b> model. In the liquidity model, we find that an important connection exists between the nonneutrality of money and the relative money demands of households and firms. This model predicts that the real effect of a money shock rose by 100 percent between 1952 and 1980, and subsequently declined 65 percent. In contrast, we find that the nonneutrality of money in the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> model is invariant to changes in money demands or other monetary factors. Several researchers have concluded from VAR analyses that the effects of money shock over time are roughly stable. This view is consistent with the predictions of the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> model, but is harder to reconcile with the specific pattern of time variation predicted by the liquidity model.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} that models of the monetary transmission mechanism should be consistent with at least the following facts. In response to a contractionary monetary policy shock, the aggregate price level responds very little, aggregate output falls, interest rates initially rise, real wages decline, though by a modest amount, and profits fall. The paper argues that neither <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> nor limited participation models can convincingly account for these facts. The key failing of the <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> model is that it implies profits rise after a contractionary monetary policy shock. This finding is robust {{to a variety of}} perturbations of the benchmark <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> model that we consider. In contrast, the limited participation model can account for all of the facts mentioned above. But it can do so only if one is willing to assume a high labor supply elasticity (2) and a high average markup (40 %). The shortcomings of both models reflect the absence of other frictions, such as wage contracts, which dampen movements in the marginal cost of production after a monetary policy shock. ...|$|R
40|$|Though {{built with}} {{increasingly}} precise microfoundations, modern optimizing <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> models have displayed a chronic inability to generate large and persistent real responses to monetary shocks, as recently stressed by Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan [2000].

We trace this lack of persistence to a standard view of the cyclical behavior of real marginal cost built into current <b>sticky</b> <b>price</b> macro models. Using a fully articulated general equilibrium model, we show how an alternative view of real marginal cost can lead to substantial persistence. This alternative view is based on three features of the “supply side ” of the economy that we believe are realistic: an important role for produced inputs, variable capacity utilization, and labor supply variability through changes in employment. Importantly, these “real flexibilities ” work together to dra-matically reduce the elasticity of marginal cost with respect to output, from level...|$|R
