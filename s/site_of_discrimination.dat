As {{contemporary}} societies are undergoing a demographic change, spurred in great part by international immigration, living in diversity continues {{to remain a}} topical issue. Moving away from the nation, considered as a <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> and exclusion, geographers and social scientist more broadly have focused on alternative socio-spatial formations. Over {{the last two decades}} or so, the local place, particularly the city or the neighbourhood within the city, has attracted considerable attention. Imbued with transnational and cosmopolitan traits, these local places have been narrated as progressive and empowering in contrast to a nation perceived as to embodying opposite dimensions. The present study critically interrogates this local/national divide. Drawing on narratives of Italians with foreign background talking and writing about their individual experiences of living and growing up in Italy, the article offers empirical evidence which challenges the local/national divide in two ways. First, participants blurred the distinction between these two scales, as identification and attachment to local places were narrated by also mobilizing national markers. Second, the sense of local rootedness of the participants was not cast against the nation, but it was strategically deployed to claim a place in the nation. These findings invite scholars to explore the different ways in which the nation intervenes in shaping life in diversity, beyond the dominant narrative of the local/national divide...|$|E

The animals were fed a single dose of vitamin E containing 60 mumol of each 2 R, 4 'R, 8 'R-alpha-(5, 7 -(C 2 H 3) 2) tocopheryl acetate (d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate; alpha-tocopherol with natural stereochemistry), 2 S, 4 'R, 8 'R-alpha- 5 -(C 2 H 3) tocopheryl acetate (d 3 -SRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate; alpha-tocopherol with unnatural stereochemistry), and 2 R, 4 'R, 8 'R-gamma-(3, 4 - 2 H) tocopherol (d 2 -RRR-gamma-tocopherol; gamma-tocopherol with natural stereochemistry). Chylomicrons, {{as well as the}} other plasma lipoproteins, contained equal concentrations of all three tocopherols at the earliest time points after feeding suggesting that all three tocopherols were absorbed equally. At later times plasma lipoproteins became preferentially enriched in d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol. This is likely to be due to hepatic secretion of VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) and other lipoproteins, which were enriched in d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol, as demonstrated in the lipoproteins isolated from perfused livers that had been obtained 24 h following the administration of the deuterated tocopherols. Taken together these data demonstrate that the liver, not the intestine, is the likely <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> between tocopherol isomers and that the liver secretes nascent lipoproteins preferentially enriched in d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to explore women's {{experiences}} as they negotiate collaborative group projects in a college course. This qualitative study extends the existing literature by providing depth to the research on women's learning through observation of women in group activities, surveys about college students' attitudes toward collaborative learning, and in-depth interviews with university women. The study isolates four ways women negotiate collaborative learning in a college course. (1) Women take group work seriously and consider it to be very important. (2) Women are often leaders in group work. Sixty-four percent of the women and only two percent of the men said they are usually the leader in collaborative learning situations. (3) Women end up doing more than their share of the work, although they may have won the leadership roles. (4) Earning good grades is very important to the women studied, and they are willing to work harder than anyone else in a group to earn them. The theories of how women learn include the debate over whether women are relational or task-oriented. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} in the university classes studied, women are both. However, textbooks on collaborative learning may contain passages that indicate that in mixed-sex groups males will emerge as leaders. In addition, some textbooks suggest that women might lead when groups are primarily dealing with relationship issues, and men will lead when groups are primarily task-oriented or where a democratic rather than a participatory style is preferred. Discussions of collaborative learning often include the goal of helping counterweigh the hidden curriculum that diminishes women. Although collaborative learning can be an important classroom technique, this study points out that it is important that collaborative learning and feminist pedagogy not be conflated. Some collaborative learning groups are a <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> and power difference for women...|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for the purification of main intermediates and storage products of leaves and tubers of potato for analysis of their C- 13 content. The method was tested for recovery of metabolites and carbon isotope discrimination during the purification process. Leaf metabolite delta(13) C values showed an enrichment of starch relative to sucrose and citrate. This result is in agreement with previous findings in other higher plants and indicates the existence <b>of</b> isotope <b>discrimination</b> steps during transport and metabolism of triose-phosphates in potato leaf mesophyll cells. Active anaplerotic replenishment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in {{the leaves of the}} plants investigated was also deduced from the significant C- 13 enrichment of malate relative to citrate and asparagine/aspartate relative to glutamine/glutamate. Analysis of tuber metabolite delta(13) C values showed no difference between starch and sucrose. However, tuber sucrose appeared significantly enriched compared with leaf sucrose and also relative to tuber citrate and malate. This finding suggests the existence <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> isotopic <b>discrimination</b> during sucrose processing in developing tubers. It also confirms that metabolic cycles of sucrose synthesis and breakdown and of hexose-phosphate/triose-phosphate interconversion, which have been described in excised tuber tissue, also occur in intact organs. The delta(13) C values were also used to estimate the metabolic rate of carbon oxidation in developing tubers on the assumption that pyruvate dehydrogenase is the main <b>site</b> <b>of</b> isotopic <b>discrimination</b> in the tuber cells. The result obtained was in agreement with the available literature, suggesting that analyses of natural isotopic distribution in plant products may be a useful tool for the study of metabolic processes and sink-source relationships in intact plants.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of how young people experience the workplace as queer (non-heterosexual) workers in the Australian labour market. Previous studies discuss the workplace as a problematic space for queer workers, depicting a <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination,</b> harassment and abuse {{on the grounds of}} sexuality. It can be argued that the workplace is configured as a sexual and gendered environment in which heterosexual expressions and relationships are frequently privileged over other sexual subjectivities. The voices of young people are predominantly absent from the literature examining queer sexualities in the workplace, despite their unique position as newcomers to the labour market. Thus, the aims of my research were to learn how young queer people experienced their place of paid employment in the Australian labour market and to examine how organisational dynamics affected their working lives. Addressing these aims through a constructivist methodology, I invited young queer people to share their accounts of former and current work environments. Thirty-four (34) young people aged 18 to 26 years participated through three qualitative methods: web-based surveys, online interviews and face-to-face interviews. The findings of this study show that young queer people experienced the workplace across five interdependent dimensions as: 1) sexually exclusive spaces; 2) regulatory spaces; 3) silencing spaces; 4) inclusive spaces; and 5) sexually diverse spaces. Across these dimensions, young people participated in both enabling and constraining environments. Negotiating constraining work environments constituted a secondary form of labour for young queer workers as they faced adverse challenges in sustaining supportive and safe work-relationships with other organisational participants. Conversely, working in enabling work environments brought opportunities to form supportive and validating relationships with other organisational participants. Within their accounts of the workplace, young queer people were positioned as victims of symbolic and material violence, as agents of change in resisting and refuting homonegative discourse, and as equal and valued employees. This thesis concludes that while working across the multidimensions of the workplace presents complex challenges for young queer workers, it also generates solutions for the development of inclusive work environments. Accordingly, {{the findings of this study}} hold implications for change in policy and practice in the field of workplace diversity, and for extending social work knowledge in the field of sexuality...|$|E

In 2003, the Defense Science Board observed: 'The [...] . problem is that instruments that can detect the buried UXOs also detect numerous scrap metal objects and other artifacts, which leads to {{an enormous amount of}} expensive digging. Typically 100 holes may be dug before a real UXO is unearthed. The Task Force assessment is that much of this wasteful digging can be eliminated by the use of more advanced technology instruments that exploit modern digital processing and advanced multi-mode sensors to achieve an improved level <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> scrap from UXOs'.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{partnerships}} {{between black and}} white academics in social work education with a focus on the accountability of white people for understanding the implications of the history and impact of the dominant culture upon colonised or dominated cultures. This focus has particular relevance for anti-racist and anti-oppressive approaches in social work as well as other fields of study and practice such as teaching, cultural studies or health services. The paper examines the relevant literature and the justification for the teaching method developed by the authors. Results from an exploratory study into the impact of this pedagogical model are then explored. This pedagogical approach is distinct in that it engages with students within a relationship model. Conclusions drawn from the study show that black-white partnership teaching is an effective pedagogy because it allows students to apply theoretical concepts within a framework of practice within their personal and professional identities. The approach offers the potential for further development in a variety of complex contexts. This model of teaching provides a context for students to safely engage with practice skills essential for working in <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> racial <b>discrimination.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Until very {{recently}} questions of resistance seemed straightforward, addressed {{in terms of}} an analysis of power. This book demonstrates how new, radical geographies of resistance emerge, develop and operate. Radical cultural politics, exemplified by the black, feminist and gay liberation, has developed struggles to turn <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> oppression and <b>discrimination</b> into spaces <b>of</b> resistance. Post-colonial and queer theory have opened up new political spaces. Whether resistance is an act of transgression (crossing borders), opposition (such as constructing barricades), or everyday endurance (staying in place), these are geographies where space is constitutive of the social. Leading contemporary geographers draw on material from around the world, including Israel, Nepal, Canada, Philippines, Australia and Nigeria. Recasting current themes in critical human geography - politics, identity and place - the contributors introduce unexplored notions of resistance, offering exciting insights for those exploring social, cultural, urban, political and development issues in different worlds of change...|$|R
40|$|As {{the major}} <b>site</b> <b>of</b> self-nonself <b>discrimination</b> in the immune system, the thymus, if {{successfully}} transplanted, could potentially carry {{with it the}} induction of central tolerance to any other organ or tissue from the same donor. We have recently developed a technique for transplantation of an intact, vascularized thymic lobe (VTL) in miniature swine. In the present study, we have examined the ability of such VTL allografts to support thymopoiesis and induce transplantation tolerance across fully MHC-mismatched barriers. Six miniature swine recipients received fully MHC-mismatched VTL grafts with a 12 -day course of tacrolimus. Three of these recipients were thymectomized before transplantation and accepted their VTL allografts long-term, with evidence of normal thymopoiesis. In contrast, three euthymic recipients rejected their VTL allografts. Donor renal allografts, matched to the donor VTL grafts, were transplanted without immunosuppression into {{two of the three}} thymectomized recipients, and one of the three euthymic recipients. These renal allografts were accepted by thymectomized recipients, but rejected by the euthymic recipient in an accelerated fashion. This study thus demonstrates that successful transplantation of a vascularized thymus across a fully MHC-mismatched barrier induces tolerance in this preclinical, large-animal model. This procedure should enable studies {{on the role of the}} thymus in transplantation immunology as well as offer a potential strategy for tolerance induction in clinical transplantation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Research on {{discrimination}} in healthcare settings has primarily focused on health implications <b>of</b> race-based <b>discrimination</b> among ethno-racial minority groups. Little {{is known about}} <b>discrimination</b> experiences <b>of</b> other marginalized populations, particularly groups facing multiple disadvantages who may be subjected to other/multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Objectives: (1) To examine the prevalence <b>of</b> perceived <b>discrimination</b> due to homelessness/poverty, mental illness/alcohol/drug related problems, and race/ethnicity/skin color while seeking healthcare {{in the past year}} among racially diverse homeless adults with mental illness; (2) To identify whether perceiving certain types <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> is associated with increased likelihood of perceiving other kinds of discrimination; and (3) To examine association <b>of</b> these perceived <b>discrimination</b> experiences with socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptomatology and substance use, and Emergency Department utilization. Methods We used baseline data from the Toronto <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the At Home/Chez Soi randomized controlled trial of Housing First for homeless adults with mental illness (n[*]=[*] 550). Bivariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used for the analysis. Results Perceived discrimination related to homelessness/poverty (30. 4 %) and mental illness/alcohol/substance use (32. 5 %) is prevalent among ethnically diverse homeless adults with mental illness in healthcare settings. Only 15 % of the total participants reported discrimination due to race/ethnicity/skin color. After controlling for relevant confounders and presence of psychosis, all types <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in healthcare settings were associated with more frequent ED use, a greater - 3 - severity of lifetime substance abuse, and mental health problems.

Both the cases and the interviews suggest that the major forms <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> against women in IT organisations revolve around pregnancy, maternity leave, the unavailability of part-time work to accommodate family responsibilities, and sexual harassment.

In this study of mental health workers, we contrast four potential perpetrators <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> (managers, co-workers, patients, and visitors) to investigate whether the negative impact <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> on victims’ well-being will vary in strength depending on the relative power of the perpetrator. We further explore whether the negative impact <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> is at least partly explained by its effects on people’s sense of organizational justice, and whether the strength of mediation varies according to the source <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Using survey data from 1, 733 UK mental health workers, a structural equation model was designed to test these hypotheses following a bootstrap approach. Discrimination from all sources was related to well-being, with that from managers having the strongest effects. The results support an explanation of the effect <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> on well-being in terms of organizational justice perceptions for discrimination from managers and from visitors, but less so for discrimination from co-workers or from patients.
