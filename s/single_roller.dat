2500|$|The {{origins of}} the {{spinning}} wheel are unclear but India {{is one of the}} probable places of its origin. The device certainly reached Europe from India by the 14th century. The cotton gin was invented in India as a mechanical device known as charkhi, the [...] "wooden-worm-worked roller". This mechanical device was, {{in some parts of the}} region, driven by water power. The Ajanta caves yield evidence of a <b>single</b> <b>roller</b> cotton gin in use by the 5th century. This cotton gin was used until further innovations were made in form of foot powered gins. Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647, for obtaining technology for sugar-refining. Each mission returned with different results on refining sugar.|$|E
2500|$|Centrifugal Railway was {{the name}} of a number of early looping roller {{coasters}} that were built in Western Europe {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. These rides were very similar in their basic design to many modern day shuttle roller coasters (i.e., they did not make a complete circuit), but with only one lift hill and no launch. A <b>single</b> <b>roller</b> coaster car would ascend to the peak on the coaster before descending rapidly down the same hill and then passing through the central loop with enough speed and centrifugal force to remain on the track at the top of the loop. The size of these centrifugal railways differed; some were purported to have vertical loops of a mere , while others were estimated to be [...] (although, as described below, early coaster designers were prone to cases of gross exaggeration).|$|E

50|$|The {{weight of}} the 2S25 is 18 tonnes which is {{comparable}} to that of infantry fighting vehicles. Like the BMD-3, the 2S25 features hydropneumatic suspension with a variable height clearance of 190-590 mm within 6-7 seconds to reduce visibility. Hydropneumatic suspension provides high smoothness while driving and dampens recoil of the main gun. Suspension on each side consists of seven <b>single</b> <b>rollers,</b> four support rollers, rear wheel drive and a front-mounted steering wheel. There are hydraulic track adjusters in assistance for greater mobility. In the engine-transmission compartment, multi-fuel diesel engine 2V-06-2S installed, which develops a power of 510 hp (380 kW). It features an automatic transmission that has five gears forward and five gears reverse.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the cotton gin consisted of a <b>single</b> <b>roller</b> made of iron or wood and a flat piece of stone or wood. Evidence {{for this type of}} gin has been found in Africa, Asia, and North America. The first documentation of the cotton gin by contemporary scholars is found in the fifth century A.D., in the form of Buddhist paintings depicting a single-roller gin in the Ajanta Caves in western India. These early gins were difficult to use and required a great deal of skill. A narrow <b>single</b> <b>roller</b> was necessary to expel the seeds from the cotton without crushing the seeds. The design was similar to that of a mealing stone, which was used to grind grain. The early history of the cotton gin is ambiguous, because archeologists likely mistook the cotton gin's parts for other tools.|$|E

50|$|The curtain weir was {{attached}} to the superstructure of the Pont de la Machine bridging the right arm of the river Rhône. The old superstructure was replaced during the construction of the power plant by a new superstructure for pedestrian use made from puddled iron. The chosen building material was strong enough to support the additional lateral forces introduced by the curtain weir into the structure. The curtain weir consisted of 39 <b>single</b> <b>roller</b> blinds made from larch wood. It was able to dam the Rhône to a height of maximal 3.3 meters.|$|E

5000|$|Roller {{chain is}} ordinarily hooked up using a master link (also {{known as a}} {{connecting}} link), which typically has one pin held by a horseshoe clip rather than friction fit, allowing it to be inserted or removed with simple tools. Chain with a removable link or pin {{is also known as}} cottered chain, which allows the length of the chain to be adjusted. Half links (also known as offsets) are available and are used to increase the length of the chain by a <b>single</b> <b>roller.</b> Riveted roller chain has the master link (also known as a connecting link) [...] "riveted" [...] or mashed on the ends. These pins are made to be durable and are not removable.|$|E

50|$|Duplex or <b>single</b> row <b>roller</b> chains {{have been}} used to drive {{overhead}} camshafts in automobile and motorcycle engines. By the early 1960s most production automobile overhead camshaft designs used chains to drive the camshaft(s). Timing chain systems are noisier and more expensive than timing belt systems. Timing chains do not usually require replacement at regular intervals, but there have been exceptions, including the timing chain in the Triumph Stag, which has a recommended life of 30000 mi.|$|R
50|$|Bitelli was an {{engineering}} company located in Bologna, Italy - the largest and, perhaps best known, Italian construction machinery firm.

Tandem rollers were soon added and In 1969 the first <b>single</b> drum <b>rollers</b> were manufactured. In 1978 Bitelli built its first paving machine and, during the 1980s, road profilers and soil stabilizers were added to the line of road machines.|$|R

50|$|Harold Dew {{left the}} company in February 1914 {{and set up a}} new concern at Charlotte Place, Clapham, London {{registered}} as D.U. Manufacturing Co making a car called the D'Ultra. This was available as either a two-seat car or delivery van and used a water-cooled Chater-Lea 8 hp 50-degree V-twin engine with 4-speed friction transmission. This transmission involved a prop-shaft to which was attached a friction disc driving a countershaft and thence by a <b>single</b> <b>roller</b> chain to the cantilever sprung rear axle, which was not fitted with a differential. The front suspension was by a transverse semi-elliptic leaf spring, and the steering was of the rack and pinion type. As was common with cycle cars the braking was only on the rear wheels, and while this was initially described as being both by internal expanding and contracting types operating on two drums the reality was rather different (see below). The ladder frame is described as being 'made of re-inforced ash, and is of quite simple design with only three cross-members'. Price was £115 complete with head lamps, hood, and wind screen.|$|E
50|$|Wolseley's postwar engines {{were all}} of the single overhead-{{camshaft}} type, the camshaft driven by a vertical shaft from the crankshaft. The eight-cylinder 21-60 held the vertical shaft in {{the centre of the}} engine, and both crankshaft and camshaft were divided at their midpoints. Their smallest engine of 847cc was designed and made for Morris's new Minor at Ward End with the camshaft drive's shaft the spindle of the dynamo driven by spiral bevel gears. But it was relatively expensive to build and inclined to oil leaks, so its design was modified to a conventional side-valve layout by Morris Engines, which was put into production just for Morris cars in 1932. Meanwhile, Wolseley expanded their original design from four to six cylinders. That six-cylinder single OHC engine announced in September 1930 powered the Wolseley Hornet and several famous MG models. This tiny 6-cylinder SOHC engine eventually was made in three different sizes and its camshaft drive continued to evolve from the dynamo's spindle to, in the end, an automatically tensioned <b>single</b> <b>roller</b> chain.|$|E
