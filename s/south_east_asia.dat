5|$|On 22 March, as {{the joint}} battles of Meiktila and Mandalay were {{drawing to a}} close, a conference was held at Monywa in Burma, {{attended}} by senior Allied military figures including Admiral Lord Mountbatten, {{the commander in chief}} of the Allied <b>South</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Command, and General William Slim, commander of Fourteenth Army. The object of the conference was to discuss future Allied strategy in <b>South</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> in the aftermath of Meiktila and Mandalay, including the reconquest of Burma and the retaking of Malaya and then Singapore. In order to secure these objectives however, Rangoon, the capital of Burma, would have to be captured before the onset of the monsoon rains, which would impede any Allied advance over land; the Allied Chiefs of Staff worked on the assumption that this would occur before June. After Rangoon had fallen, a force of between four and five divisions would be landed in Western Malaya in an operation code-named Zipper, which would itself be followed by Mailfist, the capture of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|S. Paranavitana {{offered a}} novel surmise {{explaining}} {{the origins of}} the Ariyacakravarti. According to him the Aryacakravarti are descendants of Chandrabhanu a Malay chieftain, who invaded the island from Tambralinga in 1247. According to him refugees and immigrants from the Indian kingdom of Kalinga founded similarly named Kingdoms in <b>South</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia,</b> and some of them came due to various reasons to north Sri Lanka and founded the Jaffna Kingdom. This view has been refuted by noted Indian historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastry as having no credible evidence, and other historians such as Louis Charles Damais (1911–66), an expert on Indonesian studies, Yutaka Iwamoto (1910–88), a Buddhist scholar, and S. Pathmanathan. They assert that there were no kingdoms in <b>South</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> called Kalinga and such assertions are based on erroneous readings of the Chinese name for a locality called Ho-ling which actually stood for Walain not Kalinga. Further S. Pathmanathan asserts that Chandrabhanu had categorically claimed Padmavamsa lineage whereas S. Paranavitana had adduced a Gangavamsa lineage to the Aryacakravarti. Further he notes that the inscriptions that S. Paranavitana used to make his theory have not been deciphered by any other scholar to imply a Javaka connection to the Aryacakravartis.|$|E
