25|$|Dyfri Williams, {{previously}} the Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, dated {{the cup to}} AD 5–15. Williams {{identified several}} factors supporting this dating. The <b>silver</b> <b>alloy</b> being 95% pure is consistent with other known Roman silver vessels, with silver from later periods having a far higher purity. Cracks in the cup retain chemical corrosion products which are symptomatic of age, remaining despite being cleaned twice during the 20th century. An EDX analysis showed that the corrosion was silver chloride. The decorative style and shape have a close parallel with many other vessels of the period, such as the Chryses kantharos and the closely matching figures of nude men on the Hoby skyphoi, discovered {{a decade after the}} Warren cup was first recorded.|$|E
500|$|In March 1970, the {{two houses}} reached a {{compromise}} whereby 150 million dollars would be {{struck in the}} 40% <b>silver</b> <b>alloy</b> for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities. The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, {{with the aid of}} Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as [...] "a lot less than the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get". The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.|$|E
500|$|Florins {{bearing a}} left-facing effigy of George V by Sir Bertram Mackennal were minted in {{each year of}} the King's reign (1910–1936) except 1910 and 1934. The initial reverse design (1911–1926) was {{developed}} internally at the Royal Mint, and {{is intended to be}} that of the 1887 double florin, to which the Jubilee florin is very similar. The weight and diameter of the coin were unchanged but, because of rises in the price of silver, the metallic composition was changed in 1920 from 0.925 silver to 50% silver, 40% copper, 10% nickel, then again in 1922 to 50% silver, 50% copper, and again in 1927 to 50% silver, 40% copper, 5% nickel, 5% zinc. The changes in alloy after 1920 were due to the Mint trying to find a <b>silver</b> <b>alloy</b> that would remain attractive as it wore. The inscriptions on the obverse of the original version of the George V florin were [...] and on the reverse were [...] and the year of striking.|$|E
30|$|The {{numerous}} analyses {{conducted over}} decades about corrosion rate, underlying mechanisms and the subsequently formed corrosion products, {{demonstrate that the}} corrosion process of <b>silver</b> <b>alloys</b> is affected by several parameters such as temperature, moist content, concentration of H 2 S [11 – 28]. Compared to pure <b>silver,</b> <b>alloys</b> have several additional properties (e.g. silver-rich and copper-rich phases, grain boundaries precipitation) that affect the corrosion process {{from the very first}} steps in the making of an object. For example, production methods such as casting, hammering, coinage, rolling or annealing have a considerable impact on the distribution of copper rich phases in the bulk and at the surface and influence the corrosion process [1, 8, 29].|$|R
30|$|Many {{historic}} silver {{objects are}} not made of pure silver but rather of silver alloyed with small but variable amounts of copper. For example, a typical alloy used in jewellery is sterling silver (Ag: 92.5 w%; Cu: 7.5 w%), which consists of an Ag-rich matrix containing Cu-rich inclusions. It {{is well known that}} small amounts of Cu {{play a crucial role in}} the corrosion process of <b>silver</b> <b>alloys</b> due to the preferential oxidation of Cu [1]. As a result of this, the composition, microstructure and physical properties of tarnish layers formed on top of pure silver is substantially different from the ones formed on <b>silver</b> <b>alloys,</b> although all advanced forms of tarnish layers have a very similar visual appearance: black and dull.|$|R
40|$|Energy-dispersive X-ray {{fluorescence}} (EDXRF) -analysis is {{a technique}} which {{in the case of}} metals analyzes thin surface layers. For example, when gold and <b>silver</b> <b>alloys</b> are analyzed, it typically interests a depth of microns up to a maximum of tens of microns. Therefore, it can give wrong results or be affected by a large indetermination when the sample composition is altered because of surface processes, as often happens when <b>silver</b> <b>alloys</b> are oxidated, and sometimes in the case of gold alloys rich on copper or silver. A complementary technique was therefore developed, of bulk analysis, which uses the same equipment employed for EDXRF-analysis; the X-ray beam from the X-ray tube is monochromatized by means of a tin secondary target, which K lines bracket the silver-K discontinuity. The sample to be analyzed is positioned between the secondary target and the detector. This technique is able to determine (by measuring the attenuation of tin-K rays) thickness and/or composition of gold and <b>silver</b> <b>alloys</b> having a thickness of less than about 120 [*]µm for gold and about 0. 7 [*]mm for silver. The method was tested with Au–Ag–Cu alloys of known composition and thickness and then applied to gold and silver artifacts from the tomb of the Lady of Cao, which belongs to the Moche pre-hispanic culture from the North of Peru, and dates about 300 A.

2500|$|The very {{earliest}} {{precious metals}} had mixes {{of gold and}} silver; gold and <b>silver</b> <b>alloy</b> is called electrum. With the advent of coinage, methods had to be invented to remove impurities from the gold so that gold of specific purities could be made. Cupellation was able to remove gold and silver from mixtures containing lead and other metals, but silver could not be removed. Gold parting as a process was specifically invented to remove the silver. The main ancient process of gold parting was by salt cementation and there is archaeological evidence of that process from the 6th century BC in Sardis, Lydia. [...] In the post-medieval period parting using antimony, sulfates and mineral acids was also used. In the modern period chlorination using the Miller process, and electrolysis using the Wohlwill process are {{the most widely used}} methods of refining gold by removing silver and platinum.|$|E

Flutes {{that are more}} expensive are usually made of more precious metals, most commonly solid sterling silver (92.5% silver), and other alloys including French silver (95% silver, 5% copper), [...] "coin silver" [...] (90% silver), or Britannia silver (95.8% silver). It is reported that old Louis Lot French flutes have a particular sound by nature of their specific <b>silver</b> <b>alloy.</b> [...] Gold/silver flutes are even more expensive.

Flutes can also be made out of wood, with African blackwood (grenadilla or Dalbergia melanoxylon) being the most common today. Formerly cocuswood was used but this is hard to obtain today. Wooden flutes were far more common before the early 20th century. The silver flute was introduced by Boehm in 1847, but did not become common until later in the 20th century. Wm.S.Haynes, a flute manufacturer in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, told Georges Barrère that in 1905 he made one silver flute to every 100 wooden flutes, but in the 1930s, he made one wooden flute to every 100 silver flutes.|$|E
2500|$|To {{qualify as}} {{treasure}} trove, an object must be precious, {{it must be}} hidden, and there must be no proof of its property or reasonable presumption of its former ownership. Unlike under English common law, treasure is not restricted to only gold and silver objects. In 1888 a prehistoric jet necklace and some other articles found in Forfarshire were claimed by the authorities though they were neither gold nor silver. A compromise was eventually reached, and the find was deposited in the National Museum of Scotland. In July 1958, a porpoise bone was found together with 28 other objects of <b>silver</b> <b>alloy</b> (12 brooches, seven bowls, a hanging bowl and other small metal work) underneath a stone slab marked with a cross {{on the floor of}} St. Ninian's Church on St. Ninian's Isle in Shetland. The objects were dated to about 800 A.D. A dispute having arisen over ownership of the objects between the Crown on the one hand, and the finder (the University of Aberdeen, which had carried out the archaeological excavation) and the landowner on the other, in Lord Advocate v. University of Aberdeen (1963) the Court of Session held that the bone should be regarded as treasure trove together with the silver objects. Further, the requirement that an object must be [...] "hidden" [...] means no more than that it must be concealed; it refers to the condition in which the object was found and does not refer back to the intention which the owner of the object may have had in hiding it. Finally, the requirement that there must be no reasonable presumption of former ownership means that it must not be possible to trace the ownership of the object to a person or family currently existing. Even if an object does not qualify as treasure trove, it may be claimed by the Crown as bona vacantia.|$|E
40|$|Contact {{materials}} used for electrical breakers are often made with <b>silver</b> <b>alloys.</b> Mechanical and thermodynamical properties {{as well as}} electron emission of such complicated alloys present a lack of reliable and accurate experimental data. At present, new types of contactors with longer duration are marketed, but manufacturers do not understand well why this improvement. This paper deals mainly with electron work function (EWF) measurements in UHV conditions. Also, the photoelectric emission from silver-metal (Ag-Me) electrical contacts (Ag-Ni (60 / 40), Ag-Ni (70 / 30) and Ag-W (50 / 50)) has been investigated in the spectral range of 196 - 256 nm. The effects of thermal surface treatment on EWF of the abovementioned contacts were studied at room temperature and residual gas pressure of 1. 4 x 10 - 7 mbar. The EWF of the contact pastille made with <b>silver</b> <b>alloys</b> Ag-Ni and Ag-W varies with surface treatments: cleaning by vacuum outgassing and annealing (long heating time in UHV). By heating alloy contact in ultra high vacuum large variations of EWF have been observed, which result from material component vaporization by sheets. In addition, the influence of arcing on EWF of binary alloys has been investigated. Also, EWF varies {{with the number of}} applied arcs. Therefore, after 500 arcs in air, the observed EWF increasing is probably due to progressive inclusion of oxide on alloy surface. Microscopic examination is necessary to get better understandings on EWF of <b>silver</b> <b>alloys,</b> for both virgin and eroded electric contacts.
