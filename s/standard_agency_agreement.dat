40|$|Although not for {{the first}} time, the new Civil Code {{regulated}} separately the <b>agency</b> <b>agreement</b> in art. 2072 - 2095. As a consequence of the monist concept, the new Civil Code includes many agreements from now on, including those considered up to present proper to the commercial activity. It is also the case of the <b>agency</b> <b>agreement,</b> previously regulated by a special normative document that is Law no. 509 / 2002, based on a Directive of the European Union. The rules comprised in the present regulation define a separate agreement, stand-alone agreement, with its own features, in agreement with the part it plays in achieving the intermediation activity, a part legally established by the law of the European Union. The present study is focused on the analysis of the legal regime of the <b>agency</b> <b>agreement,</b> in accordance with the new Civil Code, dealing with the following aspects: its legal frame, its legal definition and features, the content of the agreement, its effects and the termination of the <b>agency</b> <b>agreement...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{a long-standing}} {{antitrust}} principle that agency relationships {{are exempt from}} price-fixing violations. But the agency relationship must be "genuine. " To discern genuine <b>agency</b> <b>agreements,</b> the prevailing approach adopted in both the United States and the European Union focuses on whether the agent has incurred any specific risk or cost {{in relation to the}} distribution of the manufacturer's goods. Yet this approach has tended to obscure the economic nature of agency relationships. The real question to ask is not whether the agent has incurred any specific cost or risk, but instead whether, in a given case, an agency model, rather than a distribution model, actually constitutes a more efficient form for organizing distribution functions between the contracting parties. In fact, over {{a quarter of a century}} ago, Judge Richard Posner proposed a business justification approach for analyzing <b>agency</b> <b>agreements</b> in Morrison v. Murray Biscuit. Building on Morrison, and on the economic literature of property rights and agency problems, this article explores the fundamental question of how parties choose to enter into an optimal contractual form, and, moreover, proposes an economic approach to discern genuine <b>agency</b> <b>agreements.</b> It also calls for revision of the current EU Vertical Guidelines on <b>agency</b> <b>agreements,</b> which are so stringent that they deter businesses unnecessarily from entering into agency arrangements.
