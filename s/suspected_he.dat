5|$|Between 1949 and 1958 Rejewski was {{repeatedly}} {{investigated by the}} Polish Office of Public Security, who <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was {{a former member of}} the Polish Armed Forces in the West. He retired in 1967, and moved with his family back to Warsaw in 1969, to an apartment he had acquired 30 years earlier with financial help from his father-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Domitian also heavily prosecuted {{corruption}} among public officials, removing jurors if {{they accepted}} bribes and rescinding legislation when {{a conflict of}} interest was <b>suspected.</b> <b>He</b> ensured that libellous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for satire {{at the expense of the}} government. Consequently, he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public.|$|E
5|$|Richard and his wife, Lucille, {{lived in}} Montreal where they raised seven children: Huguette, Maurice Jr., Norman, André, Suzanne, Polo and Jean. They had 14 grandchildren. Lucille {{died of cancer}} in 1994, two years after the Richards celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Richard's {{companion}} late in his life was Sonia Raymond. It was announced in 1998 that Richard was suffering from abdominal cancer. As his health deteriorated, Richard was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and doctors <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> had Alzheimer's disease. He died on May 27, 2000, of respiratory failure {{as a result of his}} cancer.|$|E

5|$|The Knicks were shorthanded {{with their}} {{starting}} center, Phil Jordon, out sick. Jordon's illness was officially reported as influenza {{but it was}} widely <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was simply hung over. Jordon, in an early-season game, had played Chamberlain even, scoring 33points to the Warriors center's 34. The Knicks instead started , , second-year player Darrall Imhoff, a strong defensive player in college who led the California Golden Bears to the NCAA championship in 1959 and {{won a gold medal}} in the 1960 Summer Olympics. New York also had , , backup center Cleveland Buckner, a better shooter than a defender who Chamberlain overpowered for an NBA record 28points in one quarter two days earlier.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he scored}} 834 runs but his average fell to 21.94 {{and he never}} again {{averaged}} over 23 in any season in which he played regularly. Owing to his increasing weight and lack of physical fitness, he found batting much harder. As his physique declined, {{he was unable to}} produce the same batting feats he had managed previously. In the field, although still catching effectively, his inability to chase the ball meant he fielded closer to the batsmen; he also took fewer catches. In both 1934 and 1935, he averaged around 22 with the bat and scored under 800 runs. In 1935, he scored his final first-class century, against Somerset, having not reached the landmark since 1931. Team-mates and observers noticed that in the final years of his career, Chapman frequently left the field during matches, and they <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was drinking in the pavilion.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, {{as he returned}} from a lower-body injury that kept him from the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell to the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his adductor tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out of the lineup, Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E

25|$|American chemist and psychopharmacologist Alexander Shulgin {{reported}} he synthesized MDMA in 1965 while researching methylenedioxy compounds at Dow Chemical Company, {{but did not}} {{test the}} psychoactivity of the compound at this time. Around 1970, Shulgin sent instructions for N-methylated MDA (MDMA) synthesis to the founder of a Los Angeles chemical company who had requested them. This individual later provided these instructions to a client in the Midwest. Shulgin may have <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> {{played a role in}} the emergence of MDMA in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Based on maps {{from the}} Archives nationales and local probate records, Peter Hamilton, author of Colonial Mobile (1910), {{concluded}} correctly {{that the site}} was located at Twenty-Seven Mile Bluff. He claimed locating the well and finding bullets, crockery, large-headed spikes, and a brass ornament at the site. During {{a visit to the}} site in 1902, Carey Butt, a colleague of Peter Hamilton, <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> had located the powder magazine of Fort Louis. Based on the maps and the claims of Butt, the Iberville Historical Society erected a monument at the site in 1902 during the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the founding of Mobile.|$|E

25|$|On November 20, 2007, Linda {{filed for}} divorce in Pinellas County, Florida. In November 2008, Linda claimed {{to the public that}} she made the {{decision}} to end her marriage after finding out about Hogan's affair. In his 2009 autobiography, Hogan acknowledged that Linda on numerous occasions <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was having infidelities whenever he developed friendships with other women, but denied allegations that he ever cheated on her. Bollea only retained around 30% of the couple's liquid assets totaling around $10million in the divorce settlement. Hogan considered committing suicide after the divorce and credits Laila Ali, his co-star on American Gladiators, with preventing him from doing so.|$|E
25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings you up short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> ought to be.|$|E
25|$|But when he {{was shot}} down Bryks was wearing the Mae West {{lifejacket}} of a Polish colleague from 242 Squadron, F/O Henry Skalsky. Therefore the Germans who questioned him at St Omer <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was Polish, and sent him to Dulag Luft at Oberursel in Hesse for interrogation by a Polish-speaking German officer. There he was accused of shooting a Luftwaffe fighter pilot who was parachuting from his Bf 109 in the air battle near St Omer on 17 June. For this he was threatened with being court-martialled in Berlin. After the war no such shooting was found in German records for that day. The accusation {{seems to have been a}} false one to put pressure Bryks.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} {{first appeared}} in early 1995 as a potential love interest for Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). Before the two finally got together, Tiffany embarked on a relationship with reformed junkie Billy (Darren Young) which landed her with hepatitis C. Tiffany and Chris married in a Valentine's Day ceremony in 1996 but the marriage quickly dissolved when Chris cheated on her. Tiffany later dated and married Johnny Marinovich after a period when she <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was a child molestor. The character starred in a dramatic storyline in mid-1998 when she fell from a high rise building after trying to talk down {{a man on the}} roof. Tiffany ended up brain dead but her unborn baby was saved; Tiffany's life support was turned off soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|On 16 December 2005, Sinn Féin {{president}} Gerry Adams {{announced to}} {{a press conference}} in Dublin that Donaldson had been an agent for British intelligence. This was confirmed by Donaldson in a statement which he read out on RTÉ, the Irish state broadcaster, shortly afterwards. According to the British agent known as 'Martin', leading South Armagh republicans blamed him for IRA operations which had been compromised and <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> had planted covert listening devices which they had found. He stated that he was recruited after compromising himself during a vulnerable time in his life, but did not specify why he was vulnerable or why he would risk his life as a mole for British intelligence in an area such as West Belfast.|$|E
25|$|The book {{became an}} {{immediate}} bestseller but also prompted a vicious backlash from General Motors (GM) {{who attempted to}} discredit Nader by tapping his phone {{in an attempt to}} uncover salacious information and, when that failed, hiring prostitutes in an attempt to catch him in a compromising situation. Nader, by then working as an unpaid consultant to United States Senator Abe Ribicoff, reported to the senator that he <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was being followed. Ribicoff convened an inquiry that called GM CEO James Roche who admitted, when placed under oath, that the company had hired a private detective agency to investigate Nader. Nader sued GM for invasion of privacy, settling the case for $425,000 and using the proceeds to found the activist organization the Center for the Study of Responsive Law.|$|E

25|$|At the Rome Conference (5–6 January 1917) Lloyd George, {{advised by}} Hankey, {{proposed}} sending heavy guns to Italy {{with a view}} to defeating Austria-Hungary, possibly to be balanced by a transfer of Italian troops to Salonika. Robertson stressed that this was contrary to agreed policy and hinted that he might resign. Cadorna (Hankey <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> had been “got at by Robertson”) stressed the logistical difficulty of accepting the heavy guns, even when Lloyd George removed the precondition that they be returned to the Western Front by May, and even Albert Thomas (French Minister of Munitions) thought it unwise to remove the guns from the Western Front. Robertson wrote to Lloyd George explicitly threatening to resign if he acted on Briand’s impassioned plea to send more divisions to Salonika.|$|E
25|$|Swango's lackadaisical {{approach}} to his studies {{caught up with}} him a month before he was due to graduate, when it was discovered that he had faked checkups during his OB/GYN rotation. A number of his fellow students had <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> had been faking checkups as early as his second year. He was nearly expelled, but was allowed to remain when one member of the committee voted to give him a second chance; at the time, a unanimous vote was required for a student to be dismissed. Even earlier, several students and faculty members had raised concerns about his competence to practice medicine. Eventually, the school allowed him to graduate one year after his entering classmates, on condition that he repeat the OB/GYN rotation and complete several assignments in other specialties.|$|E
25|$|In June 2010, German {{scientists}} {{said they}} believed there was evidence that he had died of sickle cell disease. Other experts, however, rejected the hypothesis of homozygous sickle cell disease based on survival beyond the age of 5 {{and the location of}} the osteonecrosis, which is characteristic of Freiberg-Kohler syndrome rather than sickle-cell disease. Research conducted in 2005 by archaeologists, radiologists, and geneticists, who performed CT scans on the mummy, found that he was not killed by a blow to the head, as previously thought. New CT images discovered congenital flaws, which are more common among the children of incest. Siblings are more likely to pass on twin copies of deleterious alleles, which is why children of incest more commonly manifest genetic defects. It is <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> also had a partially cleft palate, another congenital defect.|$|E
