5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because {{it would have been better}} had witnesses not <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> being questioned.|$|E

25|$|The tee {{shots on}} Holes 1, 3, 8, 15 and 17 are blind, {{and there are}} several blind {{approach}} shots on Holes 2, 6 and 14. The second and third shots at Hole 9 are blind, depending on length. There also are several holes that are semi-blind; the surface of the green cannot be seen when playing approach shots on Holes 5, 10, 18, and on 15 (for the long hitter). These blind shots are only blind once. Still, they do make Wykagyl difficult to play for a golfer who has never <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> Wykagyl is unique in its mix of par threes, par fours and par fives. Most 18-hole courses have four par threes, four par fives and ten par fours, but Wykagyl has five par fives, five par threes and eight par fours.|$|E

500|$|Co-writer James Wong {{felt that}} the changes {{he was asked to}} make to the script led to [...] "Shadows" [...] turning out to be [...] "an average episode", {{although}} he felt [...] "the director did a good job with it". His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, like you have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> which is exactly what the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story. An FBI sting and a good mystery that Mulder and Scully investigate. Overall, a really solid episode." [...] The plot for [...] "Shadows" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Ellen Steiber, under the title Haunted.|$|E
500|$|... "Chair Model" [...] was {{the third}} episode of the series {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz. Blitz had previously directed [...] "The Convict" [...] and [...] "The Negotiation". The episode was written by B. J. Novak, who plays temporary worker turned corporate manager Ryan Howard. Novak was originally going to name the episode [...] "Michael Dating", but the title could have potentially been a spoiler because fans with DVRs would have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> [...] "Dinner Party" [...] aired and deduced that Michael and Jan's relationship had completely fallen apart. For a while, [...] "Parking" [...] {{was going to be}} the title, but even that was decided against because that refers to the subplot, and also because it was generic and boring even by the show's no-frills-titles standard. Eventually, someone suggested [...] "Chair Model", which was eventually kept as the name. Originally, Novak wrote Jim putting Dwight through a [...] "phony management training", but NBC pointed out that it felt like the writers had done it before even though they had not. As a group, the writers tried to think of a new idea for the plot; they considered having Pam move in with Jim, but they thought that first the two should be engaged.|$|E
500|$|On April 26, 2016, Deadline {{reported}} that Aml Ameen abruptly left production {{a couple of}} episodes into filming of the second season over a conflict with Lana Wachowski that started during the table read for the season and progressively got worse. Both the Deadline article and Ameen's co-star on Sense8, Tuppence Middleton, suggested the conflict was over [...] When asked about it, Straczynski commented he was not there {{to know what happened}} between Ameen and Lana but he respects the choices of both. Subsequent to Ameen's departure, the role of Capheus was recast to Toby Onwumere after a seven-day auditioning process. Onwumere watched a few episodes of the show to prepare for his audition, as he had not <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> The actor said about his approach to the character: [...] "My duty [...] not to emulate exactly what [...] has done, ... but just to give it my own spin, and kind of do my own thing, and just give this character the same essence, but ... maybe a different life and a different take on it." [...] Earlier in April, Kick Gurry, who had played parts in the Wachowskis' Speed Racer and Jupiter Ascending in the past, revealed he had been cast in the second season, after Lana called to inform him that they had a written a role specifically for him. In May, Deadline reported Ben Cole had been cast as Todd, a sensate who would rather be [...] "normal". In September, Sylvester McCoy reportedly revealed he filmed three or four episodes of the second season of a Netflix show, later identified to be Sense8, and has signed to appear in further seasons if he is wanted. Martin Wuttke, who had minor roles in Cloud Atlas, also joined the cast in the second season.|$|E

2500|$|Fitch {{was able}} to damage Ike Clanton's {{credibility}} through skillful questioning. In response to his questioning, Clanton denied seeking confirmation from Wyatt Earp about the reward offered by Wells, Fargo & Co, [...] "dead or alive", for the stage robbers. When shown the telegram confirming the reward would be paid in either circumstance, he denied having ever <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> On November 12, he got Clanton to testify {{that he had never}} spoken to Ned Boyle {{on the morning of the}} gunfight, and on November 23, Boyle's testimony contradicted Clanton's. During Ike Clanton's testimony under cross-examination by Fitch, he said [...] "I don't remember" [...] 14 times. This and other contradictions impugned Clanton's testimony.|$|E
2500|$|At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper gave Gracie [...] "Two Thumbs up," [...] stating, [...] "You've <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> but you'll {{rarely see}} it better." [...] Gracie is a New York Times Critics' Pick. Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis {{described}} Gracie as [...] "a familiar underdog story told with unusual sensitivity [...] “Gracie” connects the adversity-drama dots — the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter — with a subtle {{awareness of the}} shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley’s refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, {{like that of a}} good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens." [...] Bill Zwecker, of the Chicago Sun-Times, stated, [...] "It's a sweet and uplifting film, and though quite predictable, gives us a family drama that showcases simple truths about overcoming seemingly impossible odds and leaves you with a warm and very satisfying feeling deep down. It's a solid, hopeful and inspiring story that reminds us of what we might call 'old-fashioned' values about perseverance and making your dreams come true. Old-fashioned? Not at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|Men that {{believe in}} Jesus Christ to the effectual {{receiving}} of Jesus Christ, {{they are born}} to it.

[...] "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." [...] Now unless he be born of God, he cannot <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Suppose the kingdom of God be what it will, he cannot <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> he be begotten of God; suppose it be the Gospel, he cannot <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> he be brought {{into a state of}} regeneration; believing is the consequence of the new birth, [...] "not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God." ...|$|R

2500|$|IGN {{scored the}} game a 9.1/10 {{and said that}} [...] "anyone looking for a first-person shooter that offers more than flat, stereotypical {{characters}} and copy-and-paste supersoldier plots, one that attempts to establish a {{sense of right and}} wrong and loops you into the decision making process, and one that's set in one of the most vividly realized settings around should pick up BioShock 2. It's a game in which story, setting, and gameplay are expertly blended to create an experience that's as thought-provoking as it is entertaining." [...] IGN's review also stated that the game does not look as visually impressive as its predecessor, but it is still one of the best-looking games around because of its unique art style. In a round-table style video chat, IGN editors said that Rapture was less mysterious because players have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> and that was a major strike against the game. Since the original had such an eerie mysterious feel to it, the twists and turns seen in the sequel seemed less surprising.|$|E
