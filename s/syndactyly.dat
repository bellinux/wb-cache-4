25|$|<b>Syndactyly</b> {{and other}} {{deformities}} are typically observed and diagnosed at birth. Long QT syndrome sometimes presents {{itself as a}} complication due to surgery to correct <b>syndactyly.</b> Other times, children collapse spontaneously while playing. In all cases it is confirmed with ECG measurements. Sequencing of the CACNA1C gene further confirms the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|A limb anomaly {{is called}} a dysmelia. These include all forms of limbs anomalies, such as amelia, ectrodactyly, phocomelia, polymelia, polydactyly, <b>syndactyly,</b> polysyndactyly, oligodactyly, brachydactyly, achondroplasia, {{congenital}} aplasia or hypoplasia, amniotic band syndrome, and cleidocranial dysostosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syndactyly</b> / Polydactyly – The {{most common}} of {{congenital}} malformations affecting limbs. It {{is believed that}} <b>Syndactyly,</b> exhibits in variation, in which digits can be fused either partially or across its entire length, or as simple as only being connected superficially by skin. It affects 1 in every 2,000 – 3,000 live births. Polydactyly {{is the presence of}} extra fingers or toes at birth, and is believed to affect somewhere around 2 out of every 1,000 live births. However, it is believed that many cases are so minor that they are taken care of shortly after birth and not reported, so actual statistics may be higher.|$|E
25|$|Timothy {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal dominant disorder characterized by physical malformations, as well as neurological and developmental defects, including heart QT-prolongation, heart arrhythmias, structural heart defects, <b>syndactyly</b> (webbing of fingers and toes) and autism spectrum disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Syndactyly,</b> as {{it occurs}} in birds, is like anisodactyly, except that {{the third and fourth}} toes (the outer and middle forward-pointing toes), or three toes, are fused together, as in the belted {{kingfisher}} Ceryle alcyon. This is characteristic of Coraciiformes (kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{typically}} used to correct structural heart defects and <b>syndactyly.</b> Propanolol or beta-adrenergic blockers are often prescribed {{as well as}} insertion of a pacemaker to maintain proper heart rhythm. With the characterization of Timothy syndrome mutations indicating that they cause defects in calcium currents, {{it has been suggested}} that calcium channel blockers may be effective as a therapeutic agent.|$|E
25|$|Children often face medical issues very {{different}} from the experiences of an adult patient. Many birth defects or syndromes present at birth are best treated in childhood, and pediatric plastic surgeons specialize in treating these conditions in children. Conditions commonly treated by pediatric plastic surgeons include craniofacial anomalies, <b>Syndactyly</b> (webbing of the fingers and toes), Polydactyly (excess fingers and toes at birth), cleft lip and palate, and congenital hand deformities.|$|E
25|$|Atypical Timothy {{syndrome}} {{has largely}} the same symptoms as the classical form. Differences in the atypical form are {{the lack of}} <b>syndactyly,</b> the presence of musculoskeletal problems (particularly hyperflexible joints), and atrial fibrillation. Patients with atypical Timothy syndrome also have more facial deformities, including protruding foreheads and tongues. Finally, one patient with atypical Timothy syndrome had a body development discrepancy wherein her upper body was normally developed (that of a 6-year-old) while her lower half resembled a 2- or 3-year-old.|$|E
25|$|Split hand/foot {{malformation}} (SHFM) {{is characterized}} by underdeveloped or absent central digital rays, clefts of hands and feet, and variable <b>syndactyly</b> of the remaining digits. SHFM is a heterogeneous condition caused by abnormalities at one of multiple loci, including SHFM1 (SHFM1 at 7q21-q22), SHFM2 (Xq26), SHFM3 (FBXW4/DACTYLIN at 10q24), SHFM4 (TP63 at 3q27), and SHFM5 (DLX1 and DLX 2 at 2q31). SHFM3 is unique {{in that it is}} caused by submicroscopic tandem chromosome duplications of FBXW4/DACTYLIN. SHFM3 is considered 'isolated' ectrodactyly and does not show a mutation of the tp63 gene.|$|E
25|$|The most {{striking}} sign of Timothy syndrome is the co-occurrence of both <b>syndactyly</b> (~0.03% of births) and long QT syndrome (1% per year) {{in a single}} patient. Other common symptoms of Timothy syndrome are cardiac arrhythmia (94%), heart malformations (59%), autism or an autism spectrum disorder (80% who survive long enough for evaluation). Facial dysmorphologies such as flattened noses also occur in approximately half of patients. Children with this disorder have small teeth which, due to poor enamel coating, are prone to dental cavities and often require removal. The average age of death due to complications of these symptoms is 2.5 years.|$|E

2500|$|Ectrodactyly {{involves}} the deficiency {{or absence of}} one or more central digits of the hand or foot and is also known as split hand–split foot malformation (SHFM). The hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as [...] "claw-like" [...] and may include only the thumb and one finger (usually either the little finger, ring finger, or a <b>syndactyly</b> of the two) with similar abnormalities of the feet.|$|E
2500|$|Ectrodactyly, split hand, cleft hand, {{derived from}} the Greek ektroma (abortion) and daktylos (finger) {{involves}} the deficiency or absence {{of one or more}} central digits of the hand or foot and is also known as split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM). The hands and feet of people with ectrodactyly are often described as [...] "claw-like" [...] and may include only the thumb and one finger (usually either the little finger, ring finger, or a <b>syndactyly</b> of the two) with similar abnormalities of the feet.|$|E
50|$|Fenestrated <b>syndactyly</b> {{means the}} skin is joined {{for most of the}} digit but in a {{proximal}} area there is gap in the <b>syndactyly</b> with normal skin. This type of <b>syndactyly</b> is found in amniotic band syndrome.|$|E

50|$|<b>Syndactyly</b> of {{the border}} digits (thumb/index finger or ring/small fingers) is treated at early age to prevent the larger digit from curving towards the smaller digit with growth. Typically, <b>syndactyly</b> of these digits is treated at six months of age. The {{treatment}} of <b>syndactyly</b> of the other digits is elective and is more commonly performed when the digits have grown, at 18-24 months of age.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{appreciation of}} <b>syndactyly</b> as a birth anomaly or burn-trauma {{can be traced}} back to the Andalusian Muslim surgeon Al-Zahrawi (d. 1013 CE), known in the West as Abulcasis. Ambroise Paré also described <b>syndactyly</b> in the sixteenth century.|$|E
50|$|Interdigital webbing {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with <b>syndactyly,</b> which is a fusing of digits and occurs rarely in humans. <b>Syndactyly</b> specifically affecting feet occurs in birds (such as ducks), amphibians (such as frogs), and mammals (such as the kangaroo).|$|E
