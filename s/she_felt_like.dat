5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark Sword of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the Gate of Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark Sword, which opens up the Gate of Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the Gate of Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon Sword, defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark Sword then breaks apart, the Gate of Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple just as it collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon Sword revives her. Irene tells Ryu that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she had been dreaming for a long time. Ryu tells her that the incident is over, and the game ends as the two watch the sun set.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 Googoosh sang in public, {{away from}} her homeland, {{for the first time}} after 21 years of silence. The Googoosh Comeback Tour was a series of concerts {{starting}} in July 2000. Having previously left Iran, where women are forbidden to perform, amidst spectacular media attention, she began with a sold out concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto on 29 July 2000 and eventually brought the tour to a conclusion in Dubai on 21 and 24 March 2001 {{on the occasion of the}} Iranian New Year, Nowruz. Her concert in Dubai was considered a homecoming for her and thousands of Iranians crossed the Persian Gulf to hear her. The two Dubai concerts held special importance: it was the tour finale, and Googoosh was rumored to be planning to return to Iran. Therefore, many people believed it might be their last chance to see her. She later claimed that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> singing at home. As seen below, the concerts were aimed at cities with large concentrations of Iranian immigrants.|$|E
500|$|Ferreira {{commented that}} she had co-written the track during summer 2013; she sings [...] "10 years old without a voice / I feel like nothing's really changed / Now I'm just a little older" [...] during the second verse, which she {{revealed}} {{was inspired by a}} two-year period in which she did not speak because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she had had nothing to offer.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{had gone}} upstairs. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> oddly <b>like</b> crying. But {{she made herself}} laugh instead. Rusty and Joseph had been TOO awful! And Dorothy WAS a dear.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> exactly <b>like</b> a tired child, {{now that}} she had been made so comfortable, and she liked Maurice so much, oh! so much! no brother could have been dearer.|$|R
60|$|Then Mrs. Lansing came in, and on {{the whole}} Sylvia was glad of the interruption. Herbert's remarks were now and then unpleasantly suggestive. He had called her his ally, but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> his accomplice, which was much less flattering.|$|R
500|$|In My Life So Far, Fonda {{stated that}} she {{considers}} patriarchy to {{be harmful to}} men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were [...] "anti-male". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she [...] "still loves men", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.|$|E
500|$|Aki Ross's voice actor, Ming-Na Wen, was {{selected}} for a perceived fit between her personality and Aki's. Ming-Na, who found the role via her publicist, said <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she had given birth with her voice to the character. She gradually accustomed herself {{to the difficulty of}} working without the presence and spontaneity of real actors, and commented that the voice-acting work did not take much time, as she would just go into the studio [...] "once or twice a month for about four months" [...] with no need for make-up and costuming sessions. The workload was so light it did not interfere with her acting commitments in the television series ER.|$|E
500|$|She would {{describe}} her time at Princeton as a life-changing experience. Initially, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a visitor landing in an alien country" [...] as her exposure had {{been limited to}} the Bronx and Puerto Rico. Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20). She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year; her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics. She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence. She became a moderate student activist and co-chair of the Acción Puertorriqueña organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students. She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.|$|E
6000|$|Dorothea's {{face had}} become animated, {{and as it}} beamed on Rosamond very close to her, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{something}} <b>like</b> bashful timidity before a superior, {{in the presence of}} this self-forgetful ardor. She said, with blushing embarrassment, [...] "Thank you: you are very kind." ...|$|R
60|$|Afterward {{the girl}} told how <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> almost <b>like</b> weeping {{when she entered}} alone the dark, chilly opera house.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was better}} {{it should be}} so," [...] he said, as quietly as he could, [...] "if <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> couldn't <b>like</b> me for a husband. Better run away before than repent after. I hope you won't look harshly on her if she comes back, as she may do if she {{finds it hard to}} get on away from home." ...|$|R
500|$|After a {{short time}} living with Ehnni's family, the couple {{relocated}} to Algiers. Eberhardt became disappointed with Ehnni, whose only ambition after leaving the army appeared to be finding an unskilled job {{that would allow him}} to live relatively comfortably. She increased her own efforts as a writer, and several of her short stories were printed in the local press. She accepted a job offer from Al-Akhbar (...) newspaper publisher Victor Barrucand in March 1902. Ebrhardt became a regular contributor to the newspaper; Trimardeur began appearing as a serial in August 1903. Barrucand and Eberhardt formed a friendship, though Barrucand was frequently frustrated with his new employee's work ethic. Eberhardt's articles arrived irregularly, as she would only write when <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> doing so. Her job paid poorly, but had many benefits. Through Barrucand's contacts, Eberhardt was able to access the famous zawiya of Lalla Zaynab. Eberhardt spoke highly of her time with Zaynab, though never disclosed what the two discussed; their meeting, however, caused concern among the French authorities.|$|E
500|$|Jenny's {{character}} was unpopular with both fans and critics {{throughout the entire}} series because of her frequent narcissistic tendencies, her prima donna ways, her egotistical attitude, irresponsibility, frequent self-pity and selfish persona. She has also been labeled a [...] "love to hate" [...] character. The majority of critics have been intrigued by her [...] "polarising personality" [...] and branded {{it as one of}} the main reasons to watch the series. New York magazine gave a large amount of praise to Jenny and on one occasion stated: [...] "Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show." [...] Kirshner received critical praise for her portrayal of the character. Kirshner has stated she loved playing Jenny because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a brand new character during each season. She has also stated that it is difficult for people to like the character as she can be [...] "very despicable" [...] and even the LGBT community does not like her because of her [...] "duplicity and confusion".|$|E
500|$|Six weeks later, in May 2010, {{she asked}} Swivel {{to work on}} the entire project. Concerning his working {{relationship}} with Beyoncé, he commented, [...] "There was no 'We're doing this today.' It was a very kind of open project, where whatever <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> recording at that time was what we'd work on. It was based on how she felt, her mood, and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us." [...] With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments. Mostly inspired by the Fela! sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from Fela! The project was moved to KMA Studios for {{a week and a half}} because Roc the Mic was not large enough. There they began recording [...] "I Care", [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] "Rather Die Young", and completed [...] "Party". They recorded the songs [...] "Schoolin' Life", [...] "1+1" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] at Jungle City Studios in New York.|$|E

60|$|When {{the kind}} quiet melancholy of that speech fell on Dorothea's ears, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{something}} <b>like</b> the thankfulness that might well up in {{us if we}} had narrowly escaped hurting a lamed creature. She put her hand into her husband's, and they went along the broad corridor together.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} hand in his, and bent his lips to it, and with {{the warmth of his}} kiss upon it, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> a {{moisture}} <b>like</b> a tear.|$|R
500|$|Even {{though the}} show was set in Miami, filming took place at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Stock {{exterior}} shots of Miami {{were used for the}} opening credits and transitions between scenes. The series was filmed with a multiple-camera setup, with each episode last roughly 20 to 22 minutes excluding commercials. Eve said she was initially intimidated by the amount of work required to prepare for and film a television series. During an interview with Billboard, she explained that while filming the first season <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she [...] "just wanted to leave because there was so much to learn, it's just a different world". Since she found comedy to be challenging due to the [...] "certain beats you have to learn", Eve hired two acting coaches to help improve her timing. One of her coaches was Chip Fields, who visited the show's set to offer Eve acting advice. During the development of the second season, Eve viewed the set as her home, and felt the process was easier, having grown closer to the cast and crew. In a 2016 interview with Grazia, she revealed her regret at not fully committing herself to her character and the series. She explained: [...] "I was the youngest person on set and was clubbing in between being on set and learning my lines. I look back and wish I was more dedicated. But I learned from it." ...|$|E
500|$|The costumes {{go through}} a natural {{evolution}} in the series. There is a shift {{at the end of}} the first season to a darker look, and all the characters have [...] "definitely grown up" [...] during the second season. In the third season [...] there is another shift, [...] "from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to [...] more precise militaristic outfit". This change is also reflected in the series' color palette, going from [...] "a much lighter tone, much more patterns" [...] in the first season to having [...] "stripped away a bit of color" [...] by the third. Despite this increasing darkness in the costumes, Foley intended to define each character as they are introduced and to have them always be recognizable and identifiable. With the start of the fourth season, Foley said that [...] "each season definitely has its own feel and this season will be no different. I think that you're going to see some subtle differences in the costumes of the characters"; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> Fitz and Simmons, in particular, had become [...] "more adult looking", while all the cast had [...] "a pretty specific ... civilian look" [...] that would become more prominent as S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized and becomes more public. Foley left the series after the thirteenth episode of the fourth season, to work on a television adaptation of Altered Carbon, and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to [...] "blend in" [...] with Foley's established look.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Byrd had no history of drug {{addiction}} or abuse and no criminal record, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> {{she had no choice}} but to agree to drug court supervision or go to prison. Then came the catch-22; she was told she had to admit to drug use and addiction or she couldn't get into the program.|$|E
5000|$|When Megan {{comes back}} for the season 4 premiere, she is much more like her old self before her DOJ assignment. She alludes to having some time off from {{her job at the}} FBI while talking to Larry Fleinhardt. When Larry {{questions}} her about the DOJ assignment, she says that she's not ready to talk about it yet. Megan then says <b>she's</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>she's</b> been sleepwalking ever since she got back from her DOJ assignment. [...] In [...] "Hollywood Homicide" [...] Colby Granger returns, and Megan welcomes him back more enthusiastically than the other team members. She tries to talk with David Sinclair about his feelings that Colby will always be a traitor.|$|R

25|$|Von Mahlsdorf {{was born}} Lothar Berfelde, to parents Max Berfelde and Gretchen Gaupp in Berlin-Mahlsdorf, Germany. At {{a very young}} age <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> a girl, and {{expressed}} more interest in the clothing and articles of little girls. She helped a second-hand goods dealer clear out the apartments of deported Jews and sometimes kept items.|$|R
2500|$|Due to low ratings, it {{was rumored}} that the show would not return for a fifth season. In June 2006, Fox {{confirmed}} that [...] "the current order for The O.C. is 16 episodes", but added {{that there was a}} chance to add more installments. In September 2006, Rachel Bilson said that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> [...] "the show is over", and co-star Kelly Rowan stated that many of the cast realised the show was close to being cancelled. Rowan said that [...] "when [...] was picked up for just 16 episodes this year the cast had a feeling the end was near." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Lopez, she {{initially}} didn't want [...] "Jenny {{from the}} Block" [...] or [...] "All I Have" [...] {{to be released}} as singles from the album. She felt that the tracks were too similar to her previous singles such as [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] and [...] "I'm Real"; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she was [...] "visiting old territory". [...] "Those tracks were like a different era for me, and I didn't want people to perceive it like I'm just trying {{to capitalize on the}} same thing. But the record company was like, 'Who cares what they think, those are hits mama!'". Lopez, who stated she [...] "calls the shots", eventually agreed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of the 2008 Democratic Primary campaign, Morrison stated to Time magazine: [...] "People {{misunderstood}} that phrase. I was deploring the way in which President Clinton was being treated, vis-à-vis the sex scandal that was surrounding him. I said he was being treated like a black on the street, already guilty, already a perp. I have no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race." [...] In the Democratic primary contest for the 2008 presidential race, Morrison endorsed Senator Barack Obama over Senator Hillary Clinton, though expressing admiration and respect for the latter. When he won, Morrison said <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an American for the first time. She said, [...] "I felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tierney had {{reportedly}} started smoking after {{a screening}} of her first movie to lower her voice, because <b>she</b> <b>felt,</b> [...] "Isound <b>like</b> an angry Minnie Mouse." [...] She subsequently became a heavy smoker.|$|R
2500|$|Manson's lyrics {{deal with}} darker themes, {{often in a}} mocking manner. She credits that to her Scottish psyche that leads to preferring {{depressing}} themes, and the fact <b>she</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an outsider, even within Garbage – [...] "I’m the odd one out by default. I’m the only girl, I’m younger than they are, they’ve all {{known each other for}} 40 years, or something crazy like that. So I always <b>felt,</b> <b>like,</b> off the centre of things." ...|$|R
60|$|MURRAY. No, {{of course}} not. You don't understand. Why--just now--she said {{that part of}} it had all been so silly <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> she'd acted <b>like</b> a fool and didn't ever want to be {{reminded}} of it.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{publication}} of the first volume, Rossiter was asked to run the NSF's program on the History and Philosophy of Science while its director took a year of leave during 1982–1983. In 1983–1984 she was a visiting professor at Harvard, where she continued work on her second volume. Still unable to find a tenure-track position, she applied for the NSF's Visiting Professorships for Women program, and received a one-year appointment to Cornell, which she stretched to two years (1986–1988). Cornell agreed to keep her on for another three years, but her funding was split between three departments including women's studies, agriculture, and history. In many ways, at this stage of her career <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> some of the women she wrote about, saying [...] "I guess I am like a 78 [...] record in a 33 world".|$|E
2500|$|The {{crew of the}} A300 and the GIGN forces {{received}} high national honours. Charles Pasqua, {{then the}} Minister of the Interior, said that throughout the ordeal the crew [...] "rose to the occasion." [...] Bernard Delhemme returned to flying and worked for Air France for nine years before retiring. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard said that she [...] "kept seeing the faces" [...] of the three passengers who had been executed; when she received her medal she realised that she had helped save 173 people; this allowed her to mourn and get over the incident. Burgniard said {{that she does not}} wear the medal, but that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> she deserved it. Burgniard, who also received a message of thanks from the airline, never again worked for Air France. Flight attendant Christophe Morin stopped working for Air France and began to work for a charitable organisation.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Kris Green from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Hassan would join Hollyoaks in August, {{as part of}} an ongoing rejuvenation of the serial. Series producer Paul Marquess believed that Lynsey and the other new characters he was introducing would bring [...] "more fun, drama and sexiness to the show". Hassan had not expected to be asked to join Hollyoaks and said it was an exciting, but scary prospect. The actress relocated to Liverpool for filming. Her character's introduction to Hollyoaks was low-key, which made Hassan believe that she would just be kept in the background. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> Lynsey was [...] "kind of plodding along" [...] and asked the producer if he was happy with her work. He then revealed that he had been thinking along the same lines and told her that she would be a major part in an upcoming storyline featuring Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle).|$|E
2500|$|She {{attended}} Hunter College High School, {{a secondary}} school for intellectually gifted students, and graduated in 1951. While attending Hunter, Lorde published her first poem in Seventeen magazine after her school’s literary journal rejected it for being inappropriate. Also in high school, Audre participated in poetry workshops {{sponsored by the}} Harlem Writers Guild, but noted that <b>she</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> somewhat of an outcast from the Guild. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> was not accepted because she “was both crazy and queer but [...] I would grow out of it all.” ...|$|R
