40|$|This {{research}} evaluates what is {{the most}} suitable energy efficient street lighting system for Sri Lanka as a part of energy conservation which can be taken as a highly relevant topic nowadays. This research is based on the detailed review of street lamps operated in the country. The said review was mainly carried out through a comprehensive street lamp census conducted in all over the country in between late February 2010 and mid May 2010. Several lamp technologies are presently used for street lighting; however, Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are becoming increasingly competitive with established technologies due to their rapidly increasing efficiencies and decreasing cost. The research assessed the LED fixtures which have a capability of significant energy savings potential achieving from 50 % to 70 % energy savings compared to the existing street lamps that are the best option for replacement of existing lamps. Stand-alone solar powered LED system and the street lighting control methods were also discussed and evaluated to verify the optimum outcome. Mainly, lighting design and comparison have been taken into account along Bambalapitiya – Kollupitiya Galle road section with <b>Sodium</b> <b>Vapour</b> <b>Lamps</b> and LED by actual field measurements and Lighting Reality, simulation software to evaluate better street lighting options. This study found that the LEDs with photocell or timer controlling methods delivered both significant energy savings and equivalent or improved lighting performance relative to the existing lamps. The potential for energy savings from LED street lights is very large. It was estimated by economic evaluation that 155 GWh of energy was used by existing street lighting in Sri Lanka in year 2010. This study reveals that the current energy consumption would be reduced by over 1 / 3 using LED replacement to the existing lamps. As LED technology advances and efficacies improve as demonstrated by "Haitz's Law", these savings will likely more improve as well. The overall savings potential which will be made by conversion of existing lamps by LED, is likely to further increase in the future as the energy and lighting performance. Even though solar power systems need high capital expenditure, it {{will be one of the}} most appropriate energy solutions for the country like Sri Lanka. However, LED technology is unfamiliar to our country and not readily available for mass deployment; limitations continue to exist in the lighting performance of some. Additionally, economic viability, though subject to location details, will remain a key factor that must be weighed in concert with lighting performance. Incentive program development by the government may further encourage LED street lamp and solar powered system development adoptions. This research recommends that any such incentive programs include performance standards that consider warranty, efficacy, light distribution, and other important criteria...|$|E
40|$|Creep {{resistance}} {{is an important}} design criterion at high temperatures especially when continuous attempts are made to increase the efficiencies by increasing the operating temperatures. Alumina is an important high temperature material {{and in addition to}} that it is used in wide variety of applications such as substrates for electronic packaging, spark plugs, envelopes for <b>sodium</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>lamps,</b> cutting tools (when reinforced with silicon carbide) and in artificial joint prostheses. Studies on creep in alumina. have started as early as 1961. There are differing mechanisms proposed to explain the creep behaviour of alumina in the literature, but until now there is no any unanimous decision as to what the rate controlling mechanism is. Magnesia doped at ppm levels can produce significant changes in the microstructure of alumina, the most important consequence of that being the grain growth inhibition, which renders alumina superplastic. However, in a stoichiometric oxide like alumina, small impurities can create extrinsic defects which would change the diffusivities and creep rates. Therefore the background impurities in alumina should be kept to a minimum, if small dopant effects have to be studied. The present study was undertaken making use of high purity alumina powder and comparing the grain growth and creep properties of pure and magnesia doped alumina, especially since no such investigation was carried out in the recent past with high purity alumina. Pure alumina was processed by cold compaction followed by cold isostatic pressing (CIP) and pressureless sintering in air at 1773 K for 1 hour. Magnesia doped alumina was prepared by calcining a mixture of alumina and magnesium nitrate at 973 K for 2 hours followed by cold compaction, CIPing and pressureless sintering in air at 1773 K. Both pure and magnesia doped alumina were further annealed at 1873 K for various times to get grain sizes in the ranges of 1 - 5 μm. Grain growth kinetics of pure and magnesia doped alumina were studied at 1823 and 1873 K. The parameter Kg which quantifies the mobility of the grain boundary was got. It was found that Kg had decreased in the magnesia doped alumina (in comparison with pure alumina) by a factor of about 3 to 4 which was marginal and insignificant. The grain sizes followed a log normal distribution in both the cases, indicative of normal grain growth. Creep studies were conducted on pure and magnesia doped alumina in three modes, namely, constant stress, temperature jump and stress jump test. The temperature range used was 1673 to 1773 K and the stress range used was 10 to 100 MPa. The creep parameters were found to be n~ 1. 6, p~ 3. 7 and Q- 545 kJ mol" 1 for pure alumina and n~l. 3, p~ 3. 0 and Q~ 460 kJ mol- 1 for magnesia doped alumina. The creep rates in the case of magnesia doped alumina were found to have increased by a factor of 2 to 3, in comparison with pure alumina. The increase in creep rates were found to be insignificant. The creep data were analyzed and the possibility of the dislocation and interface reaction controlled creep mechanisms were ruled out since they were inconsistent with the data. It was found, from creep parameters and the comparison of theoretical Coble and Nabarro-Herring creep rates with the experimental rates, that Coble creep might be rate controlling. The activation energy values suggested that aluminium ion diffusing along grain boundary might be the rate controlling species. However, when the theoretical creep rates considering various species were compared, the rate controlling species turned out to be oxygen ion diffusing along the grain boundary...|$|E
