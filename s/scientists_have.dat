5|$|<b>Scientists</b> <b>have</b> {{proposed}} that carbonate globules found in meteorite ALH84001, which {{is thought to}} have originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago. This proposal has been met with skepticism, and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Since 1750, the Columbia has {{experienced}} six multi-year droughts. The longest, lasting 12years in the mid‑19th century, reduced the river's flow to 20percent below average. <b>Scientists</b> <b>have</b> {{expressed concern that}} a similar drought would have grave consequences in a region so dependent on the Columbia. In 1992–1993, a lesser drought affected farmers, hydroelectric power producers, shippers, and wildlife managers.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> {{hypothesized}} {{that the development of}} monothecate anthers and larger flowers (compared to those of the remaining genera in Durioneae) in the clade consisting of Durio, Boschia, and Cullenia was in conjunction with a transition from beetle pollination to vertebrate pollination.|$|E

5|$|When {{two species}} {{are similar in}} a {{particular}} character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors were also similar, and convergent if they were not.

5|$|Author Michael Bradley {{and friend}} Deanna Theilmann-Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they found two creatures they {{hypothesized}} could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded {{that at least}} one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, though he did not investigate the creatures further. <b>Scientists</b> <b>have</b> also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like creature is difficult to establish because some of the trenches in Muskrat Lake extend to over 60 metres.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E

5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|Climate <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> {{hypothesized}} that the jet stream will gradually weaken {{as a result of}} global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E
