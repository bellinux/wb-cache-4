40|$|The Food Security Act of 1985 permits {{payment of}} farm program {{benefits}} {{in part with}} PIK certificates. PIK certificates can do things that cash alone cannot do. This special capacity gives PIK certificates special value. A market determined premium has existed for them from the beginning. Briefly during the harvest of 1986, premiums were as high as 30 percent. To date, premiums have rarely been much less than 5 percent. In this paper we will attempt {{to better understand the}} reasons for the PIK certificate premiums and explore an alternate design of the system that would, for the most part, eliminate them. A second objective {{of this paper is to}} understand how the special powers of PIK certificates are capable of changing the market environment itself. The fact that PIK certificates can acquire grain owned by the CCC, in the Farmer Owned Reserve, in the Special Producer Storage Loan Program, or under 9 -month loan at approximately current market prices is an important change in the rules. Previously, CCC inventory had been available to the market only at prices well above the loan rate, with minor exceptions pertaining to the condition of the grain. Farmer Owned Reserve inventory was available at prices at or above a trigger-release price. The traditional 9 -month loan program and the SPSLP tend to support prices at levels above the loan rate plus interest carrying charges. The availability of these <b>supplies</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> via a new set of rules creates a radical new market environment, something closer to a free market (Kennedy) (Westcott and Hanthorn). Additional topics discussed include the role of PIK certificates toward alleviating storage shortages, toward creating a defacto marketing loan, and toward possible USDA control of regional markets.

The basic objective {{of this study was}} to analyze profitability of red pepper production, determinants of household’s marketable surplus and <b>the</b> degree of <b>market</b> integration in major regional intermediate markets using primary data collected from households through semi structured questionnaire. The producers’ survey result revealed that all farmers <b>supply</b> <b>the</b> product <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and 85. 3 % of red pepper produced by the sampled farmers in the production year was <b>supplied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Farmers in <b>the</b> Woreda do not have any standard measure <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> quality of pepper. They usually identify quality of red pepper by its color, pest damage, size, shape, odor and foreign matter. In the Woreda, the four largest traders handled 30. 2 % of the total volume of purchased pepper. Hence the structure of <b>the</b> pepper <b>market</b> in <b>the</b> study area was some what competitive. The profitability analysis also indicates that red pepper production was profitable. The average amount of red pepper <b>supplied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> by producers was 5. 24 quintal with minimum amount of 0. 5 quintals and maximum of 19 quintals. The variables that influenced the marketable supply positively were agricultural experience, access to credit, yield, land size, current year and lagged prices. Among the significant variables yield and access to credit were highly significant at less than 1 % significant level. <b>The</b> result of <b>market</b> integration analysis also shows that pepper <b>markets</b> in <b>the</b> western part of the region were integrated. The major problems identified are low access to improved inputs, collateral problem to get credit, poor storage facilities and low price of produce. To solve these problems increased access to improved inputs, strengthening credit institutions, strengthening of cooperatives, education and training, price information and establishment of storage and processing facilities are recommended.
