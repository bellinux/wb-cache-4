40|$|Abstract. Most {{of current}} speech {{recognition}} systems {{are based on}} Hidden Markov Models assuming that speech features are sequence of stationary stochastic processes. However, there are certain speech attributes, such as background noise type or speaker voice color, {{that do not have}} stochastic character. This fact is often ignored, by designers of robust <b>speaker</b> <b>independent</b> <b>recognition</b> system. In this work, we investigate how the performance of a noisy speech recognition can be improved provided that we have prior knowledge about type and level of noise. Next, recognizer that is using separate models, each trained on a particular type and level of noise, is proposed for more appropriate modeling of speech. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a speechreading system that uses both, shape {{information from the}} lip contours and intensity information from the mouth area.

Utterance classification is performed by combining the segment classification decisions using a fixed combination scheme. The performance of two learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines and K Nearest Neighbors, is compared.

For reasons described ins Section 3, we believe that neural network technology will eventually be preferable for large scale (thousands of ports), small vocabulary (on the order of 100 phrases), speaker independent, telephone applications. It is, however, crucial to evaluate this less mature technology against the HMMs to see how they compare from both the perspectives of classification accuracy and cost of implementation.
