In general, the results show that the forecasts for output growths in <b>SACMA</b> countries are quite similar to the actual values. Generally, the money supply changes have had a positive effect on output growths in all these <b>SACMA</b> countries. This may suggest that symmetric monetary shocks dominate in <b>SACMA</b> economies, which is a good indicator for an optimal currency area that would foster development in the region.

40|$|AbstractExperimental {{studies on}} the {{compressive}} behavior of composite laminates after low velocity impact was carried out with two test methods. One is <b>SACMA</b> Standard, {{and the other is}} a small dimensional specimen test method. Impact damage distributions, compressive failure process after impact, quasi-static indentation and compression of laminates with a hole were brought into comparison between these two test methods. The results showed that there is a great difference between these two test methods. Compressive behavior of laminates after impact varies with different test methods. Residual compressive strength of laminates after low velocity impact measured with <b>SACMA</b> Standard can reflect stiffness properties of composite resins more wholely than that measured with the other method can do. Small dimensional specimen test method should be improved on as an experimental standard of compressive strength after impact...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringCompression {{failure of}} {{laminated}} composites {{is a very}} complex mechanism involving one or more failure modes especially under high loading rates. Tabbed specimens per ASTM D 695 / <b>SACMA</b> SRM 1 R- 94 are used to measure compressive responses of composites under quasi-static to low strain rates. However, untabbed cubic specimens are employed in Split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments for studying the behavior under high loading rates. The compression responses and failure modes observed in SHPB experiments may not correlate well with those of tabbed specimens owing to the failure initiation mechanisms which are dominated by contact stress distributions. This study presents the results from a numerical investigation of the tabbed specimens in conjunction with D 695 / <b>SACMA</b> SRM 1 R- 94 test fixture for generating material response data at medium strain rates. The issues related to dynamic testing using a traditional test fixture and the limitations of its applicability owing to wave propagation effects are characterized using finite element models. Based on this study, recommendations for force measurement, achievable strain rates and interpretation of test data are made...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which Saudi listed companies report online information about their corporate governance practice in light of the guidance issued by the Saudi Arabian Capital Market Authority (<b>SACMA),</b> thereafter. Methodology – We adopted a content analysis approach, accordingly a corporate governance disclosure index is developed to analyse the content of every company's website. Findings – We found that the majority of Saudi listed companies utilise the Internet to communicate some information about corporate governance to their stakeholders. We also found that the level of online reporting of corporate governance varies between sectors. In particular, the paper revealed that the banking sector has the highest level of corporate governance disclosure compared with other sectors. On the other side, companies in the industry and service sectors provide very little information about corporate governance on their websites. The results suggest that the nature of control over the sector, the involvement of government in the ownership and management of businesses and some social assumptions could have an impact on companies' decision to disclose online information about their corporate governance in developing countries. Practical implications - The importance of investigating online reporting of corporate governance in Saudi Arabia emerges from the fact that <b>SACMA</b> published a guidance in 2006 that recommends the disclosure of corporate governance information by Saudi listed companies. Therefore, it would be worthwhile informing <b>SACMA</b> about the extent of compliance with the guidance of corporate governance. This is essential taking into consideration two facts; first, the recent remarkable grown of the Saudi stock market which was accompanied by significant increase in the demand for additional information by stakeholders, second, the recent increase of the utalisation of the Internet by companies for disclosure purposes worldwide. Further, the results of this research study could add to our limited knowledge about the practice of corporate governance in developing countries. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the limited literature on disclosure practices in developing countries in general and in Saudi Arabia in particular. Our review of the literature revealed that there is no study to date on online disclosure of corporate governance in Saudi Arabia and very limited research has been carried out in developing countries in general. This is important taking into consideration environmental factors of developing countries, which could bring different sight in the issue of the disclosure of corporate governance...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} increase in the use of composite materials has occurred during the past 20 years. Associated with this increased use is the potential for employees to be exposed to offgassing components from composite systems. Various components in composite systems, particularly residual solvents, offgas under various conditions. The potential for offgassing to occur increases as a composite material is heated either during cure or during lay-up operations. Various techniques can be employed to evaluate the offgassing characteristics of a composite system. A joint effort between AIA and <b>SACMA</b> resulted in the drafting of a proposed test method for evaluating the offgassing potential of composite materials. The purpose of testing composite materials for offgassing is to provide the industrial hygienist with information which can be used to assess the safety of the workplace. This paper outlines the proposed test method and presents round robin testing data associated with the test method. Also in this presentation is a discussion of classes of compounds which require specialized sampling techniques...|$|E

Large acoustic arrays {{have tremendous}} value in military and civil applications for producing well-formed beams. In order {{to realize the}} potential gains of these applications enabled by large acoustic arrays, {{it is essential to}} calculate and take into account the acoustic coupling of the sonar arrays. Although many studies have been conducted on this phenomenon, the practical and theoretical studies in public literature remain inadequate especially on mutual radiation impedance of the acoustic sonar arrays. In order to address this need, self and mutual radiation impedances of square piston elements in two-dimensional planar acoustic arrays are investigated in this thesis. Impedance matrices are formed from the self and mutual radiation impedances of these elements. Operation of arrays and possible mutual radiation impedances are analyzed through the active simulations of planar arrays. Importantly, the mutual impedance data is tested on a generic equivalent circuit model of a piston transducer. Resonance of these transducers and Rayleigh-Bloch waves are also observed as the outcome of these tests. by Mustafa Oğuzhan <b>Saçma.</b> M. S...|$|E
40|$|A Department of Economics {{working paper}} in {{economic}} co-operation and trade relations in Southern Africa. The {{aim of this}} paper is to discuss economic and trade relations in Southern Africa, both the current status and options for the future. The region considered covers eleven countries, namely, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Lesotho, Tanzania, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, Namibia, and Swaziland. The analysis will cover both trade in commodities and labor. Trade in labor, as a factor of production, will be analyzed between South Africa and the rest of the countries. The implications on both commodity and factor trade are analyzed in a post-apartheid South Africa. Special attention is also given to relations pertaining to the transport, energy sector, financial sector and capita! markets development in the region. We should put it clear at this stage that one broad objective is to analyze how and why the relations among countries will change when the situation in the powerful South African economy normalizes. The paper proposes that SADCC would have to be to substituted by a larger region organization that includes South Africa and Namibia. This new organisation we refer to as the Southern Africa Common Market Area (<b>SACMA).</b> The increasing organization of the world into trading blocs is one compelling raison detre for a new regional organization. The paper also discusses the main impediments to regional trade and proposes policies for trade improvements. The rest {{of this paper is}} organized as follows. Section II compares and contrasts the different economies in Southern Africa and Section III looks into the trade issues. In Section IV we shall discuss the trade flows among the countries, noting the most active trade linkages. Trade in factors of production in the form of migrant laborers in South Africa is considered in Section V. The current and future state of the transport and communication sector receives attention in Section VI, while regional energy policies are discussed in Section VII. Policy issues for improving regional trade in Southern Africa are analyzed in Section VIII, and Section IX is the conclusion...|$|E
