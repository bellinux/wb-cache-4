40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the effect of variations in the horizontal and vertical air-entry angles on the performance characteristics of a single-cylinder 2 -stroke-cycle compression-ignition test engine. Performance data were obtained over a wide range of engine speed, <b>scavenging</b> <b>pressure,</b> fuel quantity, and injection advance angle with the optimum guide vanes. Friction and blower-power curves are included for calculating the indicated and net performances. The optimum horizontal air-entry angle was found to be 60 degrees from the radial and the optimum vertical angle to be zero, under which conditions a maximum power output of 77 gross brake horsepower for a specific fuel consumption of 0. 52 pound per brake horsepower-hour was obtained at 1, 800 r. p. m. and 16 - 1 / 2 inches of Hg <b>scavenging</b> <b>pressure.</b> The corresponding specific output was 0. 65 gross brake horsepower per cubic inch of piston displacement.

From this point of view the maximum weight of fuel that can be burnt efficiently is determined, therefore, the maximum power as well.

The large turbocharged diesel engine are designed with gas pulsation turbocharger.

40|$|Conventional 2 -stroke {{engines are}} {{commonly}} used for two-wheeled and marine vehicles that have small engine displacement. However problems such as unstable combustion, high fuel consumption rate, high hydrocarbon (HC) emission need to be resolved. Beside that, the two stroke engines also have its advantages over the four stroke engines such as higher torque and power, being more compact and lighter. In order to solve these problems without compromising these advantages, a new 2 -stroke engine was designed with numerical simulations to produce {{what is called a}} two stroke engine uniflow scavenging system. In this study, the performance of the uniflow scavenging engine was researched, and considerations concerning fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions were made. These findings were then compared with the earlier research to consider gas flow and diffusion of fuel inside the cylinder.

40|$|The {{composition}} of exhaust from a marine diesel auxiliary engine running on Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) was investigated on-board a large cargo vessel. Measurements of particle number and size distributions {{in the range}} 5 - 1000 nm and gaseous emissions of O 2, CO, CO 2, SO 2 and NOx were made. The measurements were performed in October and November 2015 on two large cargo ships at berth and during travel. Measurements were also carried out on auxiliary engines of two ships when they were at berth. Data on engine power, engine revolution, fuel oil consumption, intercooled air temperature, <b>scavenging</b> air <b>pressure,</b> cooling fresh water and exhaust gas temperature were measured using instrumentation of the ship. Results showed that emission factors (g/kWh) are {{higher than that of}} previous studies for SO 2. This {{may be due to the}} high sulphur content of fuel used.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the semi-physical {{simulation}} {{technology is}} introduced {{with the design}} and implementation of a semi-physical simulation test bench. A certain low-speed marine diesel engine of high pressure common rail (HPCR) electronic control system is taken as {{the subject of the}} test bench. In order to retain the functional and structural features of the HPCR electronic control system, the essential components are in consistent with the target engine, and some auxiliary parts are simplified and reformed. Specially, a real-time simulation model is built based on the principles of Mean Value Engine Model and cylinder moving method, which captures the requirements of ECU, such as the crank angle, the exhaust valve stroke signal, the <b>scavenging</b> <b>pressure</b> and so on. Therefore a closed-loop control system is accomplished including a real-time controller deployed in the simulation model, ECU and the executing agency of HPCR system. Additionally a monitoring management system is developed for the test bench with the functions of acquiring signals, monitoring parameters, storing data, alarming and etc. Finally, some tests are finished in the test bench and through analyzing the experimental results, the test bench can perform the characteristics and functions of the HPCR electronic control system.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, an {{existing}} multi-zone combustion {{model has been}} modified and applied to predict the performance characteristics and the NOx emissions of a largescale two-stroke diesel engine (i. e. 12. 5 MW rated power). Initially, {{an attempt was made}} to examine whether the multizone model can predict with sufficient accuracy the main performance parameters of the stationary diesel engine, using input data from the shop tests (i. e. engine speed, fuel consumption and <b>scavenging</b> <b>pressure</b> at different engine loads). Hence, it was verified that the model is capable of describing the main performance characteristics of the engine with satisfactory accuracy (i. e. reference state). Further on, an experimental investigation was conducted on the specific engine, consisting of a series of performance and NOx emissions measurements that were conducted at constant speed and at three different engine loads. Then, the proposed model was applied at the present engine condition to evaluate its ability to predict the combustion mechanism using the measured cylinder pressure trace as basis for comparison. Furthermore, the predicted engine out NOx emissions were compared to measured values to examine if the model can estimate at least qualitatively the effect of engine load on them. From this combined theoretical and experimental analysis is revealed that the developed model is capable of adequately predicting both engine performance and NOx emissions of large-scale two-stroke diesel engines.

40|$|Interspecific {{interactions}} {{are among the}} key factors influencing the structure of animal communities and have high relevance for conservation. However, managers, conservationists and decision-makers rarely consider the potential side-effects of single-species carnivore management {{for the conservation of}} other carnivores. We studied how management of protected brown bears (Ursus arctos) affected interspecific interactions with an endangered apex predator, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Slovenia. Due to large body size and superb olfactory abilities, bears {{are one of the most}} important dominant scavengers and regularly usurp kills from other large predators, a process known as kleptoparasitism. At the same time, bears throughout the world are usually actively managed through zone-specific culling regimes, supplemental feeding, and translocations. This can considerably alter bear densities and activity patterns and in turn influence interactions among carnivores. Overall, we observed that bear <b>scavenging</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted in substantial energetic losses for Eurasian lynx. The probability of lynx losing kills to bears ranged from 8 to 74 % and strongly depended on local bear densities and monthly bear movement rates. Kleptoparasitic interaction intensity differed almost 3 -fold between different bear management zones. Furthermore, the presence of a bear feeding site increased the odds of lynx losing kills by 5 -fold compared to areas > 1000 m from these sites. We suggest that existing bear-feeding regimes should be reconsidered in order to reduce unwanted side-effects of this controversial practice on endangered apex predators. We also call attention to the importance of considering impacts of interspecific interactions in wildlife management and conservation...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance {{is today}} an {{increasing}} {{part of the}} shipping industry. The demand for safer operations, lower emissions and low downtime is constantly increasing. As {{a result of this}} more complicated and complex system is developed and the focus on maintenance and efficient operations {{is becoming more and more}} important. As a result of this, models such as the TCI concept has been invented. The TCI concept is based on condition monitoring of the combustion process in the cylinder and the involved equipment. The objective is to detect slowly developing deviations in parameters related to efficiency, safety and environmental condition of the propulsion function. This is done through monthly measurements by the crew and sent to the TeCoMan database for processing. There the measurements are normalized for engine load and ambient conditions to be able to compare the results with reference values collected from the sea trial and equipment manufacturer. The measurements is then transformed to TCI’s which can be explored by the crew and administrators in the TeCoMan program. The TCI value reflect the severity of the performance and will decide what actions needs to be taken, and makes it possible for the crew and administrators to plan the maintenance The problem with the TCI model has been the "noisy" behaviour for the different parameters and the goal for this thesis has been to address this problem. Data from the TOCC project has been used throughout the project, one series of seven ship and one series of four ships. A in- depth study and a sensitivity analysis to study the influence of the correction factors has been done, where the mean effective pressure, cylinder <b>pressure</b> and the <b>scavenging</b> air <b>pressure</b> are the factors that were found to have the biggest influence. To identify the reason for the noisy behaviour each ship was studied to find the root cause. For the series with seven ships, erroneous measurements for both the parameters itself and the correction factors, are the main factor for the variations in the efficiency TCI’s. This errors results in large deviations for the corrected values and thus low TCI values. For the degradation it is the <b>scavenging</b> air filter <b>pressure</b> drop and fuel pump index which have the lowest TCI’s. For the scavenging air filter the low performance is due to the varying measurements done by the U-tube manometer. For the fuel pump index the corrected values are wrong due to a fuel flow of 0 m 3 /h. For the second series the large variations in both the measured parameters and the parameters used for correction, such as mean effective pressure and cylinder power, are the cause for the low TCI’s for both the efficiency and the degradation. With defined limits for the parameters based on expert opinions a large portion of the erroneous measurements would be eliminated. Also adjustment of reference and correction values for each ship due to individual differences could enhance the TCI performance. For the second series the routines for the different measurements needs to be improved. Good procedures and trained workers will help to keep the variations at a minimum. For unstable parameters lower weighted sum can be used to decrease the influence to aggregated systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Albumin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} plasma proteins and plays a key role in many physiologic processes, such as preserving colloid osmotic <b>pressure,</b> <b>scavenging</b> radicals, and binding and transporting bilirubin, hormones, and drugs. However, albumin concentrations are often low in preterm infants during the first days of life. We hypothesized that early parenteral lipid and high-dose amino acid (AA) administration to very low birth weight (VLBW) infants from birth onwards increases hepatic albumin synthesis rates. Inborn VLBW infants were randomized to receive from birth onwards either 2. 4 g amino acids/(kg(.) d) (control group), 2. 4 g amino acids/(kg(.) d) plus 2 g lipids/(kg(.) d) (AA + lipid group), or 3. 6 g amino acids/(kg(.) d) plus 2 g lipids/(kg(.) d) (high AA + lipid group). On postnatal day 2, infants received a primed continuous infusion of [U-(13) C 6,(15) N]leucine. Mass spectrometry was used to determine the fractional and absolute albumin synthesis rates (FSR and ASR, respectively). In total, 28 infants (median gestational age 27 weeks (IQR 25 - 28), median birth weight 810 g (IQR 679 - 998) were studied. The median FSR was 6. 5 %/d in the control group, 10. 6 %/d in the AA group, and 12. 3 %/d in the high AA + lipid group, while the median was 84 mg/(kg(.) d) in the control group, 138 mg/(kg(.) d) in the AA group, and 160 mg/(kg(.) d) in the high AA + lipid group.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a model of}} a ship {{propulsion}} system containing an engine, turbocharger, propeller and ship was constructed. The purpose of the model is to be used in controller design and testing. This is motivated by the fact that testing large marine diesel engines is limited due to large costs and difficulty providing a proper testbed facility. First compressor and turbine models were developed by fitting parameters to manufacturer turbocharger maps. A novel compressor model was made from using exponential functions. The performance of the compressor model surpassed that of a model commonly used in literature. However, to conclude this in the general case, more testing has to be performed. The development of an accurate turbocharger model was stimulated by possibilities of variable area turbine, wastegate and exhaust gas recirculation control. This would again lead to better transient air-to-fuel ratio control, turbocharger speed control and the reduction of pollutants. % extrapolationExtensions were made to an existing mean value engine model developed in an earlier project work by the same author, this included an intercooler and overload protection. The overload protection works through the use of fuel limiters based of torque and <b>scavenging</b> air <b>pressure.</b> In simulations these limiters showed to effectively maintain the air-to-fuel ratio for perfect combustion, however, at an increased engine response time. It was argued that the limiters could be superfluous if appropriate control of the air-to-fuel ratio was achieved. The engine and turbocharger were put to the test in simulations. Despite the lack of turbocharger experimental data in low speed regions, the simulations proved that the turbocharger model could cope with low engine load conditions at reduced turbocharger speed. In fact, results show that the engine and turbocharger models worked excellent in the entire speed region. Furthermore a propeller and ship model was developed. These models were tested in simulations together with a PI engine speed controller. Due to limited fuel actuation an integrator anti-windup scheme had {{to be included in the}} controller. The simulations showed that the PI controller was able to follow a slowly changing speed setpoint. However, due to the fact that the model is nonlinear and that no linearization, gain scheduling or excessive parameter tuning was performed, more advanced controller performance was not investigated. Moreover, further research on creating controllers for the purpose of suppressing propeller load torque fluctuations and subsequent engine overspeed is recommended. The total ship propulsion system showed to work in accordance to expected performance. All in all, this thesis provided as an enlightenment of the parameters and principles that are important in control of propulsion plants. Furthermore, it gives a testing environment for control design of various applications. </p...|$|R
