40|$|A spin- 1 / 2 {{subsystem}} conjoined along a {{cut with}} a subsystem of spinless fermions {{in the state of}} topological insulator is studied on a honeycomb lattice. The model describes a junction between a 2 D topological insulator and a 2 D spin lattice with direction-dependent exchange interactions in topologically trivial and nontrivial phase states. The model Hamiltonian of the complex system is solved exactly by reduction to free Majorana fermions in a static Z_ 2 gauge field. In contrast to junctions between topologically trivial phases, the junction is defined by chiral edge states and direct interaction between them for topologically nontrivial phases. As a result of the boundary interaction between chiral edge modes, the edge junction is defined by the Chern numbers of the subsystems: such the gapless edge modes with the same (different) chirality <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> (<b>off)</b> the edge current between topological subsystems. The sign of the Chern number of spin subsystem is changed in an external magnetic field, thus the electric current strongly depends both on a direction and a value of an applied weak magnetic field. We have provided a detailed analysis of the edge current and demonstrate how to <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> (<b>off)</b> the electric current in the magnetic field. Comment: 4 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to design an {{automation}} system that is used to <b>switch</b> <b>ON,</b> <b>OFF</b> and get to know status of the home appliances by using computer using Zigbee wireless technology. ZigBee is a new technology, whose goal is to eliminate wired connections between electrical appliances and computer. Instead of connecting with wires, every electrical appliance has small zigbee. The home appliances are connected to the ports of the microcontroller board and their status are passed to the home server. The combination of NetBeans and EmbeddedC is used for monitoring and controlling software. The home Appliances can be monitored and accessed remotely by user via SMS or EMAIL where GSM Modem comes into use. Multi-vendor appliances can be added to the system with no major changes and hence system is scalable. Password protection is one of the functionality of the system so that unauthorized user can be denied from accessing home appliances. Another important feature is the security system that will continuously monitor the status of home appliances and take adequate actions if required...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{automation}} system becomes {{the best solution}} to overcome human problem which is always forget to switch off the electrical appliances. As we know, {{there are a lot}} of types of the {{automation system}} which is too expensive and difficult to use. For that reason, an automation system at low cost is built where; user can also program the automated system by their own. The purpose of this project is to design an automation system that can be used to <b>switch</b> <b>ON,</b> <b>OFF</b> and get know STATUS of the electrical appliances by using personal computer. This project focusing developing an automation system with Zigbee wireless technology which is controlled by programmable interface controller (PIC 18 F 14 K 50). This overall project is divided into two parts. The first part is concern on the hardware development where all electronic components are connected on a single board. Personal computer is the input component while fluorescent lamp and fan are the output component where it’s all controlled by controller circuit. Zigbee is a new technology, which has at its centre the goal of eliminating wired connections between home appliances and personal computer. Instead of connecting with wires, every appliance has small transmitters or receivers. The second part is base on software programming to operate the hardware structure. There two types of programs are used for this project. C language is the program used for PIC 18 F 14 K 50. C language assembles using CCS C Compiler to get the hex file. The hex file loaded into PIC memory using PIC kit 2 burners. C # is another program that used for create GUI for personal computer. In order to achieve better automation system, the security system can be added to this project where more sensor and load can be connected to the PIC serial port. As the result, the PIC capable to control the whole operation of this automation system...|$|E

50|$|As the {{electrical}} stimulus pattern is repetitively {{applied to the}} DUT, internal transistors <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> and <b>off.</b> As pMOS and nMOS transistors <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> or <b>off,</b> they emit photons. These photons emissions are recorded by a sensitive photon detector. By {{counting the number of}} photons emitted for a specific transistor across a period of time, a photon histogram may be constructed. The photon histogram records an increase in photon emissions during times that the transistor <b>switches</b> <b>on</b> or <b>off.</b> By detecting the combined photon emissions of pairs p- and n-channel transistors contained in logic gates, it is possible to use the resulting histogram to determine the locations in time of the rising and falling edges of the signal at that node. The waveform produced is not representative of a true voltage waveform, but more accurately represents the derivative of the waveform, with photon spikes being seen only at rising or falling edges.|$|R
