40|$|Double Potentials in Cavotricuspid Isthmus Block. Introduction: A novel mapping/ablation {{catheter}} using a coaxially ablation electrode (E) that is moveable between distal and proximal ring electrodes {{along its}} shaft {{was used to}} create a linear lesion over the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) and bidirectional block in 32 patients (21 men; age 38 – 79 years) undergoing ablation for counterclockwise atrial flutter. Methods and Results: Two bipolar electrograms (E 1 and E 2) were recorded: between E and the distal ring electrode and between E and the proximal ring electrode. Interpole distance varied for both as the E traversed the <b>slide</b> <b>shaft.</b> Given the catheter's concept, these bipoles are orientated exactly along the line of lesion creation. Prior to ablation, unitary bipolar electrograms were recorded along the catheter <b>slide</b> <b>shaft</b> position. As the CTI lesion was created (E moved along the catheter <b>slide</b> <b>shaft</b> in 2 -mm steps with radiofrequency energy delivered to achieve 65 °C for 60 sec at each), double potentials (DP) were observed. Interpotential distance became maximal with completion of the linear lesion and bidirectional block. DPs were noted in all these procedures. With pacing from the low septal right atrium at bidirectional block creation, interpotential timing was 140. 9 ± 15 msecand from the low right atrial free wall was 145. 13 ± 18 msec. In sinus rhythm, DP interpotential timing was less(35. 13 ± 9 msec) as activation fronts arrived from both septal and anterior atrial aspects. Conclusion: Bipolar recordings from the coaxially moveable electrode catheter provide unique electrogram data. DPs recorded during and after linear lesion creation can define conduction block across that lesion without the need for additional mapping catheters or complex mapping technology...|$|R

50|$|The lance is a pole weapon or spear {{designed}} {{to be used by}} a mounted warrior or cavalry soldier (lancer). During the periods of classical and medieval warfare, it evolved into being the leading weapon in cavalry charges, and was unsuited for throwing or for repeated thrusting, unlike similar weapons of the spear/javelin/pike family typically used by infantry. Lances were often equipped with a vamplate - a small circular plate to prevent the hand <b>sliding</b> up the <b>shaft</b> upon impact. Though best known as a military and sporting weapon carried by European knights, the use of lances was widespread throughout Asia, the Middle East and North Africa wherever suitable mounts were available. As a secondary weapon, lancers of the medieval period also bore swords or maces for hand-to-hand combat, since the lance was often a one-use-per-engagement weapon; assuming the lance survived the initial impact intact, it was (depending on the lance) usually too long, heavy and slow to be effective against opponents in a melee.|$|R

40|$|LectureThe {{transmission}} of torque from a shaft to a hub can be efficiently accomplished {{through the use}} of friction. The advantages of this system over a keyed connection are: (1) the significant reduction of stress concentrations in the shafts and hubs, (2) an increase in the torque that can be transmitted, and (3) the ease of hub removal. The disadvantages of this system are: (1) it requires more care at installation, and (2) it can generate high shaft stresses if misused. The theory of {{transmission of}} torque {{through the use of}} friction is relatively simple. A hub having a bore slightly smaller than the shaft on which it will be installed is expanded radially either through heating or through hydraulic pressure. Sufficiently expanded, the hub can <b>slide</b> on the <b>shaft</b> and then is allowed to resume its original diameter; however, the shaft prevents this from happening. In the process, a high contact pressure is created at the interface. It is this pressure, the contact area, and the coefficient of friction that generates the tangential force which permits the torque transmission. The contact pressure at the interface also generates high stresses in the parts. These stresses must be carefully calculated in order to avoid immediate failure of the hubs, or fatigue failure of the shafts. The practice of hydraulic installation and removal is simple if a few rules are religiously followed. The most important ones are: (1) very good contact pattern at the interface, (2) cleanliness of the parts and oil, (3) accurate measurements of pressures and motion, and (4) observance of safety rules. This paper gives the formulae necessary for the calculation of the torque that can be transmitted through an interference fit, and for the calculation of the generated stresses. The second part gives the rules that have to be followed for a safe installation and removal of the hub, and illustrations showing various methods in use...|$|R
40|$|The term "sliding bearing" {{refers to}} types of bearing where two {{conformal}} surfaces (usually the stationary bearing and a moving <b>shaft)</b> <b>slide</b> relative {{to one another}} with load distributed directly across the interface. A suitable lubricant may be employed to reduce the friction between these two surfaces. In "fluid film" bearings, this lubricant builds up a layer of sufficient thickness such that the two surfaces are completely separated. Examples include journal and thrust bearings and shaft bushings. Unlike ball or roller bearings which have a limited lifespan, sliding bearings have, at least in theory, an indefinite operational lifespan. As long as an oil film of sufficient thickness is maintained and contamination is avoided, the bearing may continue {{to do its job}} indefinitely. However, more and more onerous demands are being placed on such bearings and their associated methods of lubrication in order to maximise performance in terms of efficiency and load carrying capacity, for example in hydroelectricity generators and turbines. Given the sensitivity of operating any form of mechanical equipment in the vicinity of watercourses, often the source of drinking water for major population centres, the hydropower industry has a duty of responsibility in ensuring that as much as possible is done to minimise the risk of contamination of the water or damage to flora and fauna. Two aims - increased output, decreased environmental impact - are currently the major driving forces behind Research and Development in the hydroelectric power generation industry. Looking at these from a tribological (friction and lubrication) point of view, three areas of particular interest can be identified. These are: 1) How can the load carrying capacity of thrust bearings be increased whilst at the same time improving performance within existing dimensional constraints? 2) What is the influence on bearings of transient events (rapid changes in speed or loading) and what impact do they have on the machinery components? 3) How does the use of Environmentally Adapted Lubricants (as opposed to mineral oils) influence friction and wear etc, specifically with reference to shaft bushings, and what is the impact of fluid ageing (oxidation) on their performance? Each of these three points has been studied {{in the course of the}} work carried out for this thesis. Godkänd; 2005; 20061214 (haneit...|$|R
40|$|Hydropower, the {{utilisation}} {{of water}} {{as a means of}} driving machinery, has been used for many centuries. Today, the great power of water is being harnessed to generate as much as 20 % of worldwide electricity. The requirement for reliable and efficient electricity generation needs to be matched by environmental awareness {{on the part of the}} industry. Work carried out during the course of my doctoral studies at Luleå University of Technology has been aimed at addressing these demands by investigating means of improving sliding bearing performance through the use of environmentally adapted lubricants and the employment of novel materials and surface texturing to reduce friction. The term "sliding bearing" refers to a type of bearing where two surfaces (usually the stationary bearing and a moving <b>shaft)</b> <b>slide</b> relative to one another with load distributed directly across the interface. In hydrodynamic bearings, a lubricant layer is built up in the contact region such that the two surfaces are completely separated. Examples of these are hydrodynamic journal and thrust bearings. These types of bearing are major components in many large machines, including hydroelectric turbines. Their safe operation relies on the maintaining of sufficient oil film thickness. As long as this condition is met, the bearing could continue to do its job indefinitely. This is particularly important during transient operating conditions (i. e. rapid changes in load or speed) when oil films can momentarily become extremely thin. Such conditions have been examined for a tilting-pad thrust bearing to assess impact on operation. More and more onerous demands are being placed on such bearings and their associated methods of lubrication, e. g. increased frequency of start/stop of hydroelectric turbines. This means that new solutions are required to maximise their operational performance. One such solution attracting current attention is the employment of surface texturing. The impact of surface texturing on the performance of a tilting-pad thrust bearing has been studied in a series of tests in comparison with a plain Babbitt surface. These show a reduction in friction with the textured bearing. Film thickness is seen to be greater suggesting improved load-carrying capacity. Another possible option for improving operational performance is the use of new lubricants. Environmentally Adapted Lubricants (EALs) are produced from simple hydrocarbons meaning that the final product tends to consist of only a few different types of molecule. This also means that an EAL can be carefully tailored to a specific function. In several experimental investigations using such fluids in both thrust and journal bearings, it has been shown that minimum film thicknesses can be maintained using an EAL with lower viscosity grade than that of the mineral oil currently used. This has the added impact of reducing bearing power (friction) losses and lowering temperatures, all beneficial to bearing operation. Thicker film has been found for an EAL of identical viscosity grade to the mineral oil. Unlike mineral oils, which have been employed as lubricants for decades, little data is available for the long-term performance of EALs. This is of interest as their use has only recently begun to catch on in the power generation industry. A study of aged EALs in a tin bronze-steel contact, typical of what may be found in hydroelectric turbines, has shown continued satisfactory performance even at high acid number (high oxidation level), beyond the point where an oil would normally be changed out. The introduction of new materials provides a means of solving certain problems associated with machine operation and reliability. The use of PTFE as a bearing facing material is well established but little has been published about its performance in this application. A series of experiments have been performed to investigate the impact of employing such a facing on a tilting-pad thrust bearing. A thicker minimum film is found at the outlet edge of the pads in comparison with a babbit (white metal) faced bearing. Temperatures within the pad bulk material are seen to be lower as a result of the insulating effects of the polymer, thereby reducing the impact of thermal crowning. An investigation has also been performed with a range of PTFE composite materials to assess their suitability as a replacement for babbitt facing material in hydrodynamic journal bearings. The polymer composites have been shown to introduce clear benefits in comparison with pure PTFE and babbitt in terms of reduced wear and break-away friction at start-up.
