The output from a strip mill is coiled and, subsequently, used as the feed for a cold rolling mill or used directly by fabricators. Billets, for re-rolling, are subsequently rolled in either a merchant, bar or rod mill.

50|$|The {{classification}} {{temperature is}} defined as the temperature at which a linear shrinkage of 4% is not exceeded after 24&#8209;hour heat treatment in the electrically heated laboratory oven and in a neutral atmosphere. Depending on the type of product, the value may not exceed the following limits: 2% for boards and <b>shaped</b> <b>products,</b> 4% for mats and papers.The classification temperature is specified in 50 °C steps (starting at 850 °C and up to 1600 °C). The classification temperature {{does not mean that the}} product can be used continuously at this temperature. In the field, the continuous application temperature of amorphous HTIW (AES and ASW) is typically 100-150 °C below the classification temperature. Products made of Polycrystalline Wool can generally be used up to classification temperature.|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in quality {{requirements for the}} formed products makes it desirable to find an effective way of controlling the process to achieve complex <b>shape</b> <b>products</b> without defects. It has been proven by many researchers that the space-variant blank-holder force can {{improve the quality of}} forming to achieve a targeted <b>shape</b> <b>product</b> (no wrinkling, a high drawing depth, less variation in thickness, etc.). In the forming process, the most common problems, tearing and wrinkling, generally result from the strain condition. In this paper the effect on the strain path with various types of space-variant blank-holder force and other geometrical parameters, such as the fillet radius, the blank size, and the clearance between the die and the punch, were compared and analysed. The results showed that the space-variant blank-holder force and some geometrical parameters affect the strain distribution to various extents during the forming process. The parameters influence the negative minor strain much more than the maximum major strain. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|Molded plywood is {{the term}} for two- or three-dimensionally <b>shaped</b> <b>products</b> from {{multiple}} veneer layers that are glued together through heat and pressure in a pressing tool. The veneer layers are arranged crosswise at an angle of 90 degrees. Molded wood is used for flat furniture components such as seats, backrests and seat shells. When the veneer layers are arranged in the same direction, it is called laminated wood. It is used for armrests and chair frames. After pressing, the blanks are processed mechanically. A particular feature {{is the ability to}} produce different variations of shapes from the blanks. Due to its immense strength and low weight, molded wood is particularly suitable for interior decoration, seating furniture, bed slats, skateboards and vehicle construction.|$|E
50|$|Adaptable cam-executions, {{which can}} be made {{suitable}} individually to the concerned products, will meet especially the requirements of wet-press-technique of pourable compounds, while applications of eccentric-, knuckle-joint and round table presses are particularly related on the dry-press-technique of compounds with gliding characteristics.The sinusoidal movement of eccentric presses offers advantages especially for bigger strokes < 100 strokes per minute and the distorted sinusoidal movement of the knuckle joint is especially used for products, which need a longer time for deairing in the phase of compaction and a longer time for decompression after the bottom dead centre.For this kind of compaction technology the strokes are limited < 35 strokes per minute, but in contrast to that the compaction speed of round table presses for small and simple <b>shaped</b> <b>products</b> are especially high and quantities < 30,000 pcs per minute can be realized.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure casting: Specially {{developed}} {{polymeric materials}} allow a mould {{to be subject}} to application external pressures of up to 4.0 MPa-so much higher than slip casting in plaster moulds where the capillary forces correspond to a pressure of around 0.1 - 0.2 MPa. The high pressure leads to much faster casting rates and, hence, faster production cycles. Furthermore, the application of high pressure air through the polymeric moulds upon demoulding the cast means a new casting cycle can be started immediately in the same mould, unlike plaster moulds which require lengthy drying times. The polymeric materials have much greater durability than plaster and, therefore, it is possible to achieve <b>shaped</b> <b>products</b> with better dimensional tolerances and much longer mould life. Pressure casting was developed in the 1970s for the production of sanitaryware although, more recently, it has been applied to tableware.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{brings up}} {{this idea of}} using Near Field Communication (NFC) for {{inventory}} control system instead of using traditional barcodes. NFC because of its high security, ease of use and efficiency can be very suitable for systems like inventory control. In traditional inventory control systems, each product has a barcode pasted on it, which is vulnerable to attacks as barcodes are open and have no security. Furthermore, barcodes are prone to damages and can be unreliable when pasted on different types of products e. g. hot and frozen products, circular <b>shaped</b> <b>products</b> and irregular <b>shaped</b> <b>products</b> like clothes etc. NFC {{on the other hand}} is very efficient, secure and reliable when it comes to short-range wireless communication. In this paper we will present our prototype for the inventory control system of an electronic store in which each product has a passive NFC tag pasted to it. When a customer buys a product the receipt of the product is generated using NFC between the NFC passive tag on the product and NFC enabled device (e. g. smart phone or reader) at the cash counter...|$|E
