5|$|The North East line {{originated}} from a suburban line to Essendon in 1860, being extended to Wodonga by 1873, connecting with the New South Wales Government Railways at Albury at a break-of-gauge in 1883. A <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> track was completed {{parallel with the}} broad gauge track from Albury to Melbourne in 1962. The broad gauge track has been converted to <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> between Seymour and Albury.|$|E
5|$|Cromer High {{station was}} {{situated}} {{a short distance}} away from the Cromer Tunnel, Norfolk's only <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> railway tunnel, connecting the Sheringham and Mundesley lines. Although disused since services ceased in 1953, the tunnel remains intact.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 and 1904, the Trunk Line was {{upgraded}} to double track. The section from Drammen to Kongsberg was converted to <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> on 1 November 1909. Between 1917 and 1920, dual gauge was laid between OsloV and Drammen, and from 13 November 1922, the Drammen Line was entirely operated with <b>standard</b> <b>gauge.</b> The first electrification of NSB's lines {{was put into}} service on 26 October 1922 on the Drammen Line between OsloV and Brakerøya. The section from OsloV to Sandvika was {{upgraded to}} double track on 26 November 1922. From 1922, NSB introduced El 1-hauled passenger trains on the Drammen Line, and later other lines.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, local {{politicians}} {{proposed that the}} line be built administratively {{as part of the}} Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for <b>standard</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with <b>standard</b> <b>gauge.</b> So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be {{converted}} {{in time for the}} opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> to Voss.|$|E
5|$|The B {{converted}} {{the line to}} Taunton to mixed gauge by 1 June 1875, but {{the remainder of the}} line to Exeter was not done until 1 March 1876, three months after the B had amalgamated with the GWR. The remainder of the lines beyond Exeter were converted to <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> on 21 May 1892 so the extra rails at Temple Meads fell into disuse and were removed to leave a purely <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> layout. This allowed the through station to be rebuilt with two additional platform faces.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian Parliament gave 400,000 kroner {{in support}} in 1873, and doubled it the {{following}} year. By then, the Swedish authorities {{had decided that}} all railways should be built in <b>standard</b> <b>gauge,</b> and the Norwegian Parliament chose to change their configuration to the same gauge in 1874, increasing estimated costs from 4.7 to 8.9 million kroner. This was a similar arrangement to what would happen with the two international lines in Eastern Norway, where the Kongsvinger and Østfold Lines were also built with <b>standard</b> <b>gauge.</b> Despite intense lobbying from representatives from Innherred, the Verdal alternative was finally discarded when parliament gave 3 million kroner to the Meråker Line.|$|E
5|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>gauge</b> {{operations}} {{began in}} 1894 with five locomotives, and the narrow gauge equipment was kept temporarily for commuter runs to Blue Ash.

50|$|The E&NA “Western Extension” was {{operated}} by the New Brunswick government separately from the E&NA “Eastern Extension” and thus did not get included in the takeover by the Intercolonial Railway, which was focused exclusively on building and operating a railway from Halifax to Quebec. The E&NA “Western Extension” was <b>standard</b> <b>gauged</b> by 1877.|$|R
5|$|A {{variant of}} the Automatic Block System, Automatic and Track Control (ATC) has since been introduced, which {{provides}} the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time. Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> line to Albury, {{and then on the}} main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{the break}} of gauge at Albury was eliminated, {{with the opening}} of the North East <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> line in 1962. The new line aided freight traffic between the state capitals, and enabled though {{passenger}} trains, such as the Southern Aurora and the Intercapital Daylight. At the same time the sixties was also the end of steam, with the demolition of the massive North Melbourne Locomotive Depot on 20 January 1961.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1847 the Kilmarnock and Troon line reopened, as a <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> {{locomotive}} operated railway. It {{had been}} closed for the modernisation work, and it now provided a proper link from Kilmarnock to the coast. The GPK opened a short connecting spur between its own line and the K in Kilmarnock. On the same day a branch at Dalry to Swinlees was opened; there was a copper mine there.|$|E

5|$|Planning of {{a railway}} to connect Trøndelag and Jämtland, Sweden, started in 1869, {{with one of}} the {{proposals}} being to build a line from Trondheim via Verdal to Sweden. However, surveys along the Verdal alternative deemed it unsuitable, and instead the line was built via Stjørdalen and Meråker. To conform with Swedish standards, the line was built with <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> instead of the more common narrow gauge. The Meråker Line opened on 22 July 1882.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw costs further reduced on {{the rail}} network. Guards were removed from {{passenger}} trains in 1989, and driver only suburban trains commenced running in 1993, with the last suburban train crewed by a guard running in November 1995. In 1994 the National Rail Corporation was established, taking profitable steel, and intermodal trafficks from V/Line; and the Melbourne to Adelaide <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> line was opened in 1995 moving the break of gauge.|$|E
5|$|The first {{railroad}} track laid through Thistle was a narrow-gauge {{spur line}} servicing coal mines near today's Scofield Reservoir, built in 1878 by the Utah and Pleasant Valley Railway. By 1890, the Denver and Rio Grande Western, which acquired {{the line in}} a foreclosure sale in 1882, had rebuilt the line to <b>standard</b> <b>gauge.</b> The D connected this line with one they had built west from Colorado, completing a link from Salt Lake City to Denver.|$|E

At the same time, the line was converted to <b>standard</b> <b>gauge,</b> the number of station tracks was reduced, and the station received an overhaul. The station building was demolished in 1970, but the station was still served until the line closed in 1990. The tracks and depot buildings still exist.|$|E
5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
5|$|Details of the railroad's {{rolling stock}} are obscure. In 1891, it owned five {{passenger}} and three freight cars. In {{addition to the}} coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty (fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season), the railroad {{had at least one}} parlor car and several Brill-built observation cars. Contemporary photographs show that the railroad built some of its own open-air cars for excursion service. Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of gondola cars for coal traffic. The railroad continued to maintain a <b>standard</b> <b>gauge</b> gondola fleet {{in the last years of}} its existence.|$|E
5|$|On {{the interstate}} railway {{corridors}} there are independent sections of track {{due to the}} use of both broad and <b>standard</b> <b>gauges</b> in the state, these sections being from Melbourne to Seymour and on to Albury (constructed in the 1960s), and Melbourne to Geelong (completed in 1995).
