50|$|Schizophyllan (Sonifilan, SPG) is {{a neutral}} {{extracellular}} polysaccharide {{produced by the}} fungus Schizophyllum commune. Schizophyllan is a β-1,3 beta-glucan with β-1,6 branching. Schizophyllan {{is also known as}} <b>sizofiran.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sizofiran</b> is a beta-glucan, {{also known}} as schizophyllan and {{abbreviated}} as SPG in many papers. It is a polysaccharide consisting of repeating β(1→3)-linked D-glucose units with occasional β(1→6)-branches. [...] This generates a very stiff triple-helical structure in water.|$|E

Agaricus subrufescens (Agaricus blazei/brasiliensis, almond mushroom) is a fungus associated with Brazil and Japan. Research and small clinical studies demonstrated A. subrufescens extracts have antihyperglycemic and anticancer activities. Brefeldin A and blazein were isolated from A. subrufescens. Boletus badius has been shown to synthesize theanine which is claimed to have mild psychoactive properties. Cordyceps sinensis is an entomopathogenic fungi collected on the Tibetan Plateau. The immunosuppressant ciclosporin was originally isolated from Cordyceps subsessilis. The adenosine analog cordycepin was originally isolated from Cordyceps. Other Cordyceps isolates include, cordymin, cordycepsidone, and cordyheptapeptide. CS-4 is commercially sold as C. sinensis, but Cs-4 has recently been confirmed to be a different species from the Cordyceps species used in traditional Chinese medicine. CS-4 is properly known as Paecilomyces hepiali. Hirsutella sinensis is the accepted asexual form of C. sinensis. Lentinula edodes (Shiitake) {{has been used as a}} source of Lentinan, AHCC, and eritadenine. In 1985 Japan approved lentinan as an adjuvant for gastric cancer. Studies there indicate prolonged survival and improved quality of life when gastric cancer patients with unresectable or recurrent diseases are treated with lentinan in combination with other chemotherapies. Morchella esculenta (Morel) contains the amino acid, cis-3-amino-L-proline. Ustilago maydis (Mexican truffle, huitlacoche, corn fungus) synthesises ustilagine and ustilagic acid. Ganoderma lucidum (Ling zhi, mannentake, reishi) has a long record of medicinal use. It contains p-hydroxybenzoic acid, cinnamic acid, and lanostane-type triterpenoids such as ganoderic acids. Hydnellum peckii has yielded atromentin, an anticoagulant isolated from the mycorrhiza. Schizophyllum commune (Split gill) has yielded schizophyllan (SPG, <b>sizofiran,</b> sonifilan) which has been researched clinically for anticancer activity. Hydrophobins were originally isolated from S. commune. A chemically analogous polysaccharide, scleroglucan, is an isolate of Sclerotium rolfsii.|$|E
