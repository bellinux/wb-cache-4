50|$|Despite its {{relatively}} small size, the <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> {{is considered a}} top predator in the ecosystem it inhabits. At the Great Meteor Seamount in the eastern Atlantic, this species feeds primarily on teleosts and cephalopods, {{and to a lesser}} extent on small cartilaginous fishes. Off Tunisia, crustaceans are the second-most common prey taken after teleosts. Off Australia, this species consumes mostly teleosts, with smaller individuals taking mainly Lepidorhynchus denticulatus and larger individuals taking increasing numbers of snake mackerels and cutlassfishes. It is a strong-swimming species, with feeding and activity level increasing at night. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites of the <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> include nematodes in the genera Anisakis and Contracaecum, and the cestode Crossobothrium dohrnii.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> is uncommon, but widely {{distributed}} in the tropical and temperate regions of all oceans except for the northeastern Pacific Ocean. It is found from North Carolina to Cuba, including the northern Gulf of Mexico, and from Venezuela to Argentina in the western Atlantic. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs from Morocco to Namibia, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is reported from the Indian Ocean off southwestern India, Aldabra Island, southern Mozambique, and South Africa. In the Pacific Ocean, it is known from Japan to China, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, and northern Chile.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> (Heptranchias perlo), {{also known}} as one-finned shark, perlon shark, sevengill cow shark, sharpsnouted sevengill or slender sevengill, is a species of shark in the family Hexanchidae, and the only living species in the genus Heptranchias. Found almost circumglobally in deep water, {{it is one of}} the few species of sharks with seven pairs of gill slits as opposed to the usual five. The other shark species with seven gill slits is the broadnose sevengill shark. Though small, this shark is an active, {{voracious}} predator of invertebrates and fishes. When caught, this species is notably aggressive and will attempt to bite. It is of minor commercial importance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> is {{reasonably}} small and {{is located in}} generally deep water, and these characteristics classify this shark as harmless humans. Small to moderate numbers of sharpnose sevengill sharks are captured as bycatch in certain deepwater commercial fisheries on longlines or in trawls. They are used for fishmeal and liver oil; the meat {{is said to be}} of good quality, but the flesh is considered to be mildly poisonous when consumed. When captured, it is very active and quick to bite, but it does not pose a substantial threat to people due to its small size. Some concern exists that populations of this slow-reproducing species may be declining in areas of sustained deepwater fishing, and it has been assessed as Near Threatened by the World Conservation Union. It has occasionally been kept in captivity in Japan.|$|E

40|$|Sharks {{belonging}} to the family Hexanchidae have six or seven gill slits, unlike all other elasmobranchs, which have five gill slits. Their olfactory organs have a round shape, which is common for holocepha- lans, but not for elasmobranchs. Thus, {{the shape of the}} olfactory organ represents a further, less striking, peculiarity of this family among elasmobranchs. Despite that, the microscopic anatomy and histology of the olfactory organ have not yet been studied in any species of this family. Here, an anatomical and histological description of the olfactory organ of the <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> Heptranchias perlo is given. The organ is a rosette, with a central raphe and 31 – 34 primary lamellae, which bear secondary lamellae with a more or less branched shape. The elastic connective capsule which envelops the olfactory rosette possibly changes its shape along with water influx. In the olfactory epithelium, the supporting cells also have a secretory function, while no specialized mucous cells are visible; regarding this feature the olfac- tory epithelium of H. perlo differs from that of other chondrichthyan species. The immunohistochemical investigation of the sensory epithelium shows the absence of immunoreactivity for G olf in receptor neurons, which confirms previous observations in Chondrichthyes...|$|E
40|$|The elasmobranch fishes {{possess a}} {{remarkable}} diversity of feeding mechanisms {{for a group}} containing relatively few species (~ 1200). The three most prevalent of these mechanisms involve prey capture during which the predator overtakes its prey (ram), prey is drawn {{into the mouth of}} the predator (suction), and relatively stationary consumption of sessile or substrate affixed prey (biting). Biomechanical modeling of cranial force distributions, in situ bite performance trials, and kinematic analysis of prey capture behaviors were employed to identify morphological and behavioral specializations and constraints associated with these feeding mechanisms in lemon Negaprion brevirostris (ram), whitespotted bamboo Chiloscyllium plagiosum (suction), and horn Heterodontus francisci (biting) sharks. Biomechanical modeling of the forces generated by the cranial musculature was used to theoretically estimate the maximum bite force and mechanical loadings occurring throughout the hyostyl ic jaw suspension mechanisms of each species, characterized by suspensory hyomandibular cartilages between the back of the jaws and cranium and anterior ligamentous attachments. To assess the mechanical factors involved in the evolution of elasmobranch jaw suspension mechanisms, the feeding mechanism of the <b>sharpnose</b> <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> Heptranchias perlo was modeled as well. Heptranchias perlo possesses an ancestral amphistylic jaw suspension mechanism including non-suspensory hyomandibular cartilages, a large post-orbital articulation between the jaws and cranium, and anterior ligamentous attachments. Theoretical estimates of maximum bite force were compared to voluntary bite forces measured during in situ bite performance trials. Voluntary bite force measurements allowed the quantification of discrete behavioral attributes of bite force application in each species. To further assess the behavioral specializations associated with these feeding mechanisms, high-speed digital videography w as used to analyze the prey capture cranial kinematics of species. Collectively, these analyses have developed a morphological and behavioral basis from which to understand the functional diversity of the ram, suction, and biting feeding mechanisms in elasmobranchs...|$|E
25|$|Research in 2014 {{also found}} {{that for the first}} time, {{reproductive}} hormones levels were found in the broadnose <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark.</b> for a few years before venturing out. The probable predators of this species are larger sharks. Research from 2002 showed that although juvenile <b>sevengill</b> <b>sharks</b> utilize nursery areas in a similar way, males mature faster than females even if they are the same size and thus males are more likely to leave the nursery area before females.|$|R

5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown {{smoothhounds}} that share its range, the leopard shark has {{smaller and more}} numerous red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{patterns}} of large-scale movements of highly mobile marine predators is essential to understanding the impacts of anthropogenic pressures on the animals and the ecosystems they frequent. The broadnose <b>sevengill</b> <b>shark</b> Notorynchus cepedianus {{is one of the}} most important apex predators in temperate coastal areas around the world, yet little is known of its seasonal large-scale movements. Five male and five female <b>sevengill</b> <b>sharks</b> were equipped with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) in a coastal embayment in southern Tasmania, that collected depth and temperature data during winter, when the animals leave the coastal embayment, resulting in a dataset covering a total of 818 d. Animal tracks indicated that males moved northwards into warmer waters, whereas females remained in southern waters. Three of the females stayed in the Tasmanian coastal areas while the other two left, with one of them moving into deeper waters of up to 360 m depth at the southern edge of the Tasmanian shelf before returning to the Tasmanian coast. These sex-specific differences in large-scale movement could potentially lead to the differential exploitation of the sexes when the sharks leave the protected areas where they were tagged. Both males and females switched between diel vertical migration and reverse diel vertical migration over the course of their tracks and displayed oscillatory vertical movements, probably linked to foraging. These vertical movements persisted throughout the tracks, suggesting that <b>sevengill</b> <b>sharks</b> foraged continuously during their migration rather than switching between transiting and foraging modes...|$|R
