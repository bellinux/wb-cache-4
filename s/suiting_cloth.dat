50|$|In the 1920s, women {{continued}} to favour male motoring dress and this also crossed over into high fashion. A 1921 article in The Times {{about the latest}} Paris fashions described a red leather motoring coat fastened with metal buckles. Similar leather coats had been popular for chauffeurs and male motorists for several years. Fur was still popular, with a fashion correspondent noting that the Motor Show in Olympia was transforming shop windows around London. She recommended the latest craze for fur-lined coats in tweed, wool velour and cheviot. Musquash and nutria were also being chosen by women motorists, while in Knightsbridge, one new store was offering women's coats suitable for motoring made from men's <b>suiting</b> <b>cloth.</b> Accessories also followed the unisex trend; The Times described the arrival of neat leather caps as a fashion accessory for women in 1923. This style of sporty hat was worn in the iconic Tamara de Lempicka self portrait of 1929 in which she is driving a green Bugatti with leather cap and driving gloves - reputed {{to be based on}} an Hermès set that she had seen {{on the cover of the}} magazine Vu. As this portrait suggests, and Peter Thorold has noted, the car had become the ultimate symbol of modernity and emancipation, something that was reflected in the styling of clothes. Although no coat is visible in the de Lempicka portrait, by the late 1920s the latest motoring coats from France were worn long, made of tweed or flannel with narrow leather belts and collars in fur or flannel. Wide raglan sleeves were popular - allowing freedom of movement - and collars could be military in style with buttons up to the neck.|$|E

50|$|Soft grilles can be {{made from}} any well <b>suited</b> <b>cloth,</b> weaving, stitching, foam, fabric upholsteries and other similar materials. In general, soft grilles impose little {{resistance}} on the speaker driver because the material is free to move synchronously with the sound waves. Because the grille is capable of absorbing this vibration, softer grilles are (in general) less prone to rattling except at extremely high sound pressure levels.|$|R
50|$|Materials {{used for}} making {{suspenders}} have also changed over time, with newer additions such as rayon, a hard-wearing synthetic fiber, now offered. The traditional Woolen Boxcloth Suspenders remain available but are very costly, a style often worn by senior lawyers in London. Generally, {{a high quality}} rayon with elastic webbing is the fabric used to create suspenders, with silks webbing or tubed <b>suiting</b> <b>cloths</b> from mills such as Dugdale Bros of England also used.|$|R

Both single-breasted and double-breasted waistcoats exist, regardless of the formality of dress, but single-breasted ones are more common.

50|$|Waistcoats {{worn with}} lounge suits (now principally single-breasted) {{normally}} match the <b>suit</b> in <b>cloth,</b> and have {{four to six}} buttons.

60|$|I stooped {{under the}} rude lintel, {{and there he}} sat upon a stone outside, his gray eyes dancing with {{amusement}} as they fell upon my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind. In his tweed <b>suit</b> and <b>cloth</b> cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that cat-like love of personal cleanliness {{which was one of}} his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.|$|R

During the day he had bought a new tool-basket, cleaned up his old hay-knife and wimble, set himself up in fresh leggings, kneenaps and corduroys, and in other ways gone back to the working clothes of his young manhood, discarding for ever the shabby-genteel <b>suit</b> of <b>cloth</b> and rusty silk hat that since his decline had characterized him in the Casterbridge street as a man who had seen better days.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a different kind}} of space suit that is made of elastic cloth and has no joints. It provides excellent mobility and improved hand function. It was developed and tested in the 1960 ’s. Recent studies involved vacuum testing of a new elastic glove, then testing the physiological effects of mechanical counter pressure on the hand and arm. New textile technology will allow development of an elastic cloth that will ease donning, and there are other aids to donning under development. Computer-controlled textile machines will make close fitting garments for every astronaut, large or small. Thermal comfort results from physiologically controlled sweating with instant evaporative cooling through the porous elastic cloth. Compared to gas-pressurized <b>suits,</b> the elastic <b>cloth</b> <b>suit</b> has the advantages of low suit weight, small mass of expendables and increased safety. It is practical and effective for the exploration of Mars...|$|R

60|$|In {{a moment}} Chauvelin {{was on his}} feet and with eyes dilated, lips parted in awed bewilderment, he was gazing towards the open window, where astride upon the sill, one leg inside the room, the other out, and with the moon shining full on his <b>suit</b> of delicate-coloured <b>cloth,</b> his wide caped coat and elegant chapeau-bras, sat the imperturbable Sir Percy.|$|R
60|$|The grizzled negro was arrayed in a {{surprisingly}} new <b>suit</b> of blue <b>cloth</b> with a portentous white waistcoat {{and an enormous}} crumpled white cravat, that gave him the appearance of suffering from a glandular swelling.

Their arms are folded and their weight shifted to their right leg. Their image is the foreground of the door, and they are looking rightward toward the heart.|$|R
60|$|His close-clipped {{hair was}} grey; his figure, encased in an ill-fitting <b>suit</b> of coarse <b>cloth,</b> was stooped and shrunken; {{his face was}} deeply lined; yet {{he was not an}} old man in years.

60|$|The ex-ambassador {{was very}} {{obviously}} {{in a state}} of acute nervous tension; his hands were tightly clasped behind his back, and his movements were curiously irresponsible and jerky. But Sir Percy Blakeney looked a picture of calm unconcern: the lace bow at his throat was tied with scrupulous care, his eyeglass upheld at quite the correct angle, and his delicate-coloured caped coat was thrown back just sufficiently to afford a glimpse of the dainty <b>cloth</b> <b>suit</b> and exquisitely embroidered waistcoat beneath.|$|R
5000|$|His grandson, Sir John Arundell, K.B., The Magnificent, {{was a great}} church benefactor (notably to {{the celebrated}} lost church of St. Piran-in-the-Sands — Perranzabulæ), and, {{according}} to his will, dated 18 April 1433, possessed no less than fifty-two complete <b>suits</b> of <b>cloth</b> of gold. He was a naval commander, and was sheriff of Cornwall four times, and M.P. for the county in 1422-3. The Arundells intermarried {{with most of the}} old Cornish families — nearly all of them now extinct — thus adding considerably to their vast possessions, until at length, in the twenty-ninth year of Henry VI, John Arundell, born about 1421, had become the largest free tenant in Cornwall, his estates being of the value of 2,000l. per annum. He was sheriff and admiral of Cornwall, and a general for Henry VI in his French wars, but was attainted in 1483.|$|R

He has opined that the meaning of life lies in work, and he avoided distractions which would have detracted from his working time; in order to do one's work, however, he believed that one must stay healthy, so he exercised for his health. He is reported as having got up at 4:30 AM, breakfasting at 5:00 AM, and then beginning to write. He once said that he often felt compelled to get up at this early hour to work. Nevertheless, he wrote with great speed and efficiency, completing his famous essay [...] "Forever Regret" [...] within a few hours.|$|R

The band duly emerged {{at the tail end of}} the glam rock movement, wearing trademark white <b>suits</b> and <b>cloth</b> caps on stage. [...] Their first release, [...] "Sugar Baby Love" [...] was an instant hit remaining at number one in the United Kingdom for four weeks in May 1974, while reaching number 37 on the U.S. chart that August, and remains their best-known record. Subsequent releases were to be less successful, but the band continued to tour well into the 2000s with two lineups in existence.|$|R
25|$|The Dobcross H.K. {{box loom}} was {{manufactured}} in ca.1950 by Hutchinson, Hollingworth & Co. Ltd of Dobcross, Oldham. This loom was claimed by its makers {{to be one}} of the most widely used power looms in the woollen and worsted industries. It was used, with minor adaptations, for weaving goods as varied as light tropical <b>suiting,</b> costume <b>cloths,</b> overcoatings, army and police uniform cloths and heavy blankets. The main feature of this loom is the dobby (located top right of the loom with the hand wheel) which is known as the Knowles, American or positive wheel dobby. This device lifts and lowers the wooden shafts through which the warp ends are threaded, separating the warp threads to produce the shed. The loom has four rising or drop boxes at each side, which can be moved independently, and can weave up to seven shuttles, each with a different colour.|$|R

Here are three guineas; get {{yourself}} a <b>suit</b> of pilot <b>cloth</b> at some outfitter's at the East End. It will be useful to you anyhow, whether you go with me or ship again here." ...|$|R

Little Ben looked on, highly delighted to watch the proceedings, and Steadfast, as he waited, glanced towards the servant, a well-made young man, in a trim, sober <b>suit</b> of grey <b>cloth,</b> with a hat a good deal slouched over a dark swarthy face, that struck Stead as having been seen by him before.|$|R
60|$|Berenger {{could not}} bear to leave his wife near the Duke of Anjou and Narcisse, and he offered himself to the King as an actor in the masque, much as he detested all he heard of its subject. The King nodded comprehension, and told him it was open to him either to be a demon in a tight <b>suit</b> of black <b>cloth,</b> with cloven-hoof shoes, a long tail, and a trident; or one of the Huguenots who were to be repulsed from Paradise for the edification of the spectators. As these last were to wear suits of knightly armour, Berenger much {{preferred}} making one of them in spite of their doom.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, his clothes {{did not fit}} him. He wore a {{ready-made}} <b>suit</b> of dark <b>cloth</b> that was ill adjusted to his body. In fact, no ready-made suit of clothes ever could fit his body. And on this night, as always, the cloth bulged with his muscles, while the coat between the shoulders, what of the heavy shoulder-development, was a maze of wrinkles. His neck was the neck of a prize-fighter,* thick and strong. So this was the social philosopher and ex-horseshoer my father had discovered, was my thought. And he certainly looked it with those bulging muscles and that bull-throat. Immediately I classified him--a sort of prodigy, I thought, a Blind Tom** of the working class.|$|R

I knew I could keep my seat even on a man's saddle, for cavaliers' daughters had had to do strange things, and it was thus that I was obliged to come away from my dear Berenger's side. But then I rode between my father and Eustace. Now, if I did not find out where my poor Margaret was gone, who was to deliver her? ...|$|R
60|$|Unlike most of {{the young}} men here to-night, who wore the {{characteristic}} costume of the countryside--full, white linen shirt and trousers, broad leather belt, embossed and embroidered and high leather boots, Béla was dressed in a town <b>suit</b> of dark-coloured <b>cloth,</b> cut by a provincial tailor from Arad. He was short of stature, though broad-shouldered and firmly knit, but his face was singularly ugly, owing to the terrible misfortune which had befallen him when he lost his left eye. The scar and hollow which were now where the eye had once been gave the whole face a sinister expression, which was further accentuated by the irregular line of the eyebrows and the sneer which habitually hovered round the full, hard lips.|$|R
50|$|At St. Mary's Church at Worstead, Norfolk, {{the village}} which gave {{its name to}} the cloth, the village church built by local weavers in the fourteenth-century towers over the small community, its tower jutting strikingly above the landscape. In other East Anglian communities, the wealth from wool poured in: Wymondham, Diss, North Walsham, East Harling, Attleborough, Aylsham. The churches basked in the refracted glory of wool wealth. Even in Norwich, which boasts more medieval churches than {{anywhere}} in Europe, it was wool money that got the stone lifted, the glass stained and the panels carved. Norfolk wool was best <b>suited</b> to heavier <b>cloth,</b> and so Norwich and Norfolk eventually gained almost a complete monopoly on worstead. Those profits fueled an extraordinary ecclesiastical building boom.|$|R
