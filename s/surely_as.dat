5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E

When they see the splendor in which Psyche lives, they become envious, and {{undermine}} her happiness by prodding her to uncover her husband's true identity, since <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> foretold by the oracle she was lying with the vile winged serpent, who would devour her and her child.|$|E

25|$|The San Francisco Estuary {{together}} with the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta represents a highly altered ecosystem. The region has been heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and most recently, suburban development. These needs have wrought direct changes in the movement of water {{and the nature of}} the landscape, and indirect changes from the introduction of non-native species. New species have altered the architecture of the food web as <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> levees have altered the landscape of islands and channels that form the complex system known as the Delta.|$|E
500|$|... "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg," [...] the Ramones 1985 single, pictured Reagan's {{controversial}} {{visit to}} a German military cemetery in Bitburg earlier that year. Critics in the U.S., Europe, and Israel decried the presidential visit because among the 2,000 German soldiers buried there were 49 members of the Waffen-SS who had committed genocidal atrocities. The phrase [...] "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg" [...] was coined by protesters in {{the weeks leading up}} to Reagan's trip. Before the trip, Reagan ignited more controversy when he expressed his belief that the soldiers buried at Bitburg [...] "were victims, just as <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> the victims in the concentration camps." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his writing, Fingleton was a witty, perceptive and occasionally sardonic commentator for the BBC and at various times a contributor to The Times, The Sunday Times, The Observer, and various newspapers in Australia, South Africa and elsewhere. In 1976, he was awarded an OBE for services [...] "to journalism and to cricket". He {{was the subject of}} three appearances in 1979 and 1980 on Parkinson's TV interview show. Fingleton's judgements were characterised by careful first-hand evidence and was known for sensing the emergence of a possible story. E W Swanton stated that [...] "Fingleton remains <b>surely,</b> <b>as</b> cricket writer and broadcaster, the best his country has".|$|E

500|$|Andrews found Cardozo's {{reasoning}} too narrow, {{and felt}} that the focus {{should be on the}} unreasonable act: driving down Broadway at high speed is negligent whether or not an accident occurs. Such an act is wrong to the public at large, not only to those who might be injured. [...] "Due care is a duty imposed on each one of us to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> it does those on the scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite these setbacks, the Ross Sea party survived inter-personnel disputes, extreme weather, illness, and {{the deaths}} of three of its members {{to carry out its}} [...] mission in full during its second Antarctic season. This success proved {{ultimately}} without purpose, because Shackleton's main expedition was unable to land after Endurance was crushed in the Weddell Sea ice. Shackleton eventually led his men to safety, [...] but the transcontinental march did not take place and the Ross Sea party's depots were not required. [...] The Ross Sea party remained stranded until January 1917, when Aurora, which had been repaired and refitted in New Zealand, arrived to rescue them. Public recognition of their efforts was slow in coming, but in due course four Albert Medals were awarded to members of the party, two posthumously. Shackleton later wrote that those who died [...] "gave their lives for their country as <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> those who gave up their lives in France or Flanders." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of {{terrorist}} Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a resurgence in the popularity of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] video occurred. The official YouTube video was flooded with comments regarding {{the death of}} bin Laden and it was immediately deemed a celebratory anthem for the event. Moreover, the song's association to his death continued on other social medias, like Facebook and Twitter, and it was played as individuals celebrated outside of the White House. About it becoming an anthem for bin Laden's death, Nitsuh Abebe of New York magazine wrote, [...] "I have to confess that my list of reactions to the news did not get anywhere near 'watch a Miley Cyrus video.' The reason it occurred to others is <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> simple as it seems: This is a recent hit song whose title {{is dominated by the}} words [...] "party" [...] and [...] "U.S.A." [...] Looking for anything more apt would be overthinking it. Cyrus' video [...] is stocked with a great many of those things we like and do well: a drive-in theater, trucks and muscle cars, Daisy Dukes, giant flags. It is, just like bin Laden's death, another convenient opportunity to celebrate ourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|The initial {{consensus}} among reviewers {{was that it}} was [...] "an unusual treatise on nature". [...] The book was published soon after her poetry collection Tickets for a Prayer Wheel (1974, University of Missouri Press). Reviewing both volumes for America, John Breslin noted the similarities between the two: [...] "Even if her first book of poems had not been published simultaneously, the language she uses in Pilgrim would have given her away." [...] The Saturday Evening Post also praised Dillard's poetic ability in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, noting that [...] "the poet in her is everywhere evident in this prose-poem of hers: the reader's attention is caught not only by the freshness of her insights, but by the beauty of her descriptions as well." [...] Melvin Maddocks, a reviewer for Time, noted Dillard's intention of subtle influence: [...] "Reader, beware of this deceptive girl, mouthing her piety about 'the secret of seeing' being 'the pearl of great price,' modestly insisting, 'I am no scientist. I explore the neighborhood.' Here is no gentle romantic twirling a buttercup, no graceful inscriber of 365 inspirational prose poems. As she guides the attention to a muskrat, to a monarch butterfly, a heron or a coot, Miss Dillard is stalking the reader as <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> any predator stalks its game." ...|$|E
500|$|As for {{the other}} {{six-pack}} titles, Mega called Rockmans Zone [...] "not a very inspiring game" [...] for its slow pacing and [...] "bland" [...] graphics. Reviewers compared the game to Hogan's Alley and [...] Mega called Space Station Defender concept [...] "incredibly daft". GamePro criticized Space Station Defender [...] "washed-out and ugly" [...] graphics and [...] "obnoxious" [...] audio. The magazine thought poorly {{of most of the}} cartridge's audio. Mega found Whack Ball easy and did not expect players to maintain interest in it for longer than an hour. Sega Visions compared Whack Ball to Arkanoid. Mega wrote that Front Line was programmed poorly with [...] "the appearance of having never met up with a gamestester", calling it [...] "truly awful". Electronic Gaming Monthly and GamePro compared the game to Operation Wolf. Sega Force rated Front Line lowest within the six-pack, with a score of 22%. The magazine wrote that the bug game, Pest Control, would make players bored after ten minutes, and Mega said the game was not worth loading even once, giving it their lowest rating of the bunch: 12%. Sega Force wrote in February that the games were only fun for an hour and that the peripheral's success would depend on its future games, adding, [...] "Without that [...] support, it will die as <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> all other attempts at light guns have done." [...] The magazine ultimately recommended against purchase until more games were released.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} seen the message of Mansfield Park as abolitionist. Joseph Lew argued that Fanny's refusal to marry Henry Crawford as [...] "an act of rebellion, {{endangering}} a system based upon the exchange of women between men as <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> a slave's refusal to work". Susan Fraiman, in a 1995 essay argued strongly against the Said thesis, arguing that the values of Sir Thomas are those which Austen affirms in Mansfield Park and that if his attempt to restore order to his family in Mansfield Park is seen as analogous with his restoration of order at his Antigua plantation, then he was a failure for the [...] "moral blight" [...] at Mansfield Park remains after he returns to England. Fraiman conceded to Said that Austen {{was one of the}} writers who [...] "made colonialism thinkable by constructing the West as center, home and norm", but argued slavery in Mansfield Park [...] "is not a subtext wherein Austen and Sir Thomas converge", but rather used by Austen [...] "to argue the essential depravity of Sir Thomas's relations to other people". Fraiman argued that Austen used the issue of slavery to argue against the patriarchal power of an English gentleman over his family, his estate and [...] "by implication overseas". Fraiman argued that British imperialist discourse tended to depict the British empire as masculine and the colonies as feminine, which again to the conclusion that Said had merely inverted this discourse by making Austen a representative of the British empire while lionizing various male anti-colonial writers from Britain's colonies. Brian Southam in a 1995 essay argued that much discussed scene about the [...] "dead silence" [...] that follows Fanny Price's questions about the status of slaves in the Caribbean refers to teh moral decadence of those members of the British gentry who chosen {{to be involved in the}} abolitionist campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Trevor Lloyd in a 1999 article argued on the basis of the statements in the novel suggested that about 10% of the income from Mansfield Park come from the plantation in Antigua. John Wiltshire in a 2003 article argued that parallel between the condition of women in Britain and the treatment of slaves in the West Indies is to be understood as metaphoric as literal, and that Sir Thomas willingness to make a trip in the middle of a war to his plantation in Antigua, despite the well known perils of yellow fever and malaria in the Caribbean suggested he be understood as a good master. In Wiltshire's account, it is the slave trade, not slavery, that Austen condemns in Mansfield Park.|$|E
