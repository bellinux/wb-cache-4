This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. <b>Spiral</b> <b>point</b> <b>taps</b> are usually used in holes that go {{all the way through the}} material, so that the chips can escape. Another version of the <b>spiral</b> <b>point</b> plug <b>tap</b> is the spiral flute tap, whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill.

The results show that the proposed mechanism achieves fairness even when there are idle TAPs in the network. Index Terms — Fairness, game theory, selfish node, wireless backhaul networks. I...|$|R

30|$|Kepler and Elston’s {{simulation}} work [16] {{demonstrated that}} simple noisy genetic switch have rich bifurcation structures. Among them, bifurcations driven solely {{by changing the}} rate of operator fluctuations even as the underlying deterministic system remains unchanged. They find stochastic bistability where the deterministic equations predict monostability and vice versa. Ochab-Marcinek [20] investigated the stationary behavior of a nonlinear system, a reduced, deterministic Yildirim and Mackey [21] model of the gene regulatory system, and discovered the transition of a steady state induced by noise. A perturbed Gaussian white noise term {{was introduced in the}} deterministic model followed by numerical simulations. Turcotte et al. [22] studied noise-induced stabilization of an unstable state of a genetic switch that undergoes a variety of bifurcations in response to parameter changes. Their Monte Carlo simulations showed that near one such bifurcation, noise induces oscillations around an unstable <b>spiral</b> <b>point</b> and thus effectively stabilizes this unstable fixed point.|$|R

The small scale separation close to the trailing edge was reveled and this confirms the previous experimental observation.

By using vortex line method, the <b>spiral</b> <b>points</b> were understood as the cross-sections of the Ω-shaped vortices that follow {{the shape of the}} separation. The vortical structure was analogous to that in the wake region, where similar Ω-shaped vortex can be observed which follows the deficit region caused by the micro-ramp. Finally, the revealed flow topology was conceived beneficial to studying the wall bounded turbulence which involves similar vortical structures but in a smaller scale, while the vortical pattern in the current micro-ramp wake is larger...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{represent}} {{a new and}} promising paradigm that uses multi-hop communications to extend WiFi networks: By deploying only one hot spot (directly connected to the Internet) and several transient access <b>points</b> (<b>TAPs),</b> an Internet Service Provider (ISP) can extend its coverage and serve {{a large number of}} clients using a single broadband connection. Unfortunately, if the medium access protocol is poorly designed or inadequate, it can lead to severe unfairness and low bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a fair scheduling mechanism that optimizes the bandwidth utilization in the mesh network. Our solution assigns transmission rights to the links in the WMN and maximizes the spatial reuse (i. e., the possibility for links that do not contend to be activated at the same time). We show that our solution is fair and collision-free, and we evaluate its efficiency by means of simulations. ...|$|R
