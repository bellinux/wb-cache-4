5|$|The Ka-band {{subsystem}} {{was used}} for demonstration purposes. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32GHz Ka-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented Ka-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna <b>subnet.</b> During the cruise phase, spacecraft Ka-band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas. Ka-band tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the X-band high gain antenna to a single amplifier. If this amplifier fails all high-speed X-band communications will be lost. The Ka downlink is the only remaining backup for this functionality, and since the Ka-band capability {{of one of the}} SDST transponders has already failed, (and the other might have the same problem) JPL decided to halt all Ka-band demonstrations and hold the remaining capability in reserve.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} bits {{after the}} <b>subnet</b> bits {{are used for}} addressing hosts within the <b>subnet.</b> In the above example the <b>subnet</b> mask consists of 26 bits, leaving 6 bits for the host identifier. This allows for 62 host combinations (26−2).|$|E
25|$|The IETF {{originally}} discouraged {{the production}} {{use of these}} two subnets due to possible confusion of having a network and <b>subnet</b> with the same address.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the modular {{verification}} {{problem for a}} Petri net obtained by composition of two <b>subnets.</b> At first, we show how to transform an asynchronous composition into a synchronous one where the new <b>subnets</b> are augmented from the original ones by means of linear invariants. Then we introduce a non-constraining relation between <b>subnets</b> based on their behaviour. Whenever this relation is satisfied, standard properties like the liveness and the boundedness and generic properties specified by a linear time logic may be checked by examination of the augmented <b>subnets</b> in isolation. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for this relation which can be detected modularly using an efficient algorithm...|$|R
2500|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>subnetting</b> an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation {{architecture of the}} Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, {{it is necessary to}} allocate address space efficiently. <b>Subnetting</b> may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization. [...] <b>Subnets</b> may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.|$|R
25|$|The {{result of}} the bitwise AND {{operation}} of IP address and the <b>subnet</b> mask is the network prefix 192.168.5.0. The host part, which is 130, is derived by the bitwise AND operation of the address and the one's complement of the <b>subnet</b> mask.|$|E
25|$|The RFC 950 {{specification}} recommended reserving the <b>subnet</b> values {{consisting of}} all zeros (see above) and all ones (broadcast), {{reducing the number}} of available subnets by two. However, due to the inefficiencies introduced by this convention it was abandoned for use on the public Internet, and is only relevant when dealing with legacy equipment that does not implement CIDR. The only reason not to use the all-zeroes <b>subnet</b> is that it is ambiguous when the prefix length is not available. RFC 950 itself did not make the use of the zero <b>subnet</b> illegal; it was however considered best practice by engineers.|$|E
25|$|For IPv4, {{a network}} {{may also be}} {{characterized}} by its <b>subnet</b> mask, which is the bitmask that when applied by a bitwise AND operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. <b>Subnet</b> masks are also expressed in dot-decimal notation like an address. For example, 255.255.255.0 is the network mask for the 192.168.1.0/24 prefix.|$|E

25|$|Every net on X has a {{convergent}} <b>subnet</b> (see {{the article}} on nets for a proof).|$|E
25|$|The {{routing prefix}} of an address is {{identified}} by using another address, called the network mask or <b>subnet</b> mask, {{written in a}} form identical {{to that of the}} address itself. For example, the <b>subnet</b> mask for a routing prefix that is composed of the most-significant 18 bits of an IPv4 address is written as 11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000 in binary, or as 255.255.192.0 in decimal notation. This form of denoting the network mask, however, is only used for IPv4 networks.|$|E
25|$|While {{subnetting}} {{may improve}} network performance in an organizational network, it increases routing complexity, since each locally connected <b>subnet</b> must {{be represented by}} a separate entry in the routing tables of each connected router. However, by careful design of the network, routes to collections of more distant subnets within {{the branches of a}} tree-hierarchy can be aggregated by single routes. Variable-length <b>subnet</b> masking (VLSM) functionality in commercial routers made the introduction of CIDR seamless across the Internet and in enterprise networks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{modified}} star–ring architecture (MSRA) {{consisting of}} a star network on the upper level and many concatenated ring <b>subnets</b> on the lower level is proposed for subcarrier multiplexed passive optical network (SCM-PON). The upper level star network ensures high network capacity and its weakness in reliability is overcome by the concatenated ring <b>subnets</b> with self-healing ca-pabilities. The self-healing function can be performed at remote nodes (RNs) by using optical switches (OS) to reconfigure the ring <b>subnets</b> if any link fails. Moreover, we design the cascade add/drop transceiver (CAT) structure in the lower level ring <b>subnets</b> to com-pletely eliminate the optical beat interference (OBI) problem and achieve an OBI-free optical network. Finally, we set up an experi-mental network to demonstrate the feasibility of this cost-effective survivable structure.

40|$|Gradient factor {{centering}} {{is a new}} {{methodology for}} decomposing neural networks into biased and centered <b>subnets</b> which are then trained in parallel. The decomposition {{can be applied to}} any pattern-dependent factor in the network's gradient, and is designed such that the <b>subnets</b> are more amenable to optimization by gradient descent than the original network: biased <b>subnets</b> because of their simplified architecture, centered <b>subnets</b> due to a modified gradient that improves conditioning. The architectural and algorithmic modifications mandated by this approach include both familiar and novel elements, often in prescribed combinations. The framework suggests for instance that shortcut connections [...] - a well-known architectural feature [...] - should work best in conjunction with slope centering, a new technique described herein. Our benchmark experiments bear out this prediction, and show that factorcentering decomposition can speed up learning significantly without adversely affecting the train [...] ...|$|R

25|$|For example, {{the global}} IPv4 address 192.0.2.4 has the {{corresponding}} 6to4 prefix 2002:c000:0204::/48. This gives a prefix length of 48 bits, which leaves {{room for a}} 16-bit <b>subnet</b> field and 64 bit host addresses within the subnets.|$|E

25|$|Internet Protocol version 4 uses {{specially}} designated address formats {{to facilitate}} recognition of special address functionality. The {{first and the}} last <b>subnets</b> obtained by <b>subnetting</b> have traditionally had a special designation and, early on, special usage implications.

25|$|On {{starting}} a session, a workspace, which contains a presentation area, is displayed. A list of notes are also shown. A list of {{users in the}} local <b>subnet,</b> with whom a collaboration session can be started, are automatically detected by using the People Near Me functionality, based on WS-Discovery in the peer-to-peer networking implementation in Windows Vista. Users outside the local <b>subnet</b> must be sent an e-mail or file invitation to participate. Applications can be shared in the session, which will be local to that session only. When an application is shared, Windows Meeting Space switches into presentation mode so that participants can see what the presenter is working on and collaboratively edit or review the shared application instance.|$|E
25|$|WRI-WF-net can be {{built as}} {{composition}} of nets, i.e., replacing a transition within a WRI-WF-net with a <b>subnet</b> which is a WRI-WF-net. The result is also WRI-WF-net.

25|$|The all-zeros {{value and}} all-ones values are {{reserved}} for the network address and broadcast address respectively.

30|$|This module is only {{necessary}} in the WCE, at the wayside. It finds out to which MCE (and thus which train) a certain data traffic flow should be sent. Typically, this will be decided based on the destination IP address, as one or more <b>subnets</b> can be allocated to the onboard network of a train (see Section 6.1). Routing to those <b>subnets</b> is advertised {{to the outside world}} by the INT. When traffic destined for one of those <b>subnets</b> arrives at the INT's network, it is routed internally to the WCE. The Train Selector module will then look up to what train the destination IP address belongs to. For this end, the Train Selector contacts the Fleet Configuration database, which contains a mapping of onboard IP <b>subnets</b> to a train ID and the associated processing thread. Next, it allocates the traffic to the corresponding processing thread. Each module within the same processing thread is dedicated to a single train (and thus a single MCE).|$|R
