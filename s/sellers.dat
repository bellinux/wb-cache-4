5|$|<b>Sellers</b> {{became a}} close friend of Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, a {{photographer}} who was then married to Princess Margaret. Snowdon shared a love of women, photography, fine wine and fast cars with Sellers; both were also prone to bouts of depression. They spent many weekends together with their wives and went on several holidays on board Sellers's yacht Bobo in Sardinia. On 20 January 1965, <b>Sellers</b> and Ekland announced the birth of a daughter, Victoria. They moved to Rome in May to film After the Fox, an Anglo-Italian production in which they were both to appear. The film was directed by Vittorio De Sica, whose English <b>Sellers</b> struggled to understand. <b>Sellers</b> attempted to have De Sica fired, causing tensions on the set. <b>Sellers</b> also became unhappy with his wife's performance, straining their relationship and triggering open arguments during one of which <b>Sellers</b> threw a chair at Ekland. Despite these conflicts, the script was praised for its wit.|$|E

5|$|Born in Portsmouth, <b>Sellers</b> {{made his}} stage debut at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, {{when he was}} two weeks old.

He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in Ralph Reader's wartime Gang Show entertainment troupe, which toured Britain and the Far East. After the war, <b>Sellers</b> made his radio debut in ShowTime, and eventually became a regular performer on various BBC radio shows. During the early 1950s, <b>Sellers,</b> along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, took part in the successful radio series The Goon Show, which ended in 1960.|$|E

In 1954, <b>Sellers</b> was cast opposite Sid James, Tony Hancock, Raymond Huntley, Donald Pleasence and Eric Sykes in the British Lion Film Corporation comedy production, Orders Are Orders.

Before the release of that film, the Boultings, along with <b>Sellers</b> and Thomas in the cast, started filming I'm All Right Jack, which became the highest grossing film at the British box office in 1960. In preparation for his role as Fred Kite, <b>Sellers</b> watched footage of union officials.
