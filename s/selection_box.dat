50|$|The <b>selection</b> <b>box</b> is a boxed gift {{generally}} {{associated with}} Christmas. Although {{the history of}} selection boxes is relatively unknown, they were common around the late 19th and early 20th century Britain. Chocolatiers, Rowntree's and Cadbury pioneered the early selection boxes which were saved for {{by way of a}} Christmas club over many months, to be collected around Christmas time. Choice and variation of contents were the consumer's choice, and often the value of the <b>selection</b> <b>box</b> would exceed a week's wages. In more modern times the <b>selection</b> <b>box</b> as we know it has become a staple Christmas gift of chocolate. Each chocolate company mass produces these at Christmas time and they are often filling the spaces near supermarket checkouts. In the 60's and 70's the <b>selection</b> <b>box</b> took on a more commercialized approach with games printed on the reverse of the boxes such as snakes and ladders, adding to the desirability of each brand's <b>selection</b> <b>box</b> offering. Children expectantly received a <b>selection</b> <b>box</b> each year and regarded them as a main Christmas gift. More recently the commercial arms of the chocolate companies insist on filling their festive selection boxes with predefined chocolate bar selections, and many a child will receive in excess of six selection boxes each Christmas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} a {{possibility}} of evolutionary number of gate optimization in PLA circuits implemented in VLSI technology is presented. Multi-layer chromosomes and specialized genetic operators cooperating to them are introduced to proposed evolutionary algorithm.

Results obtained in optimization of gate number in <b>selection</b> <b>boxes</b> of DES cryptographic algorithm are compared to results obtained using SIS program with different optimization scripts such as: rugged, algebraic, and boolean. Proposed method allows to reduce the gates number in optimized circuit. Results obtained using described evolutionary method are better than using other methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Selection {{of colored}} nest boxes by wood ducks (Aix sponsa) was {{evaluated}} during the breeding seasons of 1967 - 68 in Benton County, Oregon. No color or site factor influence {{was observed in}} 1967 when nest boxes were erected in sets of eight boxes served in 1967 when nest boxes were erected in sets of eight boxes adjacent to water. Color and site factor influence was observed in 1968 when the nest boxes of a set were erected on a diagonal plane extending from water’s edge into the woods. Nest <b>box</b> <b>selection</b> by adult hens in 1968 was influenced by a strong fidelity to color of the box {{in which they had}} successfully nested in 1967. Nest <b>box</b> <b>selection</b> by yearling hens in 1968 was not influenced by color of the box in which it hatched but was related to an interaction of color and vegetational obstruction in the foreground of the box. Bright colors (white, yellow, orange and red) appeared to offset the adverse effects of vegetational obstruction on nest <b>box</b> <b>selection.</b> Nest <b>box</b> <b>selection</b> and inspection was found to be influenced by visibility of the entrance hole. No relationship was determined between the location of the first nest selected within a set and selection of subsequent nest boxes within the same set.

Used versus not used nest boxes was used as response variables and tested against multiple explanatory variables. Time of hatching also was used as response variable in 2007, where early arrivals were hypothesized to select the best nest boxes or the best habitats. Microhabitat analyses within a 0. 1 ha quadrate around the nest boxes and macrohabitat analyses outside this quadrate gave "general preference" over time, "year effect" preference and "early arrival" preference. Kestrels generally selected nest boxes in open, flat habitats such as bogs and falling areas where there were not too many competing pairs nearby. Differences in vole numbers between years resulted in year effect when voles were scarce. Kestrels selected nest boxes {{in close proximity to}} developed areas in 2005 when voles were scarce, probably because of higher density of alternative prey, such as birds, lizards and insects. Neither nest box size nor construction was important for nest <b>box</b> <b>selection,</b> but kestrels seemed to prefer boxes where the entrance hole was not too big. Some degree of cover around the nest box tree, measured as number of trees around the nest box, also seemed to matter. In addition, south facing nest boxes were selected earlier than others.
