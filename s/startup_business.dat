40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case study is to understand the impact of co-creation on a digital health <b>startup’s</b> <b>business</b> model {{in the context of}} healthcare. The research objective of the study is to examine the form of co-creation and business models within the two chosen digital health startups and specifically how co-creation progresses in them. The main research question is to examine how co-creation impacts a digital health <b>startup’s</b> <b>business</b> model. Theoretically, the impact of co-creation on a <b>startup’s</b> <b>business</b> model is evaluated through the features of co-creation and the nine elements of Business Model Canvas (BMC). The background of the review consists of the constant change of markets and customers’ needs as well as the context of healthcare. The aim of the study is to provide information about the central criteria of co-creation with which we can evaluate the impact of it on the digital health <b>startup’s</b> <b>business</b> model. The data will be collected through a semi-structured theme interview from the personnel of two chosen <b>startup</b> <b>businesses</b> (n= 4) and data will be analysed through content analysis. According to the findings of the research, co-creation is vital for startups in the context of digital healthcare. The biggest impact of co-creation is that it aids the startup to get into the hospital environment and helps it to understand the environment in which the services are used in. Getting into the hospital environment enables the companies to produce products that fit the customers’ needs, helps them to reach the target market and aids in selling the product, boosts their credibility and engages the customers. The findings point out that co-creation has a positive impact on the elements of BMC. The only element of BMC with a negative impact is revenue streams. In addition, the central criteria that can evaluate the impact of co-creation on a digital health <b>startup’s</b> <b>business</b> model was identified. The criteria showcased special features of a digital health startup. This study increases information regarding co-creation in the context of healthcare for different stakeholders involved. The findings can be used to increase the functionality of co-creation and when evaluating the impact of co-creation on a digital health <b>startup’s</b> <b>business</b> model...|$|R

2500|$|Startup {{companies}} {{can come in}} all forms and sizes. Some of the critical tasks are to build a co-founder team to secure key skills, know-how, financial resources, and other elements to conduct research on the target market. Typically, a startup will begin by building a first minimum viable product (MVP), a prototype, to validate, assess and develop the new ideas or business concepts. [...] In addition, startups founders do research to deepen {{their understanding of the}} ideas, technologies or business concepts and their commercial potential. A Shareholders' agreement (SHA) is often agreed early on to confirm the commitment, ownership and contributions of the founders and investors and to deal with the intellectual properties and assets that may be generated by the <b>startup.</b> <b>Business</b> models for startups are generally found via a [...] "bottom-up" [...] or [...] "top-down" [...] approach. A company may cease to be a startup as it passes various milestones, such as becoming publicly traded on the stock market in an Initial Public Offering (IPO), or ceasing to exist as an independent entity via a merger or acquisition. Companies may also fail and cease to operate altogether, an outcome that is very likely for startups, given that they are developing disruptive innovations which may not function as expected and for which there may not be market demand, even when the product or service is finally developed. Given that startups operate in high-risk sectors, it can also be hard to attract investors to support the product/service development or attract buyers.|$|E
