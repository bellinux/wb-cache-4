25|$|The {{overlapping}} {{categories of}} film and power capacitors are visible when they are applied as <b>snubber</b> capacitors in the growing market for high power electronics with IGBT’s and thyristors. Although the power capacitors use polypropylene film, like the smaller <b>snubber</b> film capacitors, they belong {{to the family of}} power capacitors, and are called “damping” capacitors.|$|E

25|$|The {{most popular}} simple <b>snubber</b> circuit {{consists}} {{out of a}} film capacitor and a resistor in series, connected in parallel with a semiconductor component to suppress or damp undesirable voltage spikes. The capacitor absorbs the inductive turn-off peak current temporarily, so that the resulting voltage spike is limited. But the trend in modern semiconductor technology is towards higher power applications, which increases the peak currents and switching speeds. In this case, the boundary between a standard electronic film capacitor and a power capacitor is blurred, so that larger <b>snubber</b> capacitors belong more {{in the area of}} power systems, electrical installations and plants.|$|E

25|$|When an {{inductive}} circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage {{across the open}} circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A <b>snubber</b> capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark {{may not be enough}} to damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. <b>Snubber</b> capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package.|$|E

Improvements included a single combined seat and parachute quick release fastener (QRF) and a <b>snubber</b> mechanism to allow crews to lean forward without loosening the harness. The first successful ejection using a Mk.4 seat took place in March 1957, the aircraft involved being a Fiat G.91.|$|E
2500|$|Snubbers are energy-absorbing {{circuits}} used {{to eliminate}} voltage spikes caused by circuit inductance when a switch opens. The {{purpose of the}} <b>snubber</b> is to improve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of switch contacts (such as an automotive ignition coil with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the voltage slew rate of semiconductor switches like thyristors, GTO thyristors, IGBTs and bipolar transistors. <b>Snubber</b> capacitors (or higher power [...] "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction. [...] These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the <b>snubber</b> RC circuitry fails, a power semiconductor will be destroyed in most cases.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotor blades}} are <b>snubbered.</b> 'Snubbers' are protuberances that stick out {{at right angles}} to the fan {{aerofoil}} at mid to 2/3 span.

2500|$|<b>Snubber</b> {{circuits}} usually incorporate film capacitors, mostly {{polypropylene film}} caps. The most important criteria for this application are a low self-inductance, low ESR, and very high peak current capability. The so-called [...] "snubber” capacitors sometimes have some additional special construction features. The self-inductance {{is reduced by}} slimmer designs with narrower width of the electrodes. By double-sided metallization or the film/foil construction of the electrodes, the ESR also can be reduced, increasing the peak current capability. Specially widened terminals which can be mounted directly beneath semiconductor packages can help to increase current handling and decrease inductance.|$|E
2500|$|For larger film {{capacitors}} {{with very}} high standards for stability and long lifetime, such as <b>snubber</b> capacitors, the metallization {{can be made}} with a special fault isolation pattern. In the picture on the right hand side, such a metallization formed into a “T” pattern is shown. [...] Each of these “T” patterns produces a deliberately narrowed cross-section in the conductive metallization. These restrictions work like microscopic fuses so that if a point-defect short-circuit between the electrodes occurs, the high current of the short only burns out the fuses around the fault. The affected sections are thus disconnected and isolated in a controlled manner, without any explosions surrounding a larger short-circuit arc. Therefore, the area affected is limited and the fault is gently controlled, significantly reducing internal damage to the capacitor, which can thus remain in service with only an infinitesimal reduction in capacitance.|$|E

5000|$|In {{refineries}} or plants snubbers {{are often}} used for vibration control. Snubbers come in two different variations: hydraulic <b>snubber</b> and a mechanical <b>snubber.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>snubber</b> is {{a mechanical}} device {{designed to protect}} components from excess shock or sway caused by seismic disturbances or other transient forces. During normal operating conditions, the <b>snubber</b> allows for movement in tension and compression. When an impulse event occurs, the <b>snubber</b> becomes activated and acts as a restraint device. The device becomes rigid, absorbs the dynamic energy, and transfers it to the supporting structure.|$|E
50|$|Unwanted turn-ons can {{be avoided}} by using a <b>snubber</b> circuit (usually of the resistor/capacitor or resistor/capacitor/inductor type) between MT1 and MT2. <b>Snubber</b> {{circuits}} are also used to prevent premature triggering, caused for example by voltage spikes in the mains supply.|$|E

A fast response peak voltage detector for fast output voltage control is also proposed.

Snubbers allow for free thermal movement of a component during regular conditions, but restrain the component in irregular conditions. A hydraulic <b>snubber</b> allows for pipe deflection under normal operating conditions. When subjected to an impulse load, the <b>snubber</b> becomes activated and acts as a restraint in order to restrict pipe movement. A mechanical <b>snubber</b> uses mechanical means to provide the restraint force.|$|E

5000|$|Mechanical Snubber: Whilst {{having the}} same {{application}} as the hydraulic <b>snubber,</b> retardation of the pipe is due to centrifugal braking within the <b>snubber.</b> A split flywheel is made to rotate at high velocity causing steel balls to be forced radially outwards. The flywheel is forced apart by the steel balls causing braking plates to come together thus retarding the axial displacement of the <b>snubber.</b> Rotation of the flywheel is generated by the linear displacement of the main rod acting on a ball-screw or similar device. It is also very expensive.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering) Switching {{losses in}} power {{electronic}} converters {{can be reduced}} by using <b>snubbers,</b> or resonant circuits. Simple <b>snubbers</b> can be implemented without much effort, but then energy is still dissipated, which reduces {{the efficiency of the}} converter. Regenerative <b>snubbers</b> are known, but these usually require complicated additional circuits. The use of nonlinear capacitors as turn-off <b>snubbers</b> has been investigated, and proved profitable. The main reason for this is the much smaller amount of energy which is stored in the the nonlinear capacitors, compared to linear capacitors. Resonant circuits reduce switching losses by allowing switchings to occur when the voltage across the switching device, or the current through the switching device is zero. This effect is called soft-switching and to obtain this, resonance between an inductor and capacitor is usually involved. Resonant circuits have the disadvantage that the installed switching power cannot be used optimally. This drawback has been reduced by using a saturable inductor in the resonant circuit. This thesis considers the use of both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors in a resonant phase arm. It was found that the nonlinear resonant elements lead to very low overdimensioning of the switching devices, and minimal switching losses in such a phase arm. Very few additional components are used, which keeps the cost of the converter down. A 1. 5 kW converter was constructed in which the double nonlinear resonant phase arm was implemented. This converter was investigated both experimentaly, and by means of computer simulations. The converter is also compared with {{the current state of the}} art. It is concluded that resonant phase arms with both. nonlinear inductors and nonlinear capacitors can function effectively in power electronic converters. Some important advantages are also assosiated with the use of the double nonlinear resonant circuit...|$|R
