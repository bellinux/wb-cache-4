5|$|After half an {{hour the}} Russians finally <b>stormed</b> <b>the</b> ramparts of Fort 74 and {{defeated}} the Polish battalion defending it. This forced the Polish mobile artillery in Czyste, until then shelling the advancing Russian columns and their Grand Battery, to fall back. Meanwhile, the Russian right column was approaching Fort 72. Defended by only 200 men, the fort was approached by the Russian spearhead formed by the reinforced Nieśwież Regiment. Seeing this, the Polish commander ordered his cavalry reserve to charge the Russian infantry. Russian grenadiers <b>stormed</b> <b>the</b> ramparts of Fort 72, but were repelled and forced back behind the moat, where the Polish cavalry charged them. The Russians formed infantry squares, but were defeated and forced to retreat. To counter the threat to Russian infantry, General Nostitz charged his own cavalry reserve under General Georg von Sass, and a cavalry battle ensued.|$|E

5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{principles of}} Buys Ballot's law state that for anyone ashore in the Northern Hemisphere {{and in the}} path of a hurricane, the most dangerous place to be is in the right front quadrant of <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> There, <b>the</b> observed wind speed of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> is <b>the</b> sum of the speed of wind in <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> circulation plus <b>the</b> velocity of <b>the</b> <b>storms</b> forward movement. Buys Ballot's Law calls this the [...] "Dangerous Quadrant". Likewise, in the left front quadrant of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>the</b> observed wind is the difference between <b>the</b> <b>storm's</b> wind velocity and its forward speed. This is called the [...] "Safe Quadrant" [...] due to the lower observed wind speeds.|$|R

5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} {{communist government}} agreed {{to close its}} border with East Germany to choke off the exodus.

Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the Chadian army logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability.
