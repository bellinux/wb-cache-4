40|$|The free {{vibration}} {{problem of a}} <b>stepped</b> <b>plate</b> supported on non-homogeneous Winkler elastic foundation with elastically mounted masses is formulated based on Hamilton's principle. The <b>stepped</b> <b>plate</b> is modelled by finite strip method. To overcome the problem of excessive continuity of common beam vibration functions {{at the location of}} abrupt change of plate thickness, a set of C 1 continuous functions have been chosen as the longitudinal interpolation functions in the finite strip analysis. The C 1 continuous functions are obtained by augmenting the relevant beam vibration modes with piecewise cubic polynomials. As these displacement functions are built up from beam vibration modes with appropriate corrections, they possess both the advantages of fast convergence of harmonic functions as well as the appropriate order of continuity. The method is further extended to the buckling analysis of rectangular <b>stepped</b> <b>plates.</b> Numerical results also show that the method is versatile, efficient and accurate. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Radially and azimuthally {{polarized}} beams have {{applications in}} laser technology, such as material processing and microscopy. Radially and azimuthally polarized beams {{have been produced}} using liquid crystal polarization converters created through the photoalignment of a coumarin-based photopolymer. In devices assembled with two substrates and nematic liquid crystals in the intersubstrate gap, the nematic liquid crystal molecules align along dimers produced by photoalignment at the surface of each substrate. Radial alignment is achieved by inducing a radial dimerization on one substrate by rotation of the polarization during UV exposure. A defect {{in the way the}} liquid crystals align themselves alters the final polarization state by 180 ° across the disclination line. A π phase <b>step</b> <b>plate</b> compensates for this defect, producing useful radially and azimuthally polarized fields.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{vibrational}} characteristics of thin, mass-loaded, <b>stepped</b> <b>plates</b> are investigated. The {{dimensions of the}} plates are chosen so that the steps {{can be thought of}} as representing the periodically placed stiffeners commonly found in many engineering structures. To achieve this, a classical analytical approach for the analysis of the vibration of a simply supported, <b>stepped</b> <b>plate</b> is first considered. Next, a method for the analysis of such plates carrying concentrated masses is reviewed. The above two analytical methods are then combined to analyse the vibrational behaviour of thin, simply supported and mass-loaded <b>stepped</b> <b>plates.</b> To assess the accuracy of these methods, the resultant frequency responses of the unloaded plate are compared with the Dynamic Stiffness method [1] and those for both the unloaded and mass loaded plates with finite element calculations. For a uniform, mass-loaded plate, there is perfect agreement between the frequency responses obtained from these methods. For the mass-loaded, <b>stepped</b> <b>plate,</b> the agreement is not so complete, the reasons for which are discussed in the paper. The final part of the paper deals with optimisation of the mass positions in order to improve the vibrational behaviour of the plate. In this work, the integral of the frequency response function of the mass-loaded plate over a frequency range containing some 10 – 15 natural frequencies is regarded as the objective function. The drive and response points are chosen to lie at opposite ends of a plate with high aspect ratio and transverse stiffeners, so that minimizing the frequency response is equivalent to designing vibration isolation characteristics into the plate. The Genetic Algorithm, which is an evolutionary optimization method, is employed to produce the required designs. It is demonstrated that the optimized mass positions significantly improve the vibrational behaviour of the plate...|$|R
