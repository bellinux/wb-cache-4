40|$|Abstract—Spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} functional {{unit of the}} cognitive radio networks. The spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the main}} challenges encountered by cognitive radio. This paper presents a survey of spectrum sensing techniques and they are studied from a cognitive radio perspective. The challenges that go with spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>are</b> reviewed. Two <b>sensing</b> schemes, namely; cooperative sensing and eigenvalue-based <b>sensing</b> <b>are</b> studied. The various advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. Based on this study, the cooperative spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> proposed for employment in spectrum sensing in wideband based cognitive radio systems...|$|R

5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common <b>Sense</b> <b>was</b> {{published in}} January 1776, {{just as it}} became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no new ideas and probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was nine}} years old Monteux was {{admitted}} to the Conservatoire de Paris. He studied the violin with Jules Garcin and Henri Berthelier, composition with Charles Lenepveu, and harmony and theory with Albert Lavignac. His fellow violin students included George Enescu, Carl Flesch, Fritz Kreisler and Jacques Thibaud. Among the piano students at the Conservatoire was Alfred Cortot, with whom he developed a lifelong friendship. At the age of twelve, Monteux organised and conducted a small orchestra of Conservatoire students to accompany Cortot in performances of concertos in and around Paris. He attended the world premiere of César Franck's Symphony in February 1889. From 1889 to 1892, while still a student, he played in the orchestra of the Folies Bergère; he later said to George Gershwin that his rhythmic <b>sense</b> <b>was</b> formed during the experience of playing popular dance music there.|$|E

An archaic word or <b>sense</b> <b>is</b> one {{that still has}} some current use but whose use has dwindled to a few specialized contexts, outside which it connotes old-fashioned language. In contrast, an obsolete word or <b>sense</b> <b>is</b> one {{that is no longer}} used at all. A reader encounters them when reading texts that are centuries old. For example, the works of Shakespeare are old enough that some obsolete words or <b>senses</b> <b>are</b> encountered therein, for which glosses (annotations) are often provided in the margins.|$|R

30|$|As {{discussed}} before, spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} important functions for the CWNs to obtain the available opportunistic spectrum bands. From the Table 1, we can observe that most of the existing protocols only allow each SU to use its local spectrum sensing to derive spectrum opportunities. Although only utilizing local sensing can simplify the protocol architecture, it can also lead to some problems, such as sensing errors and hidden PU problem. Cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> an efficient method to solve these problems. In DCR-MAC [21], the cooperative <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> used for solving the hidden PU problem. In CSS-RA [54], <b>sensing</b> errors <b>are</b> reduced by cooperative sensing.

Paine's great contribution was in initiating a public debate about independence which had previously been rather muted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cooperative {{wide-band}} spectrum <b>sensing</b> has <b>been</b> {{considered to}} enable cognitive radio operation of wireless regional area networks (WRAN) in the UHF and VHF TV broadcasting bands. In this paper, cooperative compressed spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>is</b> considered to enable fast sensing of the wide-band spectrum. The speed {{and accuracy of}} spectrum <b>sensing</b> <b>are</b> improved by further optimization of the compressed <b>sensing</b> receiver, which <b>is</b> done blindly without any prior knowledge of the sensed signal. Enhanced compressed spectrum <b>sensing</b> algorithms <b>are</b> proposed for the cases of individual spectrum sensing and cooperative spectrum sensing. The cooperative signal reconstruction process is modified to optimally combine the received measurements at the fusion center. A low complexity authentication mechanism, which is inherent to cooperative compressed spectrum <b>sensing,</b> <b>is</b> proposed to make the cognitive radio system immune to adversary attacks. 1...|$|R

Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII.
