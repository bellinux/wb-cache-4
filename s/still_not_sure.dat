25|$|People with OCD can use rationalizations {{to explain}} their {{behavior}}; however, these rationalizations {{do not apply to}} the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> and deems it is still better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{technology}} {{continued to}} present difficulties: in particular, animating hair {{turned out to}} be a challenge. Senior software engineer Kelly Ward spent six years writing programs to make it move the way they wanted. As late as January 2010, the directors were <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if the Rapunzel character's length of hair was going to work. These problems were finally solved in March: An improved version of a hair simulation program named Dynamic Wires, originally developed for Bolt, was eventually used. To make hair float believably in water, and to surmount other similar challenges, discrete differential geometry was used to produce the desired effects, freeing the animators from executing these specific tasks directly, which would have taken days instead of minutes.|$|E
500|$|In {{a seminar}} given in November 2014, Justice Elena Kagan {{expressed}} her {{thoughts on the}} decision in this case, noting that for herself, she faced a difficult decision between what she felt was right – allowing parents to decide what their children should watch and play – and what {{the state of the}} law was, and in hindsight, was <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if they made the right decision. She noted that she along with four others on the [...] court effectively added language to the decision that would preempt any future laws that attempted to restrict game sales.|$|E

500|$|Reception of the preview {{release of}} RT 8.1 was mixed; both ExtremeTech and TechRadar praised the {{improvements}} to the operating system's tablet-oriented interface, along {{with the addition of}} Outlook; TechRadars Dan Grabham believed that the inclusion of Outlook was important because [...] "nobody {{in their right mind would}} try and handle work email inside the standard Mail app—it's just not up to the task." [...] However, both experienced performance issues running the beta on the Tegra 3-based Surface; ExtremeTech concluded that [...] "as it stands, we’re <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> why you would ever opt to buy a Windows RT tablet when there are similarly priced Atom-powered x86 devices that run the full version of Windows 8." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly laudatory {{reviews from}} television critics, particularly for its unusual {{departure from the}} standard Mad Men episode structure and {{is considered to be}} one of the best in the series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix exalted the episode and the [...] "more formally experimental" [...] season, admitting, [...] "I'm <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> I understood 100% of it. But I know I liked it. A lot." [...] Sepinwall characterized [...] "Far Away Places" [...] as [...] "an episode that gave the feel of dropping acid even when everyone on camera was stone sober. Matt Weiner, co-writer Semi Chellas, director Scott Hornbacher, and the actors combined to give us some of the most memorable moments the show has ever done." [...] Todd VanderWerff of The A.V. Club gave it an A grade, compared it to previous [...] "structurally daring" [...] episodes like [...] "Seven Twenty Three" [...] and [...] "The Jet Set", and praised the director for the [...] "beautifully shot" [...] episode and the [...] "gorgeous image of [...] and Jane lying, heads touching, on the floor, admitting their marriage just isn’t working", while noting that the enemy of the season is [...] "the passage of time itself".|$|E

2500|$|Years later Morrall said, [...] "I {{thought we}} would win handily. We'd only lost twice in our last 30 games. I'm <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> what {{happened}} that day at the Orange Bowl, however; it's still hard to account for." [...] Wrote Matt Snell, [...] "The most distinct image I have from that whole game is of Ordell Braase and some other guys—not so much Mike Curtis--having a bewildered look." ...|$|E
2500|$|Birkin said in 2004 that, [...] "It wasn't a rude song at all. I don't {{know what}} all the fuss was about. The English just didn't {{understand}} it. I'm <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> they know what it means." [...] When Gainsbourg went to Jamaica to record with Sly and Robbie, they initially did not get on well. They said [...] "We know just one piece of French music, a song called Je t'aime… Moi Non Plus, which has a girl groaning in it." [...] Gainsbourg said [...] "It's me", and their mood changed immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Concerning the band's line-up, Scott Hutchison {{noted in}} 2008: [...] "The initial lineup in Frightened Rabbit was just myself. I had really only been messing with my 4 track for about 6 months before I started playing some shows on my own. Some {{of the songs}} still didn't have words and I was mostly just mumbling {{nonsense}} half the time. Grant joined a year later, making the outfit much noisier. Billy came along about 6 months after this and actually made it a bit less noisy. He's very calming like that is Billy. Andy {{has been in the}} band since January, and adds all the extra details we were missing before. <b>Still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if we're finished gathering members".|$|E

2500|$|Denver Post {{contributor}} Joanne Ostrow {{declared the}} protagonist of the series a [...] "female answer to SpongeBob SquarePants". Among the favorable reception was a mixed review from Common Sense Medias Emily Ashby. She said while it [...] "maintains a chaotic pace, {{and there are no}} real attempts to teach strong positive lessons [...] Young tweens will likely enjoy Bessie's outlandish, fantasy-fueled adventures– which are fast-paced and, on the surface, entertaining." [...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone called The Mighty B! a show that he admires more than what he [...] "truly love", stating: [...] "There is prodigious talent behind it and its wonderfully energetic, boisterous comedy. It's clearly trying very, very hard to be entertaining and largely succeeds [...] I almost feel bad for not liking The Mighty B! more than I do, and I'm <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> why I don't enjoy it more". He noted it was worth pointing out that more recent episodes of the show seem [...] "more assured and funnier" [...] than the eight episodes on the We Got the Bee DVD.|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} was 'Pendennis' I began with, and I lived in the book to the very last line of it, and made its alien {{circumstance}} mine to the smallest detail.

6000|$|He hesitated, and Jimmy {{made a quick}} sign of comprehension. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "I know. <b>Still,</b> I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> {{that anybody}} could blame him, under the circumstances.

6000|$|... “Yes,” said Nettie, “I {{quite often}} do. I’m {{not in the}} least afraid, like you, of being thought sentimental. In fact, we are fond of telling people what we think in my country. <b>Still,</b> I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> about those limitations.

6000|$|He {{gave her}} a curious, intent look, in which she read sympathy.

6000|$|Saxton, who {{appeared}} reflective, quite {{failed to notice}} {{the irony of the}} inquiry.

60|$|Festing {{felt that}} he must do Sadie justice.

6000|$|He paused when Festing {{looked at}} him with surprise, but resumed in a {{thoughtful}} voice: [...] "When your job's in front of you, you see what must be done, and do it well; there's not a man on my section does that kind of thing better. <b>Still,</b> I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> you always see quite far enough.
