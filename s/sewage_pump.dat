Poisonous gases, such as methane and hydrogen sulfide, can accumulate in the wet well; an ill-equipped person entering the well would be overcome by fumes very quickly.

Bike lanes, bike racks and directional signage were installed to better direct tourists and connect the town with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. A new permit process was set up with the Washington County, Maryland permit office, building code enforcement and heavy truck traffic were addressed. Events were coordinated that emphasized revitalization and the downtown merchants. Additionally local youth were honored for community involvement, events were coordinated for town youth and a Boys and Girls Club was created. The changes increased business in Williamsport.

By Means of Fluent 6. 3 ， {{the paper}} {{simulated}} the solid-liquid two-phase flow to {{a type of}} centrifugal sewerage pump under different sand size and contain arenaceous concentration conditions, using Eulerian Mixture Model, adopting SIMPLE algorithm, k-ε-Ap turbulence model and partitioning non-structure hex grid {{in the area of}} flow passage in the pump. The paper analyzed wear characteristics in different parts of centrifugal <b>sewage</b> <b>pump</b> impeller and put forward some means to decrease attrition for impeller. The results can be as theoretical reference for the optimization design of the centrifugal sewage pumps Introduce The centrifugal <b>sewage</b> <b>pump</b> is a type of pump with fewer blades and better non-block performance. It is applicable to transport fluid that will not corrode with solid particles below 80 °c. In work process, solid particles can cause wear inevitably to pump flow components. The attrition influenced normal work of <b>sewage</b> <b>pump</b> and good operating performance of system. For solving the problems of attrition, significant amount of research has been done in different angle from tribological theory, materials, hydraulic design and so on. The most of study is based on the test method [1, 2]. But these methods expend manpower and wealth of larger, and the cycle is long. Along with the development of fluid dynamics research, it is feasible and has obvious advantages to adopt simulation study with the CFD simulation software for attrition of <b>sewage</b> <b>pump.</b> Model parameter of centrifugal <b>sewage</b> <b>pump</b> The paper took type of 50 W 15 centrifugal sewage pumps as research object for simulation.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} achieve the high passing capacity, high {{efficiency}} and non-overload performance of a <b>sewage</b> <b>pump,</b> the type of WQS 120 - 60 - 45 <b>sewage</b> <b>pump</b> is selected as an example to be researched. The theory analyses and numerical simulation were conducted on the internal two-phase flow of the pump. The distribution of the solid particles in impeller is observed, {{and the influence of}} impeller outlet angle on pump efficiency and the ability of solid particles passing through is analyzed. The results showed that the solid particles concentrated on pressure surface of impeller. When impeller outlet angle was higher, local medium energy lost seriously. With the angle decreasing, the blade was more suitable for the flow of the solid particles, which has improved the impeller wearing and increased efficiency. This study can provide a certain reference for optimization design of <b>sewage</b> <b>pump</b> impeller...|$|E

The pump station has two levels, with this being the top floor. The level below houses the pumps and wet well. The staff gauge is visible on the wall behind the employee that measures the water level in the wet well. Other details shown in the photo include the glass oilers at the base of each pump motor and the tool board (with pipe wrench and pliers) to the right of the pump motors.
