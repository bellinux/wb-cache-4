5|$|The {{most common}} types of glass fiber used in {{fiberglass}} is E-glass, which is alumino-borosilicate glass {{with less than}} 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics.

50|$|Silicates: <b>Silicates</b> {{are another}} small {{molecular}} compound ranging from premium lithium <b>silicates</b> to economical sodium <b>silicates.</b> Chemically, <b>silicates</b> form calcium-silicate hydrate crystals which can densify concrete surfaces and be burnished {{to develop a}} polished appearance. <b>Silicates</b> {{are known to be}} hydrophobic and oleophobic and will only wear away if the concrete surface itself wears away. Noted for crystallization, <b>silicates</b> are frequently used for polishing concrete floors popular in large format retail outlets. <b>Silicates</b> can be applied to new and existing concrete, although they do not comply with ASTM C309 as a curing agent.|$|R

5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10âˆ’3 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and <b>silicate</b> dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of <b>silicate</b> grains that lack volatiles.|$|E
