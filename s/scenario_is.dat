5|$|Ferguson's {{depression}} returns again, when Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs {{her that}} she has an infection that requires surgery. She rejects the surgery, and is further disappointed when Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her that the worst-case <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> that she will need an ostomy pouching system. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} coronation, Mindaugas {{transferred}} some lands to the Livonian Order – portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava—although his control over these western lands was tenuous. There {{has been much}} discussion among historians as to whether in later years (1255–1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order. The deeds might have been falsified by the order; the case for this <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> bolstered {{by the fact that}} some of the documents mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses and seals.|$|E
5|$|In Rewrite Harvest festa!, {{there are}} six {{separate}} scenarios, one for each heroine. The player is initially given the choice to play the scenarios for Kotori, Chihaya and Lucia from a character selection screen. Once these three scenarios are completed, the routes for Sizuru and Akane become available, and after those two are completed, Kagari's <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> made available. After the completion of Kagari's scenario, a dungeon exploration role-playing minigame called Rewrite Quest becomes available.|$|E

5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> rare.|$|E
5|$|Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru is {{the fourth}} visual novel {{developed}} by Caramel Box.

5|$|Radical Dreamers {{features}} minimal {{graphics and}} animation; most areas are rendered with dim, static backgrounds. The game also uses atmospheric music and sounds. Like other Chrono games, Radical Dreamers contains {{a variant of}} New Game + mode. Only one <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> available on the first play-through; after finishing it and obtaining one of three possible endings, players can explore six others. These later stories often feature comical situations or allusions to Chrono Trigger.|$|E

30|$|The general <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> used to {{test the}} {{robustness}} of the developments in the micro-futures (‘The maritime economic functions in the four general scenarios’). The general <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> presented during the expert meeting and the stakeholder meetings that were organised in the project. Their use during these meetings was not evaluated explicitly. The authors’ tentative conclusion is that, for policy makers, the incorporation of uncertainty (as represented by the general <b>scenarios)</b> <b>is</b> more difficult than the incorporation of ambition (as represented by the micro-futures). As a consequence, the impact of the general <b>scenarios</b> <b>is</b> not as visible as that of the micro-futures.|$|R

5|$|The game {{features}} four scenarios {{including the}} prologue. The actions during the prologue determine {{who will be}} the central character in the story, either Jennifer Simpson or Helen Maxwell. The scenarios and player characters that follow are determined by the player's actions. There are five different endings per heroine depending on how the scenarios progress. After each <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> a save screen and an intermission mode that allows the player to explore without the threat of Scissorman. During the intermission, the player can have conversations with various characters. The next scenario will begin after the required conditions of the intermission are met.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} and {{an adaptation of}} Washington Irving's story of Rip Van Winkle. The stage adaptation was well-known and the adaptation would be compared to Joseph Jefferson's portrayal on the stage. The writer of the <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The adaptation differs from the original in some ways, including that Winkle's cantankerous wife has remarried instead of died.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> {{adapted from}} James Oliver Curwood's short {{story of the}} same name. The writer of the <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an {{experienced}} newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Sometimes the directional credit is given to Theodore Marston. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions.|$|E
30|$|When {{the system}} is trained on video {{recordings}} acquired in controlled scenarios and tested on the ones acquired in random scenarios, we also observe an improvement of up to 6 % compared to the tests where the samples collected in random <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> used for training and the ones collected in controlled <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> employed for testing and only a 2 % decrease compared to the case where video recordings acquired in controlled <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> used for both training and testing. This shows that the frontal face recordings acquired when a specific emotion was induced add more value in the testing phase. This is a significant finding if we consider this system’s applicability for real-time applications where the testing is done ad hoc, as {{it shows that the}} controlled <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> only necessary for the training stage and, once {{the system is}} trained, it will return satisfactory results in random situations. The fact that, when video recordings collected in both controlled and random <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> used together for testing and training, the prediction accuracy only reduces by 1 % compared to when the samples acquired in the controlled <b>scenario</b> <b>are</b> used for training, and the ones collected in random <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> used for testing also sustains this finding.|$|R

30|$|We {{construct}} {{three possible}} scenarios {{for the future}} relationship between media and politics in Iran according {{to the findings of}} the discourse/worldview layer. Through the discourse <b>scenarios,</b> we <b>are</b> capable of understanding the general and fundamental differences of various alternative scenarios in the long-term future. Moreover, we believe that discourse-based <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> relatively general and macro-level scenarios by which different audiences and interest groups can grasp the future’s conditions of media and politics in Iran and conduct their policy plans through this understanding. While litany <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> more useful for managers and social cause <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> more beneficial for policy makers, discourse <b>scenarios</b> <b>are</b> constructed in a more academic manner and they are beneficial for grasping the long-term futures’ alternatives.|$|R

5|$|Collisions of solitary stars {{within the}} Milky Way occur {{only once every}} -; far less {{frequently}} than the appearance of novae. Collisions occur with greater frequency in the dense core regions of globular clusters (cf. blue stragglers). A likely <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> a collision with a binary star system, or between two binary systems containing white dwarfs. This collision can leave behind a close binary system of two white dwarfs. Their orbit decays and they merge through their shared envelope. However, a study based on SDSS spectra found 15 double systems of the 4,000 white dwarfs tested, implying a double white dwarf merger every 100 years in the Milky Way. Conveniently, this rate matches the number of Type Ia supernovae detected in our neighborhood.|$|E

40|$|A {{statistical}} downscaling methodology {{was implemented}} to generate daily time series of temperature and rainfall for point locations within a catchment, {{based on the}} output from general circulation models. The rainfall <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> constructed by a two-stage process. First, for a single station, a conditional first-order Markov chain was used to generate wet and dry day successions. Then, the multisite <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> constructed by sampling from a benchmark file containing a daily time series of multiple-site observations, classified by season, circulation weather type, and whether the day is wet or dry at the reference station. The temperature <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> constructed using deterministic transfer functions initialized by free atmosphere variables. The relationship between the temperature and rainfall <b>scenarios</b> <b>is</b> established in two ways. First, sea level pressure fields define the circulation weather types underpinning the rainfall <b>scenarios</b> and <b>are</b> used to construct predictor variables in the temperature scenarios. Second, separate temperature transfer functions are developed for wet and dry days. The methods were evaluated in two Mediterranean catchments. The rainfall <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> always too dry, despite the application of Monte Carlo techniques {{in an attempt to}} overcome the problem. The temperature <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> generally too cool. The <b>scenarios</b> <b>were</b> used to explore the occurrence of extreme events, and the changes predicted in response to climate change, taking the example of temperature. The nonlinear relationship between changes in the mean and changes at the extremes was clearly demonstrated. 1...|$|R
5|$|In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult {{elements}} {{were added to}} the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. Ecstasy extends the story for the scenarios of the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include scenarios for Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa—two supporting characters from Little Busters!—and a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in Ecstasy. The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after the Refrain <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, Ecstasy features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating a labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{both the}} highest and lowest judges' scores are omitted to cancel out any discrepancy, giving a maximum of 60 style points. A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a <b>scenario</b> <b>is</b> only an example and not representative of the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump {{can be expected to}} receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5. While a lower score for style puts an athlete at the risk of being less competitive, this may be mitigated or even nullified if they have attained substantial bonus points for distance.|$|E
5|$|The 1852 {{publication}} of Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe was the best-selling {{novel of the}} 19th century and the second best-selling book of that century, following the Bible.
