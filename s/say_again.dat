I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} began recording the final 30 minutes of Flight93 at 09:31:57. At this moment, it recorded Jarrah announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen: here the captain. Please sit down, keep remaining seating. We have a bomb on board. So sit." [...] The controller understood the transmission, but chose to respond, [...] "Calling Cleveland center, you're unreadable. <b>Say</b> <b>again,</b> slowly." [...] The cockpit recording captured Dahl moaning and Jarrah telling him in English {{to sit down and}} to stop touching something (presumably the controls); Jason Dahl's wife, Sandy Dahl, listening to the cockpit {{voice recorder}}, determined that Jarrah [...] "was fussing at my husband...he was speaking in English, and he spoke Arabic anytime he was talking with the other hijackers.

500|$|Feminism {{academic}} Camille Paglia {{said that}} she used to be transfixed by this [...] "temperamental diva bitch", due to the contrast with the ideal of womanhood that she had been presented to as a child: [...] "Mary, this silent mother; and here was the witch queen who has this weird dialogue in the mirror and it didn't have to be charitable and it didn't have to be nice. I thought she was fabulous." [...] Likewise, Lana Parrilla, who later herself played the Evil Queen in Once Upon A Time, said that whenever she watched Disney's Snow White as a young girl she rooted for and [...] "loved the evil queen―every time the evil queen came on, I was like 'OK!' She was just so fascinating to me." [...] Author Deborah Lipp wrote: [...] "As I've said before and will doubtless <b>say</b> <b>again,</b> given a choice of being Snow White (helpless, sweet, voiceless) and the Wicked Queen, with the cool castle and the magic and the minions, give me my Magic Mirror now!" [...] Film director John Waters said he too rooted for the evil queen to win, and Chay Yew said that if he were a Disney character, he would be the evil queen from Snow White.|$|E

Adalgisa pleads for help and forgiveness, and Norma pledges that she will do that and will also free her from her vows as a priestess: (Norma: Ah! sì, fa core, abbracciami, Perdono e ti compiango / [...] "Yes, take heart, embrace me.

500|$|Because Never <b>Say</b> Never <b>Again</b> {{is not an}} Eon-produced film, it has {{not been}} {{included}} in a number of subsequent reviews. Norman Wilner of MSN said that 1967's Casino Royale and Never <b>Say</b> Never <b>Again</b> [...] "exist outside the 'official' continuity, [...] are excluded from this list, just as they're absent from MGM's megabox. But take my word for it; they're both pretty awful". Of the more recent reviews, opinion on Never <b>Say</b> Never <b>Again</b> is still mixed: film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with a 63% rating from 46 reviews. The score is still more positive than some of the Eon films, with Rotten Tomatoes ranking Never <b>Say</b> Never <b>Again</b> 16th among all Bond films in 2008. Empire gives the film three of a possible five stars, observing that [...] "Connery was perhaps wise to call it quits the first time round". IGN gave Never <b>Say</b> Never <b>Again</b> a score of 5 out of 10, claiming that the film [...] "is more miss than hit". The review also thought that the film was [...] "marred with too many clunky exposition scenes and not enough moments of Bond being Bond".|$|R
