25|$|The tsunami raced {{down the}} U.S. West Coast with more deaths and destruction, but no {{location}} was hit as hard. Crescent City bore the brunt, {{due to its}} offshore geography, position relative to the earthquake’s <b>strike-line,</b> underwater contours such as the Cobb Seamount, and the position of rivers near the city. Although houses, buildings, and infrastructure were later rebuilt, years passed before the city recovered from the devastation to lives, property, and its economy. Since the 1980s the breakwater has been protected from normal storm waves by hundreds of Dolos armor units, 38 ton concrete shapes.|$|E
40|$|Lower Hybrid Wave (LHW) heating {{experiments}} at the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) show a {{wide range}} of similarities to effects known from applied Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) by in-vessel or external magnetic perturbation coils: (a) <b>strike-line</b> splitting, seen on the outer divertor plates, (b) mitigation or suppression of Edge Localized Modes (ELMs), and (c) existence of a non-axisymmetric perturbation, measured via pick-up coils. Likewise, helical radiation belts appear in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL), which become well pronounced with additional helium puffing. These observations suggest a current flow understood to be along SOL field lines, located in the region where the helical radiation belts appear; here called Helical Current Filaments (HCFs). Such HCFs can be induced by LHW power deposition near the plasma edge. Particularly, the effect of the LHW-induced HCFs on ELMs is of high interest for the fusion community since such a technique could be an alternative to in-vessel magnetic perturbation coils, which may not be suitable for future power plants. For {{a better understanding of the}} experimental observations, a model to incorporate the magnetic perturbation of HCFs in the magnetic topology has been developed. Modelled SOL field lines, starting in front of the LHW antenna, show agreement in position and pitch-angle to the experimentally observed radiation belts. The comparison of the pick-up coil signals and the modelled HCFs' perturbation allows for determination of the current strength depending on the filaments' distance to the plasma edge. Agreement of predicted footprint structures and experimental observed heat load and particle flux profiles at different toroidal angles in the divertor region isfound. Based on the modelling results, the idea of LHW-induced RMPs, originating from the experimental observations, is strongly supported...|$|E
40|$|Tungsten (W) {{will be used}} as {{material}} for plasma-facing components (PFCs) in the divertor of ITER and interact with Helium (He) ions either from initial He plasma operation or from Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fusion reactions in the active operation phase. Laboratory experiments reported that in a specific operational window of impact energy, ion fluence, and surface temperature (Ein ≥ 20  eV, ϕ ≥ 1 × 1024  He+mBt= 2. 5 T,Ip= 0. 8 MA,Paux≃ 8. 0 MW Tsurf ≥ 1000  K) a modification of W surfaces occurs resulting in the formation of He-induced W nanostructures. Experiments in ASDEX Upgrade H-mode plasmas (Ein= 37 keV T, ϕ≃ 0. 75 × 1024 He 0 m− 2  MA, Paux ≃ 8. 0  MW) in He have been carried out to investigate in detail (a) the potential growth of W nanostructures on pre-damaged W samples incorporating He nanobubbles, and (b) the potential ELM-induced erosion of W nanostructure. Both W surface modifications were generated artificially in the GLADIS facility by He bombardment of W samples at ϕ≃ 1 × 1024 He 0 m− 2  keV (a) to ϕ ≃ 0. 75 × 1024  He 0 mϕ≃ 1. 6 × 1024 He+m− 2 at Tsurf ≃ 1800  K and (b) ϕ ≃ 1 × 1024  He 0 m− 2 at Tsurf ≃ 2300  K prior to exposure in the divertor manipulator of ASDEX Upgrade. Though in part (a) conditions of W nanostructure growth with a total He ion fluence of ϕ ≃ 1. 6 × 1024  He+m− 2 and peak He ion impact energies above 150  eV were met, no growth could be detected. In part (b) lower density plasmas with more pronounced type I ELMs, carrying energetic He ions in the keV range, were executed with the <b>strike-line</b> positioned on 2 [*]µm thick W nanostructure accumulating a fluence of ϕ ≃ 0. 8 × 1024  He+m− 2. Post-mortem analysis revealed that co-deposition by predominantly W, and Boron (B), eroded at the main chamber wall and transported into the divertor, took place on all W samples. Erosion of W nanostructure or its formation was hindered {{by the fact that the}} outer divertor at the location of the samples was turned under these He plasma conditions into a net deposition zone by W, B and Carbon (C) ions. The surface morphology with large roughness and effective surface area act as a catcher for the impinging impurities. Thus, apart from operation in the existence diagram of W nanostructure with respect to Tsurf, ϕ, and Ein, also the impinging impurity flux contribution needs to be considered in predictions concerning the formation of W nanostructures...|$|E
40|$|Solomon Islanders {{are highly}} {{dependent}} on their coastal resources for food and livelihoods. Parts of some islands are now quite densely populated and some groups {{are being forced to}} adapt to resource scarcities. One such adaptation is the relatively recent development of nocturnal fisheries for small coastal pelagic fish in Langalanga Lagoon, Malaita Province, in tandem with declining reef fish stocks. The technique involves using lights to attract fish to gill nets and <b>strike-lines</b> deployed from dugout canoes anchored in and around lagoon passages. In the first detailed study of a fishery based on this gear combination in the Pacific, we report a mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from over 190 light fishing trips of 3. 41 kg/hr/person. This figure is two to five times higher than CPUE's obtained for reef-associated fisheries in Solomon Islands, including sites with much lower population and market pressures. The main targets of the light fishery were clupeids, along with small carangids, small sphyraenids and small scombrids. Interviews with fishers revealed there were regular seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of the dominant species (Amblygaster sirm, the Spotted Sardinella) but no long-term (i. e. decadal) variation. Langalanga people now rely heavily on this high-yielding fishery for subsistence and cash, and some said they would need to relocate in search of alternate livelihoods if it did not exist. The high fecundity, rapid growth, early maturation and short life span of the key target species indicate that stocks are likely to be much more resilient than those of most reef-associated species. Many aspects of the behaviour and ecology of the key species remain poorly understood. However we argue that this study should encourage more scientists and fishery managers to think beyond reef-centric and larval connectivity-based models of tropical coastal fishery production and food security, and to pay much closer attention to biological oceanographic processes, including nutrient inputs, which fundamentally underpin the productivity of these increasingly important small pelagic fisheries. ...|$|R
