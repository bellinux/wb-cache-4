40|$|Sensitometric {{curves of}} Kodak XV- 2 film, {{obtained}} {{in a time}} period of ten years with various types of equipment, have been analyzed both for photon and electron beams. The sensitometric slope in the dataset varies more than a factor of 2, which is attributed mainly to variations in developer conditions. In the literature, the single hit equation has been proposed {{as a model for}} the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve,</b> as with the parameters of the sensitivity and maximum optical density. In this work, the single hit equation has been translated into a polynomial like function as with the parameters of the sensitometric slope and curvature. The model has been applied to fit the sensitometric data. If the dataset is fitted for each single <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve</b> separately, a large variation is observed for both fit parameters. When sensitometric curves are fitted simultaneously it appears that all curves can be fitted adequately with a sensitometric curvature that is related to the sensitometric slope. When fitting each curve separately, apparently measurement uncertainty hides this relation. This relation appears to be dependent only on the type of densitometer used. No significant differences between beam energies or beam modalities are observed. Using the intrinsic relation between slope and curvature in fitting sensitometric data, e. g., for pretreatment verification of intensity-modulated radiotherapy, will increase the accuracy of the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve.</b> A calibration at a single dose point, together with a predetermined densitometer-dependent parameter ODmax will be adequate to find the actual relation between optical density and dose...|$|E

Materials and methods: A Varian Clinac 23 EX linear accelerator with 6 MV X-ray beam was used to study the response of Kodak EDR 2 film. Measurements were performed at depths of 5, 10 and 15 cm in MedTec virtual water phantom and with field sizes of 2 x 2, 3 x 3, 10 x 10 and 15 x 15 cm 2. Doses ranging from 20 to 450 cGy were used. The film was developed with the Kodak RP X-OMAT Model M 6 B automatic film processor. Film response was measured with the Vidar model VXR- 16 scanner. <b>Sensitometric</b> <b>curves</b> were applied to the dose profiles measured with film at 5 cm in the virtual water phantom with field sizes of 2 x 2 and 10 x 10 cm 2 and compared with ion chamber data.

Since the measurement uncertainty in Gafchromic film dosimetry {{is thought to be}} significant compared to that of ionization chambers, a rigorous method to evaluate measurement uncertainties is desired. This article provides a method that takes into account the correlation between fit parameters as well as single dose values in order to obtain accurate uncertainties in absolute and relative measurements. A complete portrait of all sources of uncertainty in Gafchromic film dosimetry is given. The parametrization of variance {{as a function of the}} number of averaged pixels is obtained in order to accurately predict the uncertainty as a function of the size of the region of interest. The choice of functional form for the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve</b> is based on four criteria and a convergence of global net optical density uncertainty to 0. 0013 is demonstrated. A minimum number of 12 points is recommended to characterize the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve</b> to a sufficient precision on the uncertainty estimation. Uncertainty levels of 0. 9 % on absolute dose measurements and 0. 45 % on relative measurements are achieved using a 12 -point calibration curve with 220 cGy and repeating measurements five times.

In accurately determining the absolute dose delivered to the film, both the film and scanner used to digitise the images needed to be characterised.

40|$|AIM: To use portal images {{acquired}} in routine circumstances for assessment of midplane dose {{variations in the}} patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Optical density readings are performed on routinely acquired Verification films of breast and ear-nose-throat (ENT) cancer patients and these readings are converted into relative doses with the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve.</b> (1) The impact of redistribution is evaluated on films taken close to the patient exit surface and at routine focus film distance. (2) Midplane doses are estimated from film readings to assess dose variations in the patient. The influence of wedges is evaluated. Film measurements doses are compared with calculated exit doses. RESULTS: (1) In regions with large variations in {{the distance between the}} patient exit surface and the film but without inhomogeneities in tissue density, the relative doses distributions read on films acquired at large focus-film-distance (FFD) are proportional to exit doses. In regions with flat exit surfaces but with inhomogeneities in tissue density, the redistribution has only a small impact. (2) Large variations in relative midplane doses were found in both breast (85 - 115 %) and ENT (- 3. 6 to + 15 %) patients. The application of a wedge was shown to increase dose homogeneity in the midplane. A good agreement (differences < 3 %) was found between exit doses obtained from film readings and exit doses calculated with the treatment planning system (TPS). CONCLUSION: Films {{acquired in}} routine circumstances at large FFD can be used to obtain information on exit doses and to assess midplane doses in breast and ENT, without the use of a TPS.

A single useful criterion was found; that the relative brightness of the reproduction match those of the original. One significant compromise appeared to be in the shadow reproduction in low maximum density reflection prints. It was found that like reflection prints, transparencies do not typically reach relative brightnesses as low as zero. Thus, only a relatively small departure from the 1 : 1 criterion was likely.

BackgroundRadiographic films have been regularly used in routine commissioning of treatment modalities and verification of treatment planning system (TPS). The radiation dosimetery based on radiographic films has ability to give absolute two-dimension dose distribution and prefer for the IMRT quality assurance. However, the single therapy verification film gives a quick and significant reliable method for IMRT verification. Materials and methodsA single extended dose rate (EDR 2) film was used to generate the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve</b> of film optical density and radiation dose. EDR 2 film was exposed with nine 6 cmÃ 6 cm fields of 6 MV photon beam obtained from a medical linear accelerator at 5 -cm depth in solid water phantom. The nine regions of single film were exposed with radiation doses raging from 10 to 362 cGy. The actual dose measurements inside the field regions were performed using 0. 6 cm 3 ionization chamber. The exposed film was processed after irradiation using a VIDAR film scanner and the value of optical density was noted for each region. Ten IMRT plans of head and neck carcinoma were used for verification using a dynamic IMRT technique, and evaluated using the gamma index method with TPS calculated dose distribution. ResultsSensitometric curve has been generated using a single film exposed at nine field region to check quantitative dose verifications of IMRT treatments. The radiation scattered factor was observed to decrease exponentially with the increase in the distance from the centre of each field region. The IMRT plans based on calibration curve were verified using the gamma index method and found to be within acceptable criteria.

40|$|Depth {{and field}} size {{dependence}} of the sensitometric curves of radiographic films have been studied by various groups. Limited information is, however, available on {{the magnitude of the}} variations in sensitometric curves applied in clinical practice in different institutions. In this study we assessed in a systematic way the effect of the various parameters influencing the shape of the sensitometric curve: batch composition, irradiation conditions, film processing, and film scanning. Two types of film, Kodak X-Omat V and CEA TVS, were irradiated, processed, and analyzed in three different institutions. The interinstitutional variation of the sensitometric curves, expressed as the OD variation at 50 cGy, can be up to 32 % and is mainly caused by differences in film processing and to a lesser degree to differences in batch composition, film scanning, and irradiation conditions. For the Kodak films, the average OD difference at 50 cGy between the three institutions is 17 % as a result of differences in batch composition and 25 % due to differences in processing conditions. For the CEA films these data are 6 % and 24 %, respectively. The long-term variation of the sensitometric curves of KODAK films in one institution was smaller than the differences in batch composition between the three institutions. The sensitometric curves of CEA films showed in one institution a large variation with time; the shape gradually varied from sigmoidal to quasilinear. By using relative OD values rather than absolute OD values, variations in sensitometric curves of KODAK films can be reduced to 2 %. Consequently, one <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve</b> is sufficient to derive relative dose values. If processing conditions are well controlled, it might therefore be advantageous to determine the absolute OD only at one or two dose values, in combination with a "universal" relative sensitometric curv...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundModern linear accelerators, used in oncological radiotherapy, {{are often}} {{equipped}} with a dynamic wedge option and dynamic multileaf collimators. For linacs having these options, measurements of absorbed dose distribution require complete movement of the jaw, or of the dynamic multileaf collimator, for each measurement point. In conformal radiotherapy, three or more beams, modified by dynamic accessories, are combined to produce a summarized dose distribution. AimThis study is {{an investigation of the}} use of film as a detector of dose distribution produced by a single beam, or by a pair of beams modified by dynamic accessories, in phantoms. Materials/MethodsMeasurements of the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve</b> of the recently introduced EDR 2 (extended dose range) and extensively used X-Omat V radiographic films were performed. Films were irradiated using a Clinac 2300 C/D Varianâ¢ accelerator, equipped with dMLC (dynamic multileaf collimator) and EDW (enhanced dynamic wedge) options. The recorded wedge dose distribution created by the EDW and by programmed dMLC movement were used to obtain response curves of the films. Solid Waterâ¢ 457 blocks, manufactured by Gammex RMI, were used as phantoms, in which the films were irradiated. ResultsMeasurement and verification of dose distributions created by beams modified by dynamic accessories can be performed using both EDR 2 and X-Omat V radiographic films. The EDR 2 low sensitivity films are suitable for measurements of total dose distribution, as created by a number of dynamically modulated beams. High sensitivity X-Omat V films are more suited to verification of energy flow, or of the dose distribution generated by single fields, modified by dynamic accessories.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityA {{method of}} {{reducing}} the graininess of a photographic print and increasing resolution in low contrast regions is described. The method involves the printing {{of more than one}} negative frame to produce one print. This requires a series of negatives with identical detail coverage in the area to be printed. The success of the method depends largely on the precision of the solution of the registration problem. Each negative is printed in turn, using the normal exposure, partitioned in as many parts as there are negatives to be printed. Each negative must be registered as exactly as possible in the image area. 	Four different aerial emulsions were used to obtain the 35 -mm negatives for the superimposition printing technique. Kodak films used were: Tri X-RP Aercon, Super XX-RP Aerial Recon, Plus X Aerocon (SO 1166), and SO- 1213. The exposure versus resolution characteristics and the basic <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curves</b> were developed for these films prior to exposure of the final series of negative frames.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find the most {{accurate}} model for radiochromic film dosimetry by comparing different channel independent perturbation models. A model selection approach based on (algorithmic) information theory was followed, and the results were validated using gamma-index analysis on a set of benchmark test cases. Several questions were addressed: (a) whether incorporating the information of the non-irradiated film, by scanning prior to irradiation, improves the results; (b) whether lateral corrections are necessary when using multichannel models; (c) whether multichannel dosimetry produces better results than single-channel dosimetry; (d) which multichannel perturbation model provides more accurate film doses. It was found that scanning prior to irradiation and applying lateral corrections improved the accuracy of the results. For some perturbation models, increasing the number of color channels did not result in more accurate film doses. Employing Truncated Normal perturbations was found to provide better results than using Micke-Mayer perturbation models. Among the models being compared, the triple-channel model with Truncated Normal perturbations, net optical density as the response and subject to the application of lateral corrections was found to be the most accurate model. The scope of this study was circumscribed by the limits under which the models were tested.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of radiochromic EBT film was studied for high-precision clinical quality assurance (QA) {{by identifying the}} dose response {{for a wide range}} of irradiation parameters typically modified in highly-conformal treatment techniques. In addition, uncertainties associated with varying irradiation conditions were determined. EBT can be used for dose assessment of absorbed dose levels as well as relative dosimetry when compared to absolute absorbed dose calibrated using ionization chamber results. For comparison, a silver halide film (Kodak EDR- 2) representing the current standard in film dosimetry was included. As an initial step a measurement protocol yielding accurate and precise results was established for a flatbed transparency scanner (Epson Expression 1680 Pro) that was utilized as a film reading instrument. The light transmission measured by the scanner was found to depend on the position of the film on the scanner plate. For three film pieces irradiated with doses of 0 Gy, â¼ 1 Gy and â¼ 7 Gy, the pixel values measured in portrait or landscape mode differed by 4. 7 %, 6. 2 % and 10. 0 %, respectively. A study of 200 film pieces revealed an excellent sheet-to-sheet uniformity. On a long time scale, the optical development of irradiated EBT film consisted of a slow but steady increase of absorbance which was not observed to cease during 4 months. Sensitometric curves of EBT films obtained under reference conditions (SSD = 95 cm, FS = 5 Ã 5 cm 2, d = 5 cm) for 6, 10 and 25 MV photon beams did not show any energy dependence. The average separation between all curves was only 0. 7 %. The variation of the depth d (range 2 - 25 cm) in the phantom did not affect the dose response of EBT film. Also the influence of the radiation field size (range 3 Ã 3 - 40 Ã 40 cm 2) on the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curve</b> was not significant. For EDR- 2 films maximum differences between the calibration curves reached 7 - 8 % for X 6 MV and X 25 MV. Radiochromic EBT film, in combination with a flatbed scanner, presents a versatile system for high-precision dosimetry in two dimensions, provided that the intrinsic behaviour of the film reading device is taken into account. EBT film itself presents substantial improvements on formerly available models of radiographic and a radiochromic film and its dosimetric characteristics allow us to measure absorbed dose levels in a large variety of situations with a single calibration curve.

40|$|Purpose: Different {{multichannel}} {{methods for}} film dosimetry {{have been proposed}} in the literature. Two of them are the weighted mean method and the method put forth by Micke et al and Mayer et al. The purpose of this work was to compare their results {{and to develop a}} generalized channel-independent perturbations framework in which both methods enter as special cases. Methods: Four models of channel-independent perturbations were compared: weighted mean, Micke-Mayer method, uniform distribution and truncated normal distribution. A closed-form formula to calculate film doses and the associated Type B uncertainty for all four models was deduced. To evaluate the models, film dose distributions were compared with planned and measured dose distributions. At the same time, several elements of the dosimetry process were compared: film type EBT 2 versus EBT 3, different waiting-time windows, reflection mode versus transmission mode scanning, and planned versus measured dose distribution for film calibration and for gamma-index analysis. The methods and the models described in this study are publicly accessible through IRISEU. Alpha 1. 1 ([URL] IRISEU. is a cloud computing web application for calibration and dosimetry of radiochromic films. Results: The truncated normal distribution model provided the best agreement between film and reference doses, both for calibration and gamma-index verification, and proved itself superior to both the weighted mean model, which neglects correlations between the channels, and the Micke-Mayer model, whose accuracy depends on the properties of the <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curves.</b> Conclusions: The truncated normal distribution model of channel-independent perturbations was found superior to the other three models under comparison and we propose its use for multichannel dosimetry.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to enable the removal of developer depletion and diffusion effects (i. e., adjacency effects from noisy photographic images, thus, providing a potential for improvement in the reliability of restored object and aerial image estimates. The investigation was based on the use of a previously formulated image resortation model which characterized the exposure, latent image and development interactions of the photographic process in terms of statistical estimation theory. This study addressed the application and appropriate modification of the formulated model in the removal of adjacency effects from noisy images of selected line targets. Literature pertaining to the initial observations of adjacency effects, their recognition as a nonlinear chemical development effect and the pertinent models (forward) used to predict their effects was reviewed. This was followed with a review of the statistical restoration (inverse) model and its comparison to previously derived forward models. X-ray quanta exposures were then used to obtain noisy photographic images, free of optical scattering effects, for the purpose of empirically determining a chemical spread function to characterize chemical adjacency effects. Photographic images were obtained that contained lines of 0. 010, 0. 100 and 1. 000 mm widths to enable comparison between the magnitude of the chemical spread function and the Eberhard effect. A segmented polynomial (cubic spline function) approach was used to calculate the chemical spread function. Separate light quanta exposures were used to obtain gross grain density <b>sensitometric</b> <b>curves</b> and noisy line images. The covering power relationship between mass of developed silver and diffuse density was empirically derived for Panatomic-X film processed without agitation in D- 76 developer (diluted 1 : 1). Emperical verification of the statistical restoration model was achieved. Chemical adjacency effects were successfully removed from noisy line images using an appropriately scaled version of the statistical restoration model. The spatial frequency content of the noisy line images was approximately 1, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 40 cycles/mm. The proportionality factor, used to scale the chemical spread function required in the restoration model, was found to be equivalent to the ratio of the empirically derived chemical spread function and a magnitude estimate of the Eberhard effect. The maximum diffuse density correction for edge effects was found to be 0. 14, or approximately 11. 1 % of the gross grain density level, 1. 20. Similar diffuse density corrections for fine line images were found to range between 0. 14 and 0. 36, or approximately 11. 1 % to 28. 3 % of the gross grain density level associated with a specific line element...|$|R
