40|$|For {{advanced}} {{gas turbine}} engines, two combustor systems, the lean premixed/prevaporized (LPP) {{and the rich}} burn/quick quench/lean burn (RQL) offer great potential for reducing NO(x) emissions. An important consideration for either concept {{is the development of}} an advanced fuel injection system that will provide a stable, efficient, and very uniform combustion system over a wide operating range. High-shear airblast fuel injectors for gas turbine combustors have exhibited superior atomization and mixing compared with pressure-atomizing fuel injectors. This improved mixing has lowered NO(x) emissions and the pattern factor, and has enabled combustors to alternate fuels while maintaining a stable, efficient combustion system. The performance of high-shear airblast fuel injectors is highly dependent on the design of the dome <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes.</b> The type of <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes</b> most widely used in gas turbine combustors are usually flat for ease of manufacture, but vanes with curvature will, in general, give superior aerodynamic performance. The design and performance of high-turning, low-loss curved dome <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes</b> with twist along the span are investigated. The twist induces a secondary vortex flow pattern which will improve the atomization of the fuel, thereby producing a more uniform fuel-air distribution. This uniform distribution will increase combustion efficiency while lowering NO(x) emissions.

40|$|Master of EngineeringSpray dryers are {{the core}} {{components}} of a milk powder production plant, where the basic configuration usually features co-current flow of milk powder and air. Spray dryers have to be cleaned frequently due to powder deposit build-up on the walls. Powder deposit build-up gives rise to lower product yields and poses a potential fire risk. If the powder deposits are scorched (from being overheated) they will contaminate, and thus compromise, the quality and consumer safety of the final product, if the powder deposits fall in and mix with it. With milk powder production rates of most industrial spray dryers ranging from 4 - 28 tonnes of dry powder an hour, these wall deposition problems are significant. This problem is worth investigating because the outcome of reducing or eliminating wall deposition is that a spray dryer could operate {{for a longer period}} of time without having to be cleaned. Reduction in downtime due to cleaning would give rise to increased production time and possibly a reduction in the cost of manufacturing the product. The spray dryer used in this work was a modified short-form co-current Niro unit, fabricated from stainless steel. The spray dryer had an internal diameter of 0. 80 m, narrowing down to 0. 06 m at the base, and a height of 2 m. A two-fluid nozzle was used to spray the process fluids (water, skim milk and grape skin extract) into the drying chamber. To measure the wall deposition fluxes on the internal walls of the spray dryer, four stainless steel plates (dimensions 110 mm by 120 mm) were inserted in place of the windows that were previously used as sight glasses. A fifth plate (dimensions 110 mm by 120 mm) and a sixth plate (dimensions 110 mm by 110 mm) were also placed on the conical section of the spray dryer at different circumferential locations. Before this work, no quantitative data on the effects of spray dryer operating conditions on the wall deposition fluxes of food material were available. This work investigated the effect on the spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls of the spray dryer of (i) flow patterns in the spray dryer, by changing the degree of swirl imparted to the incoming air by using three <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angles of 0 o, 25 o and 30 o, and (ii) the stickiness of the product, through first changing the temperature of the incoming air by using three inlet air temperatures of 170 oC, 200 oC and 230 oC; and then changing the process fluid flowrate by using three flowrates of 1. 4 kg hr- 1, 1. 6 kg hr- 1 and 1. 8 kg hr- 1. Previous researchers have found that the extent to which water droplets spread out in the drying chamber is affected by the amount of swirl in the inlet air. This is likely to affect wall deposition fluxes because the particles will be closer to the walls if the droplets spread out widely. The results of this work have quantitatively confirmed that the spray deposition flux increases at higher <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angles, where the spray deposition flux increased from 7 g m- 2 hr- 1 (<b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angle 0 o) to 12. 9 g m- 2 hr- 1 (<b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angle 30 o). When a <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angle of 0 o was used, it was observed that the cross-sectional area of the spray cloud did not change very significantly with time. However, when a <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angle of 25 o was used, the spray cloud was observed to “flutter”, and when the <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angle was increased to 30 o, the spray cloud was observed to recirculate rapidly back in the direction of the nozzle. Thus, the chance of the particles being thrown further towards the walls of the chamber is likely to increase at higher <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angles. This result suggests that higher wall deposition arises because more swirl is imparted to the air entering the dryer, which in turn affects the stability of the spray cloud and, therefore, the stability of the flow patterns in the spray dryer. The stickiness of the skim milk powder is related to the temperature and moisture content of the particles. In the past, the sticky-point curve has been suggested as a semi-quantitative concept in selecting operating conditions for spray drying food material containing carbohydrates, where it has been implied that there is no significant wall deposition below the sticky-point curve. This work has quantified the spray deposition in spray dryers with respect to the sticky-point curve, where the highest spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls was 16 g m- 2 hr- 1, and the operating point corresponding to this spray deposition flux was located at and above the sticky-point curve. Hence, both particle stickiness and flow patterns affect the wall deposition of particles in a spray dryer. This work also investigated the effect of wall properties, namely a non-stick food grade material (nylon), adhesive tape and stainless steel, on the spray deposition flux of skim milk powder on the walls. The effect of electrostatics on wall deposition was studied by grounding the spray dryer and an anti-static agent was added to the skim milk to investigate if altering the properties of the feed material could reduce wall deposition. This work has quantitatively confirmed that cohesion occurs at the same rate as adhesion for skim milk powder in this spray dryer, because firstly, decreasing the adhesion tendency of the v wall by using nylon coating had no significant effect on the spray deposition flux compared with a smooth stainless steel wall and a wall covered with a double-sided adhesive tape; and secondly the powder collected on the walls was a linear function of time with and without adhesive on the plates. Furthermore, using a nylon coated wall did not eliminate wall deposition, and the wall deposition flux was found to be the same as when a stainless steel wall was used. This result further supports the finding here that spray deposition on the walls for skim milk powder is controlled by cohesion rather than adhesion. The spray dryer operating parameters that gave rise to the least spray deposition flux on the walls were a <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angle of 0 o, an inlet air temperature of 230 oC and a process fluid flowrate of 1. 4 kg hr- 1. Decreasing the feed flowrate from 1. 8 kg hr- 1 to 1. 4 kg hr- 1 (decrease by 24 %), with the inlet air temperature and <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angle held constant, decreased the wall deposition flux by 43 % from 7 g m- 2 hr- 1 to 4 g m- 2 hr- 1. Since the spray deposition flux on the walls decreased by 43 % when the feed flowrate was decreased by 24 %, it might be considered that the production process is in favour of a decrease in the feed flowrate to 1. 4 kg hr- 1 in this dryer, and consequently a decrease in the spray deposition flux on the walls per unit production output. Finally, this work investigated if the outlet moisture content from this small spray dryer used here was equilibrium limited or controlled by drying kinetics. The findings in this work confirmed the product moisture locus concept, which implies that the outlet moisture content of the skim milk particles approaches the equilibrium moisture content (in equilibrium with the outlet gas), and that the outlet moisture content of spray-dried food material containing carbohydrates is probably not limited by particle drying kinetics, even though the spray dryer is smaller (diameter 0. 8 m, height 2 m) than those used in the dairy industry, typically with a diameter of 30 m and a height of 10 m...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} investigates two generalized methods, i. e., {{a simple}} universal index and oscillation frequency, for the {{quantitative assessment of}} flame stability at fossil-fuel-fired furnaces. The index is proposed to assess the stability of flame {{in terms of its}} color, geometry, and luminance. It is designed by combining up to seven characteristic parameters extracted from flame images. The oscillation frequency is derived from the spectral analysis of flame radiation signals. The measurements involved in these two methods do not require prior knowledge about fuel property, burner type, and other operation conditions. They can therefore be easily applied to flame stability assessment without costly and complex adaption. Experiments were carried out on a 9 -MW heavy-oil-fired combustion test rig over a wide range of combustion conditions including variations in <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> position of the tertiary air, <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> position of the secondary air, and the ratio of the primary air to the total air.

40|$|The {{quality of}} coal from a natural source can vary {{significantly}} {{as it is}} processed from the ground. Elevated sand loadings within the raw coal can significantly influence wear due to erosion within the mill-duct system of a lignite fuelled power station. A previous study [1] by the current authors investigated the gas and particle mass flow within the mill-duct system of a real-life operating power station both numerically and experimentally. This work extends the previous study by considering the wear of the mill-duct system caused by coal and varying levels of sand under normal operating conditions. At elevated levels of sand loading, the wear significantly increased {{in comparison with the}} coal only flow. Considering varying levels of sand loadings, the erosion wear at the highest sand loading case (30 % by mass) produced slightly less than three times the total wear of the 10 % sand loading case. This non-linear relationship {{can be attributed to the}} re-acceleration of the heavier sand particles after particle-wall collisions. The erosion patterns found within the swirl vane regions of the mill-duct confirm the findings of other researchers in the field of particulate roping. The findings suggested that the particle ropes twist around the circumference of duct when a series of bends is encountered. These findings were evident in the erosion distribution comparing the <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes</b> in the upper and lower legs of the mill-duct system. These differing erosion distributions were attributed to the rotational motion of the secondary gas flows and the difference in bend-to-swirl vane distance of the two legs. The predicted erosion wear on the upper leg <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes</b> was greater than those of the lower leg even though the particle mass flow was biased toward the lower leg. The upper and lower leg swirl vane geometry imparts an anti-clockwise rotation to the flow while the secondary flow created by the trifurcation geometry was anti-clockwise within the lower leg and clockwise within the upper leg. Thus the anti-clockwise motion created within the lower leg geometry actually aided the swirl vane motion, minimising the wear. The upper leg <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes</b> reversed the secondary flow resulting in a greater number of particle/swirl vane collisions, leading to a higher degree of wear...|$|E

40|$|A model reactor {{is used to}} {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} the overall performance and detailed flowfield structure of a non-premixed swirl-stabilized distributed reaction are sensitive to modest changes in inlet conditions (e. g., fuel injection angle, inlet geometry, and <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> solidity). Measurements of combustor performance are based on exhaust plane species concentration profiles (HC, CO 2, CO, O 2), combustion efficiency, and visual observation of combustor stability. The detailed flowfield structure is established by spatially mapping the axial and azimuthal velocity fields using two-component laser anemometry, and the temperature field using a thermocouple probe. The results show that relatively modest changes in inlet conditions can dramatically affect the flowfield structure. As an example, for the model reactor evaluated the addition of a small step at the outer boundary of the swirler yields significantly lower centerline axial velocities and a more uniform thermal structure in the recirculation zone. Furthermore, a modest reduction in <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> solidity transforms the aerodynamic structure of the recirculation zone from an off-axis to a central, on-axis structure. These results explain, in part, the contradictory conclusions drawn from data acquired in non-premixed swirl-stabilized distributed reactions, and establish that comparisons and generalizations of such flows require, at a minimum, (1) careful measurements and specification of the inlet conditions, (2) detailed measurements of the flow structure, and (3) an assessment of the effects of modest changes in key operating and configurational variables. © 1988 Combustion Institute...|$|R

40|$|A typical {{means of}} {{limiting}} the {{peak power output}} of race car engines is to restrict the maximum mass flow of air to the engine. The Formula SAE sanctioning body {{requires the use of}} an intake restrictor to limit performance, keep costs low, and maintain a safe racing experience. The intake restrictor poses a challenge to improving engine performance. Methods to better understand the ramifications of the restrictor on the engine lead to performance improvements that allow an edge over the competition. A one-dimensional gas exchange simulation code coupled with three-dimensional CFD is used to simulate various concepts in the improvement of restrictor performance. Ricardo’s WAVE and VECTIS are the respective simulation codes. Along with this, the interaction of intake manifold and restrictor are considered. The effects of different diffuser geometries and plenum dimensions were first explored using WAVE, and then a series of different diffuser angles were simulated using WAVE-VECTIS. Primary area of improvement was determined to be through the use of tighter or smaller diffuser angles. Acoustic filtering using Helmholtz resonators was investigated using WAVE to determine if restrictor performance could be improved by attempting to make flow at the throat more uniform over the cycle. Inline Helmholtz resonators were also investigated in an attempt to increase pressure upstream of the throat. Initial results were encouraging, but were very sensitive to geometry.

Since swirling flow becomes more effective in reducing jet noise as the density and temperature gradients increase, the significant trends in noise reduction and engine performance that were established by these parametric studies could be projected into potentially greater reductions of sound pressure levels with minimum thrust losses by controlled swirling of the jets of high thrust engines.

The seal was operated at a Reynolds number of 24, 000 and a Taylor number of 6, 600 using water as the working fluid. <b>Swirl</b> <b>vanes</b> were placed upstream of the seal to produce positive, negative, and no preswirl. It {{was found that the}} axial and radial velocities were minimally effected. The tangential velocity, both in the clearance region and the seal cavities on the rotor, were greatly altered by the preswirl. By applying negative preswirl, the tangential velocity was suppressed, even in the seventh cavity. The turbulence levels decreased as the preswirl varied from negative to positive...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of soot {{inside a}} flame-tube burner using a special water-flushed probe are discussed. The soot is {{measured}} at {{a series of}} points at each burner, and upon occasion gaseous constitutents NO, CO, hydrocarbons, etc., were also measured. Four geometries of flame-tube burners were studied, {{as well as a}} variety of different fuels. The role of upstream geometry on the downstream pollutant formation was studied. It was found that the amount of soot formed in particularly sensitive to how aerodynamically clean the configuration of the burner is upstream of the injector <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes.</b> The effect of pressure on soot formation was also studied. It was found that beyond a certain Reynolds number, the peak amount of soot formed in the burner is constant...|$|E
40|$|Swirl brake {{influences}} the static and rotordynamic characteristics of labyrinth seal which {{are important in}} the prediction of turbomachine stability. To study {{the influence of the}} swirl brakes on improving seal stability, the effects of swirl brakes on the static and rotordynamic characteristics of labyrinth seals were investigated by the combination of numerical simulation and experiment. First, it was performed to the effects of swirl brake on the static flow characteristics of labyrinth seal with swirl ratio and pressure distribution based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). And then a comparison between leakage predicted by the CFD model and measurement was presented to verify the accuracy of the simulation. Moreover, an experiment was implemented to analyze the rotordynamic characteristics of labyrinth seal using an improved impedance method based on an unbalanced synchronous excitation method on a rotor test rig. The influences of swirl brake density, length, inlet/outlet pressure ratio, and rotating speed were measured and discussed, respectively. The CFD numerical results show that the swirl brake effectively reduces the seal swirl ratio (∼ 60 - 75 % less), circumferential pressure difference (∼ 25 - 85 % less) so that the seal destabilizing forces decrease. With the increasing of the <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes</b> density and length, the seal leakage drops (∼ 8 - 20 % less). The experimental rotordynamic characteristics results show that it is more obvious to reduce the crosscouple stiffness (∼ 50 - 300 % less) and increase the direct damping (∼ 50 - 60 % larger) with the increasing in the number and length of the <b>swirl</b> <b>vanes,</b> and thus the swirl brake improves the seal rotordynamic stability. The efforts of this paper provide a useful insight to clearly understand the effects of swirl brakes on the labyrinth seal static and rotordynamic characteristics, which is beneficial to improve the design of annular seals.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} to obtain the time-mean and turbulent quantities of opposed lateral jets in a low speed, nonreacting flowfield. A jet-to-crossflow velocity ratio of R = 4 was used throughout the experiments, with <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angles of 0 (swirler removed), 45 and 70 degrees used with the crossflow. Flow visualization techniques used were neutrally-buoyant helium-filled soap bubbles and multispark photography {{in order to obtain}} the gross flowfield characteristics. Measurements of time-mean and turbulent quantities were obtained utilizing a six-orientation single hot-wire technique. For the nonswirling case, the jets were found not to penetrate past the test-section centerline, in contrast to the single lateral jet with the same jet-to-crossflow velocity ratio. In the swirling cases, the crossflow remains in a narrow region near the wall of the test section. The opposed jets are swept from their vertical courses into spiral trajectories close to the confining walls. Extensive results are presented in r-x plane plots...|$|R
40|$|The SR- 7 A {{propeller}} was acoustically {{tested with}} and without downstream <b>swirl</b> recovery <b>vanes</b> to determine if any extra noise {{was caused by the}} interaction of the propeller wakes and vortices with these vanes. No additional noise was observed at the cruise condition over the angular range tested. The presence of the <b>swirl</b> recovery <b>vanes</b> did unload the propeller and some small peak noise reductions were observed from lower propeller loading noise. The propeller was also tested alone to investigate the behavior of the peak propeller noise with helical tip Mach number. As observed before on other propellers, the peak noise first rose with helical tip Mach number and then leveled off or decreased at higher helical tip Mach numbers. Detailed pressure-time histories indicate that a portion of the primary pressure pulse is progressively cancelled by a secondary pulse as the helical tip Mach number is increased. This cancellation appears to be responsible for the peak noise behavior at high helical tip Mach numbers...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{problem of}} lateral jet injection into typical flow {{fields in the}} absence of combustion was studied. All flow fields being investigated have no expansion of the crossflow (the test section to swirler diameter ratio D/d = 1), after its passage through an optional swirler (with <b>swirl</b> <b>vane</b> angle phi = 0 (swirler removed), 45, and 70 degree). The lateral jet(s) is(are) located one test-section diameter downstream of the test-section inlet (x/D = 1). The lateral jets have round-sectioned nozzles, each of which has an area of 1 / 100 th of the cross sectional area of the crossflow (A sub j/A sub c = 1 / 100). Jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios of R = v sub j/u sub o = 2, 4, and 6 were investigated. Helium-bubble low visualization, five-hole pitot probe time-mean velocity measurements, and single-wire time-mean velocity and normal and shear stress turbulence data were obtained in the research program...|$|R
