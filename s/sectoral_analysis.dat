5000|$|Media {{concentration}} {{has been}} widely debated in Bulgaria since the 1990s. After the change from Communism to the market economy, the country faced the issue of concentration: the monopoly positions of the state media were replaced by the domination of several private media groups. In the 1990s the problem affected in particular the print sector: two most influential newspapers at that time - Trud and 24 hours - were purchased by the WAZ Group. The group dominated the Bulgarian media market until the late 2000s. In the late 2000s, the creation and rapid grow of the New Media Group were seen again as a case of media ownership concentration in the sector of print and online media. At stakes there was the group’s links with politics and a bank. The group purchased local media, thus acquiring a dominant position in the local media market and in print media distribution. According to some estimates, the company gained a 70-80% share in the print media distribution market. The case of the New Media Group lead to public debate in 2001 that forced the Commission on the Protection of Competition to make a <b>sectoral</b> <b>analysis</b> of the concentration in the print media distribution market. The {{study found that the}} concentration in 2009-2011 constituted an obstacle to new competitors wishing to enter the market [...] The Commission also concluded that {{there was a lack of}} transparent rules in the field. However, it issued a permission for such concentration on the basis that it would not establish or increase a dominant position in the distribution market.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that the Norwegian innovation system is locked-in to a specialization pattern of scale dependent, resource intensive industries, in which innovation depends mainly on the in-house activities of (a few) large firms. To this extent, we employ a <b>sectoral</b> empirical <b>analysis</b> using data on industrial dynamics and innovation in the Norwegian economy. Our results indicate that although the Norwegian economy has parts that are resourceand scale dependent, and also sectors in which the market structure is inert and concentrated, these characteristics are not systematically related to the level and nature of innovation activities. Our results indicate that innovation in Norway takes place in two main regimes: a highintensive and a low-intensive regime. This is not correlated systematically with industrial dynamics. ...|$|R

Results from a back-of-the-envelope calibration suggest that this mechanism has an important role in raising both wages and returns to experience in denser areas. Labor market...|$|R
