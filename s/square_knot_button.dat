50|$|The eleven main {{knots of}} Chinese {{knotting}} are the four-flower knot, six-flower <b>knot,</b> Chinese <b>button</b> <b>knot,</b> double connection knot, double coin knot, agemaki, cross <b>knot,</b> <b>square</b> <b>knot,</b> Plafond knot, Pan Chang knot, {{and the good}} luck knot.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} methods for tying <b>button</b> <b>knots,</b> {{such as the}} Chinese <b>button</b> <b>knot,</b> the Celtic <b>button</b> <b>knot</b> and the monkey fist. The Ashley Book of Knots {{contains}} over a hundred examples.|$|R
50|$|The <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> is amphichiral, {{meaning that}} it is indistinguishable from its own mirror image. The {{crossing}} number of a <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> is six, which is the smallest possible crossing number for a composite knot.|$|R
5000|$|The medal {{consists}} of a pendant suspended from a green ribbon with a thin white vertical stripe. The pendant is the BSA universal emblem superimposed on an [...] "A", all of a brass colored metal. The <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> insignia is an embroidered green <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> on a cloth khaki patch. Multiple awards are denoted by the wear of program devices, worn on the <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> award and the ribbon of the award medal.|$|R
50|$|In South America, a fiador {{is usually}} {{made of the}} same {{material}} {{as the rest of}} the halter or bridle, or of rawhide, and is fixed with a <b>knotted</b> <b>button</b> and button hole.|$|R
50|$|The <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> can be {{constructed}} from two trefoil knots, one of which must be left-handed and the other right-handed. Each of the two knots is cut, and then the loose ends are joined together pairwise. The resulting connected sum is the <b>square</b> <b>knot.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Square</b> <b>knot</b> {{insignia}} are embroidered cloth patches {{that represent}} awards of the Boy Scouts of America and Scout associations throughout the world. The insignia depicts a <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> made of colored ropes; {{the colors are}} generally dictated by the award the insignia is associated with.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese <b>button</b> <b>knot</b> and the Celtic <b>button</b> <b>knot</b> are {{decorative}} stopper knots.|$|R
50|$|Those who {{completed}} the course prior to 2012 were issued a corresponding cloth sew-on <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> insignia, a sea-blue trident on a silver gray background, on the BSA uniform. The Seabadge knot {{was one of the}} few that do not actually use a representation of a <b>square</b> <b>knot.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Although {{they do not}} use a <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> {{insignia}}, the District Award of Merit and the Silver World Award award insignia {{are still}} referred to as [...] "square knots". The District Award of Merit and the Professional Training Award {{do not have a}} wearable insignia item other than the <b>square</b> <b>knot.</b>|$|R

50|$|Half knots {{are tied}} {{alternately}} behind {{and in front}} of the rope until the width of the band of twine approaches the diameter of the rope. A reef (<b>square)</b> <b>knot,</b> or better a series of reef (<b>square)</b> <b>knots,</b> completes the whipping. If a needle is available this string of reef (<b>square)</b> <b>knots</b> can be pulled through the rope to bury the ends. Alternatively, a short bight of another rope can be laid first and used to pull the rope ends through. If the rope is a stranded rope, the ends can usually be pulled through without a needle.|$|R

50|$|The most {{frequently}} represented animals are rodents, bats, peccaries and growling jaguars. Strips frequently applied with grooves, are disposed in spiral or long circles. Other models {{were used to}} depict rough eyes, eyebrows and other facial features, as well, round <b>knots,</b> <b>buttons</b> etc.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Square</b> <b>knots</b> are {{rectangular}} cloth patches {{that use}} a multi-colored knot and/or border design to informally represent certain awards. Some emblems use other designs, {{such as the}} overhand knot for the District Award of Merit, but they are all referred to as [...] "square knots". Some awards are represented by both medals or badges and square knots; others certificates or plaques and square knots; while other awards or recognitions have a certificate and a small device to wear atop a <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> emblem. Only a few <b>square</b> <b>knots</b> may be worn by youth, among them the Hornaday conservation award, the religious emblem or life-saving awards.|$|R
25|$|No {{more than}} seven devices may be placed on any one <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> emblem.|$|R
50|$|Recipients may {{wear the}} {{corresponding}} <b>square</b> <b>knot,</b> with {{a design that}} reflects the award.|$|R
50|$|In <b>knot</b> theory, the <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> is a {{composite}} knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection. It {{is closely related to}} the granny knot, which is also a connected sum of two trefoils. Because the trefoil knot is the simplest nontrivial <b>knot,</b> the <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> and the granny knot are the simplest of all composite knots.|$|R
50|$|The (−3, 0, −3) pretzel <b>knot</b> (<b>square</b> <b>knot</b> (mathematics)) is the {{connected}} sum of two trefoil knots.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> and the granny knot have {{isomorphic}} knot groups, {{yet these}} two knots are not equivalent.|$|R
50|$|The twine {{is first}} {{threaded}} diagonally through the rope. The twine is then wrapped round the rope including the diagonally threaded end. A needle is {{then used to}} thread the two ends through the rope to enclose the wrapping turns. Finally a reef (square) or a string of reef (<b>square)</b> <b>knots</b> is tied. Then this string of reef (<b>square)</b> <b>knots</b> is pulled through the rope to bury the ends.|$|R
50|$|The medal is a pendant {{suspended}} from a green, white and green ribbon. The current pendant is a Tenderfoot emblem on a keystone, {{all in a}} brass colored metal. Earlier versions had the keystone and emblem created in 10 or 14 karat gold; and with the First Class emblem {{as opposed to the}} Tenderfoot emblem. There is a matching certificate, signed by the Chief Scout Executive with spaces for it to be countersigned by the local Council's President and Scout Executive. The cloth <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> insignia is an embroidered green and white <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> on a cloth khaki patch. Multiple awards are denoted by the wear of program devices, worn on the <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> award and the ribbon of the award medal.|$|R

After a <b>square</b> <b>knot</b> was tied, the suture was then threaded through each catheter eyelet and three interlocking <b>square</b> <b>knots</b> were made using a needle driver.
