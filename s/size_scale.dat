There are relatively few fests in the world, all based in Europe and Canada; however, their size means that they have a significant influence on local LARP culture and design.

The Autobot Grimlock, who transforms into a dinosaur, is controlled differently than other characters. Carrying only a sword and shield, Grimlock cannot transform at will, instead accumulating rage as he battles opponents. When he gains enough rage, Grimlock is able to transform and inflict massive damage. The online cooperative campaign play featured in the first game has been removed in favor of levels that utilize each character's specific abilities.|$|E

25|$|Clastic {{sedimentary}} rocks, are subdivided {{according to}} the dominant particle size. Most geologists use the Udden-Wentworth grain <b>size</b> <b>scale</b> and divide unconsolidated sediment into three fractions: gravel (>2mm diameter), sand (1/16 to 2mm diameter), and mud (clay is <1/256nbsp&mm and silt is between 1/16 and 1/256nbsp&mm). The classification of clastic sedimentary rocks parallels this scheme; conglomerates and breccias are made mostly of gravel, sandstones are made mostly of sand, and mudrocks are made mostly of the finest material. This tripartite subdivision is mirrored by the broad categories of rudites, arenites, and lutites, respectively, in older literature.|$|E

In this study, we measure the vacuole-cell <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> trends in budding yeast using optical microscopy and a novel, to our knowledge, image analysis algorithm. Vacuole volume and surface area both show characteristic scaling trends {{with respect to}} cell size that are consistent among different strains. Rapamycin treatment was found to increase vacuole-cell <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> trends for both volume and surface area. Unexpectedly, these increases did not depend on macroautophagy, as similar increases in vacuole size were observed in the autophagy deficient mutants atg 1 Δ and atg 5 Δ. Rather, rapamycin appears to act on vacuole size by inhibiting retrograde membrane trafficking, as the atg 18 Δ mutant, which is defective in retrograde trafficking, shows similar vacuole <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> to rapamycin-treated cells and is itself insensitive to rapamycin treatment. Disruption of anterograde membrane trafficking in the apl 5 Δ mutant leads to complementary changes in vacuole <b>size</b> <b>scaling.</b> These quantitative results lead to a simple model for vacuole <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> based on proportionality between cell growth rates and vacuole growth rates...|$|R

25|$|Supercritical fluids {{can be used}} {{to deposit}} {{functional}} nanostructured films and nanometer-size particles of metals onto surfaces. The high diffusivities and concentrations of precursor in the fluid as compared to the vacuum systems used in chemical vapour deposition allow deposition to occur in a surface reaction rate limited regime, providing stable and uniform interfacial growth. This is crucial in developing more powerful electronic components, and metal particles deposited in this way are also powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis and electrochemical reactions. Additionally, due to the high rates of precursor transport in solution, it is possible to coat high surface area particles which under chemical vapour deposition would exhibit depletion near the outlet of the system and also be likely to result in unstable interfacial growth features such as dendrites. The result is very thin and uniform films deposited at rates much faster than atomic layer deposition, the best other tool for particle coating at this <b>size</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

The structure assigned in 1991 to the antibiotic isolated from a marine organism, diazonamide A (C40H34Cl2N6O6, molar mass 765.65 g/mol), proved to be incorrect by the classical proof of structure: a synthetic sample was not identical to the natural product. [...] The mistake was attributed to the inability of X-ray crystallography to distinguish between the correct -OH / >NH and the interchanged -NH2 / -O- groups in the incorrect structure. With advances in instrumentation, however, it is now routinely possible to distinguish between such similar groups using modern single-crystal X-ray diffractometers.|$|E

An overall dimensionless length scale factor R describes the <b>size</b> <b>scale</b> of the Universe {{as a function of}} time; an increase in R is the expansion of the Universe. A curvature index k describes the geometry. The index k is defined {{so that it can be}} only 0, corresponding to flat Euclidean geometry, 1, corresponding to a space of positive curvature, or −1, a space of positive or negative curvature. The value of R as a function of time t depends upon k and the cosmological constant Λ. The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy. The equation describing how R varies with time is known as the Friedmann equation after its inventor, Alexander Friedmann.|$|E

40|$|In {{unicellular}} phytoplankton, the <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> exponent of chlorophyll content per cell decreases {{with increasing}} light limitation. Empirical studies have ex- plored this allometry by combining data from several species, using average values of pigment content and cell size for each species. The resulting allometry thus in- cludes phylogenetic and <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> effects. The possibility of measuring single-cell fluorescence with imaging-in-flow cytometry devices allows {{the study of}} the <b>size</b> <b>scaling</b> of chlorophyll content at both the inter- and intraspecific levels.
