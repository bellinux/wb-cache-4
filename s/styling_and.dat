The visual starts with angle shots of the singer lying on sand, followed by her walking on a field wearing a black dress. Subsequently, the singer poses {{in front of a}} stonewall and performs to the song sporting a transparent jacket and a black leotard. The last scenes show her on a swing, swimming while a sea storm takes place, and her posing in front of a body of water with a black bodysuit on.|$|E
5|$|Kashyap's next {{release was}} Bombay Velvet (2015), a period film set in Bombay in the 1960s, based on Princeton University Historian Gyan Prakash's book Mumbai Fables.

Released on 15 May 2015, the film opened to mixed to negative reception; while critics appreciated its retro-look, performances, <b>styling</b> <b>and</b> music, they criticised its faltered storytelling. It also emerged as a box-office failure.|$|E

40|$|Neural style {{transfer}} {{has drawn}} broad attention in recent years. However, most existing methods aim to explicitly model the transformation between different <b>styles,</b> <b>and</b> the learned model is thus not generalizable to new styles. We here attempt {{to separate the}} representations for <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> contents, and propose a generalized style transfer network consisting of style encoder, content encoder, mixer <b>and</b> decoder. The <b>style</b> encoder <b>and</b> content encoder are used to extract the <b>style</b> <b>and</b> content factors from the <b>style</b> reference images <b>and</b> content reference images, respectively. The mixer employs a bilinear model to integrate the above two factors and finally feeds it into a decoder to generate images with target <b>style</b> <b>and</b> content. To separate the <b>style</b> features <b>and</b> content features, we leverage the conditional dependence of <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> contents given an image. During training, the encoder network learns to extract <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> contents from two sets of reference images in limited size, one with shared <b>style</b> <b>and</b> the other with shared content. This learning framework allows simultaneous style transfer among multiple <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> can be deemed as a special `multi-task' learning scenario. The encoders are expected to capture the underlying features for different <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> contents which is generalizable to new <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> contents. For validation, we applied the proposed algorithm to the Chinese Typeface transfer problem. Extensive experiment results on character generation have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our method...|$|R
5|$|Production {{models in}} {{development}} have included convertibles, crossovers, and dedicated hybrids. Under the F marque, Lexus plans to produce high-performance vehicles with its first expressions being the IS F and the LFA. Lexus officials have also discussed standard production model usage of varying platforms. The LS uses a dedicated platform, while the entry-level Lexus ES had {{been criticized for}} being too similar to the Toyota Camry, with which it shared platforms until its sixth generation, in both <b>styling</b> <b>and</b> powertrain design. The Nürburgring test track in Germany has also seen Lexus prototype testing.|$|E
5|$|To {{address the}} {{relatively}} poor {{reception of the}} preceding AU series, the BA series was heavily updated for launch in September 2002—the same time as its biggest rival, the Holden Commodore (VY). It featured a substantially revised and more conservative exterior styling, with every panel new except for the carry-over door skins. Interiors, too, were substantially revised, while mechanically, a new independent rear suspension setup was fitted to all sedan derivatives and the engine and transmissions received extensive upgrades. In October 2004, Ford introduced a Mark II update, bringing subtle <b>styling</b> <b>and</b> mechanical changes, and in October 2005, replaced the BA with the BF.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its quietness, {{well-appointed}} and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative <b>styling</b> <b>and</b> a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E

5|$|UK {{department}} store retailer Debenhams' collaboration with designers, launched in 1993 under their Designers at Debenhams range, was a success. Hoping to recapture {{some of their}} lost market share, Marks and Spencer (M) asked Everest to review their menswear range. As Creative Consultant, he designed the Sartorial suiting line for their menswear collection. In October 2000, he designed the Autograph suiting line. Noting that the M range consisted of Italian-style suiting, he aimed to achieve a more 'British' look from the cut, fit and <b>styling</b> <b>and</b> by using different fabrics and colours. He also has responsibility for their Luxury collection. During M advertising campaigns, his designs for the Autograph range have been modelled by several British celebrities, including David Beckham, Bryan Ferry, Jimmy Carr, Martin Freeman, Bob Mortimer and Take That. In 2007, M were selected by The Football Association as 'Official Tailor to the England football team' and Everest designed the team's official suits for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between transformational leadership, decision-making <b>styles,</b> <b>and</b> certain outcome using a sample of 98 officers of a large manufacturing organization in India. Results show that transformational leadership is related positively to rational <b>style</b> of decision-making <b>and</b> negatively to avoidant <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> that dependent <b>style</b> moderates {{the relationship between}} rational <b>style</b> <b>and</b> transformational leadership. Findings also reveal that perceived effectiveness of leader and follower's extra effort and satisfaction are related positively to rational <b>style</b> <b>and</b> negatively to avoidant style. Follower's intention to quit the job is positively related to intuitive <b>and</b> avoidant <b>styles.</b> Transformational leadership fully mediates the relationship between rational <b>and</b> avoidant <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> extra effort. Controlling for transformational leadership also results in {{a positive relationship between}} dependent <b>style</b> <b>and</b> intention to quit.

40|$|User-Web {{interactions}} {{have emerged}} as an important area {{of research in the}} field of information science. In this study, we investigate the effects of users’ cognitive styles on their Web navigational <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> information processing strategies. We report results from the analyses of 594 minutes recorded Web search sessions of 18 participants engaged in 54 scenario-based search tasks. We use questionnaires, cognitive style test, Web session logs and think-aloud as the data collection instruments. We classify users’ cognitive <b>styles</b> as verbalisers <b>and</b> imagers based on Riding’s (1991) Cognitive Style Analysis test. Two classifications of navigational <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> three categories of information processing strategies are identified. Our study findings show that there exist relationships between users’ cognitive <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> their navigational <b>styles</b> <b>and</b> information processing strategies. Verbal users seem to display sporadic navigational <b>styles,</b> <b>and</b> adopt a scanning strategy to understand the content of the search result page, while imagery users follow a structured navigational <b>style</b> <b>and</b> reading approach.
