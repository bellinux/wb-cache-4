5|$|The {{bank has}} gained its funding from {{different}} sources, {{and the main}} contributors have shifted over time. In the initial years, donor agencies used to provide the bulk of capital at low rates. By the mid-1990s, the bank <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh. More recently, Grameen has started bond sales {{as a source of}} finance. The bonds are implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and still they are sold above the bank rate. In 2013, Bangladesh parliament passed 'Grameen Bank Act' which replaces the Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983, authorising the government to make rules for any aspect of the running of the bank.|$|E
5|$|Captain Edward Smith – Unveiled in July 1914 at {{the western}} end of the Museum Gardens, the statue was sculpted by Kathleen Scott, wife of Antarctic {{explorer}} Robert Scott. The pedestal is made from Cornish granite and the figure is bronze. This is a memorial to the captain of the RMS Titanic, which sank on 15 April 1912. Captain Smith was from Hanley and Lichfield was chosen as the location for the monument because Smith was a Staffordshire man and Lichfield was the centre of the diocese. The statue originally cost £740 raised through local and national contributions. In 2010, as part of the 'Parks for People' programme, the statue was restored and the green patina removed from its surface at a cost of £16,000. In 2011 an unsuccessful campaign was <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the statue moved back to Captain Smith's home town of Hanley.|$|E
