30|$|Archeological and {{volcanic}} {{materials have}} the potential to acquire a natural remanent magnetization (NRM) that is thermal in origin (termed a thermal remanent magnetization or TRM). TRM is obtained on cooling through a material’s Curie-temperature (Néel temperature) to room temperature and can be preserved over geological timescales depending on the magnetic grain size distribution of a particular material. A TRM can be treated as the summation of blocks of magnetization associated with discrete temperature ranges (called partial TRM or pTRM). In the laboratory it is possible to reverse the magnetization process (demagnetization). By repeatedly heating a material carrying a TRM in a zero-field to increasing temperature steps, pTRMs can be demagnetized and the magnetization history of the material can be recovered. After each temperature application, the magnitude of three orthogonal components of magnetization can be measured at room temperature. If the material records a direction representative of a <b>spot</b> <b>reading</b> of the geomagnetic field (without secondary contamination), the components of magnetization will linearly decrease to zero with increasing temperature and a characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) direction (represented as declination and inclination) can be calculated for a particular temperature step or across a range of temperature steps.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE. It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that crowding, the adverse low-level effect due to the proximity of adjacent stimuli, explains slow reading in low-vision patients with absolute macular scotomas. According to this hypothesis, crowding in the vertical dimension should be released by increasing the vertical spacing between lines of text. However, studies with different experimental paradigms and only a few observers have given discrepant results on this question. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate this issue with a large number of patients whose macular function was carefully assessed. METHODS. MP 1 microperimetry examination was performed for each low-vision patient. Only eyes with an absolute macular scotoma and no foveal sparing (61 patients with AMD, 90 eyes; four patients with Stargardt disease, eight eyes) were included. Maximal reading speed was assessed for each eye with French sentences designed on the MNREAD test principles. RESULTS. The effect of interline spacing on maximal reading speed (MRS) was significant although small; average MRS increased by 7. 1 words/min from standard to double interline spacing. The effect was weak irrespective of PRL distance from the fovea and scotoma area and regardless of whether an eccentric island of functional vision was present within the scotoma. CONCLUSIONS. Increasing interline spacing is advisable only for very slow readers (< 20 words/min) who want to read a few words (<b>spot</b> <b>reading).</b> Vertical crowding does not seem to be a major determinant of maximal reading speed for patients with central scotomas.

40|$|The {{discontinuation}} {{of conventional}} photographic spot-reading transmission densitometers -including the widely adopted X-Rite model 310 - {{due to the}} rapid decrease in demand for analogic photographic laboratory work has had a broadly felt effect in the conservation community. In the cultural heritage conservation field, instruments like the X-Rite 310 are widely used, specifically {{in the performance of}} the Photographic Activity Test (PAT) for the preservation of photographic materials. In the present research, five possible alternate metrics were investigated as substitutes for the increasingly unavailable <b>spot</b> <b>reading</b> transmission densitometers in Status-A readings as mandated by the current PAT. The analyzed metrics were: (1) ratio in reflection using normal illumination geometry and circumferential 45 ° viewing (0 / 45 :c), (2) contrast ratio in reflection using diffuse illumination and 8 ° viewing geometry with specular component included (d/ 8 :i), (3) contrast ratio in reflection using diffuse illumination and 8 ° viewing geometry with specular component excluded (d/ 8 :e), (4) Ortho-transmission densitometry and (5) UV- transmission densitometry. The contrast ratio metric can be obtained with commonly available reflection spectrophotometers, such as the X-Rite 939 and the X-Rite SP 64. The use of contrast ratio metric could open up new possibilities for measurement in the field of art reproduction and cultural heritage preservation to analyze changes in density and opacity. The proposed work analyzed the readings obtained by three measurement instruments: (1) X-Rite 361 T, (2) X-Rite 939 and (3) X-Rite SP 64, in a set of three achromatic transmission step-wedges (15 -Step Transmission Stouffer© Graphic Arts T 1530 CC step-wedge) used as a surrogate for the colloidal silver strip used in the PAT. The goal was to evaluate the performance of the five proposed metrics and geometries as a possible alternative to transmission densitometry measurements when recording data using the Photographic Activity Test. The results indicate that there exists a near-perfect linear relationship between the readings using the X-Rite 361 T in Ortho-transmission densitometry channel and the readings from the Status-A transmission density using the X-Rite 310 across the entire densitometric range represented by the Stouffer wedge. The UV channel measurements also exhibit a near seamless linear regression model with the Status-A readings. Both relationships were found to be statistically significant. On the other hand, the measurements with the setups using contrast ratio measurements did not exhibit the same linear relationship when the entire measurement range is considered. However, in readings of less than. 95 opacity, the contrast ratio measurements did exhibit a meaningful linear relationship when compared to the Status-A transmission readings with a density value of less than 1. 8, albeit still with lower correlation than both readings with the X-Rite 361 T...|$|E
