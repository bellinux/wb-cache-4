In 2006, EPI developed the Institutional <b>Student</b> <b>Retention</b> Assessment (ISRA), {{which serves as}} a web-based campus audit system focused on <b>student</b> <b>retention.</b> The ISRA was developed with funding from Lumina Foundation for Education. That same year, with support from TG, EPI created the Effective Practices in Student Success (EPSS) database. The EPSS currently includes 141 programs from across the US and Canada with evidence-based strategies for postsecondary access and success. In 2007, EPI created the Retention Calculator, which calculates the benefit-cost of saving or losing students in higher education institutions and systems. EPI unveiled the EPI-DAS in 2009, a longitudinal data management system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with GEAR UP and other education initiatives to track individual students, collect and analyze data, and generate reports based on findings. EPI-DAS is designed to meet the reporting requirements of the federal government under the No Child Left Behind Act.|$|E

This research employs a quasi-experimental research, research design The Nonequivalent Control Group Design. The technique of collecting data are used documentation and test. Result of the data is analyzed by using Paired Sample T Test, One Way Anova and Multivariate. The results showed that reciprocal learning group consisting of 69. 48 and <b>student’s</b> <b>retention</b> consisting of 63. 12 with a difference of 6. 35 from the postest value, the group of talk think write consisting of 79. 03, the mean of <b>student’s</b> <b>retention</b> about 67. 5 with a difference of 11. 53 from the postest value, and the control group (speech) it consists of learning outcomes about 70. 31 and the <b>student’s</b> <b>retention</b> about 14. 38 with a difference of 55. 93 from the postest value.

It is an important issue for all institutions due to the potential negative impact on the image of the university and the institution and is great hindrance on the career path of the dropouts.

[...] However, he argues, [...] "sometimes just the facts will do, and the U.S. News manual offers them in great heaps [...] Sarah Lawrence, for example, does not take into consideration SAT or ACT scores. Don't even send 'em, it tells high school students. That tells me all I need to know about Sarah Lawrence. It tells me that Sarah Lawrence doesn't take aptitude as seriously as I'd like. The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone who has taught at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade point averages of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another. But if one college attracted high school students whose SATs averaged 1100 to 1200, and another attracted students with SATs averaging 1300 to 1400, I know the latter is more selective. Sarah Lawrence might not care about such things, but I do." ...|$|E

Multi-staged sampling procedure was used to select a total of 120 (71 female & 49 male) students from three co-educational schools within the study area. The selected students {{were randomly assigned to}} experimental group I (Computer based blended learning in individualised setting) experimental group II (Computer based blended learning in collaborative setting) and the control group (lecture method). A multiple-choice question items on Chemistry that was developed, validated by the Chemistry experts was pilot-tested and a reliability coefficient of 0. 74 was obtained using test re-test method. The achievement test was administered as instrument for data collection to students as pre-test, post-test and retention test.
