5|$|According to Maulana Muhammad Ali's Quranic commentary, there indeed existed a {{group of}} Jews who venerated Ezra as the <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> According to Ali, Qastallani held that in the Kitan al-Nikah, {{that there was a}} party of Jews who held this belief.|$|E

5|$|<b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> was {{distributed}} by the BBC, who broadcast the show on BBC One.

As well as being shown in the UK, <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> was also licensed to New Zealand and seven European territories, including France and Denmark. In the United States, the show was aired by the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story, as a single three-hour special at 8p.m. on 15 April, two weeks after its UK broadcast. It was also repeated in the US on Christmas Day 2002 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in South Africa, along with scriptures and {{philosophical}} texts of Hinduism and other Indian religions, Gandhi read translated texts of Christianity {{such as the}} Bible, and Islam such as the Quran. A Quaker mission in South Africa attempted to convert him to Christianity. Gandhi joined them in their prayers and debated Christian theology with them, but refused conversion stating he did not accept the theology therein or that Christ was the only <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2002, a {{year after}} the show was first {{broadcast}} in the UK, an accompanying book written by Angela Tilby was released. Tilby's book, also titled <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> was a tie-in to the documentary series, and featured an introduction from Bowen. A VHS box set of Jesus: The Complete Story, produced by Warner Home Video, was released in the United States on 15 May 2001. The set was rereleased on Region 1 DVD on 31 August 2004.|$|E

5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents. The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned. <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story as a single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast. The show was also licensed to countries including France, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> {{consists}} of a single series of three episodes. Each episode lasts approximately 50 minutes and documents a different stage of Jesus's life. The episodes take the format of Bowen visiting significant locations {{from the life of}} Jesus, talking head interviews with 21 historians and Biblical experts, and reenactments of Jesus's life featuring Israeli actor Liron Levo. Locations from Jesus's time—such as Caesarea, Yatta and Sepphoris—were recreated by archaeologists using evidence from buildings and street plans, and were then digitised into computer graphics by Red Vision.|$|E
5|$|The demon Tarakasura {{had created}} havoc in the universe, {{and only the}} <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>god</b> Shiva could slay him, but Shiva had turned to ascetic ways {{after the death of}} his first wife, Sati. Kama was thus {{instructed}} by the gods to make Shiva fall in love again. Kama went to Mount Kailash with Rati and Madhu or Vasanta ("Spring"), and shot his love-arrows at Shiva (in another version of the legend, Kama entered Shiva's mind) and invoked desire. Wounded by Kama's arrows, Shiva becomes attracted to Parvati, the reincarnation of Sati, but agitated, burns Kama by a glance of his third eye.|$|E

It was repeated in the US during March the following year, and gained a figure of 1.5million viewers per episode.

5|$|The law {{was used}} {{in at least one}} attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658 a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> and that the miracles {{described}} in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things, but argued that he had only been responding to questions asked of him. He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E
