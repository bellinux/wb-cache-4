5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to <b>see</b> <b>around</b> an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E

The boulevard was to contain activities such as autographs, a -high toboggan run, and photographs with the Vince Lombardi Trophy. As the area was expected to <b>see</b> <b>around</b> 400,000 people, security was increased in the area.|$|E
25|$|Convex mirrors {{provide a}} wider {{field of view}} than flat mirrors, and are often used on vehicles, {{especially}} large trucks, to minimize blind spots. They are sometimes placed at road junctions, and corners of sites such as parking lots {{to allow people to}} <b>see</b> <b>around</b> corners to avoid crashing into other vehicles or shopping carts. They are also sometimes used as part of security systems, so that a single video camera can show more than one angle at a time.|$|E

25|$|These {{were smaller}} settlements, market {{towns and villages}} with defenses, which might collectively be {{described}} as Stadtchen. These occur particularly in Burgenland, but also in Styria, and East Tirol. They are primarily defenses against the Turkish incursions and marauding Hungarian brigands. These walled and defended settlements were mainly constructed in the period between the first siege of Vienna in 1529 and the second siege in 1683. In 1622 the Esterhazy’s succeeded to {{the control of the}} area around Eisenstadt the modern Burgenland and {{in the light of the}} threats from the Turks and the marauding Hungarian groups started the fortification of the larger villages and settlements. At Oggau am Neusiedler See the walls may have started to be built earlier following the Bocskay rebellion in 1605, which had left the small market town devastated. Other settlements in Burgenland to be walled were Rust, (which together with the Altstadt at Eisenstadt) which were now given the special status of “Royal Free Cities” and Purbach and Donnerskirchen. The four settlements – Oggau am Neusiedler See, Purbach, Rust and Donnerskirchen – formed a defended group along the western edge of the Neusiedler <b>See.</b> <b>Around</b> 1640 probably all of these settlements had angled bastions added to the walls for mounted artillery.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Range Rover was given a minor facelift, consisting mainly of redesigned and repositioned switchgear (which saw many of the originally BMW era designed items updated or replaced), along with new options never before available for Range Rover. The 2010 Range Rover also gained new visual display units as also seen in the new for 2010 Jaguar XJ (X351). This change consisted of a 12-inch TFT LCD virtual instrument panel, which replaces the conventional cluster design — instead 'virtual' gauges are displayed where physical analog gauges were previously. This allows various sets of information to be displayed as required — for example navigation and map information can be displayed instead of engine readouts, whilst {{when one of the}} off-road driving modes is selected on the Terrain Response system the 'gauges' are reorganised to provide space to display the schematic of the vehicle's suspension, steering and transmission systems. The other display unit is fitted to the centre console and uses a bi-directional screen to show different images depending on viewing angle (may not be available in the US). This allows navigational information to be displayed to the driver, whilst someone in the front passenger seat can use the same screen to use the onboard DVD player at the same time, for example. This system also contains a state-of-the-art multi-camera system from Valeo Vision Systems in Ireland, which allows the driver to <b>see</b> <b>around</b> the vehicle during manoeuvres and which contains multiple overlays and views.|$|E

500|$|Fiberoptic layngoscopes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} available since the 1990s.

This provides a significant advantage in situations where the operator needs to <b>see</b> <b>around</b> an acute bend in order to visualize the glottis, and deal with otherwise difficult intubations. Video laryngoscopes are specialized fiberoptic layngoscopes that use a digital video camera sensor to allow the operator to view the glottis and larynx on a video monitor. Other [...] "noninvasive" [...] devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are the laryngeal mask airway (used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement) and the Airtraq.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} morning Broderick moved the company down the spur line {{in order to}} establish a firm base, while Beale moved 5 Platoon forward. Four 7.62mm L4A4 Bren light machine-guns were incorporated into the patrol. The Australians encountered a track, beyond which lay the river, while to the north across a shallow creek, movement of the Indonesians could still be heard. The presence of the Indonesians so close to the Australian position made the chances of detection too great and as such no more troops were brought forward. Instead, Beale deployed his platoon into two positions, one covering the track with two Brens in order to secure it from the Indonesians in the re-entrant, as well as another position on a bend in the river. Only the sentry on the right-hand flank, Private Lawrence Jackson, could <b>see</b> <b>around</b> the bend, which narrowed to just [...] at that point.|$|E
500|$|The whale eye is {{relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for [...] colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a [...] tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. In water, a whale can <b>see</b> <b>around</b> [...] ahead of itself, but they have a smaller range above water. They also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.|$|E

Roger Lloyd-Pack told The Daily Mirror that he based the character of Lumic on Donald Rumsfeld: [...] "I thought, 'Who is a power-hungry mad person who believes he is completely right and has a lot of control?'

In some of Plato's dialogues, this is expressed by Socrates, who spoke of forms in formulating {{a solution to the problem}} of universals. The forms, according to Socrates, are archetypes or abstract representations of the many types of things, and properties we feel and <b>see</b> <b>around</b> us, that can only be perceived by reason (...) [...] (That is, they are universals.) In other words, Socrates was able to recognize two worlds: the apparent world, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of forms, which may be the cause of what is apparent.|$|E

With this they were able to penetrate the first door of the southern shaft through the hole drilled in 2002, and view all the sides of the small chamber behind it.
