50|$|<b>Skydrol</b> is an {{advanced}} fire-resistant aviation hydraulic fluid manufactured by Solutia Inc. There are various lines of <b>Skydrol</b> including <b>Skydrol</b> 500B-4, <b>Skydrol</b> LD-4, and <b>Skydrol</b> 5.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skydrol</b> fluids are {{incompatible}} with many plastics and paints, {{which can be}} softened and eventually destroyed by exposure to <b>Skydrol.</b> Some materials (for example, rayon acetate) and rubber-soled shoes may also be damaged by <b>Skydrol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acid and {{contamination}} must {{be monitored}} while using <b>Skydrol,</b> and generally hydraulic systems should be sampled every C check. <b>Skydrol</b> has a 5-year shelf {{life from the}} date of manufacture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skydrol</b> fluids are irritating {{to human}} tissue. Gloves and goggles are {{recommended}} safety equipment when servicing <b>Skydrol</b> systems. If the fluid {{gets on the}} skin it creates an itchy, red rash with a persistent burning sensation. The effects subside within a few hours; egg white {{can be applied to}} the affected area to neutralize the burning. Animal studies have shown that repeated exposure to tributylphosphate, one of the phosphate esters used in <b>Skydrol</b> fluids, may cause urinary bladder damage.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of jet aircraft operating at higher altitudes, and lower external temperatures {{there was a need}} for improved phosphate ester fluids.

50|$|In 1949 Douglas first {{licensed}} Monsanto {{to produce}} a range of <b>Skydrol</b> materials under their patents. In the 1990s Monsanto became primarily a biotechnology company, and an independent chemical producer, Solutia, was created in 1997 to handle its chemical interests, including <b>Skydrol.</b> In 2012, Solutia was acquired by Eastman Chemical.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skydrol</b> {{contains}} {{a small amount}} of a PFOS, which is not listed on the MSDS.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Skydrol</b> {{series of}} {{phosphate}} ester hydraulic fluids were originally {{developed by the}} Douglas Aircraft Company in the late 1940s to reduce the fire risk from leaking high pressure mineral oil-based hydraulic fluids impinging on potential ignition sources. A secondary use for the original <b>Skydrol</b> 7000, now obsolete, was as a fire-resistant lubricant in Douglas-designed cabin pressure superchargers used in the DC-6 and 7 series piston-engined aircraft, and first flight tested by United Airlines in 1949.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skydrol</b> {{is made up}} of a {{group of}} {{chemical}} additives dissolved into a fire-resistant phosphate ester base stock which inhibits corrosion and prevents erosion damage to servo valves and includes a purple or green dye to ease identification. It has been approved by most airframe manufacturers including Airbus, Boeing and BAE Systems and has been used in their products for over 40 years.|$|E
40|$|The {{preliminary}} evaluation of crosslinked polyphenyl quinoxaline (X-PPQ), LARC-TPI, ethyl terminated polysulfone (ETPS), and crosslinked polyimide (X-PI) as adhesives is presented. Lap shear strength stability under thermal, combined thermal/humidity, and stressed and unstressed <b>Skydrol</b> exposure was determined. The X-PPQ, LARC-TPI, and X-PI exhibited good adhesive performance at 505 K (450 F) after 1000 hours at 505 K. These three polymers also performed well after exposure to combined elevated temperature/high humidity, as well as, to <b>Skydrol</b> while under stress. The ETPS exhibited good ambient temperature adhesive properties, but performed poorly under all other exposure conditions, presumably due to inadequate chain extension and crosslinking...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of three phenylquinoxaline polymers as high temperature structural adhesives is presented. These included an experimental crisskubjabke oiktner (X-PQ) and two experimental materials (PPQ- 2501) and (PPQ-HC). Lap shear, crack extension, and climing drum peel specimens were fabricated {{from all three}} polymers, and tested after thermal, combined thermal/humidity, and stressed <b>Skydrol</b> exposure. All three polymers generally performed well as adhesives at initial test temperatures from 219 K (- 67 F) to 505 K (450 F) and after humidity exposure.

40|$|In {{response}} to the increasing environmental concem {{about the use of}} and disposal of hazardous chromates in coatings, a novel solvent based epoxy primer without containing chromates was developed. It was intended to meet MIL-P- 23377 G Type I, Class N specification with the VOC at 340 g/l. This coating is highly flexible and yet passes 6 months <b>Skydrol</b> immersion test. Other properties include outstanding solvent resistance, low application viscosities, long pot life, low density and excellent corrosion protection. It is compatible with MIL-C- 85285 B urethane topcoat. The use of strontium chromate in anti-corrosion primers is well known. The somewhat limited solubility in water of strontium chromate, 5 x 10 " moles chromate ion, makes itself as an effective passivating pigment. However, the hexavalent chromium is also {{considered one of the most}} carcinogenic compounds. The emission of chromate can be found in the coating applications, metal treatment (e. g. alodine, anodized aluminum), and welding of stainless steel. ' Increasingly stringent environmental and worker safety regulation^'^^^ ^ have encouraged metal pretreatment and coating manufacturers to look for chromate alternatives. '. ' A strontium chromate free coating technology has been reported! This "cleaner " technology led this laboratory to formulate a QPL (qualified product list) low density water-borne non-chromate epoxy primer to meet and exceed MIL-P- 85582 B Type I Class N Specification. " Water-bome epoxy primers are useful in many ways. They provide excellent corrosion resistance, ease to clean, fast drying, and longer pot life. However, an essential limitation was the lack of prolonged fluid resistance such as <b>Skydrol.</b> Therefore, attempts have been made in this laboratory to develop a high solids fluid resistant solvent-based epoxy system for aerospace applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{use of a}} HTP (High Temperature Performance) ceramic foam for aeroacoustic {{applications}} is investigated. HTP ceramic foam is {{a composition}} of silica and alumina fibers developed by LMMS. This foam is a lightweight high-temperature fibrous bulk material with small pore size, ultra high porosity, and good strength. It {{can be used as}} a broadband noise absorber at both room and high temperature (up to 1800 F). The investigation included an acoustic assessment as well as material development, and environmental and structural evaluations. The results show that the HTP ceramic foam provides good broadband noise absorbing capability and adequate strength when incorporating the HTP ceramic foam system into a honeycomb sandwich structure. On the other hand, the material is sensitive to <b>Skydrol</b> and requires further improvements. Good progress has been made in the impedance model development.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of 3 experimental polymers from NASA-Langley and a commercially produced polymer from Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals as high temperature structural adhesives is presented. A polyphenylquinoxaline (PPQ), polyimide (STPI/LaRC- 2), and a polyarylene ether (PAE-SO 2) were evaluated as metal-to-metal adhesives. Lap shear, crack extension, and climbing drum peel specimens were fabricated {{from all three}} polymers and tested after thermal, combined thermal/humidity, and stressed hydraulic fluid (<b>Skydrol)</b> exposure. The fourth polymer, LARC-TPI was evaluated as an adhesive for titanium honeycomb sandwich structure.

40|$|Recently, {{air quality}} {{regulations}} have prompted significant efforts by coatings resin producers and coatings manufacturers {{to develop new}} low Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) coatings. One approach has been to develop water-borne polyurethanes having performance approaching that of solvent-borne coatings. Several water-borne resins were tested in white topcoat formulations versus solvent-borne controls (MIL-C- 83286 and Deft 1 -COAT). Selected chemical resistance and flexibility tests were performed to determine whether solvent-borne performance could be achieved in a water-borne formulation. Coatings were formulated with and without crosslinkers to determine whether chemical resistance could be improved without sacrificing flexibility. In general, chemical resistance of the water-bornes was {{not as good as}} that of the solvent-borne controls; all formulations failed 7 days ’ immersion in <b>Skydrol</b> 500 B. Crosslinking tended to improve chemical resistance but in some cases decreased flexibility of the coatings. An aziridine-crosslinked formulation performed best but is undesirable because of potential health risks associated with aziridines. With additional development, water-borne coatings should be able to satisfy performance requirements of the military specification for high-solids polyurethane topcoats, MIL-C- 85285...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} the present work is to {{investigate}} the possible effects of manufacturing and in-service induced reduction of bonding quality on the mechanical performance of composite bonded joints appearing in aeronautical applications, due to defects that cannot be detected sufficiently by means of conventional NDT. To this end, an experimental program has been conducted to measure mode-I interlaminar fracture toughness of adhesively bonded CFRP laminates. Five different representative scenarios have been considered; namely, poor curing of the adhesive, release agent contamination and moisture uptake by the composite substrates, which may occur during manufacturing of the joints, as well as <b>Skydrol</b> contamination and thermal degradation of the composite substrates, which are related to in-service life and could affect an adhesively bonded repair. Eight specimens for each scenario were tested. To assess the effects of each scenario, the experimental results have been compared with relative measurements taken from a set of reference specimens. Prior to mechanical testing, and the conventional NDT techniques, ultrasound C-scan and X-ray tests have been conducted to assess {{the quality of the}} bondline. All scenarios considered in the present study have been found to {{have an effect on the}} mode-I fracture toughness of the composite bonded joints. It was also shown that conventional NDT, such as ultrasonic and X-ray inspection, are not capable to sufficiently detect the defects resulting from the specific scenarios considered and being responsible for the reduction of joint's performance...|$|E
40|$|Sorption {{thermodynamics}} {{of water}} in polymers is a subject of primary interest both from a fundamental {{point of view and}} for its practical implications. In fact, several polymer matrices, when exposed to a humid environment, absorb significant amounts of water which adversely affect most physical- mechanical properties. In this thesis, modelling of water sorption thermodynamics in high performance glassy thermoplastic matrices of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyetherimide (PEI) and equilibrium water sorption in miscible PEEK/PEI blends as a function of blend ratio, has been investigated. Equation of state theories originally developed to interpret thermodynamics of mixtures at equilibrium, namely Sanchez-Lacombe Hydrogen Bonding (SLHB) and Non Random Hydrogen Bonding (NRHB), have been extended to the case of glassy polymer- low molecular weight penetrant mixtures, displaying possible hydrogen bonding interactions (HB). To this aim, the approach developed by Doghieri and Sarti in deriving the Non Equilibrium Theory for Glassy Polymers (NETGP), which is based on thermodynamics of internal state variables, has been adopted to extend the equilibrium models to out-of-equilibrium glassy systems, resulting in NETGP-SLHB and NETGP-NRHB theories. Making reasonable choices about the selected internal state variables and based on critical assumptions concerning the rate of evolution of these variables, it has been possible to obtain workable equations which have been used to interpret water sorption isotherms in PEEK and PEI, determined at temperatures ranging from 30 to 70 C°. For comparative purposes the Non-Equilibrium Lattice Fluid theory (NELF), which does not account for possible interactions between the components, has been also employed. The NELF model provided an unsatisfactory prediction of sorption isotherms, in view of its inability to reproduce the upward concavity exhibited at high vapor water activities, which is related to clustering of absorbed water molecules. Conversely, NETGP-SLHB and NETGP-NRHB models provided a good fitting of equilibrium sorption isotherms in the whole activity range investigated. In particular, differently from the NELF theory, the models displayed the same upward concavity as the experimental data. This improvement is to be ascribed to the HB contributions to the Gibbs energy. Once the best fitting parameters have been determined from experimental sorption isotherms, the developed models have been used to predict the amount of self-HB and cross-HB interactions occurring at equilibrium in the mixtures as a function of water mass fraction absorbed within polymers. At low water concentration cross-HB interactions prevailed while the water self-HB interactions increased their importance as total water concentration increased. For the PEI/water system the theoretical predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results obtained from FTIR spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements of PEEK/PEI mixtures showed a single glass transition temperature that increased with enhancing PEI content, confirming the complete miscibility in the amorphous state of components. The equilibrium water sorption in the blends decreased with increasing PEEK content and the sorption isotherms showed trends similar to those of neat components. At high activities the isotherms exhibited an upward concavity due to clustering of water molecules and not to plasticization effects in view of the low amount of water absorbed and of the very high glass transition temperature of the mixtures. On PEEK/PEI blends a study to evaluate their chemical resistance in <b>Skydrol,</b> Jet-fuel and methyl-ethyl-ketone (MEK) has been also performed. These solvents were chosen to represent a range of chemically aggressive environments that high performance polymers may encounter in aeronautic applications. Sorption kinetics showed modest absorptions of <b>Skydrol</b> and low absorptions of Jet-fuel for PEEK and PEI, while the blends exhibited a small weight lost, which decreased with enhancing the amount of PEEK. Conversely, higher absorptions were recorded with MEK, mainly for PEI and for blends rich in PEI...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{aerospace}} industry already has experience with adhesive bonding on carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) technology, a great potential for the manufacturing of high-loaded structures exists. A prerequisite for such an application is {{that the quality of}} the adhesive bond can be controlled. Several non-destructive testing (NDT) methods exist for the characterisation of defects like pores, delamination or debonding within adhesive bond. No existing NDT technique however allows a control of the optimal physical and chemical properties of the adherend surface yet, which is believed to be decisive in the mechanical performance of the adhesive bond. This lack is an obstacle to a wider application of adhesive bonding technology. Therefore, to ensure the optimal properties of the adhesive bond, that are depending on the adhesive and the adherend surface properties, "new" NDT methods for the characterisation of the adherend CFRP surface need to be developed. This paper covers some recent research activities led in this field within Fraunhofer and Airbus Operations GmbH. Preliminary test programs were launched in accordance with Airbus standards in order to reveal the potential of a few pre-selected "new" NDT technologies. They involved also comparison between conventional laboratory measurements and mechanical destructive tests for the correlation of the contamination and damage effects on the CFRP. Tests have been performed on 3 different applications scenarios: moisture uptake in CFRP, thermal damage in CFRP, Skydrol/Water contamination in CFRP. First results demonstrated that portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), Laser-induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) were able to detect traces of <b>Skydrol</b> contamination while a portable Infrared Spectrometer was successfully implemented in all experimental cases, from the systematic detection of heat damaged composites to different moisture contents. Interesting results were also obtained from other technologies such as active thermography. This approach relying on the characterisation of properties of the composite material has shown interesting possibilities so that further development of each technology is running and shall provide even better results in the future...|$|E
