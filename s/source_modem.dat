40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an historical}} {{inquiry into the}} role played by new building materials in the formation of architectural modernism in France. It proceeds on the theoretical assumption that a "material" is not a technical given [...] a securely defined entity in the physical and linguistic senses [...] but an architectural construct whose "inherent properties" are a matter of interpretation. It suggests that within a specific architectural culture, the conceptions and uses of a material are defined by concerns that are not only constructional but involve architectural doctrines, building practices, aesthetic projects, and cultural strategies. Since the publication of Sigfried Giedion's Bauen in Frankreich. Bauen in Eisen. Bauen in Eisenbeton (1928), reinforced concrete has been commonly accepted as the common denominator of French modernism. The dissertation questions this interpretive assumption, focusing on the changing conceptions of the material as an index of transformations in French architecture and architectural culture. It covers a period that spans from the Universal Exhibition of 1889 to the early 1930 s, a period which saw the development of reinforced concrete in French architecture, from its emergence within architectural discourses to its inscription within early modernist historiography. Through a close examination of contemporary books and periodicals, unpublished sources, and graphic documents, the dissertation explores the theories and works that framed the critical relationship of new material to French modernism. Inaugurated with the late nineteenth-century demise of metal as the leading material in architectural theory, the preeminence of reinforced concrete in French architecture was marked by the dispersion of rationalist tenets into competing architectural programs. The First World War was a pivotal event in this process. Of principal importance were the positions of Auguste Perret and Le Corbusier. While Perret insisted on continuity with prewar practices, emphasizing the role of craft production, Le Corbusier embraced the rupture brought about by the societe machinique, shifting towards the idea of industrialized construction. These positions were key to the technical and aesthetic definition of the modem house, from the function of the concrete frame to the nature of external revetments. They also led the way to the cultural and ideological debates that ensued on the nationality of the material and the <b>sources</b> of <b>modem</b> architecture. In the late 1920 s the return of metal merely underscored the "rhetoric of materials" in the definition of French modernism. by RÃ©jean Legault. Thesis (Ph. D.)

In contrast to the more frequently studied missionary <b>sources</b> for early <b>modem</b> Japan, the East India Company records shed light {{on a number of}} issues of cultural interest to the historian. Questions addressed in this study include the image of the Japanese in the Hirado sources, the attempts of British merchants to learn the Japanese language, relations with local servants, the type of food consumed and clothes worn in the factory, sexual relations with local consorts, perceptions of law and order in Japan and impressions of both Buddhism and Japanese Christian converts. Where appropriate, the themes covered in the Hirado letters are studied in the light of recent scholarship on domestic issues in England. This thesis challenges the assumption that overseas Europeans made little cultural adaptation to their new home, and points out the danger of judging Jacobean attitudes towards nonEuropeans based on a small number of literary texts. Historians of the European presence in Japan during this period have continually noted the cultural-anthropological potential of the Hirado documents, yet until now they have only been the subject of narrative works. The historiography exammmg European contacts with non-European peoples in this period concentrates overwhelmingly on colonial encounters in North America, in which Europeans lived segregated lives, and characteristically viewed the natives as barbarians. The situation in much of Asia was very different. Not only was Japan militarily powerful, it was clearly civilized according to the canons of contemporary geographical literature. Hence, the letters of transient merchants within a powerful Asian society reveal a far greater extent of cultural interaction than reports of European settlers in colonial societies...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of ethnohistorical <b>sources,</b> <b>modem</b> pollen rain, fossil pollen, contemporary vegetation patterns and. thedistribution of Aboriginal sites enabled a moc;tel of Holocene vegetation change in northeastern Tasmania to be developed. The influential hypotheses of fire stick farming and ecological drift are {{shown to be}} generally resiliant and worthwhile but in need of adjustment to account for local and regional variations in environmental and cultural practices. A more recent theory in which Aborigines were forced out of southwestern Tasmania at about 12, 000 BP by expanding Holocene forests is re-evaluated {{in the light of}} evidence which suggests that forests may have developed earlier than previously thought and that Aborigines, forests and fire in Tasmania have had a long co-existence. A study of all available Tasmanian ethnohistorical sources pertaining to Aboriginal burning of vegetation revealed a pattern of Aboriginal land use from ca. 1 n 3 - 1830 which was more complex than previously thought. In northeastern Tasmania, fire was used in a fashion corresponding to the position of sites along an altitudinal gradient from sea level to 1, 500 m. A close reading of the available information reveals that present day ecologists and archaeologists often use ethnohistorical references concerning fire in an uncritical manner. A number of crucial historical incidents in which European mariners sighted devastating fires and dense clouds of smoke are reinterpreted as defensive responses by Aborigines to the presence of Europeans, rather than a normal modus operandi. These sources cannot therefore be taken to indicate a traditional use of fire. Historical sources suggest that Aboriginal life in Tasmania revolved around a complete familiarity with forests. Previous research has highlighted the importance of coastlines for settlement, and that forests, especially wet forests, were inimical to Aboriginal settlement objectives. The analysis emphasises that Aboriginal fire regimes differed across the state according to social perogatives as well as to environmental determinants. Archaeological surveys and limited excavations were conducted in order to date the commencement of Aboriginal site formation in coastal, inland and mountainous environments. It was discovered that coastal sites in the northeast date to the last 3, 000 years of the Holocene. Sites which are located on the margins of lunette fringed lagoons and shallow freshwater lagoons date from about 6, 000 years BP to ca. 8, 500 BP. In the highlands of the northeast, rockshelters are dated to 1, 600 years BP. Prior to an investigation of fossil pollen to determine vegetation changes over the same range of times, Tauber pollen traps were placed in a selection of representative vegetation communities in the northeast. The results of this study were used to form analogues against which fossil pollen assemblages were compared. In this way it was possible to reconstruct past vegetation associations with a degree of precision not available by the {{analysis of}} fossil pollen alone. Analyses from a coastal lagoon, an inland marsh, two highland bogs and sediment from an Aboriginal site revealed patterns of vegetation change which drew attention to the effects of Aboriginal burning on the landscape. A 10, 500 year old pollen sequence from the coastal lagoon suggested that the vegetation had changed from a pre-Holocene Poaceae dominated steppe complex, to a Eucalyptus forest, and finally to an Allocasuarina dominated coastal heathland. The final change to heathland occurred at 6, 500 years BP. This date is synchronous with the stabilization of sea levels, increases in inorganic input into lagoon sediments, major peaks in Typha spp. pollen and the commencement of Aboriginal occupation on lagoon margins. The present day structure of the vegetation is likely to have resulted from a complex interaction between environmental variables and the burning of forests and heathlands by Aborigines. Eucalyptus forests surrounding a small closed basin at 80 m altitude in the hinterland have existed virtually unchanged for 4, 000 years. Further evidence suggests that these forests may have been extant for at least 13, 000 years. Increases in regional wet forest and rainforest pollen taxa point to a change in climate at about 3, 500 BP which allowed an expansion of wet forest communities. This is supported by increases in local spore percentages which show that the hydrology of the basin changed to allow the development of a Sphagnum bog. The humid phase is thought to have continued for a maximum of about 1, 000 years, after which time drier climates prevailed. It is possible that decreases in temperature rather than increases in precipitation were responsible for the perturbation. Throughout the 4, 000 year long sequence, high levels of carbonized particles indicates that burning by Aborigines was continuous. Pollen from a short core obtained from a highland bog surrounded by wet eucalypt and rainforest communities, showed a transition from grassland or grassy woodland to wet forest at about 3, 000 BP. It is thought that burning of local forests by Aborigines altered the local hydrology sufficiently to create a mire at about 5, 500 years BP. Continued burning maintained an open grassy formation for 2, 000 years. The abandonment of the site by Aborigines as a place for frequent burning {{led to the development of}} forests in which wet forest taxa predominated and where fires were less frequent but more intense. Sediment from a highland buttongrass moor adjacent to a 1, 600 year old Aboriginal site was analysed for pollen. The sequence displays little vegetation change since the onset of organic accumulation 1, 600 years ago. Synchrony between the two dates provides the first direct palaeoecological evidence that Aboriginal burning practices were involved in the creation and maintainence of buttongrass moorlands in Tasmania. The pollen and archaeological evidence, in combination with the analysis of ethnohistorical sources demonstrate that forests and Aborigines have a long history of coexistence. Aboriginal fires had major effects on delicately poised coastal ecosystems and lesser effects on inland lowland forests. In elevated locations with high rainfall and fertile soil, fire was employed to produce small treeless patches. Burning on poorly drained infertile sites is thought to have initiated hydrological changes which resulted in the creation of limited areas of sedgeland...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We compare {{geodetic}} and single-station {{methods of}} measuring dynamic deformations and characterize their causes {{in the frequency}} bands 0. 5 - 1. 0 Hz and 4. 0 - 8. 0 Hz. The geodetic approach utilizes data from small-aperture s ismic arrays, applying techniques from geodesy. It requires relatively few assumptions and a pr ior i information. The single-station method uses ground velocities recorded at isolated or single stations and assumes all the deformation is due to plane-wave propagation. It also requires knowledge of the azimuth and horizontal velocity of waves arriving at the recording station. Data employed come from a small-aperture, dense seismic array deployed in Geyokcha, Turkmenistan, and include seismograms recorded by broadband STS 2 and short-period L 28 sensors. Poor agreement between geodetic and single-station estimates in the 4. 0 - 8. 0 Hz passband indicates that the displace-ment field may vary nonlinearly with distance over distances of- 50 m. STS 2 ge-odetic estimates provide a robust standard in the 0. 5 - 1. 0 Hz passband because {{they appear to be}} computationally stable and require fewer assumptions than single-station estimates. The agreement between STS 2 geodetic estimates and single-station L 28 estimates i surprisingly good for the S-wave and early surface waves, suggesting that the single-station analysis hould be useful with commonly available data. These results indicate that, in the 0. 5 to 1. 0 Hz passband, the primary source of dynamic deformation is plane-wave propagation along great-circle source-receiver paths. For later arriving energy, the effects of scattering become important. The local structure beneath the array exerts a strong control on the geometry of the dynamic deformation, implying that {{it may be difficult to}} infer <b>source</b> characteristics of <b>modem</b> or pa-leoearthquakes from indicators of dynamic deformations. However, strong site con-trol also suggests that the dynamic deformations may be predictable, which would be useful for engineering seismically resistant structures...|$|R

40|$|The Ikkattoq gneisses of the Archaean gneiss {{complex in}} the Nuuk region, {{southern}} West Greenland, are the orthogneiss component within the amphibolite facies Tre Brodre terrane. They have mostly granodioritic compositions, {{with a small amount}} of quartz diorite. Sm-Nd isotopic data for a quartz diorite and five granodiorite Ikkattoq gneiss samples from within 5 km of the Ikkattoq (fjord) type locality yielded a regression with a slope equivalent to 2005 +/- 52 Ma (MSWD = 0. 72). Regardless of the low MSWD, this cannot be the true age of the Ikkattoq gneisses, because all Ikkattoq gneisses yield U-Pb zircon dates of c. 2825 Ma and they are cut by the undeformed 2560 Ma Qorqut granite complex. This anomalously young regression 2 Ì† 7 age 2 Ì† 7 resulted instead from mixing of different Nd components, indicating that the Ikkattoq gneisses are derived from mixed source materials. Taking the true age of the Ikkattoq gneisses as 2825 Ma from U-Pb zircon dating, the range of initial epsilon(Nd) in the Ikkattoq gneisses is - 7. 1 to - 1. 8. The negative initial epsilon(Nd) values mean that older, light rare earth enriched, sialic crust contributed to the igneous precursors of the Ikkattoq gneisses. This Nd evidence for contribution of older sialic crust is supported by positive epsilon(Sr) values for the Ikkattoq gneisses. With epsilon(Nd) values as low as - 7. 1 this older crustal component has to be Eoarchaean. The presence of scarce quartz diorites (low SiO(2), high MgO) suggests that ultramafic rocks (upper mantle?), metasomatised by the passage of fluids or silicic melts, were another contributing source. The Ikkattoq gneisses are proposed as a complex suite incorporating material derived from melting of much older sialic crust and probably upper mantle. The intercalation of tectonostratigraphic terranes during collisional orogeny at c. 2720 Ma destroyed the architecture of this 2825 Ma magmatic system, and the Ikkattoq gneisses now form a slice tectonically isolated from their source region. In terms of trace element parameters, the Ikkattoq gneisses resemble Phanerozoic volcanic arc granites. Thus an Andean-style arc setting for the generation of the Ikkattoq gneiss precursors is possible. Other Archaean TTG suites of the Nuuk region are generally thought to represent predominantly juvenile additions to the crust. In the broadest sense they do, because isotopic work over the past 30 years has demonstrated that they do not represent wholesale recycling of considerably older crust. However in detail, within these broadly juvenile suites, a contribution from older crust can be detected. Thus, c. 3000 Ma type-Nuk gneisses from around Nuuk town show a spread in epsilon(Nd) values down to - 1. 7. In this case, the likely older crustal component was 3230 Ma quartz diorite that occurs as enclaves in the c. 3000 Ma suite. Thus to a lesser or greater degree, some Meso- to Neoarchaean TTG suites in the Nuuk region display the same internal complexities and evidence for mixed <b>sources</b> as <b>modem</b> arc suites developed near the margins of older crust.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the realist {{dimension}} {{for the study of}} image in modem Sudanese poetry. This attitude developed in a period which is considered the richest and multidimensional phase of Sudanese poetry. Sudanese poets and specially the poets of socialist realism contributed towards modem Arabic poetry to demonstrate its uniqueness through their search for a new language and new themes. It subsequently led them to revolt against the classical structure of Arabic poetry. They turned towards pre-Islamic African heritage which was lying asleep in their intuition in their search for new language and new ideas to add a new <b>source</b> for <b>modem</b> Arabic poetry. The introduction of the thesis -Image in Realist Dimension in Modem Sudanese Poetry: a Stylistic Study- {{deals with the}} explanation of some of the basic terminologies such as imagination and its relation with the image, rhetoricians and critic's understanding of the term image both in classical and modem sense, stylistic study of the literary texts, and meaning of the term realism in poetry. As far as the relationship and between the imagination and the image and its function is concerned, it becomes clear during the study of the subject that poetic image is the creation and innovation of the imagination which has the potential to bring out new and varied ideas from the same object, analyzes it, decomposes it and again unites it according to the poet's own vision and thinking. In the same way, the image transmits imaginative ideas to the reader. Modem Arabic criticism has borrowed this understanding of the image from modem European critics. The Arabic lexicons do not refer to such a meaning of the term image as we have pointed out above. Rather these refer to the condition through which we get an image preserved and recorded in our mind either in state of being awaken or dream. The Muslim philosophers also paid attention to the explanation of term imagination in their works. They divide the perceiving force into two kinds: 1 - Power that perceives the external objects with the help of five senses. 2 - Power that perceives from within with the help of five powers namely phantasia, fantasy, imagination, illusion and memory. These five forces preserve the images of the objects with all the details which remain stored inside it. These objects, then, become the field where the imagination plays its role. The word imagination among the Muslim philosophers is associated with a derogatory sense of deception and exaggeration Hence the use of imagination, in their view, beautifies, decorates and embellishes the poetry. It is explained that for the comprehension of the term "imagination', Muslim philosophers depended on Aristotle's ideas that he presented in his book "al-Naft" and specially his discussion about the forces that perceive from the external as well as internal world and narration of the functions of each. In the same way, it is explained that this idea of imagination was transferred from philosophy to the rhetoric and criticism. The idea overshadowed the opinions of some of the literary critics and rhetoricians when they tried to explain the function of poetic imagination and its role in the formation of poetic image. The derogatory sense that was attached to imagination caused a degradation in the status of poetry among some of the critics and they looked down upon it with doubt and reservations. They considered it as false in the guise of truth. This attitude cannot generally be applied to all the critics and rhetoricians but it was the attitude of a minority of them. Some of them believed that we should not expect any factual statements from the poet and we should only enjoy with his new and innovative ideas because the field of illusions is vast open before him than the truth which is limited and can not afford imaginative treatment. About the meaning of image among the classical critics and rhetoricians, it is mentioned that sensualism was the most important tendency among the classical poets and critics for the understanding of the poetic image. Basically, the image depends upon the words that are comprehendible through senses, be these the words explaining some objects or some descriptions. So, a successful poetic image in their view is that in which the poet finds out the similarities between the two objects which can be understood by the senses. It is also mentioned that the classical critics and rhetoricians faced some problems while they wanted to analyze the poetic image {{from the point of view}} of similarity. Because they understood the metaphor on the basis of the idea of similarity and they tried to find out the similarities between the two objects whereas there was no point of similarity. This concept led them to consider the metaphoric image as the simile whereas in reality, there is no point of similarity in a metaphor. The purpose in structuring an image is not to explain an idea which cannot be comprehended by the senses, rather the purpose is to interpret a meaning which can not be interpreted without the image. On the other hand, the modern critics do not give any importance to sensualism in understanding the poetic image. The similarities between the two objects of the image are not paid any attention and specially the apparent sensual similarity is not searched for. The reason is that the poet makes his image of two objects which obviously have no similarity and the imagination of the poet creates a relationship between the two. The imagination has a vital role to play in the formation of such images. The power of imagination brings closer two very different objects and it finds out a relationship between though apparently there seems no logical relationship between the two. Indeed, the poet goes on to discover very subtle relationships with the help of imaginative power. An innovative poet catches the glimpse of the material world and recreates it according to his own spiritual and mental approach which eventually makes the image as an original and pure creation of his mind. Image in this modern sense is created by mixing the elements and objects having different qualities to form a new product which is distinct in its nature and properties from the earlier elements. The basic function of the poetic image, because of this, has become to present a picture of the inner microcosm of the poet. Secondly, it reveals the world view of the poet with all the minor details. In the light of the above understanding of the image, the modern criticism has offered a new definition of metaphor. The metaphor is a kind of relationship between the external world and the internal feelings and emotions of the poet. Such an understanding of the metaphor leads the poet to assign human features to non-living objects and it is done through borrowing those linguistic phrases which are used to express the conditions of human life and then applying them on material objects from the nature. Because of this definition, the metaphors is considered as one of the artistic devices which is used by the modem poet in the formation of his image which enriches the implicit and interpretive value. In the same manner, the method of stylistic study of the text is also explained. It is clearly stated that the stylistical study aims at the construction of language in a literary text. It is because a literary text is after all a linguistic text which has its own system and construction. We can not go deep into the meaning of a text unless we analyze its linguistic construction. It means that the literary critic pays more attention to the internal construction of the text more than the external elements also. We have mentioned the nature of relationship between stylistics and modem linguistic studies. It is explained that stylistic studies texts according to modem linguistic levels. The construction of the text mainly comprises the letters, words, sentences etc. In this situation, the role of the stylistic critic is to analyze what the poet has selected and which makes his text distinct from others keeping in view the stylistic features that appear in the text and those that, the phonological, lexical, syntactical and semantic deviations, the implicit value that these deviations have, parallelism in the text and the rhythm. The stylistic critics care about the title of the poems as it is the first step towards the understanding of the poetic text and the first signal that the poet transmits to the reader. Secondly, the context of a work throws light upon the meaning of that work through linguistic and social and civilizational usage. Regarding the concept of realism in poetry, it is explained that in the beginning it was considered the mere copying of the details of nature giving the kodak camera image of the reality and this was called as naturalism. This concept did not last for long, and the new concept was that realism is not photographic imitation but the creation in which poet's imagination plays the most vital role It is so, because the poet is not just a person who observes the objects, indeed he mixes his observation with his mental and spiritual build up. This kind of realism is known as realism of consciousness which means that the art is the creation of the inner-self of the poet and it reveals his specific view. The socialist realism is the most recent face of realism. The main concern of the artist is to highlight the clash of the classes. This realism voices the concern for the working class and the poet himself should be from the same class.
