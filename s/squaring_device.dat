50|$|These {{distorting}} {{effects may}} be better mitigated by using another modulation scheme that {{takes advantage of the}} differential <b>squaring</b> <b>device</b> nature of the nonlinear acoustic effect. Modulation of the second integral of the square root of the desired baseband audio signal, without adding a DC offset, results in convolution in frequency of the modulated square-root spectra, half the bandwidth of the original signal, with itself due to the nonlinear channel effects. This convolution in frequency is a multiplication in time of the signal by itself, or a squaring. This again doubles the bandwidth of the spectra, reproducing the second time integral of the input audio spectra. The double integration corrects for the -ω² filtering characteristic associated with the nonlinear acoustic effect. This recovers the scaled original spectra at baseband.|$|E

These devices may be electrical, mechanical, hydraulic or any combination of these. The thesis is confined to electrical <b>square</b> law <b>devices,</b> which {{are by far the}} most numerous. The input and output quantities are usually represented as voltages or currents. A literature survey was conducted and a large number of different types of <b>square</b> law <b>devices</b> were revealed. These have been classified into sections, depending on the mode of squaring, and each has been examined for various properties. Some devices have been examined theoretically, and others by actually developing and constructing a circuit and taking a series of measurements, in each case a conclusion is drawn concerning the accuracy, frequency response and dynamic range. This classification and examination of <b>square</b> law <b>devices</b> showed that, although there were many devices excelling in one property, there were very few having excellent all round performance. Either a method for improving the performance of existing devices or a completely new device with excellent all round properties would be needed to improve the position, it was decided to attempt to develop a method to improve the properties of existing devices, and the last and major section of the thesis is devoted to the treatment of a method for reducing distortion due to odd powers in the nominal square law transfer function.
