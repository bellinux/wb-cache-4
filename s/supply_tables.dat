The space between the rows is restricted to dealers and other casino personnel. Besides dealers, the pit personnel include game supervisors, still called by their traditional title of [...] "floorman" [...] (even though many are now women); clerks who man computer terminals where information about players and tables is input; a pit manager (or [...] "pit boss") who supervises the entire pit; and various other personnel who are {{in and out of}} the pit to <b>supply</b> <b>tables</b> with chips, empty money boxes, and perform other maintenance tasks.Pits may vary in size, depending on the size of the casino, but are typically eight to twelve blackjack-sized tables or six to eight large craps or roulette tables. At the end of each pit may be nothing more than a barrier keeping the public out, or another game table facing a cross aisle. Small casinos may feature only one pit, while larger resorts in Las Vegas, Atlantic City or Monte Carlo may have a dozen or more, with pits devoted to a single game such as craps or roulette.|$|E

30|$|Many {{economic}} models (e.g., {{computable general equilibrium}} models, econometric input–output models) {{revolve around}} a matrix of technical coefficients.

Nevertheless, the enlargement of a yearly yet existing survey with a wide coverage of firms, such as the Annual Regional Accounts in Andalusia (Spain), elaborated by the Institute of Statistics of Andalusia, can provide two important advantages at a low cost: the estimation of interregional trade for a certain region and the estimation of the structure of distributive channels for each product and industry, both on a yearly basis.

40|$|Extending and generalizing {{the results}} of {{rational}} equations, Dynamics of Third Order Rational Difference Equations with Open Problems and Conjectures focuses on the boundedness nature of solutions, the global stability of equilibrium points, the periodic character of solutions, and the convergence to periodic solutions, including their periodic trichotomies. The book also provides numerous thought-provoking open problems and conjectures on the boundedness character, global stability, and periodic behavior of solutions of rational difference equations. After introducing several basic definitions and general results, the authors examine 135 special cases of rational difference equations that have only bounded solutions and the equations that have unbounded solutions in some range of their parameters. They then explore the seven known nonlinear periodic trichotomies of third order rational difference equations. The {{main part of the}} book presents the known results of each of the 225 special cases of third order rational difference equations.
