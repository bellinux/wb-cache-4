40|$|One of {{the fast}} and {{economical}} ways of putting tunnels or stream crossings under roadways is to use <b>box</b> <b>culverts.</b> <b>Box</b> <b>culverts</b> are structurally rigid, easy to construct, and easy to add length when needed. Because of their simple geometric configuration, precast concrete <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> with various dimensions are commonly used in the U. S. In some cases, non-standard <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> are also used, for which the design document has to be produced per project design specification. The design process of <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> is relatively easy and repetitive because of their typical geometric configuration. In practice, engineers are following exactly the same process with different dimensions and loading conditions to design <b>box</b> <b>culverts.</b> Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is therefore often used to speed up this repetitive calculation process. In India, many designers use STAAD. Pro for the structural analysis of <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> and bring {{the results of this}} analysis to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to carry out the remaining calculations. However, all these cases are dealt separately and a significant amount of time is used {{to come up with the}} final design. In addition, it has been challenging to keep all engineering calculations and drawings of a specific <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> for its lifecycle. One of the solutions that one can come up with for this challenge is to automate the entire design process in one package and keep all design documents in one location. This study presents the Web-based application we developed to 1) automate the <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> design process and 2) keep all design documents in one location. This Web-based application is developed based on Indian Standard codes (IS) and Indian road congress codes (IRC) using ASP. net. This study presents how this application was developed, how it is working, and how it improved the design process of <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> in our tests. This study shows that results obtained from this application are very close to the traditional design process and can be successfully used for designing of <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> in India. Also the study concludes that there is a significant amount of time saving in the design process when this application is used instead of traditional design process...|$|R
40|$|Concrete <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> floor slabs {{are known}} to have {{detrimental}} effects on river and stream hydraulics. Consequences include an aquatic environment less friendly to the passage of fish and other organisms. This has prompted environmental regulations restricting construction of traditional, four-sided <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> structures in rivers and streams populated by protected species. The <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> standard currently used by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) is likely to receive increased scrutiny from federal and state environmental regulators in the near future.

40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the optimal joint positions which can minimize distresses of concrete pavement containing <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> with horizontally skewed angles. METHODS: The concrete pavement containing the <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> with different skewed angles and soil cover depths was modeled by 3 dimensional finite element method. The contact boundary condition was used between concrete and soil structures in addition to the nonlinear material property of soil in the finite element model. A dynamic analysis was performed by applying the self weight of pavement, negative temperature gradient of slab, and moving vehicle load simultaneously. RESULTS: In case of zero skewed angle (0 。), the maximum tensile stress of slab was the lowest when the joint was positioned directly over side of <b>box</b> <b>culvert.</b> In case there was a skewed angle, the maximum tensile stress of slab was the lowest when the joint passed the intersection between side of the <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> and longitudinal centerline of slab.

40|$|Failures of <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> {{under static}} and {{earthquake}} loads can cause significant economic loss. Therefore, {{it is important}} to investigate the soil-culvert interaction of <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> to understand their responses to such loads. The response of buried <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> is a complex soil-structure interaction problem, where the relative stiffness between the soil and the structure is a critical factor. Soil arching is an important aspect of the soil-culvert interaction problem, and results in the redistribution of free-field stresses due to the presence of buried structures and leads to an increase or decrease in the loading around <b>box</b> <b>culverts.</b> A series of static and seismic scaled physical model centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the soil culvert interaction. Two different <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> thicknesses and two Nevada sand relative densities were used to explore the interaction between the sand and <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> under a wide range of different conditions. The static loading consisted of the soil self-weight of and the surcharge from a surface foundation, while the seismic loading considered the application of seven earthquake shaking events for each test. Several sensors were used in these tests, including tactile pressure sensors, LVDTs, accelerometers and strain gauges. A newly developed method for installing the strain gauges inside the <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> model is introduced. The responses of the <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> have been compared for all of the loading conditions. It was observed that the kinematic soil culvert interaction due to the presence of a <b>box</b> <b>culvert,</b> as well as the surface foundation, had a significant effect on reducing the peak ground acceleration at the surface when compared to the free-field peak ground acceleration. The kinematic interaction can provide up to a 50 % reduction and is dependent on the amplitude of the input motion {{at the base of the}} model. Small values for the rocking of the <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> and surface foundation were also observed, and their values changed with the amplitude of the input motion. The values observed for the foundation were higher than those for the culvert, due to the soil confinement. The lateral movement of the foundations increased as the peak ground acceleration at the base of the model increased. The racking deformation ratio of the culvert was found to change with the thickness and therefore the relative stiffness of the culvert and the soil density. Soil pressures measured by different methods were in good agreement and those obtained from the tactile sensors can be considered to bound the expected behaviours. The soil pressure observed on the culvert top slab had a parabolic shape, i. e., higher values at the edges and lower at the center than the theoretical vertical soil pressure. On the side wall, the horizontal soil pressure increased with depth. The soil-culvert interaction factors decreased at the center and increased at the edges of the top slab, as the thickness and the relative stiffness of the culvert decreased. The seismic analysis showed that the seismic bending moment increased as the peak ground acceleration at the model base and the relative stiffness of the culvert increased. The static and seismic responses of the <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> were analyzed using the finite difference code FLAC 2 D and the results matched the experimental responses. The validated numerical model was then used to perform a parametric study, to evaluate the effects of: culvert geometric parameters, foundation locations and soil properties for the static loading and only the culvert geometric parameters for the seismic loading. The results have been evaluated for bending moment, soil pressure and soil culvert interaction factors. Based on these analyses, charts and equations are presented to help in assessing the design values of the static soil pressure, static bending moment, and the seismic bending moments around <b>box</b> <b>culverts.</b> Keywords Soil arching, Soil <b>Culvert</b> Interaction (SCI), <b>box</b> <b>culvert,</b> foundation, Nevada sand, centrifuge modeling, finite difference modeling, kinematic interaction, rocking of structures, racking of culverts, bending moment, soil pressure, soil-culvert interaction factors, geometry effect, foundation effect, soil properties...|$|R

Multiple cell reinforced <b>box</b> <b>culverts</b> are ideal bridge structure if the discharge in a drain crossing the road is large and if the bearing capacity of the soil is low the single <b>box</b> <b>culvert</b> becomes uneconomical because of the higher thickness of the slab and walls.
