40|$|Abstract — This work {{deals with}} an {{enhanced}} Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) scheme designed for satellite communication networks deployed under DVB-RCS. Our contribution defines a DVB-RCS standard-compliant operational framework that, unlike other ap-proaches, fixes some {{structure in the}} general and combi-natorial DBA problem. This results in reduced signalling, increased robustness to PHY-layer changes and reduced complexity of the subsequent allocation. Thereafter, the DBA problem is cast in a mathematical optimization prob-lem and a fast algorithm to solve it is proposed. Moreover, the problem formulation guarantees maximum fairness among users and establishes a link to deal with QoS requirements at higher layers. This cross-layer solution is specially interesting when merging the <b>satellite</b> <b>subnetwork</b> with the Internet TCP/IP-based core network. Results show significant increases in both bandwidth utilization and overall transferred data rate by using the proposed method. Computational time is decreased {{by a factor of}} two when compared to existing solutions. And fi-nally, the advantageous interaction with QoS requirements at higher layers is shown with practical examples. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel cross-layer {{framework}} for opti-mizing the {{dynamic bandwidth allocation}} (DBA) of a digital video broadcast (DVB) -return channel satellite (RCS) system using adaptive coding is proposed. The design of the medium access control (MAC) methods {{taking into account the}} adaptive physical layer and higher layers ’ quality of service (QoS) requirements is cast as an optimization problem by using the network utility maximization (NUM) framework applied within the <b>satellite</b> <b>subnetwork.</b> Hierarchical and global solving procedures fully compliant with the DVB-RCS standard are proposed. They do not only provide minimum bandwidth guarantees but also maximize fairness. Further, they allow a joint optimization of the time slot size and overall system efficiency while minimizing signalling overhead. A reduced computational complexity algorithm to solve the DBA problem is presented. In practical terms, it increases the number of connections with absolute and relative QoS require-ments the system can manage and facilitates the interoperability of the satellite network within an Internet protocol (IP) environment.

40|$|An initial {{evaluation}} of a TDMA satellite broadcast architecture with an integrated ground network is proposed in this study as one option for the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN). The architecture proposed consists of a ground based network that {{is dedicated to the}} reception and transmissions of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) messages from Mode-S or UAT type systems, along with tracks from primary and secondary surveillance radars. Additionally, the ground network could contain VHF Digital Link Mode 2, 3 or 4 transceivers for the reception and transmissions of Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) messages and for voice. The second part of the ATN network consists of a broadcast satellite based system that is mainly dedicated for the transmission of surveillance data as well as En-route Flight Information Service Broadcast (FIS-B) to all aircraft. The system proposed integrates those two network to provide a nation wide comprehensive service utilizing near term or existing technologies and hence keeping the economic factor in prospective. The next few sections include a background introduction, the ground subnetwork, the <b>satellite</b> <b>subnetwork,</b> modeling and simulations, and conclusion and recommendations...|$|E
