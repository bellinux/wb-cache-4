40|$|This study {{examines}} cultural influences on professional judgments of Australian, Indian and Chinese Malaysian accountants {{in relation to}} auditor–client conflict resolution. The study draws on cultural characteristics of, and differences among, these societies to formulate hypotheses that Australian accountants {{are less likely to}} resolve audit conflicts by acceding to clients than Indian and Chinese Malaysian accountants, and are also less accepting of resolving audit conflicts in this way. Data are gathered through a survey questionnaire administered to samples of <b>senior</b> <b>accountants</b> from “big-six” (at the time of data collection) firms in Australia, India and Malaysia. The questionnaire comprised an auditor–client conflict scenario, and used both single-item and multidimensional [specifically, the Multidimensional Ethics Measure of Reidenbach and Robin (1988, 1990) ] measures of professional judgment. The results support the hypotheses about differences in Australian compared to Indian and Chinese Malaysian professional judgments. Additionally, the results support the Multidimensional Ethics Measure as having greater explanatory power than a single-item measure. The results have implications for the international harmonisation of accounting and auditing standards, and for audit procedures and codes of conduct in international accounting firms. 31 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Although Research and Development and {{intellectual}} property are becoming {{central to the}} competitive advantage of more companies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (USA), the Accounting Standards Board (UK) and the International Accounting Standards Committee each prescribe a different treatment for the same development expenditure. This paper {{is based on the}} views of <b>senior</b> <b>accountants</b> on the treatment of R&D expenditure in companies that undertake over seventy per cent of UK industry-funded R&D. Most respondents prefer to expense all R&D costs immediately for the theoretically sound reason that the ex ante benefits are too uncertain; by contrast there is a strong consensus that the ex post benefits of R&D expenditure are positive. Two important dimensions of the corporate reporting accountants' perspective emerge: first, disclosure is seen as much more important than the accounting treatment of R&D expenditure and, second, the financial statements are not viewed as the primary channel of communication for information on R&D. These perceptions suggest that UK accounting regulators need to move beyond a focus on the narrow technical issues of R&D in order to consider the role of financial statements in the wider communication process that occurs between companies and accounts users. ...|$|R
