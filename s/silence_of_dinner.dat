60|$|The {{last man}} whom I will mention is Carlyle, seen by me several times at my brother's house, {{and two or}} three times at my own house. His talk was very racy and interesting, just like his writings, but he {{sometimes}} went on too long on the same subject. I remember a funny dinner at my brother's, where, amongst a few others, were Babbage and Lyell, both of whom liked to talk. Carlyle, however, silenced every one by haranguing during the whole dinner on the advantages <b>of</b> <b>silence.</b> After <b>dinner</b> Babbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very interesting lecture on silence.|$|R

40|$|Conclusions In {{suspension}} {{cultures of}} tobacco BY- 2 cell line derived from calli after transformation about 90 % of lines contained cells with various GFP fluorescence level after transformation. Newly introduced cloning method allowed obtaining nearly 50 % of clones with homogeneous GFP expression from primarily heterogeneous BY- 2 lines. Heterogeneity of GFP expression in transgenic BY- 2 lines had two causes - genetic (primary lines contained cells with different T-DNA insertions) and epigenetic one. Epigenetic heterogeneity of BY- 2 lines was connected with transgene <b>silencing,</b> formation <b>of</b> stable epigenetic states early after transformation, and "permanent heterogeneity" with fluctuating levels in GFP expression. Reduction or <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> transgene expression in potato was predominantly observed in lines with {{higher number of}} T-DNA insertions and with higher initial GFP expression. Silencing in potato always gradually affected both introduced genes. <b>Silencing</b> <b>of</b> GFP expression preceded (in months) loss of resistance to kanamycin (<b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> NPTII gene) in all monitored cases that indicates interconnections between <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> both transgenes. The same sequence <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> both transgenes in potato was also observed in silenced lines after reactivation of transgene expression by 5 -azacytidine, which [...] ...|$|R
