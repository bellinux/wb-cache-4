30|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007 to 2009 {{was the most}} serious meltdown to shake the global economies in more than 70  years. As it emerged and got into a shape, it confounded governments, financial institutions, markets and industries, academics, media commentators and finally the attitudes of the public. In {{a matter of months}} and years, the speed of the crisis and its unexpected twists and turns excited fears around the world. The crisis swept around the globe, impacting on financial markets, economies and inevitably government budgets like tax problems. The crisis changed taxpayers’ attitudes towards civil servants and its pension. In South Korea, there is even nickname for civil servants – “The Thick Iron Rice-Cooker”, which means they secured their job and livelihood for good. The public acknowledged that the current law for civil servant pension act is compensation for their generally low <b>salaries.</b> However, the <b>statement</b> also seems to be outdated for the public opinion, given that civil servant’s paychecks fall short of those among large companies, but are above the average in the private sector like small and medium-sized enterprises.|$|R

Statistic analysis used to test the hypothesis from the existing data means to make the decision making easier. Y= a + X 1 + X 2 + X 3 + X 4 Y= - 106, 586 + 0, 03 + 1, 205 - 0, 08 + 0, 351 Simultaneous influence (gathered) all independent variables to work-force productivity were done by F-test. From multiple linear regression analysis, there found Fcount 9, 817, while F table at significant level 0, 05 showed 3, 478 value.

So that it could be concluded that hypothesis test which stated there were simultaneous influence of independent variable to productivity variables could be accepted. In order to find individual influence (partial) of independence variables age (X 1), work-experience (X 2), family load (X 3), salary (X 4) to the work-force productivity, there did t-test.
