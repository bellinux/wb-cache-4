Even in Spain, which has the highest organ donation rate in the world, there are only 35.1 actual donors per million people, and there are hundreds of patients on the waiting list. This rate compares to 24.8 per million in Austria, where families are rarely asked to donate organs, and 22.2 per million in France, which—like Spain—has a presumed-consent system.|$|E

The total amount he gave personally is uncertain, although he personally estimated that in 1927–37 he spent well over 2.3 million dollars. Bennett was a controlling owner of the E.B.

I used only a third of a stick-- you know, short fuse, with the end split so as to hold the head of a <b>safety</b> <b>match.</b> That's where I mended my predecessors' methods. Not using the match-head, they'd too-long fuses. Therefore, when they spotted a school of mullet; and lighted the fuse, they had to hold the dynamite till the fuse burned short before they threw it. If they threw it too soon, it wouldn't go off the instant it hit the water, while the splash of it would frighten the mullet away. Funny stuff dynamite. At any rate, I still maintain mine was the safer method.|$|E
60|$|Van Horn, {{regarding}} the shore for {{some sign of}} life, lighted a cigar and put one hand to the waist-line of his loin-cloth to reassure himself {{of the presence of}} the stick of dynamite that was tucked between the loin- cloth and his skin. The lighted cigar was for the purpose, if emergency arose, of igniting the fuse of the dynamite. And the fuse was so short, with its end split to accommodate the inserted head of a <b>safety</b> <b>match,</b> that between the time of touching it off with the live cigar to the time of the explosion not more than three seconds could elapse. This required quick cool work on Van Horn's part, in case need arose. In three seconds he would have to light the fuse and throw the sputtering stick with directed aim to its objective. However, he did not expect to use it, and had it ready merely as a precautionary measure.|$|E

50|$|Before the <b>safety</b> <b>match</b> was invented, matches were {{dangerous}} for the workers in the factory because {{the use of the}} very poisonous white/yellow phosphorus that the workers were inhaling, in particular those who worked with the application on the sticks. After some years of exposure they could get infected from the poisonous phosphorus and get a disease called “Phossy jaw” and could lose their teeth. This disease was very deadly. When the cause for the disease was discovered, the ventilation in the production process was improved, but the dangerous type of phosphorus were soon forbidden to use for matches. The <b>safety</b> <b>match</b> used the non-poisonous red phosphorus that was placed on the striking surface, not the match itself. The reason they were called “safety matches” was because they would only ignite on the striking surface on the box, nowhere else would the match ignite. The <b>safety</b> <b>match</b> patent included the combination of using red phosphorus and separating it from the stick. Johan made it possible to mass-produce the <b>safety</b> <b>match.</b>|$|E

The <b>safety</b> <b>match</b> had been invented and patented by the Swedish chemist Gustaf Erik Pasch (1788-1862) in 1844, but at that time, it was too difficult to produce it. In 1845 Johan Edvard started to experiment with these new type of matches in a small workshop he had rented. In 1846 his younger brother Carl Frans (1823-1917) joined his small workshop. In 1847 they were ready to set up a production plant and bought an estate on the coast of Lake Vättern where they built a large match factory. Today, their original factory is a museum.|$|E
