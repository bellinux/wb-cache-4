5|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>therapist</b> Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those {{selecting}} from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and <b>sex</b> <b>therapist</b> Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

MTV also interviewed many people who had viewed the book on the day of its release at the HMV music store in New York City.

500|$|Other casting {{choices were}} Broadway actor Jerry Orbach as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby's father; and Jane Brucker as Lisa Houseman, her older sister. Bergstein also {{attempted}} to cast her friend, <b>sex</b> <b>therapist</b> Dr. Ruth Westheimer, to play Mrs. Schumacher, and Joel Grey as her husband. However, Westheimer backed {{out when she}} learned the role involved being a thief. The role went instead to 79-year-old Paula Trueman, and Joel Grey was not cast. Another role went to Bergstein's friend, New York radio personality [...] "Cousin Brucie". She initially wanted him to portray the social director but then later asked him to play {{the part of the}} magician. The role of the social director went to the then unknown Wayne Knight (of later Seinfeld and 3rd Rock from the Sun fame). The part of Baby's mother was originally given to Lynne Lipton, who is briefly visible in the beginning, when the Houseman family first pulls into Kellerman's (she is in the front seat for a few seconds; her blonde hair is the only indication), but she became ill {{during the first week of}} shooting and was replaced by actress Kelly Bishop, who had already been cast to play Vivian Pressman, the highly sexed resort guest.

[...] Of his 1986 Bunthorne with the company, The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Reed does not overdo. He sings and {{speaks in a}} {{moderate}} tone of voice, never moves more than fairly quickly, and never hits the audience {{over the head with}} a joke. As a result, when he strikes a pose of even mild ridiculousness, the result is hilarity. He makes Bunthorne a good-natured poseur, and admits his dependency on adulation with endearing simplicity." [...] At a NYGASP gala at Symphony Space in 1987, Reed proposed on stage to noted <b>sex</b> <b>therapist</b> Dr. Ruth Westheimer. [...] He also performed in concerts in North America and Britain, including at The Berkshire Choral Institute as The Duke of Plaza Toro (with Kenneth Sandford as Don Alhambra) in The Gondoliers (1985). [...] In reviewing a 1988 concert, The Boston Globe wrote that Reed [...] "is near to perfect in his chosen field.

Overall, <b>sex</b> <b>therapists</b> were generally comfortable with sexually explicit educational material and erotica but less comfortable with pornography.

Physical attractiveness effects have in the past been summarized by the statement, “what is beautiful is good,” referring to the tendency to attribute more positive personality characteristics to more physically attractive individuals. In the present study, therapists were presented with clinical information about a hypothetical client with an accompanying picture of the client. The pictures used were selected based on physical attractiveness rankings, with high, moderate, and low levels of attractiveness represented. The client was described as having anxiety about either social competence or academic performance. Therapists 2 ̆ 7 treatment recommendations varied based on the presenting problem; however, physical attractiveness, client <b>sex,</b> and <b>therapist</b> <b>sex</b> did not significantly affect therapists 2 ̆ 7 recommendations, except for an interaction of attractiveness, client <b>sex,</b> and <b>therapist</b> <b>sex</b> for expected prognosis without therapy.
