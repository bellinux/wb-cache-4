40|$|The {{purposes}} of this document are (1) to briefly discuss outcome measurement, risk adjustment, and the rationale for risk adjusted outcome reporting {{in the context of}} outcome-based quality improvement (OBQI) for home health care, and (2) to summarize the current risk adjustment and outcome measurement approaches as well as plans for their continued refine ment. Except for Section 1 and the first component of Section 2, this overview is intended for a somewhat technically inclined audience. Nonetheless, it should be useful to those with little or no research or statistical experience. For such individuals, an intuitive sense of the risk adjust ment methods can be acquired by simply reading the narrative and <b>skimming</b> <b>through</b> the <b>material</b> that is more technical in nature. In Sections 5 and 6, background information on outcome measures and OBQI is presented in order to provide contextual information that is relevant to understanding the applications of the statistical risk adjustment methods summarized here. 1. What Risk Adjustment Is and Why It Is Needed Suppose the hospitalization rate is 20 % for one home health agency and 30 % for another. On the basis of these statistics alone, one might conclude that the second agency provide...|$|R

5000|$|This estrangement serves {{literature}} by forcing {{the reader to}} think about what might have been an ordinary piece of writing about a common life experience in a more thoughtful way. A piece of writing in a novel versus a piece of writing in a fishing magazine. At the very least, literature should encourage readers to stop and look closer at scenes and happenings they otherwise might have <b>skimmed</b> <b>through</b> uncaring. The reader is not meant to be able to <b>skim</b> <b>through</b> literature. When addressed in a language of estrangement, speech cannot be <b>skimmed</b> <b>through.</b> [...] "In the routines of everyday speech, our perceptions of and responses to reality become stale, blunted, and as the Formalists would say 'automatized'. By forcing us into a dramatic awareness of language, literature refreshes these habitual responses and renders objects more perceptible" [...] (Eagleton 3).|$|R

40|$|Scrubbing or <b>skimming</b> <b>through</b> an {{audio-only}} recording {{remains a}} challenge with today’s audio interfaces. We present DiMaß, a technique for direct manipulation of an audio timeline with continuous, high-fidelity audio feedback. Building upon prior work in interactive conducting systems, DiMaß uses improved algorithms to (1) estimate the input position and velocity of low sampling rate, relative input {{devices such as}} a mouse or iPod scroll wheel; (2) adjust audio play rate to precisely track user input; and (3) interactively time-stretch the audio without changing the pitch at arbitrary forwards and backwards play rates. Early feedback showed that users are willing to tolerate slightly reduced responsiveness in exchange for smoother sounding audio. We are currently exploring how DiMaß enables users to more quickly and efficiently scrub and <b>skim</b> <b>through</b> audio.

40|$|Readers on the Web often <b>skim</b> <b>through</b> text to {{cope with}} the volume of {{available}} information. In a previous study, Duggan and Payne [11] tracked readers' eye movements as they <b>skimmed</b> <b>through</b> expository text under time pressure. This article presents novel analyses of these eye-movement data. Results indicated that readers were able to explicitly direct attention to the most important information in the text and that this improved performance on a subsequent test of memory for the meaning of text. We suggest readers achieve this by satisficing - reading through text until the rate of information gain drops below threshold and then skipping to the next section of text. Further analyses of gaze patterns for paragraphs and pages supported this explanation. Combining satisficing with some form of scanning or sampling behaviour could explain patterns of reading found on the Web. A greater understanding of the way that text is read on the Web would assist many producers of online content...|$|R
