5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them of the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News {{that he went to}} bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W.

5|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}} B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the lipoprotein particle.

FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies determines the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypercholesterolemia.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low.

Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.|$|E
