40|$|Abstract. Effect of {{low-temperature}} {{degradation of}} 3 Y-TZP ceramics (polycrystalline zirconia stabilized by 3 mol % of yttria) on contact damage resistance {{has been studied}} applying scratch testing technique. Friction properties and damage mechanisms have been investigated for various degrees of hydrothermal ageing, i. e. for different grain sizes and crystallography, and for different thickness of the degraded surface layer. The onset of plastic damage, catastrophically cracking, grain pull-out, <b>spalling</b> and <b>chipping</b> due to top layer debonding have been identified. The contact damage micromechanisms corresponding to various degrees of degradation have been studied in detail by interferometry and microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Fibre/matrix {{delamination}} is {{a common}} problem when cutting carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) that can have a detrimental effect on workpiece mechanical properties and hence compromise the in-service performance of the composite part. The present paper details experimental results when drilling small holes (1. 5 [*]mm diameter) through backed and un-backed CFRP laminates using tungsten carbide twist drills {{to determine the effect}} of peel ply layers (∼ 100 [*]µm thick nylon sheet attached on both sides of 3 [*]mm thick laminates) on hole entry and exit delamination. Considerable reduction in damage relating to fuzzing, <b>spalling,</b> edge <b>chipping,</b> and delamination was observed when drilling the nylon-backed CFRP material, with scanning electron micrographs showing significantly inferior hole quality for the corresponding un-backed workpieces, particularly at hole exit...|$|R
40|$|The {{drilling}} of {{composite materials}} {{is a very}} common and important process used {{in the process of}} assembling of composite structures. In the process of composite material drilling the following errors happen: delamination, fraying, edge <b>chipping,</b> <b>spalling,</b> surface roughness and dimensional errors.

40|$|Martian surface {{materials}} {{viewed by}} the two Viking landers (VL- 1 and VL- 2) range from fine-grained nearly cohesionless soils to rocks. Footpad 2 of VL- 1, which landed at 2. 30 m/s, penetrated 16. 5 cm into very fine grained dunelike drift material; footpad 3 rests on a rocky soil which it penetrated ≈ 3. 6 cm. Further penetration by footpad 2 may have been arrested by a hard substrate. Penetration by footpad 3 is less than would be expected for a typical lunar regolith. During landing, retroengine exhausts eroded the surface and propelled grains and rocks which produced craters on impact with the surface. Trenches excavated in drift material by the sampler have steep walls with up to 6 cm of relief. Incipient failure of the walls and failures {{at the end of}} the trenches are compatible with a cohesion near 10 – 10 ^ 2 N/m^ 2. Trenching in rocky soil excavated clods and possibly rocks. In two of five samples, commanded sampler extensions were not achieved, a situation indicating that buried rocks or local areas with large cohesions (≥ 10 kN/m^ 2) or both are present. Footpad 2 of VL- 2, which landed at a velocity between 1. 95 and 2. 34 m/s, is partly on a rock, and footpad 3 appears to have struck one; penetration and leg strokes are small. Retroengine exhausts produced more erosion than occurred for VL- 1 owing to increased thrust levels just before touchdown. Deformations of the soil by sampler extensions range from doming of the surface without visible fracturing to doming accompanied by fracturing and the production of angular clods. Although rocks larger than 3. 0 cm are abundant at VL- 1 and VL- 2, repeated attempts to collect rocks 0. 2 – 1. 2 cm across imbedded in soil indicate that rocks in this size range are scarce. There is no evidence that the surface sampler of VL- 2, while it was pushing and nudging rocks ≈ 25 cm across, <b>spalled,</b> <b>chipped,</b> or fractured the rocks. Preliminary analyses of surface sampler motor currents (≈ 25 N force resolution) during normal sampling are consistent with cohesionless frictional soils (ϕ ≈ 36 °) or weakly cohesive frictionless soils (C < 2 kN/m^ 2). The soil of Mars has both cohesion and friction...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the several}} {{machining}} processes, drilling {{is one of}} the most frequently used for the hole production for screws, rivets and bolts. Drilling of composite materials causes several damage modes, such as: delamination, fiber-pull out, edge <b>chipping,</b> <b>spalling,</b> uncut fibers, surface roughness and dimensional errors, and others. Delamination is a major problem associated with drilling fiber reinforced composite materials. It causes poor assembly tolerance, reduces structural integrity of material and the potential for long term performance deterioration. The thrust force has been cited as main cause of delamination. In this paper the objective was to establish correlation between cutting tool geometry, cutting velocity and feed rate with delamination during drilling carbon fibre reinforced composite materials. Drilling test were carried out on carbon epoxy composites using different twist drills...|$|R
40|$|In June 2005, the NESC {{received}} a multi-faceted request {{to determine the}} long term reliability of fiber optic termini on the ISS that exhibited flaws not manufactured to best workmanship practices. There {{was a lack of}} data related to fiber optic workmanship as it affects the long term reliability of optical fiber assemblies in a harsh environment. A fiber optic defect analysis was requested which would find and/or create various types of <b>chips,</b> <b>spalls,</b> scratches, etc., that were identified by the ISS personnel. Once the defects and causes were identified the next step would be to perform long term reliability testing of similar assemblies with similar defects. The goal of the defect analysis would be for the defects to be observed and documented for deterioration of fiber optic performance. Though this report mostly discusses what has been determined as evidence of poor manufacturing processes, it also concludes the majority of the damage could have been avoided with a rigorous process in place...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} for aeolian abrasion of natural dune sands to produce fine dust particles. Particular attention is given to how the particle size, sorting, colour, shape {{and the presence of}} iron oxide coatings and clay skins affect the rate of dust production. Natural dune sand samples were obtained from the crests of active continental dunes from the Simpson Desert and the Channel Country and abraded for 72 hours using a large glass 'test-tube' chamber. The <b>chipping,</b> <b>spalling</b> and breakage of sand grains and the removal of iron oxide coatings and clay skins from grain surfaces produced between 0. 41 - 0. 98 % fine particles. Statistical analysis identified that the degree of sorting and grain roundness of a sand sample are the major influences on the dust production rate. Well-sorted, sub-rounded sand samples yielded less dust than poorly sorted angular sand grains. Comparison with previous studies of aeolian abrasion of crushed quartz sands, these natural dune sands produced very low quantities of fine material, but the widespread geographical distribution of desert dune fields makes them potentially a significant source of dust-sized particles on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A polymer {{infiltrated}} ceramic network (PICN) and a resin nano ceramic (RNC) restorative {{materials for}} Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications recently became commercially available. Little independent evidence regarding their mechanical properties exists to facilitate material selection process. The {{purpose of this}} study was to measure the edge chipping resistance and flexural strength of the novel PICN and RNC materials and compare it to two commonly used feldspathic ceramic (FC) and leucite reinforced glass-ceramic (LRGC) CAD/CAM materials that share the same indications. Materials and Methods: For the edge chipping test, 20 specimens/group were tested. Square prism specimens 10 10 2 mm were sectioned from the commercially available CAD/CAM blocks, polished and adhesively attached on a 4 mm thick resin bed fabricated in a custom holder. A 120 degree sharp conical indenter was mounted on a universal testing machine and the specimens edge was positioned in distances varying from 0. 1 mm to 0. 7 mm horizontally from the indenter tip. Two edge chipping tests were performed per sample at a crosshead speed of 0. 1 mm/min and the critical force at which a <b>chip</b> <b>spalled</b> off the edge was recorded. One-way ANOVA determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). For the flexural strength test, 22 specimens/group were tested. Beam specimens 18 4 1. 2 mm were sectioned from the commercially available CAD/CAM blocks and polished. A 3 -point flexure test was performed on a universal testing machine with a test fixture support span of 15 mm and the crosshead speed set at 0. 5 mm/min. Weibull statistics determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). Flexural modulus and work of fracture were also measured and one-way ANOVA determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). Results: Regarding edge chipping resistance, one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences with the materials ranking RNC 3 ̆eLRGC=FC 3 ̆ePICN (P=. 05). Regarding flexural strength, Weibull statistics revealed significant differences with the materials ranking RNC=LRGC 3 ̆ePICN 3 ̆eFC (P=. 05). Regarding flexural modulus one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences between the 4 materials, which ranked RNC LRGC=PICN 3 ̆eFC (P=. 05). Conclusions: The RNC material demonstrated superior results for all the mechanical properties tested compared to the other 3 materials. Randomized controlled trials to determine clinical success are warranted for the RNC material...|$|R
