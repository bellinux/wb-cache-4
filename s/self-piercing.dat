This paper deals with the strength and fracture mechanism of single-lap <b>self-pierce</b> riveted joints.

For investigating the fracture mechanism of the single-lap <b>self-pierce</b> riveted joints, the electrolytic polishing and anode film coating were used for dealing with the cross-section. The differential interference contrast method was used for observing the micro-structure of the cross-section of the joints.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to extend the process limits of the {{mechanical}} joining technique <b>self-pierce</b> riveting in currently critical application scenarios such as the joining direction "thick in thin", the joining of cast aluminum with limited ductility and carbon fiber reinforced plastics {{as well as the}} combination of <b>self-pierce</b> riveting with adhesive {{through the use of a}} new die concept. Core of the new process variant is the separation of the die in a die ring and counter punch in which the counter punch is moved during the joining process. Through the use of the additional kinematics of the die tool significant improvements with respect to the joint quality compared to the conventional process can be achieved at all investigated application scenarios. Especially remarkable potential has the new process variant with separated die when joining materials with limited ductility. By the application of the force-controlled counter punch and the resulting additional superposition of the parts with compressive stresses, in contrast to the conventional <b>self-pierce</b> riveting, cracking in the parts can be avoided completely. In the numerical studies, a basic understanding of the new <b>self-pierce</b> riveting process was generated and the main influence factors on joint quality could be identified.

40|$|Abstract. Lightweight materials, such as {{aluminum}} die castings, {{are used}} {{more and more}} for automotive applications. Due to the limited weldability, joining these materials by <b>self-pierce</b> riveting has been established. The challenge {{in this regard is}} that these materials, especially new high strength aluminum die castings, have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining by forming of these materials can be accompanied by cracks, which develop during the forming operation. This paper shows the experimental and numerical investigation of a new die concept for <b>self-pierce</b> riveting materials with limited ductility. At the new tool concept the riveting die is separated and a movable die element is used. This element allows that the parts are superimposed with compressive stresses during the <b>self-pierce</b> riveting process. In the paper it can be shown, that in contrast to the conventional process crack-free joints can be generated by using the new tool concept.

40|$|Advanced {{lightweight}} materials, such as {{high strength}} aluminium and magnesium alloys, are used in an expanding range of engineering applications, {{such as in the}} transport sector, machine and equipment construction or the general construction industry. Thermal welding of these materials is, in contrast to steel, problematic since it severely affects both the static and fatigue resistance of the joint and the base material. This has strengthened the demand for more suitable joining techniques without heat input. The focus of the present research is on the application of two of the most important conventional cold joining techniques (clinching and <b>self-pierce</b> riveting) for these new emerging lightweight materials. The challenge in this regard is that these materials have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining these materials can be accompanied by cracks which develop during the forming operation. This situation has limited the use of these materials and of the joining processes in the past. The aim of the project was to develop rules and guidelines based on scientific results determining either how cracks induced by clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> riveting can be avoided or which cracks are acceptable. Therefore, the damage behaviour of lightweight materials, such as aluminium and magnesium, during the clinching and <b>self-pierce</b> riveting process was investigated both experimentally and numerically. The results from the project can be summarized as follows:Depending on the joining parameters and location in the component, different damages can occur during clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> riveting of materials with limited ductility. The relationships between joining parameters and the risk for damages in the closing head or part edge are demonstrated in this report and the risk for joining process-induced damages can be minimized by choosing the suitable joining tools. For all material combinations considered within this project it could not be observed that the joining process-induced damages {{have a negative effect on}} the resulting joint strength. This was determined for quasi-static and cyclic loads for both clinching as well as <b>self-pierce</b> riveting. In the numerical investigations regarding the damage modelling it was determined that the damage location as well as the level can be calculated by simple as well as complex fracture models. However, calculation of crack propagation in the die-sided part for clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> riveting using FEM is only possible to a limited extent...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing {{of complex}} tube-workpieces often {{requires}} medium-based forming processes. Because of the inaccessibility {{to the inside}} of the parts, joining of attached parts is difficult. Part handling and a loss of accuracy during thermal joining are disadvantages. A new method of spot-joining by forming is a combination of hydroforming and clinching or hydroforming and <b>self-pierce</b> riveting. In contrast to the standard method the clinching or <b>self-pierce</b> riveting is done without die. A high pressure fluid takes over the task of the die during joining. This die-less procedure also increases the range of possibilities which are not available with standard techniques. By integrating joining into the hydroforming process an additional step in assembly is avoidable. In order to use additional velocity dependent effects of the material, for example the increase of the formability and the decrease of spring back, <b>self-pierce</b> riveting during the hydroforming process by means of impulse load has also been researched among other conventional quasi-static force transmissions. Numeric simulations were used for the theoretical description of the procedure. One goal of simulation is the characterisation of the most influential parameters on the process as a function of the material properties, tool kinematics/-geometry and of the friction conditions.

40|$|The {{importance}} of environment friendly mobility strengthens {{the need of}} lightweight design in the automotive industry. New electric car models, like the BMW i 3, already have car body with a high amount of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) to allow, {{as a result of}} the low vehicle weight, appropriate ranges without reloading the battery. Methods for joining materials like CFRP play a key role to implement lightweight designs into car body production. Conventional joining methods like spot welding cannot be used for such material combinations. Due to the good automation and possible combination with adhesive, mechanical joining techniques such as <b>self-pierce</b> riveting (SPR) are very relevant for joining these lightweight materials. While generally <b>self-pierce</b> riveting of CFRP with aluminium is possible, different damages e. g. delaminations, fiber or matrix fractures in the CFRP can occur during the joining process and have to be considered. This paper shows an analysis of these process induced damages when <b>self-pierce</b> riveting CFRP compound with aluminum sheet metal and investigates their influence on the joint strength. In our research the conventional SPR process of CFRP-aluminium joints is compared to the application of a new die concept for SPR in which a separated die is used to reduce the process induced delaminations in the CFRP. Additionally, these joining results are contrasted to SPR joints with pre-drilled CFRP components. Through the pre-drilling the damages in the CFRP can nearly be avoided completely and so these joints can be used as a reference. The results of the three processes to produce CFRP-aluminum joints are compared by micrographs, computed tomography and strength tests...|$|R
