The questionnaire was posted on several online support groups designed for clients with various chronic health conditions. The study samples consisted of 318 participants worldwide, who live with chronic health condition(s), and data were stored on a <b>secured</b> <b>server</b> at www.formsite.com. Date analysis showed that the CES scale is highly reliable with Alpha (a) of 0.97. Statistical techniques to assess {{the construct validity of}} the CES scale were executed using two methods of factor analysis: principal component analysis, and principal axis factoring. After analyzing factor and reliability, they retained 44 items with the highest factor loadings for the final scale, that is, the Client Empowerment Scale. A reliable and valid CES instrument can be used to measure clients’ empowerment, predict clients’ self-management practices, and evaluate the effectiveness of empowering programs.|$|E

Previously, we had limited traffic in Battlefield networks and small number of known private servers with their contents and security concerns. The users of <b>secured</b> <b>server</b> interacted with limited number of servers which were known in advance. Today, the Battlefield networking, surveillance traffic, content servers and hybrid information have increased dynamically. The present Battlefield architecture is handling only data streams of bits between-end-to-end system for content of Battlefield services and its objects. The modern battlefield techniques and architecture is constantly evolving. Therefore, we need more resources to effectively visualize the pattern of the battlefield objects and situations.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Quality {{assurance}} (QA) for radiation treatment {{has become a}} priority since poorly delivered radiotherapy can negatively influence patient outcome. Within a national project we evaluated the feasibility of a central review platform {{and its role in}} improving uniformity of clinical target volume (CTV) delineation in daily practice. Material and methods All Belgian radiotherapy departments were invited to participate and were asked to upload CTVs for rectal cancer treatment onto a <b>secured</b> <b>server.</b> These were centrally reviewed and feedback was given per e-mail. For each five consecutive patients per centre, the overlap parameter dice coefficient (DC) and the volumetric parameters volumetric ratio (RV) and commonly contoured volume (VCC) were calculated. Results Twenty departments submitted 1224 eligible cases of which 909 were modified (74. 3 %). There was a significant increase in RV and VCC between the first ten patients per centre and the others. This was not seen for DC. Statistical analysis did not show a further significant improvement in delineation over the entire review period. Conclusion Central review was feasible and increased the uniformity in CTV delineation in the first ten rectal cancer patients per centre. The observations in this study can be used to optimize future QA initiatives. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

A recording device designed by IFSTTAR-LMA, called EMMA, was used to detect situations during which the vehicle reaches high dynamics demands in longitudinal, lateral or combined directions. 50 EMMA were deployed for one year from autumn 2012 on public fleets in the North, Center and South of France. EMMA acquires data from internal accelerometers and gyro-meters, GPS trajectory and speed, and data available on vehicle CAN bus. The data are analyzed in real-time to detect when acceleration signals exceed some thresholds, modulated by vehicle speed. The data acquired 30 s before and 15 s after the trigger are then stored and sent automatically to a <b>secured</b> <b>server.</b> The data collection comprises also the itinerary paths and information illustrating the dynamic demands for each travel.

40|$|Remotely {{supervised}} myofeedback treatment (RSMT) is {{a relatively}} new intervention aimed at reducing neck-shoulder pain and disabilities. Subjects are equipped with a garment that can be worn under the clothes during daily work. Dry surface electrodes incorporated in this garment measure muscle activation (sEMG) of the trapezius muscle. The garment is connected to an ambulant device that provides feedback to the subject when muscle relaxation is insufficient. sEMG data are also sent to a <b>secured</b> <b>server</b> that is accessible by therapists for remote counseling purposes. In conformance with the evaluation stages of DeChant, RSMT was evaluated on technical feasibility, patient satisfaction, and changes in clinical outcomes. In addition, subjects were asked about their willingness to pay. The study population consisted of 10 female workers suffering from neck-shoulder pain related to computer work. Results show that in 78 % of the remote counseling sessions, sufficient amounts of data were available at the server for the therapist to make an assessment of muscle tension needed for the remote counseling sessions. Subjects were highly satisfied about the usefulness and ease of use of the remote counseling. However, they were less satisfied with the technical functioning of the myofeedback system. Eighty percent of the subjects reported a reduction in pain intensity and disability directly after RSMT. Subjects were willing to contribute a maximum of 200 euro for RSMT. Based on this study, it can be concluded that RSMT is technically feasible and induces changes in clinical outcomes. However, further improvements to technical functioning and research into the clinical effectiveness are needed before this treatment can go into real deployment...|$|E
40|$|Anjana {{works as}} E-resources Librarian and is slowly but steadly {{emerging}} {{as an expert}} in the field of E-resources Librarianship. In this session she would talk about managing licenses using the ERMS application and the public display of the licensing terms on the E-journal portal. She holds an MS degree in Library and Information Science and Information Resources ManagementDigital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998 (DMCA), despite recognizing the needs of the libraries, actually protects the copyright holder. Most of the educational institutions, especially university libraries, route online copyrighted information from the copyright holder to their students, staff and faculty, and thus, meet the definition of Online Service Providers (OSP) as described in the DMCA. Chapter II (1 - 3) of the DMCA provides guidelines for such institutions and does not hold them responsible for all research activities of a faculty member or a graduate student, but it, however, clearly states that this protection is valid only if the institution provides informational material that accurately describes and promotes compliance with federal copyright laws. Vendor licensing agreements are fairly complicated documents and require that their terms and conditions are met for all practical purposes. As E-resources are becoming a preferred format desired by faculty, students and librarian alike, e-resources librarians are dealing with complicated licensing terms and conditions on a daily basis. How many of us remember to convey, or, actually convey the licensing terms to our patrons? Or, in fact, how many libraries have a mechanism {{to take care of this}} important aspect? According to the DMCA, an institution must not only convey these terms it also must have a designated agent to receive infringement notifications. Florida Gulf Coast University library uses an ERMS program that includes the License Manager (LM) tool for recording critical licensing terms and then displaying these terms and conditions through the e-journal portal. The LM tool allows us to store either the PDF copies of the licenses on a <b>secured</b> <b>server</b> that are accessible only through a user ID and password or provide a direct URL to the electronic copy of the license. In addition, it also allows us to enter following information to be displayed through our e-journal portal. Basic information regarding authorized user, concurrent users, fair use clause, remote access, and user restrictions Printing or copying restrictions/permissions Terms and conditions related to making digital or print copies for scholarly sharing ILL restrictions: print or Fax, secure electronic, or by email, Restrictions/permissions for course reserves/course packs and persistent URLs, and Other user restrictions Additionally, we can also provide information that is not displayed in the public view but is always available to the ILL staff and the librarians. This information includes: License termination: requirements, period (days, weeks, months etc.), rights and conditions Perpetual access rights/notes Governing Law Copyright Law Non renewal notice period Archiving rights and restrictions etc. Cure Period for breach etc., and Renewal terms The biggest benefit of this exercise is that we are always in compliance with the act and can not be held liable for any infringements. The LM tool also allows us to link terms and conditions of one license agreement to multiple databases that a vendor may provide access to, thereby saving duplicate efforts. A practical demonstration of this process will follow the general discussion. Learning outcomes: Grasp importance of DMCA (1998) act. Understand crucial elements of an e-resource license and why these should be made accessible to patrons. Benefit from a simple demonstration of the complete process of selecting licensing terms and displaying them in the public view of the e-journal portal using a software application.
