However, the inherent problem of varying lead wire resistance can cause errors when the Wheatstone bridge is used to measure strain in a flight environment.

40|$|The jet smooth ride {{is still}} a vision for helicopters. Even though noise and {{vibration}} levels were already drastically diminished {{there is still the}} need for further reduction. The main rotor as a major source of those disturbances is one factor that hinders the realization of this vision. Individual blade control (IBC) in general has the potential to reduce noise and vibration of rotary wing aircrafts. This is mainly done by preventing blade vortex interactions and generation of aerodynamic forces to cancel out vibrations. The architecture of IBC systems evolved from actuated pitch links to active flaps and active twist. Since the active twist {{can also be used to}} adapt the pre-twist of the blade, it is as well possible to improve the hover figure of merit and to increase the maximum take off weight. The active twist blades investigated at DLR (German Aerospace Center) are actuated by piezoelectric Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) actuators that are integrated into the skin of the rotor blades (see Figure 1). However some advantages Actuator <b>Strain</b> <b>gage</b> position Figure 1 : Active twist blade of the active twist concept like distributed actuation without big local strains or no moving components are also causing some challenges in the control of the actuation. Even though a feed forward control of the actuation voltage can be realized easily it is quite difficult to find a physical value that is suited to close the loop for a direct control of the twist. As the angle of attack at the blade tip has a big influence on the trajectory of the vortices, and therefore the potential to reduce noise and vibration generated by blade vortex interactions, the tip twist angle of the blade is intended to be controlled. But since the twist is generated over the whole span of the blade, it is not possible to measure the actuation amplitude at a discrete hinge as for an active flap. The fact that the active twist blades investigated at DLR are model scale blades causes additional challenges due to the high centrifugal accelerations and the limitations in size. In a first attempt commercial accelerometers were used to detect the flap wise accelerations at the leading and trailing edge of the blade tip. The results of those measurements will be compared to an optical reference and the limitations of this principle will be shown. Another way to estimate the motion of the blade tip is the use of <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> data. The <b>strain</b> <b>gages</b> as well as the actuators were directly integrated into the skin of the rotor blade during the manufacturing process. Theoretically the moments measured by the <b>strain</b> <b>gages</b> can be integrated to a deformation when the distribution of the stiffness is known. The main challenges in the calculation of the tip twist for an active twist rotor blade are the differences in the shear flux distribution that arise when the blade is deformed by the actuators or by other "passive" moments (see Figure 2). Hence the twist can not be predicted without additional information about the actuator state. A method for the compensation of the actuator influence on the torsion <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> <b>bridges</b> was developed. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated using rotor test data. The database that is needed for these investigations was established during an extensive measurement campaign performed in the DLR rotor test facility in Braunschweig between January and April 2009. The German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW) supported this campaign with Stereo Pattern Recognition (SPR) measurements to determine the blade motion. Figure 3 shows the principle setup of the test. One single blade was tested on an articulated rotor hub. The SPR cameras were capturing the position of 28 ultraviolet reflecting markers that were painted on the blade. The blade was illuminated by 20 arrays of triggered ultraviolet LEDs. For an additional optical measurement of the blade tip *(E-mail: Steffen. Opitz@dlr. de) <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> position profile passive active Figure 2 : Active and passive distribution of + 45 strain Figure 3 : Measurement campaign test setup motion, 2 red LEDs were incorporated at the tips leading and trailing edge. A camera with a shutter time of 10 s was used to capture the position of the LEDs. The SPR measurements and the additional optical measurement system served as reference for the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> based tip twist calculation. The measurement of deformation using <b>strain</b> <b>gages</b> has another remarkable difficulty. It is a challenging task to incorporate the influence of the centrifugal forces in the calibration of the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> <b>bridges.</b> Due to small and unavoidable misalignments in the position of the single <b>strain</b> <b>gages</b> the <b>bridge</b> mean value changes with rising rotor speed. Unfortunately this drift is mixed with signals generated by extension torsion or extension bending couplings. Consequently the static deformation of the blade, caused by the centrifugal forces, is hard to measure with <b>strain</b> <b>gages.</b> As already mentioned the use of acceleration sensors for the prediction of the blade tip twist motion is generally an alternative to <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> data based methods. Since commercially available sensors did not fulfill the requirements to measure the tip twist a novel sensor concept was investigated. The geometry of the sensor is realized in a way that the cross sensitivity to other accelerations is very small. The signal to disturbance ratio is further improved by the use of a Wheatstone bridge. The sensor can be configured to work as an accelerometer that is sensitive to torsional motions only or as a sensor that takes advantage of the centrifugal field to measure even static twist. An optimization is performed to find the best sensor configuration. Within this paper the requirements on a measurement system for the detection of the tip twist angle of an active twist blade in model scale will be elucidated. Experimental results are used to compare different approaches. Further on the principle of a novel tip twist sensor will be shown and simulation results will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the energy absorption characteristics of plastically deformed inclined struts under impact loading. This information is needed to provide a usable method by which designers and analysts of shipping casks for radioactive or fissile materials can determine the energy absorption capabilities of external longitudinal fins on cylindrical casks under specified impact conditions. A survey of technical literature related to experimental determination of the dynamic plastic behavior of struts revealed no information directly applicable to the immediate problem, especially in the impact velocity ranges desired, and an experimental program was conducted to obtain the needed data. Mild-steel struts with rectangular cross sections were impacted by free-falling weights dropped from known heights. These struts or fin specimens were inclined at five different angles to simulate different angles of impact that fins on a shipping cask could experience under certain accident conditions. The resisting force of the deforming strut was measured and recorded as a function of time by using load cells instrumented with resistance <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> <b>bridges,</b> signal conditioning equipment, an oscilloscope, and a Polaroid camera. The acceleration of the impacting weight was measured and recorded as a function of time during the latter portion of the testing program by using an accelerometer attached to the drop hammer, appropriate signal conditioning equipment, the oscilloscope, and the camera. A digital computer program was prepared to numerically integrate the force-time and acceleration-time data recorded during the tests to obtain deformation-time data. The force-displacement relationships were then integrated to obtain values of absorbed energy with respect to deformation or time. The results for various fin specimen geometries and impact angles are presented graphically, and these curves may be used to compute the energy absorption capacity of a longitudinal fin on a shipping cask as a function of its geometry and the percentage of deformation it is expected to experience as well as the peak force to which the fin would be subjected during the impact resulting from a 30 -foot free drop onto an essentially unyielding horizontal surface...|$|R

40|$|Harry W. ShentonAs {{many of the}} nation's bridges {{reach the}} end of their design service life, the {{reliability}} and safety of these bridges is becoming a major concern. Visual inspections conducted every two years are not thorough enough to fully assess the performance of a bridge. While other inspection methods are available, these processes require more time and many other resources. With this in mind the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) initiated the Long-Term Bridge Performance Program (LTBPP), with its primary goal being to use permanently instrumented bridge monitoring systems throughout the country to gather quantitative data on the long-term performance and deterioration of our bridges. Bridge 1 - 821, located in Wilmington, DE, is a typical slab on girder steel design. Known as Delaware's first "Smart Bridge," it was instrumented with a structural monitoring system in 2006. The system consists of 61 sensors that include accelerometers, and displacement, temperature, and several types of <b>strain</b> <b>gages.</b> Sensor data is recorded by a Campbell Scientific CR 9000 X data acquisition system. Two main types of data are collected: monitor data and event data. Monitor data is taken every hour and is used to track bridge behavior from season to season and year to year. Event data is taken for 4 seconds when a predetermined threshold is reached for a trigger gage and is used to study the behavior of the bridge due to the site specific live load traffic, and to analyze the dynamic performance of the bridge. Recent work on the project included: (1) field work to repair <b>strain</b> <b>gages</b> and <b>bridge</b> completion modules that were malfunctioning, (2) developing software to implement a more reliable event trigger, and (3) developing MATLAB software programs to process and analyze collected data. Since this is a permanent monitoring project, monthly reports summarizing bridge behavior is a goal for the future. The current MATLAB programs are capable of accomplishing this task but additional work must be done to refine the process and increase automation, while decreasing human interaction and the time required for analysis.

One system monitors <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> signals {{in the time}} domain and gives an output indication whenever the signal amplitude of any gage exceeds a pre-set alarm or abort level for that particular gage. The second system monitors the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> signals in the frequency domain and therefore is able to use both the amplitude and frequency information. Thus, an alarm signal is given whenever the spectral content of the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> signal exceeds, at any point, its corresponding amplitude vs frequency limit profile. Each system design is described with details on design trade-offs, hardware, software, and operating experience...|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the commercial piezoelectric accelerometer came about {{through a number of}} attempts to find the most effective method to measure the vibration on large structures such as bridges and on vehicles in motion such as aircraft. One attempt involved using the resistance <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> as a device to build an accelerometer. Incidentally, it was Hans J. Meier who, through his work at MIT, is given credit as the first to construct a commercial <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> accelerometer (circa 1938). [...] However, the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> accelerometers were fragile and could only produce low resonant frequencies and they also exhibited a low frequency response. These limitations in dynamic range made it unsuitable for testing naval aircraft structures. On the other hand, the piezoelectric sensor was proven to be a much better choice over the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> in designing an accelerometer. The high modulus of elasticity of piezoelectric materials makes the piezoelectric sensor a more viable solution to the problems identified with the <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> accelerometer.|$|R

40|$|Unique <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> based {{methods were}} {{developed}} to identify magnitudes and locations of loads on a non-continuous, non-homogenous, slender beam with variable cross sections, welded and bolted joints, and pinned, firm rest, soft rest, pinned-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions. Four uniaxial <b>strain</b> <b>gages</b> mounted to the bottom surface of the beam created a force transducer capable of identifying the magnitude and location of a load inside the weight area. By combining individually scaled <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> outputs, the bending moment diagram was constructed. For the case of multiple loads separated by two or more <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> locations, uniaxial <b>strain</b> <b>gages</b> forming multiple force transducers can still identify the magnitudes and locations of all the loads. A calibration method was developed {{to account for the}} discrepancies between the theoretical and actual scaling factors arising from stress concentrations and unpredictable stress patterns in the beams due to the presence of the joints. The <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> based force transducer methodology was experimentally validated on prismatic beams with firm rest, soft rest, firm rest-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions; an aluminum beam with a bolted joint; and a half aluminum and half steel beam with two different cross sections and a bolted joint. It was also experimentally validated on a continuous aluminum beam with a linearly varying cross section and rest boundary conditions, a tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints, and a full scale portable army bridge at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center. The force transducer methodology is independent of the boundary conditions of the beam and the error from <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> drift due to uniform thermal expansion on a prismatic beam can cancel out. When there are multiple loads separated by only one <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> location, the problem is ill posed for the force transducer methodology. Another method has been developed using two shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of the beam, one on each side of a load, to identify the magnitude of the load in this case. A combination of two uniaxial <b>strain</b> <b>gages</b> and two shear gages, with one uniaxial <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> and one shear gage at the same location on each side of a load, can be used to identify the location of the load. The <b>strain</b> <b>gage</b> based methods were experimentally validated on a prismatic beam with rest boundary conditions...|$|R
