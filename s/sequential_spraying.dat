A new proniosomal delivery system for a poorly water-soluble drug such as celecoxib was developed and subjected to in vitro and in vivo studies. Proniosomes were prepared by <b>sequential</b> <b>spraying</b> method, which consisted of cholesterol, span 60, and dicetyl phosphate in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 0. 1, respectively. The average entrapment percent of celecoxib proniosome-derived niosomes was about 95 %. The prepared proniosomes showed marked enhancement in the dissolution of celecoxib as compared to pure drug powder. The bioavailability of 200  mg single dose of both celecoxib proniosomal formulation and a conventional marketed celecoxib capsule was studied in human volunteers.

30|$|In {{order to}} examine the merit of the two-step {{sequential}} method, in which two perovskite precursors are sequentially sprayed, perovskite films were also fabricated by one-step co-spray deposition of a mixture of the two precursor solutions on stationary (run 9 m) and vibrating substrates (run 10 m). Figure  6 d shows that a rough, non-uniform perovskite layer with poor coverage is formed by the co-spray method on a stationary substrate (run 9 m), somewhat similar to its sequentially made counterpart (run 7 of Fig.  4), although the coverage of run 7 is higher. When the substrate is vibrated (Fig.  6 e), the film characteristics are improved, and the film resembles its sequentially fabricated counterpart (run 6), although the coverage of co-sprayed sample (c.f. SEM of run 10 m) {{is lower than the}} sample sequentially sprayed (c.f. SEM of run 6). This is because in co-spraying approach, due to the strong interaction between DMSO and IPA, the reagents partially precipitate upon mixing. This early crystallization disturbs the balance of molar ratio between PbCl 2 and MAI reagents in the liquid phase. Therefore, the precursor solution after mixing consists of a sintered solid phase and a dilute liquid phase, which should be essentially filtrated before spraying. The resultant filtrate will be a dilute bright yellow solution, leaving behind a thin layer with low coverage {{due to the lack of}} sufficient reagents. Therefore, a combination of <b>sequential</b> <b>spraying</b> and substrate vibration through the 2 S-SVASC renders the best perovskite film characteristics.|$|E

Perovskite {{precursor}} {{solutions are}} sprayed onto an ultrasonically vibrating substrate in two sequential steps via a process herein termed as the two-step <b>sequential</b> substrate vibration-assisted <b>spray</b> coating (2 S-SVASC). The gentle imposed ultrasonic vibration on the substrate promotes droplet spreading and coalescence, surface wetting, evaporation, mixing of reagents, and uniform growth of perovskite nanocrystals. The {{role of the}} substrate temperature, substrate vibration intensity, and the time interval between the two <b>sequential</b> <b>sprays</b> are studied on the roughness, coverage, and crystalline structure of perovskite thin films.

The optimization process revealed that the performance of the perovskite films prepared by the 2 S-SVASC method strongly depends on the substrate temperature, substrate vibration power, and time interval between the two <b>sequential</b> <b>sprays</b> delivering the perovskite precursors to the substrate. In the optimized experimental conditions (run 6, substrate temperature[*]=[*] 120  °C, substrate vibration power[*]=[*] 5  W, and the time interval between spraying perovskite precursors[*]=[*] 15  min), the application of the 2 S-SVASC guarantees the formation of a perovskite film with minimum density of pinholes, almost 100  % surface coverage and sufficient chemical conversion of perovskite precursors to perovskite crystals, resulting in a device power conversion efficiency of 5.08  % for a device with active area of larger than 0.3  cm 2. Given that a simple planar structure was employed here and the optimization process was only performed on the active layer, we believe that further tuning of the developed process will allow for obtaining a higher PCE, using a commercially scalable, fast, and low-cost technique, i.e., spray coating.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the importance of}} the <b>sequential</b> <b>spraying,</b> we performed two experimental runs (9 m and 10 m) based on the conventional one-step spraying, with and without imposed ultrasonic vibration on the substrate. In this case, the reagent solutions (MAI in IPA and PbCl 2 in DMSO[*]+[*]DMF, at a 3 : 1 ratio of MAI to PbCl 2) were mixed at 70  °C and filtrated through a 30 -μm PTFE filter under nitrogen atmosphere in a glovebox. The filtrate was loaded into a syringe pump and sprayed onto the substrate, while the substrate and solution were both kept at a 70  °C. The structural characteristics and performance of the prepared thin films were compared with the perovskite thin films prepared via the 2 S-SVASC method. As mentioned earlier, a 3 : 1 volume ratio of DMSO/DMF was used to prepare the lead halide precursor. DMSO makes a strong coordination with PbCl 2 owing to its –O– groups. A good coordination between the solvent and solute causes a uniform deposition and high surface coverage [20]. However, complete removal of DMSO needs prolonged annealing times at elevated temperatures, making the perovskite susceptible to decomposition. On the other hand, interaction between DMSO and PbCl 2 causes retarded deposition due to formation of strong DMSO–Pb– complexes [22]. Using pure DMF also leads to a very fast chemical reaction in a few seconds after contact between reagents has been made. This immediate conversion results in rapid and irregular crystallization and unfavorable chemical conversion, coverage, and morphology. Addition of DMF to DMSO optimizes the reaction between precursors and solvent volatility and evaporation rate. We examined different ratios of DMSO/DMF. It was observed that for the conditions of these experiments, the best film quality and coverage is achieved when a 3 : 1 volume ratio of DMSO/DMF is employed as the solvent for PbCl 2.|$|E

This study was developed to evaluate the weed chemical control in glyphosate tolerant soybean, associated to cover crops cultivated in the autumn/winter. The experiment was carried out under field conditions at the FCAV/Unesp, Jaboticabal, São Paulo State, Brazil. A randomized split-plot block design was used, with four replications. St. Lucia Grass (Brachiaria brizantha ‘Marandu’), forage millet (Pennisetum americanum ‘BN 2 ’), and a treatment with spontaneous growth vegetation were evaluated for plots, and, for subplots, the herbicides glyphosate, chlorimuron - ethyl plus lactofen, and fluazifop-p-butyl, in a <b>sequential</b> <b>spraying,</b> and two controls without any application. Grass cover contributed to the chemical control, suppressing weeds, and the single application of 720 g a. e. ha- 1 of glyphosate, independently of the cover crop cultivated in the autumn/winter, was sufficient for adequately controlling Acanthospermum hispidum, Alternanthera tenella, Amaranthus sp., Bidens pilosa, Xanthium strumarium, Cenchrus echinatus, Digitaria sp., and Eleusine indica, with results similar to the treatment (chlorimuron-ethyl + lactofen) + fluazifop-p-buthyl.

A cobertura com braquiarão contribuiu para o controle químico, exercendo supressão das plantas daninhas. A aplicação única de 720 g e. a. ha- 1 de glyphosate, independentemente da cobertura vegetal utilizada na entressafra, foi suficiente para o controle adequado de Acanthospermum hispidum, Alternanthera tenella, Amaranthus sp., Bidens pilosa, Xanthium strumarium, Cenchrus echinatus, Digitaria sp. e Eleusine indica, com resultados similares ao tratamento (chlorimuron-ethyl + lactofen) + fluazifop-p-buthyl.

A wide range of injection pressure was swiped from 5 MPa to 30 MPa to investigate the effect of injection pressure on spray behaviors. The macroscopic spray images taken by a high-speed camera were used to investigate the influence of the injection pressure on the spray development process. Spray tip penetration, cone angle, and spray tip velocity were measured from the spray images, and the breakup regimes were predicted using dimensional analysis. Experimental results showed that an increase in injection pressure caused a decrease in droplet size based on the <b>sequential</b> <b>spray</b> images and breakup regimes.

40|$|Introduction: Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an {{important}} nut crop in Iran and {{many parts of the}} world. One of the major challenges of growing walnut is planting of non-grafted walnut trees in orchards, which leads to the reduction of yield, quality and productivity of walnut orchards. Compared to the other fruit trees, walnut grafting is difficult and even newly grafted walnut seedlings are vulnerable to fall or winter frost chilling, so that most of the seedlings are lost after subjecting to the cold winter. There are a few studies reporting successful grafting in outdoor conditions, however, final grafting take after winter has been usually ignored. Hence, increased walnut grafting success and improved tree growth after grafting through foliar nutrient application may lead to increased tolerance of chilling. Therefore, main goals of this research were to investigate the effect of some graft covers and role of foliar spray of calcium, boron and zinc on the reduction of frost damage in newly grafted seedlings under outdoor conditions. Materials and methods: This research was conducted at agricultural research station, Khoy city, west Azerbaijan province, during 2012 - 2014.

For HAT, vector control is an important complement to case detection and treatment, because reducing vector density can rapidly halt human trypanosomiasis transmission [1, 2]. Also, in the absence of any chemoprophylaxis, vector control remains the only available strategy capable of protecting human individuals from acquiring infection [3]. For AAT, vector control remains widely used.
