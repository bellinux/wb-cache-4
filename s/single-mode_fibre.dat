2500|$|... 10 Gigabit Ethernet {{defines a}} version of Ethernet with a nominal data rate of 10 Gbit/s, ten {{times as fast as}} Gigabit Ethernet. In 2002, the first 10 Gigabit Ethernet {{standard}} was published as IEEE Std 802.3ae-2002. Subsequent standards encompass media types for <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibre</b> (long haul), multi-mode fibre (up to 400m), copper backplane (up to 1m) and copper twisted pair (up to 100m). All 10-gigabit standards were consolidated into IEEE Std 802.3-2008. , 10 Gigabit Ethernet is predominantly deployed in carrier networks, where 10GBASE-LR and 10GBASE-ER enjoy significant market shares.|$|E
50|$|The first 40 Gbit/s Ethernet <b>Single-mode</b> <b>Fibre</b> PMD {{study group}} meeting {{was held in}} January 2010 and on March 25, 2010 the P802.3bg <b>Single-mode</b> <b>Fibre</b> PMD Task Force was {{approved}} for the 40 Gbit/s serial SMF PMD.|$|E
5000|$|In The Netherlands in {{the city}} of Eindhoven and a nearby village of Nuenen, there is a large network with 15 000 connections. Triple play is offered. Houses and {{companies}} are connected with <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibre.</b> The network is owned by the members themselves, who formed a corporation. The first European FTTH project was also in Eindhoven in a neighborhood known as the [...] "Vlinderflats". This was a multi-mode fibre but was in 2005 changed to <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibre.</b> FTTH resulted in new broadband services; the inhabitants started their own broadband TV station called VlinderTV.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} few years new <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> have been {{developed}} and presented to the market which ex-hibit lower bending loss than common <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres,</b> so-called "bend-improved " or "bend-tolerant " fibres. Recently a new “bend-insensitive ” fibre type has been developed, which reduces bending loss by more than an order of magnitude compared to bend-tolerant fibres while being backwards compatible with standard <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres.</b> This has been achieved through nanoStructures ™ technology, enabling fibre optic cable designs that bring optical cable installation on par with copper communication cables. Since these new fibres differ in structure from standard <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres,</b> modifications in some fusion splicing processes become necessary. Investigations of suitable fusion processes and the results are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of polarisation optical time-domain reflectometry in <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> is demonstrated. Polarisation {{analysis of the}} backscattered light clearly shows {{the evolution of the}} state of polarisation in the fibre. It is further shown that the polarised nature of the scatter return from <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> can cause errors in conventional backscatter measurements...|$|R
40|$|Influence of the {{bending radius}} on the {{radiation}} resistance of <b>single-mode</b> glass optical <b>fibres</b> {{is discussed in}} this paper. Radiation induced attenuation in <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> shows discrepancies when measured in specific geometries allowing high dose rates. A series of dedicated tests shows that this phenomenon is related to low bending radius. For irradiation tests of <b>single-mode</b> optical <b>fibres,</b> the spool radius should therefore be carefully chosen...|$|R
50|$|A further advance was {{reported}} by Washio et al. in 1980 when they pumped 150 m of <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibre</b> with a 1.34 μm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. This was just inside the anomalous dispersion regime for their fibre. The result was a continua which stretched from 1.15 to 1.6 μm and showed no discrete Stokes lines.|$|E
5000|$|Dark fibre {{capacity}} is typically used by network operators to build SONET and dense {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (DWDM) networks, usually involving meshes of self-healing rings. Now, it is also used by end-user enterprises to expand Ethernet local area networks, especially since the adoption of IEEE standards for gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet over <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibre.</b> Running Ethernet networks between geographically separated buildings is a practice known as [...] "WAN elimination." ...|$|E
50|$|With the {{increasing}} bandwidth requirements of developments such as 4K/UHDTV, HFR (high frame rate) and HDR (high dynamic range) {{the use of}} triax is declining in the TV industry. Most of the recently developed broadcast cameras from the leading manufacturers have hybrid <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibre</b> and copper power cores which supersede the older triax connectivity. The advantages of the hybrid copper/fibre over triax cable are noise immunity due to the optical isolation and extremely high bandwidth.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for determining unambiguously, from the far-field pattern of <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres,</b> the core diameter and the refractive-index difference between core and cladding. It involves measurements {{only of the}} half-power width of the main lobe and {{the width of the}} first minimum. Universal curves are presented that can be used with <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> or any fibre operating in the single-mode regime. Independent determinations of core diameter over the range 4 - 8 µm by an etching technique are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the far-field pattern...|$|R
40|$|Backscatter {{measurements}} {{have been}} made on <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> with high precision and good spatial resolution. Apparent changes in local attenuation are revealed which occur over short fibre lengths and result from backscatter factor variations. The latter are compared to known fluctuations in fibre parameters. It is found that the backscatter signal is less sensitive to diameter variations in <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> than in multimode fibres. Longitudinal variations of numerical aperture, scattering loss coefficient or core radius preclude an accurate determination of local attenuation derived from backscatter measurements made at one end only of the fibr...|$|R
40|$|Fibre lasers present {{numerous}} {{advantages over}} other lasers {{not only in}} terms of low threshold, efficiency and low operating power but also with respect to their compatibility with standard <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres.</b> Lasing action has been demonstrated in rare-earth doped silica <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> with both semiconductor laser and argon ion/dye laser pump sources. Semiconductor laser-diode pumping is highly convenient both in terms of cost and operational requirements. We describe here the characteristics of a single-mode Nd 3 +-doped fibre laser operating at 1. 088 µm. In particular results are presented for CW, Q-switched and mode-locked operatio...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{dispersion}} compensating microstructured fibre {{design is}} proposed. The fibre has a honeycomb cladding structure with an up-doped core region, {{and is designed}} to match the relative dispersion slope of standard <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibre.</b> A dispersion value below - 1350 ps·nm⁻¹�km⁻¹ at 1550 nm has been predicted...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been carried out on propagation in <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> having a dip in the refractive index at the centre of the core. The energy of the mode gradually spreads from the centre of the core with increase of the degree of the dip. Nevertheless the near- and far-field distributions of such <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> are very nearly Gaussian in shape. A simple method of estimating the limit of the single-mode region for any kind of index profile is presented. For a particular class of profiles, dip widths up to 30 % have a negligible effect on the propagation characteristics...|$|R
40|$|When {{research}} on optical fibre communications was first started in 1966 the main interest was in <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> {{since it was}} thought that the bandwidth of step-index fibres, the only type under consideration at the time, would be rather limited. Subsequently, with the development of SELFOC and other types of graded-index fibres, a high degree of equalisation of the group velocities of the fibre modes became possible so that the bandwidth available with multimode fibres was greatly increased. Interest then shifted away from <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> because of the difficulties of handling, launching, jointing and fabrication and also because the lifetimes of semiconductor lasers, the only small and relatively efficient sources possible, were not high. However the limits of bandwidth which are theoretically possible with an optimum refractive-index distribution are difficult to achieve in practice and the technology has now advanced to the stage where <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> may not be as difficult to incorporate into a practical system as was first thought. A renewed interest has therefore been shown in small-core fibres and a comparison of their properties with those of multimode fibres is presented here...|$|R
40|$|We show, both {{experimentally}} and theoretically, {{that for}} <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres,</b> the (E) ESI and MFD methods are interrelated in a self-consistent model with the theoretical cutoff wavelength playing a pivotal role.

40|$|A set of coupled-mode {{equations}} for helical fibres are formulated. These equations {{are then}} used to analyse the helical <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> with intrinsic linear birefrinqence. The eigen-modes and the resultant birefringence of the whole waveguides are obtained. The effect of the external perturbation on these waveguide are also considered...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} {{a great deal of}} interest in the development of <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres,</b> capable of transmitting linearly-polarized light. Conventional monomode fibres exhibit linear birefringence; they therefore have an output state which is, in general, elliptically polarized and different from that at the input. Apart from the possible curtailment of the transmission bandwidth caused by this birefringence, the indeterminacy of the output polarization is a considerable disadvantage when coupling fibres to polarization-sensitive integrated-optics receivers. In addition, several interesting devices which utilise <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> have recently emerged and it has been found that the intrinsic retardance present in the fibres accompanied by the uncertainty in output polarization imposes a limitation on performance. Amongst these, the best known are the Faraday-effect current transducer, the fibre Raman laser and the fibre gyroscop...|$|R

40|$|Optical fibres {{have been}} {{developed}} to a high degree of sophistication for applications in long-distance transmission. Silica-based fibres have attenuations close to the theoretical minimum at wavelengths of 0. 85 µm, 1. 3 µm and 1. 55 µm, while the bandwidth of <b>single-mode</b> <b>fibres</b> can, for all practical purposes, be made almost infinite at wavelengths greater than 1. 3 µm. Attention is now being given to the design of new types of fibre for application as sensors in control and process engineering. At Southampton we have fabricated fibres with zero birefringence, strong linear birefringence and strong circular birefringence. Secondly we have made fibres with longitudinal metal components close to the core to produce electrically-activated modulation and switching.
