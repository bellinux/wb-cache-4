40|$|The {{photometric}} transit {{timing technique}} was proposed by Szabó et al. (2006) {{as a method}} for discovering moons of transiting extrasolar planets. In the preliminary analysis of this technique, {{it was assumed that}} the noise in the transit lightcurve was well described by uncorrelated white noise. However, this assumption is not necessarily realistic. To determine the eﬀect of using more realistic lightcurves, transit timing uncertainties are calculated for the case of white <b>noise,</b> measured <b>solar</b> photometric <b>noise</b> and measured <b>solar</b> photometric <b>noise</b> that has been ﬁltered. It is found that for light curves contaminated with realistic photometric noise, the transit timing uncertainties are dramatically increased (and thus moon detection reduced).

50|$|Noise that {{originates}} {{from the}} Sun is called <b>solar</b> <b>noise.</b> Under normal conditions there is constant {{radiation from the}} Sun due to its high temperature. Electrical disturbances such as corona discharges, as well as sunspots can produce additional noise.|$|E
50|$|Sunspot {{activity}} {{has a major}} effect on long distance radio communications, particularly on the shortwave bands although medium wave and low VHF frequencies are also affected. High levels of sunspot activity lead to improved signal propagation on higher frequency bands, although they also increase the levels of <b>solar</b> <b>noise</b> and ionospheric disturbances. These effects are caused by impact of the increased level of solar radiation on the ionosphere.|$|E
50|$|The steady {{electric}} discharging {{currents in}} a lightning channel cause {{a series of}} incoherent impulses in the whole frequency range, the amplitudes of which decreases approximately with the inverse frequency. In the ELF-range, technical noise from 50 or 60 Hz, natural noise from the magnetosphere, etc. dominates. In the VLF-range, there are the coherent impulses from R- and K-strokes, appearing out of the background noise. Beyond about 100 kHz, the noise amplitude {{becomes more and more}} incoherent. In addition, technical noise from electric motors, ignition systems of motor cars, etc., are superimposed. Finally, beyond the high frequency band (3-30 MHz) extraterrestrial noise (noise of galactic origin, <b>solar</b> <b>noise)</b> dominates.|$|E
40|$|On 6 April 1971 a solar X-ray flare and a type 3 <b>solar</b> radio <b>noise</b> burst were {{observed}} with instrumentation on the eccentric-orbiting satellite IMP 6.

40|$|Continuous {{atmospheric}} probing by a lidar is {{a requirement}} for many applications. However, due to high <b>solar</b> background <b>noise</b> during the daytime, lidar operations are mostly restricted to night-time. While many techniques are in practice, like reducing the receiver field of view, changing the view angle, introducing a narrow band Interference Filter (IF), these are applied to circumvent problems, rather than to suppress the noise. Using a Fabry-Perot interferometer as a narrow passband filter for <b>solar</b> background <b>noise</b> suppression is a known technique, and its potential is exploited in our system. An optical-fiber-coupled lidar system with its transmitter injection seeded was developed and has been operated during the daytime at Gadanki (13. 6 ˚N, 79. 2 ˚ E). The signal-to-noise ratio of the return signal is used as the performance indicator, to evaluate the improvements. Signal-to-noise ratios with and without the Fabry-Perot interferometer are measured with near identical test set-ups. The signal-to-noise ratio enhancement factor is ca. 4, {{in agreement with the}} theoretical value. The performance is compared when the receiver fields of view are changed. </p...|$|R

[...] Similar sentiments were expressed by others, with descriptions ranging from [...] "punchy breakcore freneticism coiled tightly around endlessly twisted ambience and hectic experimental sound sculpture", to [...] "a gaseous contrail of <b>solar</b> <b>noise</b> and ice particles where ambient breaths of watery melodies get heat-flashed into steam, and software-driven drum programming is savaged by extended processor cycles."

In {{a review of}} the album's 2008 re-issue, Brian Howe of Pitchfork stated that The Glow Pt. 2 remained to be Phil Elverum's [...] "crowning achievement" [...] and that [...] "seven years of imitation have done nothing to dull its impact-- it sounds as unaccountably grand now as it did in 2001". Brock Thiessen of Exclaim! described the album as [...] "a brave new world where <b>solar</b> <b>noise</b> bursts over sprawling epics of the most intimate nature" [...] and stated that [...] "it's clear age hasn't tainted the kaleidoscopic Glow Pt. 2 in the least". Both reviews praised the bonus material on Other Songs & Destroyed Versions as essential, with the latter asserting that while [...] "none of the new lyrics clarify the overarching story", the new tracks [...] "reveal a few more glimpses of a distant, haunting world that's all the more alluring for its incompleteness". Writing for PopMatters, Dan Raper stated that [...] "Microphones fans will find Other Songs & Destroyed Versions more than worth the investment".|$|E
40|$|Spaceborne laser {{altimeters}} in {{planetary orbit}} typically use high energy (approximately 100 mJ) solid state lasers, large telescopes (50 to 100 cm), and high detection thresholds to achieve unambiguous surface returns with {{few or no}} ifalse alarmsi resulting from <b>solar</b> background <b>noise.</b> As {{a result of this}} conservative design philosophy, spacecraft prime power weight, or size constraints typically restrict operations to modest repetition rates on the order of a few tens of Hz which, at a typical ground velocity of 7 Km/sec, limits along-track spatial sampling to one sample every few hundred meters. The surface return rate of an Earth-orbiting altimeter can be increased by up to two orders of magnitude for a given laser output power by emitting the available photons in a high frequency (few KHz) train of low energy (< 1 mJ) pulses, as produced by passively Q-switched solid state "microlasers", and using single photon detection. while simultaneously using much smaller telescope diameters on the order of 10 cm. Simple onboard software algorithms, based on post-detection Poisson filtering techniques, can be employed to identify and extract the surface data from <b>solar</b> background <b>noise</b> prior to onboard data storage or transmission to a ground station.

40|$|The sudden {{outburst}} of in-band <b>solar</b> radio <b>noise</b> from the Sun {{is recognized as}} one of the potential Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) sources that directly impact the performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. On September 24, 2011, the solar active region 1302 unleashed a moderate M 7. 1 soft X-ray flare associated with a very powerful radio burst at 1415  MHz. The Solar Radio Burst (SRB) event spanned over three distinct episodes of <b>solar</b> radio <b>noise</b> emission that reached the maximum radio flux density of 114, 144 Solar Flux Units (SFU) at 13 : 04 : 46 UTC. This paper analyzes the impact of September 24, 2011 SRB event on the performance of a significant subset of NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers located in the sunlit hemisphere. The performance assessment is carried out in terms of Carrier-to-Noise power spectral density ratio (C/N 0) degradation, dual-frequency pseudorange measurements availability, pseudorange residual errors, and dual-frequency positioning errors in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. We observed that during the SRB event the GPS C/N 0 is reduced at most by 13  dB on L 1 and 24 dB on L 2. The C/N 0 degradation caused the loss of lock on GPS L 1 and L 2 signals and significant code-tracking errors. We noticed that many stations experienced less than four satellite measurements, which are the minimum required number of measurements for position estimation. The deteriorated satellite-receiver geometry due to loss of signal lock and significant code-tracking errors during the solar radio burst event introduced large positioning errors in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Rise in vertical positioning error of 303  m and rise in horizontal positioning of 55  m could be noticed during the solar radio burst event...|$|R
40|$|Data {{acquired}} {{with the}} Geophysics Laboratory's high-latitude meteor scatter test-bed between Sondrestrom Air Base (AB) and Thule AB, Greenland, during the solar disturbances of March and August 1989 are presented. These disturbances provided {{a unique opportunity}} to observe a number of naturally occurring disturbance effects on meteor scatter links operated in the frequency range (35 to 147 MHz) covered by the test-bed. The disturbances range from signal absorption to system noise variations. The properties of ionospheric absorption in general are discussed and illustrated with computations using electron density profiles from the September 1978 solar proton event (SPE). It has been found that accurate measurements of high levels of ionospheric absorption with riometers pose special problems. These problems are identified and discussed. The data acquired during the March and August 1989 solar disturbances are then related to the zenith absorption measured at Thule, and the influence of absorption as well as system noise variations are discussed. The two events presented are very different. The August event was dominated by ionospheric absorption which affected meteor arrival rates and duty cycles primarily at the lower frequencies (35 and 45 MHz), although some effects could also be seen at the higher frequencies (65 to 147 MHz). The March event combined weak ionospheric absorption with large <b>solar</b> <b>noise</b> bursts. The effects of this event on the test-bed were dominated by increased <b>solar</b> <b>noise</b> at all frequencies. The relative influence of <b>solar</b> <b>noise</b> and ionospheric absorption during SPE events is discussed along with speculation as to the validity of frequency dependence conclusions based on testing of the JANET system...|$|E
40|$|The solar {{brightness}} varies on timescales from {{minutes to}} decades. Determining {{the sources of}} such variations, {{often referred to as}} <b>solar</b> <b>noise,</b> is of importance for multiple reasons: a) it is the background that limits the detection of solar oscillations, b) variability in solar brightness is one of the drivers of the Earth's climate system, c) it is a prototype of stellar variability which is an important limiting factor for the detection of extra-solar planets. Here we show that recent progress in simulations and observations of the Sun makes it finally possible to pinpoint the source of the <b>solar</b> <b>noise.</b> We utilise high-cadence observations from the Solar Dynamic Observatory and the SATIRE model to calculate the magnetically-driven variations of solar brightness. The brightness variations caused by the constantly evolving cellular granulation pattern on the solar surface are computed with the MURAM code. We find that surface magnetic field and granulation can together precisely explain <b>solar</b> <b>noise</b> on timescales from minutes to decades, i. e. ranging over more than six orders of magnitude in the period. This accounts for all timescales that have so far been resolved or covered by irradiance measurements. We demonstrate that no other sources of variability are required to explain the data. Recent measurements of Sun-like stars by CoRoT and Kepler uncovered brightness variations {{similar to that of the}} Sun but with much wider variety of patterns. Our finding that solar brightness variations can be replicated in detail with just two well-known sources will greatly simplify future modelling of existing CoRoT and Kepler as well as anticipated TESS and PLATO data.

30|$|We {{investigated}} {{failures in}} the GPS performance produced by extremely dense solar radio burst fluxes associated with the intense (X 3.4 in GOES classification) solar flare and Halo CME recorded by SOHO/LASCO on December 13, 2006. According to substantial experimental evidence, high-precision GPS positioning on the entire sunlit side of the Earth was partially disrupted for more than 12 – 15 min; {{the high level of}} GPS slips resulted from the wideband <b>solar</b> radio <b>noise</b> emission. Our results are in agreement with the data obtained recently for the extreme solar radio burst on December 6, 2006, and provide a sound basis for revising the role of space weather factors in the functioning of state-of-the-art satellite systems and for taking a more thorough account of these factors in their development and operation.|$|R

In this note, we introduce the basic principles and a mathematical description of correlated mode excitation. We use simple, illustrative examples, involving two modes. Our treatment suggests that in the real observations, any signatures of the correlation would not appear as a correlation of the output amplitudes of overtones, but rather as subtle modifications to the power spectral density at frequencies between the central frequencies of the overtones. These modifications give a contribution to the observed peak asymmetries. Comment: 7 pages; accepted for publication in Astronomische Nachrichte...|$|R
40|$|It is {{essential}} to detect corona discharge as a symptom of insulation breakdown in high voltage applications. However the accuracy of such a measurement is often reduced due {{to the existence of}} <b>solar</b> background <b>noise</b> in the signal. Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum are areas of the solar spectrum where the solar radiation is lower in intensity due to certain wavelengths of light been absorbed by gases in the sun. Analysing the corona and solar spectra reveals that there exists an overlap at certain wavelengths between corona peaks and Fraunhofer lines specifically between the 300 nm - 400 nm wavelength range. This thesis will explore the potential of evaluating corona activity at these Fraunhofer lines and through signal processing optimise the signal to noise ratio. One of the signal processing techniques used was the implementation of an optical band-pass filter. From the results obtained it was determined that the purchased optical filter was not filtering out the solar radiation and hence no corona was detected. The signal to noise ratio was 0. 0314. Consequently it was decided that the optical filter specifications (i. e. (FWHM) and central wavelength (CWL)) were not ideal. Hence a new approach of simulating an optical narrow band-pass filter in MATLAB was applied. The MATLAB model allowed the filter to adjust its bandwidth along the wavelength range until the highest signal to noise ratio was obtained. The signal to noise ratio was 2. 121. The simulated filter specifications that generated the highest signal to noise ratio had a FWHM of 0. 05 nm and CWL of 357. 558 nm which coincided with the wavelength of a different Fraunhofer line and a different corona peak. The results verified that with the newly designed filter the signal to noise ratio increased by 67 %. Thereafter cross correlation was performed for extracting the corona signal from the <b>solar</b> background <b>noise.</b> Correlation proved to be an efficient technique to detect corona in the presence of solar radiation. In essence Fraunhofer lines can be used to detect corona activity during the daytime with the implementation of a suitable filter as well as through cross correlation...|$|R
