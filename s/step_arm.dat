50|$|Defensive measures, such as arming {{merchant}} ships, and advising them {{to either}} run, or turn towards the U-boat {{in order to}} ram, or force it to submerge, were the most effective.From arming ships for self-defence, the next <b>step</b> was <b>arming</b> ships {{for the purpose of}} engaging the U-boats in gun battles; two U-boats were sunk in 1915 whilst attacking trawlers so fitted. The following <b>step</b> was to <b>arm</b> and man ships with hidden guns to do so, the so-called Q ship. A variant on the idea was to equip small vessels with a submarine escort. In 1915, two U-boats were sunk by Q-ships, and two more by submarines accompanying trawlers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This study {{evaluated}} {{which of}} two different stair-stepping techniques produced {{a higher level of}} perceived physi-cal exertion and whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify gluteus maximus activation during stepper exercise and/ or differences in gluteus maximus activation between exercise techniques. The study was a prospective, single-blind, random-ized, two-period, crossover trial. The stair-stepping techniques were 15 -minute sessions of (1) short <b>steps</b> with <b>arms</b> unsupported (Short) or (2) full <b>steps</b> with <b>arms</b> supported (Full). The main out-comes measured were time to reach a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 13, StairMaster console intensity level, volunteers’ judgment as the most strenuous technique, and gluteus maximus MRI signal intensity. We found that participants performing the Short exercise technique reached an RPE of 13 sooner (mean difference 105 +/ – 54 seconds, p = 0. 04) and were unable t...|$|R

As he came down the <b>steps,</b> his <b>arm</b> linked in that of the Celebrity, his {{attitude}} towards his wife was both apologetic and defiant. He had at once the air of a child caught with a forbidden toy, and that of a stripling of twenty-one who flaunts a cigar in his father's face.|$|R

2500|$|The swaying in rhythmic dances was {{considered}} erotic by missionaries and most traditional dancing was forbidden.
