50|$|Basic {{versions}} of the Suzuki Swift (and its related badge-engineered versions) used a 993 cc inline-three-cylinder <b>engine,</b> with <b>single-point</b> <b>injection.</b> The same <b>engine</b> was also used in the Suzuki Wagon R+, with multi-point injection. This was replaced from 2003, with an Opel-sourced 998 cc unit, with four valves per cylinder and variable-length intake manifold, also used on the similar Opel Agila and the third generation of the Opel Corsa, and later on the Suzuki Splash and the fifth generation of the Opel Corsa. The Opel models previously used a 973 cc engine, which was initially featured on the second generation of the Opel Corsa.|$|R
50|$|A {{facelift}} in 1990 (referred to unofficially as the Mark 2F or IIF) saw square headlights, bigger bumpers {{and a new}} interior (dash {{and door}} trim). The three different styles (hatchback, coup√© hatchback and sedan) were maintained. As well as the cosmetic differences, under the skin the car received modifications to the chassis and suspension {{as well as the}} addition of servo-assisted brakes to all models including right hand drive versions. The new Polo still had the 4-cylinder engine but now as well as the carburetor 1.0 L, a fuel injection model was available with <b>single-point</b> <b>injection</b> and all <b>engines</b> came standard with a catalytic converter to combat tightening EU laws on automobile emissions.|$|R
2500|$|The Mark II Facelift (referred {{to as the}} Mark IIF, also erroneously {{known as}} the [...] "Mark 3") was a {{far-reaching}} facelift of the MkII, including a re-skin of the bodywork, launched {{in the autumn of}} 1990. The new look saw square headlights, enlarged and reshaped tail-lights, bigger bumpers and a new interior (dashboard and door trim). The three different body styles were maintained. As well as the cosmetic differences, under the skin the car received modifications to the chassis, suspension and brakes. The new Polo still had the 4 cylinder engines but now as well as the carburettor 1.0L, a fuel injection model was available with <b>single-point</b> <b>injection</b> and all <b>engines</b> came with a catalytic converter as standard to combat tightening European emissions regulations. The saloon was only produced in Spain, and production ceased in 1992 due to disappointing sales.|$|R
50|$|The {{justification}} for <b>single-point</b> <b>injection</b> was low cost. Many of the carburetor's supporting components - {{such as the}} air cleaner, intake manifold, and fuel line routing - could be reused. This postponed the redesign and tooling costs of these components. <b>Single-point</b> <b>injection</b> was used extensively on American-made passenger {{cars and light trucks}} during 1980-1995, and in some European cars in the early and mid-1990s.|$|R

50|$|All engines were inline-four-cylinder units, front {{transverse}} mounted: The 0.9-litre and 1.2-litre engines had carburetor, {{as did the}} 1.5-litre 85 hp engine, {{while the}} 1.5-litre 90 hp and 1.7-litre engines, introduced in 1989, used <b>single-point</b> <b>injection</b> systems. The 1.5-litre 100 hp, introduced in 1988, had multi-point fuel injection. The 1.7-litre diesel was an indirect injection unit.|$|R
5000|$|A special [...] "twin-port injection" [...] {{version of}} the 1.3 L (1275 cc) engine was {{developed}} by Rover engineer, Mike Theaker. It was the last A-Series variant, produced from 1997-2000. Japanese model received <b>single-point</b> <b>injection</b> {{version of the}} engine and the radiator {{is still on the}} side due to the space constraint for the air conditioner component.|$|R
50|$|From 1992 to 1996 General Motors {{implemented}} a system called Central Port Injection or Central Port Fuel Injection. The system uses tubes with poppet valves from a central injector to spray fuel at each intake port {{rather than the}} central throttle-body. Fuel pressure {{is similar to a}} <b>single-point</b> <b>injection</b> system. CPFI (used from 1992 to 1995) is a batch-fire system, while CSFI (from 1996) is a sequential system.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the aspects of mixture {{preparation}} in petrol engines which are {{of interest to the}} mechanical engineers and researchers. The work reviewed the characteristics and behaviour of fuel and air flow in the intake manifolds of petrol engines and emphasised on investigation of fuel distribution between cylinders in a carburation engine and a multi-point <b>injection</b> <b>engine.</b> Characteristics of the flows of liquid fuel film, fuel droplets, fuel evaporation and process of mixing of fuel and air were analysed. The presence and behaviour of a large amount of liquid fuel film and fuel droplets in the intake manifolds was confirmed to be a main cause of inhomogeneity of mixture supplied to the cylinders. Atomising fuel spray and heating inlet manifolds are good methods for improving fuel evaporation and mixing of fuel and air in the intake manifolds to achieve homogeneous mixture for good operations of the engines. Fuel distribution between cylinders of a carburation engine and a multi-point <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> was investigated, using the method of exhaust gas analysis. The results showed that in the multi-point <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> fuel distribution between the cylinders is much better than in the carburation <b>engine</b> although the <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> is equipped with a pneumatically controlled fuel injection pump (delta A/F ratio of 0. 35 to 0. 93 in the <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> in contrast of delta A/F ratio of 0. 76 to 1. 7 in the carburation engine at normal running conditions). <b>Injection</b> <b>engines</b> equipped with an electronically controlled fuel injection system would have much better improvement in fuel distribution than the <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> used for the present study. Heating the intake manifold in the carburation engine (by increasing coolant temperature) indicated a good improvement in fuel distribution between the cylinders while heating inlet air was not an effective way. In the <b>injection</b> <b>engine,</b> fuel distribution between the cylinders was seen to be not significantly affected by heating...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of particle emissions from gasoline port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> {{have not been}} fully investigated and established in comparison with those from direct-injection spark ignition engines. This paper aims to evaluate a new measurement system that could potentially be adapted later to allow a much wider examination of particulate production from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> relative to gasoline direct-injection engines. This work presents the morphology of the particles emitted from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> analysed using scanning transmission electron microscopy. The current designs of dilution tunnel used in particle morphology measurements were reviewed, and subsequently a new dilution tunnel was designed, built, tested and optimised for nanoparticle measurements from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines.</b> A new methodology for capturing nanoparticles from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> for morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy was investigated by integrating a nanoparticle impactor with a dilution tunnel. The performance of the dilution tunnel demonstrated that it integrated very well with the impactor and achieved the targets {{in terms of the}} flow rate and the temperature. The widest variety of particle morphologies, including liquid particles, was observed on the transmission electron microscopy grid from impactor plate A. In addition to soot agglomerates, crystalline particles and salt particles were also seen. In contrast with earlier studies, particle fragmentation was also observed...|$|R

50|$|The {{precombustion chamber}} {{patented}} in 1909 by L'Orange {{connects to the}} engine cylinder via a restricted passage, or burner. In operation, a narrow cone of fuel is sprayed down towards the burner by the single orifice injector nozzle. At this time the technology did not exist to manufacture nozzles with multiple orifices and diesels used high pressure air to spray the fuel directly into the cylinder. L'Orange also discovered that indirect <b>injection</b> diesel <b>engines</b> ran more smoothly and quietly than direct <b>injection</b> <b>engines.</b> Use of a precombustion chamber also reduced stress on the engine's structure, {{so that it could}} be made less heavy than a direct <b>injection</b> <b>engine.</b> However, indirect <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> require higher compression ratios, about 20:1, to compensate for the greater surface to volume ratio causing more heat loss from the cylinder charge. They are also more difficult to start when cold, therefore the precombustion chambers are fitted with electrically heated glowplugs.|$|R
