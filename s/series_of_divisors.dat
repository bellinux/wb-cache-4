50|$|The highest averages {{method is}} the name {{for a variety of}} ways to {{allocate}} seats proportionally for representative assemblies with party list voting systems. It requires the number of votes for each party to be divided successively by a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>divisors.</b> This produces a table of quotients, or averages, with a row for each divisor and a column for each party. The th seat is allocated to the party whose column contains the th largest entry in this table, up to the total number of seats available.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the electoral threshold, the minimum percentage of the vote that a party must obtain to win seats, there are several different methods for calculating seat allocation in proportional systems, typically broken down into the two main types; highest average and largest remainder. Highest average systems involve dividing the votes received by each party by a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>divisors,</b> producing figures that determine seat allocation; examples include the d'Hondt method (of which there are variants including Hagenbach-Bischoff) or the Webster/Sainte-Laguë method. Under largest remainder systems, party's vote shares are divided by the quota (obtained by dividing the number of votes {{by the number of}} seats available). This usually leaves some seats unallocated, which are awarded to parties based on the largest fractions of seats that they have remaining. Examples of largest remainder systems include the Hare quota, Droop quota, the Imperiali quota and the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} multi-point algebraic geometric codes defined from curves {{related to}} the generalized Hermitian curve introduced by Alp Bassa, Peter Beelen, Arnaldo Garcia, and Henning Stichtenoth. Our main result {{is to find a}} basis of the Riemann-Roch space of a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>divisors,</b> which can be used to construct multi-point codes explicitly. These codes turn out to have nice properties similar to those of Hermitian codes, for example, they are easy to describe, to encode and decode. It is shown that the duals are also such codes and an explicit formula is given. In particular, this formula enables one to calculate the parameters of these codes. Finally, we apply our results to obtain linear codes attaining new records on the parameters. A new record-giving [234, 141,≥ 59] -code over F_ 27 is presented as one of the examples.
