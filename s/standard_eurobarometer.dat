The Central and Eastern Eurobarometer (CEEB) surveys were begun in 1990, when nationally representative surveys were undertaken {{on behalf of the}} European Commission in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and the Soviet Union. The surveys, which explored individuals' attitudes toward democratic and economic reform, were carried out in the autumn of each year from 1990 to 1997, in up to twenty countries in the region. An extension of the Eurobarometer series, conducted semi-annually in the member nations of the European Union (EU), the Central and Eastern Eurobarometers also focused on public support for the EU and on other issues facing Europe as a whole. After the first wave of research, the number of countries was variably expanded to reflect then-current political alignments and realities of access for survey researchers. In each of the countries surveyed, approximately 1, 000 persons aged 15 and over were interviewed in their own homes. The surveys ended in 1997 and were later replaced by the Candidate Countries Eurobarometers.

Main Topics : The eighth round of Central and Eastern Eurobarometer surveys focused on the topics of evaluation of the economic and democratic reforms (including human rights, perception of Europe and the European Community (and its role in Eastern Europe), attitudes towards NATO membership and knowledge of foreign languages. Respondents were asked many questions that appeared in earlier surveys in this series. These included items on whether respondents felt that things in their country were going in the right or wrong direction, how satisfied they were with the way democracy was developing and how it was working in their country, and how much respect there now was for human rights. Respondents were also asked to identify the flags of different countries and organizations, to provide their impressions of the aims and activities of the European Union (EU), and to comment on which countries they believed their future was most closely tied to, how they would vote if referenda on the question of their country's membership in the EU and in NATO were held tomorrow, and the main reasons for their votes. Additional questions focused on which groups within their societies would likely benefit or lose out as ties between their country and the EU increased, whether their country or the EU itself benefitted the most from the current relationship between the two, the ways they might hear about the activities of the EU, and if they wanted to learn more about what the EU was doing on a variety of economic and social issues. New questions explored whether respondents had ever heard of the United Nations, the European Union, or the Council of Europe, and whether they would be more or less likely to vote for EU membership if their country had first joined NATO. Demographic information collected on respondents covers gender, age, highest level of education completed, occupation, voting status, mother tongue and knowledge of other languages, which party they would vote for should there be a general election held tomorrow, nationality/ethnic background, region of residence, size of locality, and income. <br...|$|R

This changed radically with the recession, with trust in the ECB becoming correlated quite closely with growth. However, even the recovery of growth in 2009 was not sufficient to restore trust in the ECB to previous levels.

In October 2001, the European Commission launched {{a new series of}} surveys in the 13 countries that are applying for European Union (EU) membership under the heading Candidate Countries Eurobarometer (CC-EB). Initially named Applicant Countries Eurobarometer or AC-EB, the surveys were ordered and co-ordinated by the Directorate-General for Press and Communication (Public Opinion Analysis). The CC-EB surveys are carried out in Bulgaria, Republic of Cyprus (with a separate Northern Cyprus survey parallel to 2002. 2), Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey. After a four year gap they are replacing the former Central and Eastern Eurobarometer. A pilot survey was conducted for test purposes in winter 1999 / 2000. After the EU enlargement in May 2004, the CC-EB series became part of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer,</b> intermittently also including the remaining candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia and Northern Cyprus. Candidate Countries Eurobarometer gathers information from the societies which are applying to become members of the EU {{in a way that is}} comparable with the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer.</b> Also the methodology used is almost identical to that of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer.</b> Every survey is carried out on national representative samples of around 1, 000 respondents (realised interviews) aged 15 and over in each country, except Malta and Cyprus, where the samples are of 500 respondents, using face-to-face interviewing at the respondent's home. The national samples reflect the structure of population aged 15 + in terms of gender, age, regions of a country, settlement size, education level, and marital status. In each of the 13 candidate countries, the surveys are carried out by national institutes associated with and co-ordinated by the Hungarian office of The Gallup Organization in Budapest and Gallup Europe in Brussels.

Main Topics : This round of Central and Eastern Eurobarometer Surveys focused on public support for the European Community and on attitudes toward political and economic reforms and other issues facing Europe. Respondents were asked whether they felt their country was going in the right direction in general, how well their country's economy and their own finances had fared over the past year, whether they thought the establishment of a free market economy was right or wrong, and whether economic reforms and privatization were occurring too fast or slow. Satisfaction with the development of democracy and with their own place in their political system was assessed, as was intention to vote in the next general election. A series of questions elicited opinions on the respect for human rights in one's own country and on the situation for minority rights. Several items concerned respondents' trust in various forms of information media, including broadcasts from the West. Respondents were asked how frequently they think of themselves as European. They were also asked to indicate how aware they were of, and how interested in, the European Community, its activities, and institutions, and to rate how positively they regarded the European Community, and the prospect of their country's membership in the Community. Country-specific questions were asked regarding sources of information about the European Community. Participants were also asked about how the economy, government, and private citizens might be advantaged or disadvantaged by the country's increasing ties with the European Community. The survey explored the prospect of future alignments with the United States, the European Community, other East European countries, other (non-EC) European countries, Russia, Turkey, Japan, and South Korea. Opinions were sought on the fairness of European Community and other countries' trade and assistance policies. Respondents' views were obtained on the break-up of European nations and on their personal likelihood of emigration to other European countries, and on the effectiveness of the United Nations and other international organizations' intervention in former Yugoslavia. A few of these questions were asked of a small sample of persons in Serbia and Croatia. Demographic data collected on each participant includes age, education, occupation, religion, ethnic background, mother tongue, citizenship, union membership, left/right political placement, sex, and income. <br...|$|R
40|$|Background: Health {{literacy}} {{concerns the}} capacities {{of people to}} meet the complex demands of health in modern society. In spite of the growing attention for the concept among European health policymakers, researchers and practitioners, information {{about the status of}} health literacy in Europe remains scarce. This article presents selected findings from the first European comparative survey on health literacy in populations. Methods: The European health literacy survey (HLS-EU) was conducted in eight countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain (n = 1000 per country, n = 8000 total sample). Data collection was based on <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>standards</b> and the implementation of the HLS-EU-Q (questionnaire) in computer-assisted or paper-assisted personal interviews. Results: The HLS-EU-Q constructed four levels of health literacy: insufficient,problematic, sufficient and excellent. At least 1 in 10 (12 %) respondents showed insufficient health literacy and almost 1 in 2 (47 %) had limited (insufficient or problematic) health literacy. However, the distribution of levels differed substantially across countries (29 – 62 %). Subgroups within the population, defined by financial deprivation,low social status, low education or old age, had higher proportions of people with limited health literacy,suggesting the presence of a social gradient which was also confirmed by raw bivariate correlations and a multivariate linear regression model. Discussion: Limited health literacy represents an important challenge for health policies and practices across Europe, but to a different degree for different countries. The social gradient in health literacy {{must be taken into account}} when developing public health strategies to improve health equity in Europe...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{documents}} {{the changes in}} Italian public opinion towards the Euro. Its aim is to assess the relevance of economic factors for the decline in Italian support for the common currency. The thesis begins by assessing {{the extent to which}} support for the Euro has declined in Italy. While there has been popular, media and political comment on this issue, the thesis investigates the changes in attitude through the use of survey material and concludes that there is compelling evidence that public support for the Euro has declined in Italy. The thesis adopts a utilitarian/rational choice approach in order to investigate the reasoning behind the Italian public's developing relationship with the single currency from 1998 to the present. Its central question is: How have economic factors impacted on the Italian public's support for the Euro? The analysis focuses on Italians' perceptions - not their actual knowledge - of national and individual level economic changes brought about by the single currency. The thesis investigates how such perceptions have impacted Italian popular support for the Euro over the period 1998 - 2007. The method employed in this thesis is primarily based around analysing quantitative data gathered from <b>Standard</b> and Flash <b>Eurobarometers.</b> Other sources considered are academic literature and newspaper articles. The analysis clearly suggests that Italians' optimism towards their national and personal economic situations have all decreased since the Euro was introduced, concurrently with their diminishing support for the Euro. This work suggests that the main reason for decreased support lies in Italian perceptions that the Euro has contributed to worsening economic situations at both the national and individual levels. In particular, Italians believe the Euro has spurred inflation and diminished their purchasing power, and accuse it of failing to promote economic growth and jobs. However, Eurobarometer data combined with newspaper articles indicate that it is the perceived economic consequences at the individual level - loss of purchasing power due to Euro-related price increases, and pessimism towards their household financial situation - that more strongly determine Italians' decreasing support for the Euro...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{questions}} regarding economic inequalities have attracted {{an increasing number}} of research in the field on interdisciplinary social sciences. However, not enough attention has yet been paid for understanding the perceptions of economic inequalities and, particularly, the perceived size of inequalities in the society. The central research question set in this analysis explores how the magnitude of economic inequality is perceived in European Union Member states and how possible variation in these perceptions can be explained. Seven theory-based hypotheses are formulated in order to test both individual and contextual country-level effects on perceived magnitude of inequality. Assumed explanations at individual level include different demographic characteristics, subjective social status, expectations towards social mobility and attitudes towards welfare state. Marco level factors, included in formulated hypotheses, consider selected macroeconomic parameters, post-Soviet heritage and typology of welfare regimes. <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> survey data (81. 5) is chosen as the primary data set for statistical analysis. The designed methodological approach combines multiple and multilevel regression modelling in assessing explanatory capacity of chosen micro and macro-level indicators. The results yield for diverse explanation of perceived magnitude of economic inequality, including both individual and contextual country-level factors. Findings also reveal that personal believes and attitudes carry the largest part in overall explanatory capacity of the presented research model. More specifically, lower self-placement in society, negative expectations of future social mobility and higher support for welfare state prove to be the most significant explanatory factors for amplified perceptions of inequality magnitude...|$|E
40|$|The European Parliament is {{the only}} source of direct {{legitimacy}} of the European Union, as it {{is the only}} body directly elected by the citizens. Politics within the European Parliament has increasingly grown in importance, as its powers expanded progressively with each European Union treaty. The opposite happened with voter turnout. This paper builds on the idea that the European elections are perceived as less important by the voters’ parties and the media, and are in general characterized by a lower electoral participation with respect to National elections. We analyze turnout from two perspectives: individual and aggregate level. Individual electoral models are estimated using data from the European Social Survey and <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> Survey, referring at electoral turnout at National and Supranational level, respectively. From an individual level perspective, we test if unequal participation exists concerning socioeconomic categories across “firstorder” National elections and “second-order” European elections in order to understand if a potential representation bias might exist. Empirical evidence highlights that inequality in participation exists only for the European Parliament elections. From the aggregate level side, an original panel data is used {{in order to understand the}} turnout gap across elections and test the “second-order” theory concerning the European Parliament elections as an opportunity to contest governing parties. Evidence shows that a vote share gap across the two election types exists, and that large as well as extremist and parties from European Monetary Union Member States lose votes across elections.

A precursor to the Eurobarometer studies, this survey queried respondents of six European countries on some of what would become <b>standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> measures, such as how satisfied respondents were with their present lives. Other questions focused on respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the European Community (EC), including how well-informed they felt about the EC, what sources {{of information about the}} EC they used, whether their country had benefited from being an EC member, and the extent of their personal interest in EC matters. Another major focus of the survey was on the respondents' attitudes toward the unification of Europe, probing opinions concerning the economic, political, and administrative aspects of unification. Information was gathered concerning national pride and willingness to replace individual symbols of nationalism with "United States of Europe" symbols. In addition, the study investigated the respondents' attitudes toward world society and politics. The emphasis was on the respondents' opinion of appropriate governmental priorities, both domestic and international. The degree of political participation of the respondents and their trust of foreigners was also ascertained. The data include two constructed indices that were used in analyses conducted by Ronald Inglehart and reported in The silent revolution: changing values and political styles among western publics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1977). One of these indices places the respondent along a materialist-postmaterialist values continuum and the other categorises the respondent's political ideology according to his or her party preference. Demographic data include sex, age, education, occupation, size of town, and region.

Another major focus of the surveys was on the respondents' satisfaction with various aspects of life and society, including satisfaction with their work, housing, leisure time, welfare programs, and life in general. Respondents' political attitudes were also assessed. For example political party preference, political participation, and which goals they felt were important for their country. Another series of questions focused on the European Community. Respondents were asked to name the countries that had recently joined the Common Market. They were also asked to rate the information they received from the news media along several dimensions. Other questions covered respondents' attitudes toward their countries' EC membership. For example whether it was good or bad and why, whether their own country or the European Community could better handle certain problems, and whether it was desirable to work toward a United Europe.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the results of a pilot study themed “Czech {{students}} and EU”, which adum­bra­ted a prepared extensive research in graduation years of secondary schools of the region Vysočina {{on the occasion of the}} Czech chairmanship in the European Union in the first half-year of 2009. The pilot study included 362 students of the Polytechnic College in Jihlava. Its objective consisted particularly in the rectification of a questionnaire and exploratory research into relationships between the know­led­ge and opinion parts of questionnaires even within the both mentioned parts by means of factor analysis and methods of structural modelling. With respect to the considerable number of respondents and standard conditions, which were ensured at completing the questionnaires it is not possible to ignore even results concerning the knowledge and views of the group of respondents as a whole as well as particular specific segments. Our research was inspired by a “Eurobarometer”, but with respect to a fact that (unlike the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer)</b> it refers to a specific target group, ie studying young people, it concerns only partly and only in some questions comparable examination. Therefore, the questionnaire (in contrast to Eurobarometer) involves also the knowledge part. This part includes eight fields. With respect to the study orientation of the respondents surprisingly worse results occur particularly in fields Institution, politics and law of EU (30 % successfulness) and Economy and finance of EU (37 % successfulness). On the contrary, the highest successfulness (of course, only relatively) was noted in fields Culture, education and sport in EU (63 %). Generally, knowledge of students can be unambiguously evaluated as poor. The opinion part includes in total 20 items, which are divided into five fields. In particular respondents, sex, the size of the place of residence, political profile, social group of a household, ideas of a future carrier, knowledge of languages and interest in problems of EU were determined by means of identification questions. As for the opinion part, it is possible to state that opinions of students are not too marked (answers in the central part of an evaluation scale predominate but, at the same time, all values of the scale were used in all questions) and differences between segments of respondents are generally insignificant. The subject of the paper is particularly aimed at the analysis of results of the opinion part, in the concrete eight items from two fields (Social dimension of EU and Me and EU). For the first area, segments were compared according to sex and political orientation and for the second area, according to sex, language knowledge and interest in EU problems...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the economic and financial crisis of 2007 / 8 national-level contextual factors matter in different ways for individuals in EU member states when assessing support for the EU. Individuals hypothesise that EU member states economic affluence and quality of governance creates the salience of issues. This influences the criteria adopted by them when determining attitudinal factors towards the EU. When applied to individuals in less affluent EU member states individuals evaluate the EU on the basis of economic prospects, while in more affluent EU member states individuals rely on political criteria to evaluate the EU. In the least affluent EU member states individuals generalise their perceptions of national and personal economic conditions to the EU level believing that the EU does not represent their economic interests. In the most affluent EU member states individuals are equally critical of the EU but centre their judgements on the comparative quality of national governments and EU institutions. For individuals the assumption remains that further EU expansion implies continued market liberalisation. However since {{the beginning}} of the economic and financial crisis what individuals regard as excessive inequality may have little to do with inequality per se but whether the liberal-market economy as a whole provides high living standards and dynamic economic development. Inequality as a macro-political and economic determinant bridges the gap between economic and political systems at the national and EU level. Using data from European Election Study (EES) 2009 and <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> data from 2009 - 2013 this inquiry examines individual-level effects on perceptions of inequality and how this plays a significant role when analysing mass public opinion support for the EU. By using a Binary Logit Regression model, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Multiple Regression analysis and Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) the analysis demonstrates two predominant findings. Firstly, individuals believe that the EU has a positive role to play in addressing inequality since the onset of the economic crisis. Secondly, the role to be played by the EU in addressing inequality supersedes that of the EU member states’ governments and reinforces support for the European integration project. Overall, this demonstrates that individuals in the EU believe that the EU is best placed to address market-generated inequality since the onset of the economic and financial crisis of 2007 / 8 and as a result this produces increased support for the EU. These findings demonstrate a strong case for the inclusion of inequality as a determinant of mass public opinion support for the EU since the economic and financial crisis began in 2007 / 8...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to {{the debate on the}} role and efficacy of pension portability regimes in ensuring both a fair treatment of workers and neutrality as regards to labour mobility choices. Drawing on important contributions from the literature, I perform a comprehensive analysis that aims {{to bridge the gap between}} the economic and the political analyses of portability. In addition, I also present novel and unprecedented empirical insights on portability’s effects in the labour market. The thesis is comprised of an opening, introductory section followed by four main Chapters (from 2 to 5). Chapter 2 is devoted to a theoretical and empirical analysis of labour mobility. Two main practices are primarily discussed: international and occupational mobility. Then, the issue of pension portability is described and examined in detail in Chapter 3. In this section, focusing on the European Union, I survey the current legal framework for the portability of both mandatory public and private pension rights. While this analysis focuses on the current situation, I also review the historical evolution of rules and practices. This examination is complemented by a simulation exercise estimating possible pension entitlements for a representative worker accumulating pension rights in different EU countries. The simulations are performed using real parameters of national pension systems and are based on empirical assumptions. Overall, Chapter 3 offers therefore a very thorough analysis of portability regimes: both from a normative and an economic (i. e., costs vs. benefits) perspective. Chapters 4 and 5 contain two key empirical analyses in this dissertation. Chapter 4 focuses on the portability of complementary pension rights in Italy when job mobility occurs voluntarily across employers, but not across countries. Using micro-data from the Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), I examine whether coverage from an occupational pension plan has discouraged job mobility in Italy between 1998 and 2010. Such an effect has been documented to occur in other countries, especially the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. However, there has never been a similar examination for the case of Italy. My analysis provide very weak or no effect of pension portability losses impacting on labour mobility decisions. There is, on the contrary, some evidence that pension-covered jobs are better jobs overall, for the ample set of benefits they offer to workers and of which the pension plan is only an element. For this reason, mobility out of these positions is less convenient and thus frequent. Finally, Chapter 5 examines whether past difficulties in portability transfers affect the propensity for future international mobility. This is a unique research question that has not been studied in the literature so far. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that a positive experience of portability encourages people to consider further opportunities of mobility abroad, whereas negative experiences are likely to lower such interest. Both these effects are tested and estimated empirically using data from the <b>Standard</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> Survey No. 75. 1 (2011), covering 27 EU member states. I find that that easy portability in the past increases the propensity for job mobility abroad in comparison to people with no prior portability experience. On the contrary, difficult experiences slightly depress the propensity for mobility...|$|E

The Eurobarometer (EB) survey series is a unique programme of cross-national and cross-temporal comparative social science research. Since the early seventies representative national samples in all European Union (EU) (formerly the European Community (EC)) member states have been simultaneously interviewed {{in the spring and}} autumn of each year. Starting with EB 34. 1 (autumn 1990), separate supplementary surveys on special issues have been conducted under almost every EB number. The EB is designed to provide regular monitoring of public social and political attitudes in the EU through specific trend questions. More information about the series may be found on the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Data Archive for the Social Sciences (GESIS) Eurobarometer Survey Series web pages. GESIS was formed in 2007 when three independent institutes merged (Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim). Users should note that earlier EBs are available from GESIS. Background Work on European survey series began in early 1970, when the Commission of the European Community sponsored simultaneous surveys of the EC. These surveys were designed to measure public awareness of, and attitudes toward, the Common Market and other EC institutions, in complementary fashion. They also probed the goals given top priority for each respondent's nation. These concerns have remained a central part of the EC's research efforts - which were carried forward in the summer of 1971 with another six-nation survey that gave special attention to agricultural problems. The nine EC member countries were then surveyed again on the same topic areas in September 1973. After 1973, the surveys took on a somewhat broader scope in content as well as in geographical coverage, with measures of subjective satisfaction and the perceived quality of life becoming standard features of the EC public opinion surveys. Over time, the member states of the EC/EU have increased in number, and the coverage of the EB surveys has widened accordingly. In 1974, nine countries were surveyed: France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg. Greece has been included since the autumn 1980 survey (EB 14) onwards, Portugal and Spain since autumn 1985 (EB 24), the former German Democratic Republic since autumn 1990 (EB 34), Finland since the spring of 1993 (EB 39), and Sweden and Austria since the autumn of 1994 (EB 42). Norway has been included in some surveys since 1991, from EB 36 onwards. In 2004, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the EU, and in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania (some of these countries participated in the Candidate Countries Eurobarometer survey series (see under GN 33343) before full accession). Candidate countries of Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Iceland have also been included in selected surveys. Some surveys are also conducted in Turkey, and in the Turkish Cypriot Community (Northern Cyprus). The Eurobarometer public opinion surveys are conducted on behalf of and co-ordinated by the European Commission, DG Press and Communication - Opinion Polls Sector (European Commission Public Opinion Analysis). Special topic modules are carried out {{at the request of the}} responsible EU Directorate General. The UK Data Archive no longer hold the Eurobarometer Survey Series datasets, they are available to browse, analyse and download online via GESIS's ZACAT service.
