Downey defended Gibson during the {{controversy}} surrounding The Passion of the Christ, and said [...] "nobody's perfect" [...] in reference to Gibson's DUI. Gibson said of Downey: [...] "He {{was one of the first}} people to call and offer the hand of friendship. He just said, 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's go <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to work on ourselves.'" [...] In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work, and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.|$|E
500|$|While Nintendo did not {{formally}} announce {{plans for a}} Metroid title for the Wii U, Animal Crossing producer Katsuya Eguchi mentioned in an interview how such a title could {{make use of the}} console's tablet controller to perform actions such as scanning enemies and retrieving information. A demo program for the Wii U, titled Battle Mii, showed Mii characters dressed in Varia Suits, as well as Samus's gunship from Other M; this was later revealed as a mini-game called [...] "Metroid Blast", which is featured in Nintendo Land. Nintendo Land producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who was also involved with the Prime trilogy, has declared that this minigame reflects his ideas for future Metroid titles, while also displaying the series is [...] "a franchise that we value and we certainly want to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with it in the future". Miyamoto added that Retro is [...] "a very high priority" [...] in the development of more Metroid games. In 2014, a former artist from Next Level Games revealed his company had interest in developing a 3DS Metroid game, going as far as building a prototype, before Nintendo asked them to do [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, in an {{interview}} with Gamasutra, Rockstar executive Dan Houser revealed the studio may focus on a sequel for Bully once Max Payne 3 is released. [...] "Contrary to a lot of people, we like to {{take a little bit of}} time at the end of a game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game," [...] he said. [...] "So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max, and then we will <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with Bully." ...|$|E
