He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{trouble with}} the Senate {{hindered}} the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term.

Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified appointee, but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator David B. Hill his enemy.

5|$|Following the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Sendiri tour, Chrisye {{began to}} explore the {{possibility}} of producing an album of his early hits, remastered by Gutawa.

5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage {{was viewed as a}} desertion of his duties. Historians in the 21st century see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most of his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son, Alfred the Great.|$|E

Following the moderate sales <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> acclaimed debut album, Illmatic (1994), Nas chose to focus his efforts in a more mainstream direction. Primarily produced by Trackmasters, it is a departure for him from the raw, underground tone of his debut album towards a more polished, mainstream sound. The album features mafioso and gangsta themes, and marks the first appearance of Nas's short-lived supergroup The Firm, which included rappers Foxy Brown, AZ, and Cormega.|$|E

50|$|Villehardouin's words — while {{sometimes}} {{accurate and}} other times not — present a vivid personal account of the Fourth Crusade.

Villehardouin merely reports <b>of</b> the <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work.|$|R
