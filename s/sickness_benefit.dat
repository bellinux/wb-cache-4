Nevertheless, all the EU member countries provide rights to sick leave and to <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> {{and most of them}} also to paid sick leave. Sick leave is the right to be absent from work, while paid sick leave is the payment of (part of) the employee’s salary by the employer during <b>sickness.</b> <b>Sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> are covered by the social protection system (Spasova et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|Aims: We {{analyzed}} the redistributive outcomes for <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> using a typology of social insurance institutions compared to external factors for sickness risk. Material: Unbalanced panel {{data of the}} Luxembourg Income Study on household earnings, <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> and labour force demography (OECD data) and educational attainment were employed. Method: Gini-coefficients were used for measuring earnings inequality. Relative changes in earnings inequality for <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> were explained by social insurance institutional dummies using multiple regression analyses.

25|$|One {{conclusion}} of Black's 2011 report concerned the sickness benefits system. Black felt {{that too many}} claims for the out-of-work <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) {{did not meet the}} threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an 'assessment phase' lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but, in practice, receives {{the same amount of money}} as they would if they were on Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving 'assessment rate' ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not fit for work on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the assessment phase be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found unfit for work.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Elliott {{was born}} on 26 April 1921 in Kensington, London, the {{youngest}} of three children of Ronald Elliott, a motor engineer, and his wife, Mabel [...] Donaldson, a school teacher. She had an older sister, Audrey, and an older brother, Donald. The family was poor; her father suffered, and ultimately died, from tuberculosis and was frequently unemployed, while her mother was barred from working as a school teacher after she was married. The family therefore often had to live on a weekly <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit.</b> For entertainment, they took advantage of free entry to art galleries, museums and libraries. Elliot's direct experience of poverty led to her becoming an ardent socialist later in life. She attended Portobello Elementary School in North Kensington, and won a London County Council scholarship to Christ's Hospital in 1932. She excelled academically, was a prefect, and played hockey for her house.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} upon social {{networks}} {{and their relationship}} to stigma and identity for long-term <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> recipients in the North East of England. Drawing on empirical qualitative research with long-term <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> recipients, this article demonstrates how the co-construction of stigma is fundamental in shaping how long-term <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> recipients participate in social networks with friends, family and the community. The findings support the idea that the stigma of receiving benefits can be contrasted with nostalgia for the social elements of employment. Utilizing the work of Goffman, the article focuses on how the stigma and shame felt at receiving <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> {{for an extended period of}} time interacts with social networks and identity. Reluctance to disclose a claimant identity to friends and family could lead to social isolation and a perceived need to ‘keep meself to meself’ which can be linked to a wider rhetoric surrounding benefits recipients that characterizes them as ‘scroungers’...|$|R

2500|$|Incapacity Benefit is a British social {{security}} benefit that was phased out following {{the passage of}} the 2007 Welfare Reform Act. The benefit used to be paid to more than two million adults who were having difficulty finding work because of an illness or a disability.

2500|$|Under Part 1 of the National Insurance Act 1911, {{compulsory}} {{health insurance}} was provided for workers earning less than £160 per year. The scheme was contributed to by the worker who contributed fourpence, the employer who contributed threepence and the government who contributed twopence. The scheme provided <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> entitlement of nine shillings (£36), free medical treatment and maternity benefit of 30 shillings (£120). An estimated 13million workers came to be compulsorily covered under this scheme. Part 2 of the National Insurance Act passed in 1911 gave workers the right to sick pay of 9s a week and free medical treatment {{in return for a}} payment for 4d a week. Sick pay would be paid for 26 weeks of sickness. The medical treatment was provided by doctors who belonged to a [...] "panel" [...] in each district. Doctors received a fee from the insurance fund for each [...] "panel" [...] patient they treated. The National Insurance Act (Part II) gave workers the right to unemployment pay of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2½d a week. Under Part 2 of the National Insurance Act 1911, which dealt with unemployment insurance, most insured workers were given seven shillings in unemployment benefit which could be claimed for up to 15 weeks a year. This scheme was also financed through the contributions of workers and government. Although only a minority of workers were insured by this scheme, it nevertheless covered a number of trades and industries, such as shipbuilding, which were particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in employment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract My Bachelor {{dissertation}} "Legal Adjustment of Sickness Insurance and its Influence on the Abuse of <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefits</b> {{deals with}} {{the interpretation of the}} legal adjustment of individual <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>benefits</b> after 1 st January 2008 and with reasons which may cause the abuse of <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>benefits.</b> The main objective of my Bachelor dissertation is not only to find out these causes but also to refer to the facts which could become a basis for changes and alterations in the legal adjustment of the sickness insurance system since 1 st January 2009. My work and conclusions are based on good quality research using the method of half-standardized interviews with six respondents from OSSZ (=District Social Security Administration [...] transl. remark) in Tábor and Pelhřimov, and I also involved the method of documents analysis. The research was carried out on the basis of source materials which were available in OSSZ Tábor in the periods of January and February 2007, August to December 2007 and January and February 2008 and also on the basis of statistical data for years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The gathered data and interviews results apparently show that {{there is a tendency to}} the abuse of <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>benefits</b> in the company. This fact is supported by the legal adjustment both in the area of social insurance and in the area of health insurance, and consequently in the area of the criminal law too. The research established that there might be the abuse of benefits, but on the other hand, if you compare the data showing the amount of finances invested into the <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>benefits</b> in the months of January and February of years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, it is apparent that in February 2008 there is a decline in financial means invested into these benefits. We have succeeded in reduction of expenses on <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> then. And the adoption of the waiting period can partly prevent from <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> abusing too. In spite of that decline which has indisputably resulted from the legal adjustment valid since 1 st January 2008 there are remedies that could prevent from further benefits abusing such as a consistent reform in the health service system, introduction of clear rules for checking those who are on sick leave and financial participation of employers during the sick leave of their employees. Concentration of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> payments for employees of small organizations, for self-employed individuals and for employees of organizations onto OSSZ companies (=District Social Security Administration) should make this paperwork easier and should cause the fall in expenses connected with <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> payments...|$|R
