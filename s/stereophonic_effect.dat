This process was called multiplexing, and once fully instituted removed the need for two stations, and thus two receivers at the listener's end {{in order to achieve}} a <b>stereophonic</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

5000|$|During the 1950s {{the group}} {{continued}} to play [...] "live" [...] dates with the same personnel, but their recording sessions would often have studio musicians substituting for one or another, because keyboardist Artie Dunn did not read music and guitarist Al Nevins became {{more interested in the}} production end of the recording business. The group's popularity waned as rock and roll became popular, but the group reinvented itself by using its RCA Victor recording sessions as an audio laboratory, employing additional instruments and novel <b>stereophonic</b> <b>effects.</b> These new arrangements became popular among fans of lounge music and exotica. Al Nevins remained with RCA Victor as a producer and arranger until his death in 1965; Morty Nevins then hired studio musicians Fred Mendelssohn and Vinnie Bell and recorded a new stereo album for Musicor in 1966, using the Three Suns name.|$|R

50|$|The Kahn-Hazeltine {{system also}} called ISB was {{developed}} by American engineer Leonard R. Kahn and the Hazeltine Corporation. This system used an entirely different principle—using independently modulated upper and lower sidebands. While a station using the system would sound best with proper decoding, it was also possible to use two standard AM radios (one tuned above and the other below the primary carrier) to achieve the <b>stereophonic</b> <b>effect,</b> although with poor stereo separation and fidelity compared to a proper Kahn system AM stereo receiver. One {{of the best known}} stations to use the Kahn system was 890/WLS, Chicago. WLS still transmits in AM stereo today but uses the Motorola C-QUAM system instead.|$|E
5000|$|Some network {{programs}} held on {{into the}} television era: Don McNeill's Breakfast Club, {{one of the first}} and longest-running morning shows in the country, hosted by Don McNeill, ran from 1933 to 1968. Other long-running ABC programs included the National Barn Dance, running from 1924 to 1960, and Paul Harvey's daily commentary, which ran from 1951 until his death in 2009. [...] In 1958, ABC collaborated with its sister television network to produce the first national stereophonic sound broadcasts, when it simulcast The Plymouth Show (one of two shows hosted by Lawrence Welk at the time); the TV side broadcast one audio channel and the radio side broadcast the other in synchronization; viewers had to tune into both devices to achieve the <b>stereophonic</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When {{the show}} debuted nationwide, The Lawrence Welk Show {{was billed as}} the Dodge Dancing Party in 1955 and 1956. During 1956-59, Lawrence Welk was {{broadcast}} two nights per week. The second show's title was Lawrence Welk Presents Top Tunes and New Talent [...] (1956-58) and then Lawrence Welk's Plymouth Show, after another Chrysler vehicle (1958-59). The Plymouth show was the first American television program to air in stereophonic sound. Due {{to the fact that}} stereophonic television had not yet been invented (it would be 25 more years before it would become standard), ABC instead simulcast the show on its radio network, with the TV side airing one audio channel and the radio side airing the other; viewers would tune in both the TV and the radio to achieve the <b>stereophonic</b> <b>effect.</b> Starting with the 1959-60 season the two shows were merged into The Lawrence Welk Show, reverting to monophonic broadcasts. The name stuck, and it became the most popular variety show ever.|$|E

500|$|Hendrix favored overdriven {{amplifiers}} {{with high}} volume and gain. He {{was instrumental in}} developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback, and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock. He rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his thumb. He applied this technique during the beginning bars of [...] "Little Wing", which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method {{has been described as}} piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand. Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{recent research}} {{findings in the}} psychoacoustics of 3 D multichannel sound recording and rendering. The addition of height channels in new reproduction formats such as Auro- 3 D, Dolby Atmos and 22. 2, etc. enhances the perceived spatial impression in reproduction. To achieve optimal acoustic recording and signal processing for such formats, it is first {{important to understand the}} fundamental principles of how we perceive sounds reproduced from vertically oriented stereophonic loudspeakers. Recent studies by the authors in this field provide insights into how such principles can be applied for practical 3 D recording and upmixing. Topics that are discussed in this paper include the interchannel level and time difference relationships in terms of vertically induced interchannel crosstalk, the effectiveness of the precedence effect in the vertical plane, the aspect of tonal coloration resulting from vertical <b>stereophonic</b> reproduction, the <b>effect</b> of vertical microphone spacing on envelopment, the effect of interchannel decorrelation, and the use of spectral cues for extending vertical image spread...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the premiere}} of Pierre Schaeffer's Symphonie pour un homme seul in 1951, a system that was {{designed}} for the spatial control of sound was tested. It was called a [...] "relief desk" [...] (pupitre de relief, but {{also referred to as}} pupitre d'espace or potentiomètre d'espace) and was intended to control the dynamic level of music played from several shellac players. This created a <b>stereophonic</b> <b>effect</b> by controlling the positioning of a monophonic sound source [...] One of five tracks, provided by a purpose-built tape machine, was controlled by the performer and the other four tracks each supplied a single loudspeaker. This provided a mixture of live and preset sound positions [...] The placement of loudspeakers in the performance space included two loudspeakers at the front right and left of the audience, one placed at the rear, and in the centre of the space a loudspeaker was placed in a high position above the audience. The sounds could therefore be moved around the audience, rather than just across the front stage. On stage, the control system allowed a performer to position a sound either to the left or right, above or behind the audience, simply by moving a small, hand held transmitter coil towards or away from four somewhat larger receiver coils arranged around the performer in a manner reflecting the loudspeaker positions [...] A contemporary eyewitness described the potentiomètre d'espace in normal use: ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the world}} premiere, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Fanfare Ritmico, remarking: The {{world premiere of}} Jennifer Higdon's zippy, enchanting Fanfare Ritmico started the concert off with a bang. Written for the {{orchestra}} {{as one of a}} series of commissioned fanfares, Higdon's score is a brisk, sharp-edged concoction, full of rhythmic pizzazz and blunt orchestral writing (aside from one splendidly played solo for the concertmaster). Hsu led the orchestra in a magnificent performance. Allan Kozinn of The New York Times similarly described the piece as [...] "tonal and flashy, with dense, demanding brass and percussion writing". [...] Anne Midgette called it [...] "exuberant" [...] and [...] "a flourish of sound that opens by running across the percussion in the back of the orchestra, from right to left, like a <b>stereophonic</b> <b>effect,</b> and then blooms through the orchestra." [...] Tim Sawyier of the Chicago Classical Review also lauded the composition, writing, [...] "The propulsive percussion section was dynamic throughout, and the trumpet and flute flourishes nimbly executed."David Bratman of the San Francisco Classical Voice wrote: Higdon's compositional secret is a strong sense of musical structure. Even a chaotic piece like this one, a tossed salad of echoes of numerous different styles, still manages to hang together. The scoring is built on percussion (thundering timpani and various other drums open the work) but the spotlight passes all over the orchestra, even to violin solos. As a composer whose orchestral style naturally tends to the bright, brittle, and brassy, Higdon was a good choice to contribute to the Fanfares Project...|$|E

30|$|Two {{different}} test sessions {{have been}} carried out in order to prove the real-time performance of the proposed system, referred as test session 1 and test session 2, respectively. In test session 1, the microphone signal is acquired by using only the two most external microphones of the linear array mounted on the supporting base; since the microphone distance in the array is equal to 4 cm, the selected microphones in this configuration are 16 cm far away from each other and they are also tilted to form an angle of 70 degrees in order to guarantee the <b>stereophonic</b> <b>effect.</b> In test session 2, the near-end signal is acquired through the microphones array; then, the beamforming algorithm is applied, according to the guidelines described in the previous sections. In particular, the beampatterns have been designed to maximize the stereophonic recording capabilities of the array. Loudspeakers have been placed at a distance of 1 m {{from the center of the}} array in order to simulate real hands-free communication acoustic conditions. Microphone calibration has been made in order to minimize the negative effect of gain imperfections: microphone gain level has been adjusted so that the energy of all the outputs were the same, having white noise as input. Each simulation test lasts 20 s assuming the following scenario: 0 – 5 s far-end only, 5 – 10 s near-end only, 10 – 15 s double-talk situation, and 15 – 20 s far-end only.|$|E
