5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to save the}} Star Ferry pier in early 2007, a campaign to preserve the pier in situ was launched. Ahead of the closure, members of the public, environmentalists, and <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> arrived to tie blue ribbons to indicate their desire to preserve the harbour. On 22 April, about 100 protesters once again rallied at the pier, launching farewell voyages in a last-ditch attempt to urge the Government to reconsider: a petition of over 400 signatures from the Arts community was collected.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Marriage Protection Act was reintroduced to the General Assembly on January 23, 2012. The {{new version}} of the bill {{contained}} provisions that more explicitly protects religious leaders, institutions, and their programs from legal action if they refuse to officiate or provide facilities for a same-sex marriage or couple as a matter of their doctrine. During the legislative process, several high-profile political figures attempted to persuade legislators to vote in favor of the bill, including former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Dick Cheney, Terry McAuliffe, and Ken Mehlman. The House of Delegates passed the bill with a 72–67 vote on February 17, 2012 and the Senate passed with a 25–22 vote on February 23, 2012. To secure support from <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> who desired to submit the law to public referendum, the bill was amended to take effect on January 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{coalition}} {{was successful}} in taking control of both houses of the legislature; with the Senate election to be held just over a week later, intense politicking took place. <b>Some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> went into hiding for fear they would be pressured by the other side. The coalition decided on McKisson as their candidate {{the day before the}} balloting began. Three Republican state representatives who had voted with the Democrats to organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority in both the short and long term elections. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders complained to the United States Senate, which took no action against Hanna. McKisson lost a re-election bid as mayor in 1899; Hanna remained a powerful figure in the Senate until his death in 1904.|$|E

5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
25|$|GTL, {{along with}} the wealthy private-equity firms that own them, such as Veritas Capital, have been criticized by {{advocacy}} groups, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg Business, and <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers,</b> for charging overly high prices in their monopoly in communication with incarcerated individuals. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has tried unsuccessfully {{for many years to}} cap the price of phone calls.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court of Pakistan on 24 July, {{revised the}} {{date for the}} presidential {{election}} on {{the appeal of the}} ruling party, PML (N), asking the election commission to hold it on 30 July instead of 6 August. The court made the order as many of the lawmakers who will elect a replacement for President Asif Ali Zardari will be paying pilgrimages or offering special prayers on 6 August for the holy month of Ramadan, which ends a few days later, thus making it potentially difficult for <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> to oblige with their religious duties along with the election. The petition was filed by the leader of the house in the Senate Raja Zafarul Haq on the same day.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{debate on}} whether high-calorie soft drink vending {{machines}} {{should be allowed}} in schools {{has been on the}} rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a complex issue and soft drinks are not the only cause. They also note the immense amount of funding that soft drink sales bring to schools. Some people take a more moderate stance, saying that soft drink machines should be allowed in schools, but that they should not be the only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the schools should be required to provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a comparable price. <b>Some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.|$|E

2500|$|The Espionage Act of 1917 {{made it a}} {{crime to}} {{interfere}} with the war effort or with military recruitment or to attempt to aid a nation at war with the U.S. [...] Wartime violence on the part of local groups of citizens, sometimes mobs or vigilantes, persuaded <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> that the law was inadequate. In their view the country was witnessing instances of public disorder that represented the public's own attempt to punish unpopular speech in light of the government's inability to do so. Amendments to enhance the government's authority under the Espionage Act would prevent mobs from doing what the government could not.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cost of the}} Rail Runner {{system was}} $135 million for the first phase and around $250 million for the second phase.

In late 2007, the Rail Runner {{was the subject of}} more criticism as a transportation funding shortfall left many state road projects stalled. State officials said the rising cost of construction materials and decreased federal support were the cause, but <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> cited the cost of the Rail Runner as a contributing factor for the shortfall. Supporters of Rail Runner funding note that roadways and other infrastructure for passenger cars also operate at a deficit, requiring government funding for construction, operation, and maintenance.|$|E

2500|$|At a statehouse {{press conference}} on June 22, 2015, Governor Nikki Haley, flanked by elected {{officials}} of both parties, including U.S. Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, and former Republican Governor Mark Sanford, called for the flag to be removed by the state legislature, saying that while the flag was [...] "an integral part of our past, it does not represent the future" [...] of South Carolina. [...] "We {{are not going to}} allow this symbol to divide us any longer," [...] she said. The legislature, scheduled to meet the following day for a budget session, must vote by a two-thirds majority to extend debate to the flag issue, and by two-thirds to remove the flag from statehouse grounds, although the legality of that provision has been questioned by <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers.</b> Haley said she would call for a special session if the legislature did not act.|$|E
2500|$|Supporters {{argue that}} a {{consumption}} tax, such as the FairTax, would {{have a positive impact}} on available capital (through deferred taxation on investment), increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade), incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., increased economic growth, and ease of tax compliance. The plan may increase cost transparency for funding the federal government and supporters believe it would have positive effects on civil liberties, the environment, and advantages with taxing illegal activity and illegal immigrants. Because the FairTax plan would remove taxes on income, tax deductions would have no meaning or value, which concerns <b>some</b> <b>lawmakers</b> about losing this method of social incentive. [...] There are also concerns regarding the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, transition effects on after-tax savings, impact to the income tax industry, incentives on credit use, and the loss of tax advantages to state and local bonds.|$|E
