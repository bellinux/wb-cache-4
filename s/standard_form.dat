5|$|Handscroll: The handscroll {{originated}} from ancient Chinese text documents. From the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 BCE) through the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), bamboo or wooden slips were bound {{and used to}} write texts on. During the Eastern Han period (25-220), the use of paper and silk as handscrolls became more common. The handscroll was {{the one of the}} main formats for texts up until the Tang dynasty (618-907). Since the Three Kingdoms (220–280), the handscroll became a <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> for mounting artwork. New styles were developed over time.|$|E
5|$|No.A816 {{emerged from}} Eastleigh in August 1931 for trials, but was stopped when {{temperature}} variations within the condensing equipment caused water leakage. Modifications {{were made to}} improve the draughting of the locomotive, incorporating a box-like chimney attached to the condenser array by pipes. No.A816 was released for more trials, and produced performances well-below those displayed by the unmodified members of the class. The experiment was ended when the system's developers ran out of money, and the locomotive was converted back to <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> between May and August 1935, re-entering service as No.1816.|$|E

In the Middle Byzantine period (c. 843 – 1204), domes were normally built to emphasize separate functional spaces, rather than as the modular ceiling units they had been earlier. Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> of the {{periodic}} table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours, {{as is the}} case (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> of {{periodic}} table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E

5|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> of the Maya stela {{incorporating}} art, calendrical {{dates and}} hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only {{began to be}} erected in the Maya lowlands after 250 AD. The late 4th century saw the introduction of non-Maya imagery linked to the giant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. This foreign influence is seen at Tikal, Uaxactun, Río Azul and ElZapote, all in the Petén Department of Guatemala. At Tikal this was initiated by the king YaxNuunAyiinI, from there it spread to his vassal cities. In the 5th century, this strongly Teotihuacan-linked imagery was abandoned by YaxNuunAyiinI's son SiyajChanK'awiilII, who reintroduced imagery associated with the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands. Minor references to Teotihuacan continued, for example {{in the form of}} Teotihuacan war emblems. His Stela31 was originally erected in 445 but was later broken from its butt and was found buried in the city centre, almost directly above his tomb. It depicts the crowning of SiyajChanK'awiilII, with his father hovering above him as a supernatural being and is executed in traditional Maya style. On the sides of the stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non-Maya style, dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior, bearing the central Mexican atlatl spear-thrower not adopted by the Maya, and carrying a shield adorned with the face of the Mexican god Tlaloc. The reverse of the stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing the history of Tikal, including the Teotihuacan invasion that established Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his dynasty.|$|E
