Richardson has been involved in the production of over 40 Comic <b>Strip</b> <b>films</b> and has directed 17 of them. The series won a Rose D'Or for The Strike in 1988. He developed the series into feature films; The Supergrass, Eat the Rich, The Pope Must Die, and , none of which achieved great box office success. In the 1990s, Richardson introduced a new generation of performers, Doon Mackichan, Mark Caven, Phil Cornwell, Sara Stockbridge, George Yiasoumi and Gary Beadle, who appeared in his productions. He co-wrote and also directed the 1990s cult mockumentary comedy series Stella Street with Phil Cornwell and John Sessions. In 2004, Richardson co-founded the production company Great Western Features with Nick Smith, which is based in Totnes, Devon. In 2005, he directed the Comic <b>Strip</b> <b>film</b> Sex Actually.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that all nuclei containing labelled DNA in the jejunum of adult mice divide before migrating into the villi {{and that the}} amount of labelled DNA is constant during the passage of cells through the villi was tested experimentally. Mice were killed 40 min, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 h after a single intraperitoneal injection of [3 H]thymidine. Grain counts in <b>stripping</b> <b>film</b> autoradiographs showed (i) considerably higher grain counts in the villi 24 h after injection than expected from those in the crypts at 40 min, and (ii) a loss of 32 % of the grain count during passage of the cells through the villi. Consideration of various factors which might influence the grain counts show that the findings have to be accepted as correct. It is suggested that a considerable proportion of the nuclei labelled in the crypts migrate into the villi without subsequent division and that labelled DNA is lost during passage through the villi. The hypothesis of formation of metabolic DNA during differentiation and loss during function provides an explanation of the findings...|$|E
40|$|Grasshoppers of {{the species}} Melanoplus differentialis were {{injected}} with tritiumlabelled thymidine. At intervals thereafter autoradiographic <b>stripping</b> <b>film</b> was applied over Feulgen squashes and sections. In this species during early prophase of meiosis the sex chromosome forms a heterochromatic block {{large enough to be}} resolved in tritium autoradiographs. A study of the squash preparations reveals that the sex chromosome is synthesizing DNA at a different period of time from the euchromatic autosomes. Since there is a developmental sequence of spermatocyte cysts along the testicular tubes it is possible from the sections to show that the heterochromatin synthesizes DNA later than does the euchromatin. To find out whether the results obtained in Mdanoplus were characteristic of heterochromatin in general, young seedlings of rye were grown in a tritiated thyrnidine solution and Feulgen squashes were made as for Mdanoplus. In rye leaf nuclei there is a large block of heterochromatin constituted by the proximal regions of the chromosomes and a euchromatic one formed by the median and distal regions of the same chromosomes. Here also the heterochromatin synthesizes DNA at a different period of time from the euchromatin. It is concluded that in rye the asynchrony of synthesis occurs within each chromosome. Counts of silver grains over the two types of chromatin in nuclei of Melanoplus and Secale disclosed that the number of grains per unit area was two to three times higher over the heterochromatin. To check the DNA content, Feulgen photometric measurements were made of Mdanoplus nuclei at the same stage. The Feulgen and grain counts agree in showing that the heterochromatin contains two to three times more DNA per unit area than the euchromatin...|$|E

The time course of incorporation curves for nucleolus and non-nucleolar nucleus (NNN) contain 2 distinct turnover fractions, rapid and slow. Both fractions were increased after thioacetamide treatment but remained proportional to those of controls. The unique stimulated RNA turnover in the nucleus and nucleolus, coupled to a "normal" turnover in the cytoplasm, suggests that this nuclear-nucleolar loss of label does not represent an exclusive passage of formed nuclear RNA to the cytoplasm...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to answer the question: Is H 3 -thymidine uptake by nuclei of the mouse seminal vesicle evidence for DNA synthesis and mitosis, or does it signify some "metabolic" function of DNA unrelated to chromosome duplication? Mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of H 3 -thymidine. Six hours later Feulgen squashes of the seminal vesicle epithelium were made and covered with autoradiographic <b>stripping</b> <b>film.</b> The silver grains above labeled nuclei were counted, and the Feulgen dye contents of these same nuclei were determined photometrically after removal of the grains from the emulsion. Unlabeled nuclei were also measured. The dye contents of non-radioactive nuclei form a unimodal distribution, indicating that polyploidy is absent from this tissue. The radioactive nuclei fall into two groups. In the first, the average dye content is {{the same as that of}} the cold nuclei (2 C). In the second, the values range from 2 C to 4 C. In the 2 C to 4 C group the grain count is proportional to the dye content, showing that incorporation is correlated with synthesis. The radioactive 2 C nuclei arose by mitosis during the course of the experiment. This is shown by the following facts: (1) They frequently occur in pairs. (2) They average smaller than unlabeled 2 C nuclei. (3) Their average grain count is approximately half that of the 4 C nuclei. (4) Labeled division figures are found. (5) A mitotic rate estimated from the number of labeled 2 C nuclei accords reasonably well with one based on the number of observed mitoses. Since the incorporation of thymidine accompanies DNA synthesis and precedes mitosis, there is no reason to postulate a special "metabolic" DNA in this tissue...|$|E

The epidermal cells were grown in vitro using a chamber culture technique. Skin slices containing dermis and epidermis were surgically removed from the ear and then incubated for ten minutes in a trypsin solution to remove the underlying dermis. The cells were teased apart and cultured in Fischer's Medium supplemented with 15 % fetal calf serum and a penicillin-streptomycin mixture. 3 H-thymidine was added at t = 0 to make a final concentration of 0. 21 Î¼c/ml (s. a. 3. 0 c/m mole). Progress in the cycle was monitored hourly by stopping growth in {{a portion of the}} chambers. Coverglasses with cells attached were then prepared for autoradiography. Kodak AR- 10 <b>Stripping</b> <b>Film</b> was used. Development was performed seven days after exposure began. One thousand cells on each slide were scored to determine the percentage of cells labeled, labeled cells in mitosis, and the percentage of labeled and unlabeled cells in metaphase. From this data, the total length of the cell cycle was found to be approximately 15 hours; G 2 was minimally 3 hours; S lasted approximately 5. 4 hours; the duration of the M phase was. 4 hours; and G 1 was 6. 2 hours long. A marked increase in DNA synthetic activity was noted at 7 to 8 hours. Partial synchrony of the cell population was thought to be achieved upon removal of the ear tissue from the guinea pig. This apparent synchrony supports the proposal that cells in G 1 prior to injury are directed to synthesis when removal occurs and suggests that the real control of the cell cycle may lie in the G 1 period...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{application}} of autoradiographic techniques to the homogenity control of MÃ¶ssbauer sources. Autoradiography {{can be used for}} this purpose in all cases where the radioactive MÃ¶ssbauer source isotope is introduced into a non-radioactive host, e. g. by diffusion or melting. In addition, it can also be used for the study of non-radioactive alloys in cases where a neutron activation of the sample produces only weak or short lived activities in the matrix material but causes high activities of the impurity atoms. By the use of special <b>stripping</b> <b>film</b> material cluster distances down to a few micrometers can be resolved. The minimal size of clusters needed for detection is given by the condition that a sufficient number of radio-active decays must originate from a single cluster during the exposure time of the film to produce a grain capable of development. With the use of a microdensitometer or by using equidensitometric film, fluctuations in impurity concentration throughout the matrix can be mapped by creating equidensity lines. To obtain quantitative results on such fluctuations one has to calibrate the impurity concentration versus grain density of the film. This task can be achieved without serious difficulties. An important application of these techniques arises in MÃ¶ssbauer studies of properties of highly dilute alloys (e. g. Kondo system). Measurements are then usually performed as source experiments {{in order to keep the}} impurity concentration in the ppm range. The properties of such systems depend critically on the condition that the impurities are distributed uniformly throughout the bulk of the sample. No clustering of the impurity atoms should occur. In the desired concentration range the classical metallurgical techniques like microprobe analysis, electron microscopy and neutron or x-ray diffraction are not applicable. Microprobe analysis which comes closest to the autoradiographic technique, however, does not sample automatically the bulk of the alloy. Standard single line sources for MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy in 57 Fe are also prepared by diffusing the 57 Co activity into a metallic, non-magnetic matrix. The question of homogenity of the 57 Co impurity is crucial to such questions as the minimum emission linewidth of such a source in particular if used at low temperatures. The autoradiographic technique has been applied successfully to the control of cluster precipitation of 57 Co and rare earth activities (e. g. 170 Tm) in Cu, Al, Au, Ag and Pd. Often these activities are preferentially attached to grain boundaries and the appropriate heat treatments had to be developed to insure homogenous sources...|$|E
