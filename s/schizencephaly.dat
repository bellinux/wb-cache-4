50|$|Neuroradiologically, {{intracranial}} malformations {{associated with}} septo-optic dysplasia include agenesis of the septum pellucidum, <b>schizencephaly,</b> and lobar holoprosencephaly.|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} {{for individuals with}} <b>schizencephaly</b> varies {{depending on the size}} of the clefts and the degree of neurological deficit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Schizencephaly</b> can be {{distinguished}} from porencephaly {{by the fact that}} in <b>schizencephaly</b> the fluid-filled component, if present, is entirely lined by heterotopic grey matter while a porencephalic cyst is lined mostly by white matter. Individuals with clefts in both hemispheres, or bilateral clefts, are often developmentally delayed and have delayed speech and language skills and corticospinal dysfunction. Individuals with smaller, unilateral clefts (clefts in one hemisphere) may be weak or paralyzed {{on one side of the}} body and may have average or near-average intelligence. Patients with <b>schizencephaly</b> may also have varying degrees of microcephaly, Intellectual disability, hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body), or quadriparesis (weakness or paralysis affecting all four extremities), and may have reduced muscle tone (hypotonia). Most patients have seizures, and some may have hydrocephalus.|$|E
50|$|Treatment for {{individuals}} with <b>schizencephaly</b> generally consists of physical therapy (KG-ZNS with Vojta Methode), occupational therapy (with specific emphasis on neuro-developmental therapy techniques), treatment for seizures, and, in cases that are complicated by hydrocephalus, a shunt.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in COL4A1 exons 24 and 25 are {{associated}} with HANAC (autosomal dominant hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps). It has also been confirmed that mutations in the COL4A1 gene occur in some patients with porencephaly and <b>schizencephaly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Schizencephaly</b> (...) {{is a rare}} {{birth defect}} {{characterized}} by abnormal clefts lined with grey matter that form the ependyma of the cerebral ventricles to the pia mater. These clefts can occur bilaterally or unilaterally. Common clinical features of this malformation include epilepsy, motor deficits, and psychomotor retardation.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{the defect}} {{is linked to}} {{mutations}} of the EMX2, SIX3, and Collagen, type IV, alpha 1 genes. Because having a sibling with <b>schizencephaly</b> has been statistically shown to increase risk of the disorder, {{it is possible that}} there is a heritable genetic component to the disease.|$|E

50|$|The {{center is}} for adults with neurodevelopmental {{disorders}} complicated by cognitive dysfunction (mental retardation). It is a 650 bed residential facility. Established diagnoses include Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Trisomy 8 mosaic syndrome, Trisomy 13 syndrome, Williams Syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, PKU, Tuberous sclerosis, Neurofibromatosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Congenital rubella syndrome, the syndrome of hypoxic/ischemic perinatal brain injury, lead encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, prosencephaly, <b>schizencephaly,</b> and other diagnoses.|$|E
50|$|Estimates of {{cerebral}} malformations {{vary from}} 39% to 90% {{of children with}} ONH. Abnormalities evident via neuroradiography can include agenesis (absence) or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, absence or incomplete development of the septum pellucidum, malformations of the pituitary gland, <b>schizencephaly,</b> cortical heterotopia, white matter hypoplasia, pachygyria, and holoprosencephaly. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, often {{in conjunction with other}} major malformations, is significantly associated with poor and delayed developmental outcome.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of NTDs: open, which are more common, and closed. Open NTDs occur when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or {{vertebrae}} (back bones). Examples of open NTDs are anencephaly, encephaloceles, hydranencephaly, iniencephaly, <b>schizencephaly,</b> and spina bifida. Rarer types of NTDs are called closed NTDs. Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin. Common examples of closed NTDs are lipomyelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, and tethered cord.|$|E
50|$|In <b>schizencephaly,</b> the neurons border {{the edge}} of the cleft, {{implying}} a very early disruption of the usual grey matter migration during embryogenesis. The cause of the disruption is not known, but likely the cause may be either genetic or a physical insult, such as infection, infarction, hemorrhage, in utero stroke, exposure to a toxin, or mutation. It is thought that normal neuron migration during the second trimester of intrauterine development, when primitive neuron precursors (germinal matrix) migrate from just beneath the ventricular ependyma to the peripheral hemispheres where they form the cortical grey matter.|$|E
50|$|There {{was once}} thought to be a genetic {{association}} with the EMX2 gene, although this theory has recently lost support. However it has been confirmed that mutations in the COL4A1 gene occur in some patients with schizencephaly.Causes of <b>schizencephaly</b> may also be caused by environmental exposures during pregnancy sickness during pregnancy (such as Cytomegalovirus), exposure to toxins, or a vascular insult. Often there are additional associated heterotopias (isolated islands of neurons) which indicate a failure of migration of the neurons to their final position in the brain caused by possible stroke.|$|E
50|$|Preliminary {{diagnosis}} {{may be made}} {{in utero}} via standard ultrasound, and can be confirmed with a standard anatomy ultrasound. This sometimes proves to provide a misdiagnosis of differential diagnoses including bilaterally symmetric <b>schizencephaly</b> (a less destructive developmental process on the brain), severe hydrocephalus (cerebrospinal fluid excess within the skull), and alobar holoprosencephaly (a neurological developmental anomaly). Once destruction of the brain is complete, the cerebellum, midbrain, thalami, basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and portions of the occipital lobes typically remain preserved to varying degrees. Though the cerebral cortex is absent, {{in most cases the}} fetal head remains enlarged due to the continued production by the choroid plexus of cerebrospinal fluid that is inadequately reabsorbed causing increased intracranial pressure.|$|E
50|$|FCMS is {{primarily}} originates from damages in the posterior {{region of the}} inferior frontal gyrus and inferior region of the precentral gyrus. Anatomically, the word operculum {{is defined as the}} cortices encompassing the insula, which includes the pre and post-central, inferior-frontal, supramarginal, angular inferior parietal, and superior temporal convolutions. Parts of the brain such as Heschl's gyrus, Broadmann's area, Broca's Area, Wernicke's Area are amongst the most relevant in the operculum. These areas are responsible for auditory functions for language and speech.FCMS, sometimes called cortical pseudobulbar palsy, is characterized by lesions affected both sides of the operculum. These lesions typically damage the cranial nerves leading to both motor and sensory deficits. The cranial nerves that are impaired include the following; Cranial Nerve (CN) V (the trigeminal nerve), CN VII (the facial nerve), CN IX (the glossopharyngeal nerve), CN X (the vagus nerve), and CN XII (the hypoglossal nerve). Cerebral malformation, namely unilateral <b>schizencephaly</b> in association with contralateral polymicrogyria symmetrically in the perisylvian area is another known charactheristic of FCMS. Moreover, another deformation found with FCMS includes the failure of opercularization caused by the underdevelopment of the anterior part of the opercula found in the fetal brain in the 32nd week.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{case reports}} of 17 -year-old female dizygotic twins are presented. One {{of the twins}} had {{bilateral}} closed-lip <b>schizencephaly,</b> and the other had focal cortical dyspla-sia. Septum pellucidum was absent in both cases. The cor-tical dysplasia in case 2 corresponded to the same hemispheric location with the right schizencephalic cleft in case 1. The combination of <b>schizencephaly</b> and focal cor-tical dysplasia in siblings or twins has not been previously reported. <b>Schizencephaly</b> has been proposed as an extreme variation of focal cortical dysplasia (1). Although one hypothesis for its cause is based on vascular compromise during early neuroembryogenesis (2), familial occurrence also has been reported (3 – 5). However, the ethiopathogenesis of <b>schizencephaly</b> is still unclear...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Schizencephaly</b> {{is a rare}} {{developmental}} malformation of {{the central}} nervous system associated with cell migration disturbances. <b>Schizencephaly</b> can be uni- or bilateral and is divided into two morphological types. The cleft is defined as type I ("closed lips") if there are fused clefts in cerebral mantle. In type II ("open lips") the clefts are separated and filled with cerebrospinal fluid connecting lateral ventricle with the subarachnoid space. Material/Methods: We retrospectively analysed data of patients hospitalized in the Clinical Pediatric Neurology Department of Provincial Hospital No. 2 in Rzeszow between 1998 - 2011. Clinical data and imaging exams were analysed in the group of children with confirmed <b>schizencephaly.</b> Results: <b>Schizencephaly</b> was recognized in 32 children. Diagnosis was made in children at the ages between 2 weeks and 15 years - the majority of older children were born before the year 2000. Diagnostic imaging, most often magnetic resonance imaging, was performed in all of the children. In most cases coexistence of other CNS malformations was discovered. In only one patient there were no neurological symptoms, most of the children presented different developmental disorders and neurological symptoms - most often cerebral palsy and epilepsy. In the group of children with bilateral and type II <b>schizencephaly</b> certain symptoms occurred more often. Conclusions: <b>Schizencephaly</b> is a rare central nervous system developmental disorder, which is very often associated with other severe brain malformations and in most of the cases subsequent multiple neurological symptoms. The method of choice in diagnosis of <b>schizencephaly</b> is magnetic resonance, which shows the degree and type of cleft, coexisting abnormalities and allows differential diagnosis.

40|$|<b>Schizencephaly</b> is a {{malformation}} of cortical development char-acterized by gray matter-lined clefts in {{the cerebral}} cortex {{and a range}} of neurological presentations. In some cases, there are features of septo-optic dysplasia concurrently with schizence-phaly. The etiologies of both <b>schizencephaly</b> and septo-optic dysplasia are thought to be heterogeneous, but there is evidence that at least some cases have genetic origin. We hypothesized that these disorders may be caused by mutations in three candidate genes: LHX 2, a gene with an important cortical patterning role, and HESX 1 and SOX 2, genes that have been associated with septo-optic dysplasia. We sequenced a large cohort of patients with <b>schizencephaly,</b> some with features of septo-optic dysplasia, for mutations in these genes. No pathogenic mutations were observed, suggesting that other genes or non-genetic factors influencing genes critical to brain development must be respon-sible for <b>schizencephaly.</b> 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Schizencephaly</b> is an {{uncommon}} congenital dis-order of cerebral cortical development. The defect is charac-terized {{by the presence}} of a cleft in the brain extending {{from the surface of the}} pia mater to the cerebral ventricles. The margins of the cleft are lined with heterotropic, dysplastic gray matter. The causes of <b>schizencephaly</b> are heterogeneous and can include teratogens, prenatal infection, maternal trauma, or EMX 2 mutations. Method In the present paper, the authors described difficulties in employing diagnostic imaging in differentiating between type II (open-lip) <b>schizencephaly</b> and much more common intracranial fluid spaces of a different origin (arachnoid cysts and hydrocephalus). Result In all the three cases, the treatment consisted in implan-tation of a shunt system; nevertheless, it should be emphasized that a surgical intervention in the third presented case (type II <b>schizencephaly)</b> aimed at relieving the symptoms of intracranial hypertension—a directly life-threatening condition—since shunting is not a method of treating <b>schizencephaly</b> itself. Conclusions Although proper interpretation of the character of intracranial fluid spaces is of significance for further thera-peutic management, yet, the key decision as to the surgical intervention is made based on clinical presentation, predomi-nantly on symptoms of intracranial hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Whereas <b>schizencephaly</b> is a {{malformation}} of cortical development which exact cause remains unknown, {{is almost}} entirely characterized by clefts extending from the pial surface to ependymal surface and could be unilateral or bilateral. Oftentimes, it also occurs in association with other abnormalities. Over the years, two types were described in literature, lips closed and open. Therefore, our intention is describe a case of <b>schizencephaly</b> monitored by the Neurology Service of Nova Iguacu University Hospital. Approach: A 29 -year old single male student, presenting clinical history of epilepsy since he was 23 years old (partial seizures with secondary generalization) showed a global delay in neuropsychomotor development. Results: The patient has been admitted in the emergency department and his seizures were controlled with IV diazepan, followed by phenobarbital and phenotoyn. CT scan has revealed a cortical maldevelopment described as bilateral <b>schizencephaly.</b> After these procedures, he was released six days later, seizure-free, using carbamazepine and phenotyn. Conclusion: Is indeed that prognosis for individuals with <b>schizencephaly</b> varies {{depending on the size}} of the clefts and the neurological deficit degree. In general, treatment for individuals with <b>schizencephaly</b> usually consists of physical therapy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Schizencephaly</b> is a {{human brain}} {{malformation}} distinguished by full-thickness unilateral or bilat-eral clefts through the neocortex. Heterozygous mutations in the EMX 2 locus are reported to give rise to <b>schizencephaly.</b> However, the compre-hensive identification of causative genetic loci is precluded {{by a lack of}} large pedigrees and genome-wide linkage analyses. We present here a large Turkish pedigree with three individuals with <b>schizencephaly.</b> The similarity of clinical signs in affected individuals strongly suggests an underlying genetic cause; however, genome-wide linkage analysis rules out EMX 2 linkage and instead suggests additional candidate loci. These results indicate that genetic forms of schizence-phaly are likely to be heterogeneous...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Septo-optic {{dysplasia}} (SOD) is {{an uncommon}} developmental disorder involving variable midline brain structures, characterized by optic nerve hypoplasia, dysgenesis of septum pellucidum and pituitary- hypothalamic dysfunction with consequent endocrine deficits. The association of septo-optic dysplasia and cortical dysplasia {{is described as}} septo-optic dysplasia-plus. Reports on patients with septo-optic dysplasia-plus have been rare. Other distinct features, which occur especially when cerebral cortical abnormalities are also present (SOD- plus), consist of significant generalized developmental delay and/or spastic motor deficits. Methods: We report a 10 -year-old boy with septo-optic dysplasia-plus syndrome, characterized by septo-optic dysplasia with <b>schizencephaly,</b> significant generalized developmental delay, spastic motor deficits and seizure intractable. Extraction of DNA for gene EMX 2 {{is in the process}} of reporting Results: Neuroimaging studies revealed <b>schizencephaly</b> with enormous ex vacuo dilation of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles that involves medium cells up to the vertex of the brain; the residual frontal cortex of both sides develop a pachigiric aspect, especially in parasagittal regions; the corpus callosum is represented in all its sections but slightly hypoplastic at the rostrum and the splenium. There are also dislocated left femoral head, optic atrophy, deficiency determination and alternating exotropia bilaterally Conclusion: <b>Schizencephaly</b> is a distinct congenital cerebral malformation presenting as transcerebral mantle cleft between lateral ventricle and pial surface. Nearly half of the patients with SOD have <b>schizencephaly.</b> When the SOD is associated to open-lip <b>schizencephaly,</b> the subjects have a poor prognosis with respect to psychomotor development and complicating intractable epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Schizencephaly</b> is a brain-destructive lesion {{relating}} to clefts in the fetal brain that usually {{communicate with the}} ventricular system, subarachnoid space, or both. It presents as two types: Type I (closed) and Type II (open). During pregnancy, it may be suspected {{in the course of}} ultrasonography, which highlights ventricular dilatation and brain abnormalities. Usually, the diagnosis is confirmed postnatally using trans-fontanel ultrasonography. The etiology of <b>schizencephaly</b> is still unknown, but it may be derived from a primary disorder of brain development or from bilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion. Many causative agents including vascular insult, infections, toxins, and medications have been associated with this malformation. We present a pictorial essay of six cases of <b>schizencephaly</b> that were suspected on prenatal ultrasound scans and confirmed postnatally by trans-fontanel, two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasonography...|$|E
40|$|<b>Schizencephaly</b> {{is a rare}} anomaly of {{neuronal}} migration {{characterized by}} the presence of brain clefts that communicate with the lateral ventricles. Type I is characterized by clefts with fused lips or margins, not communicating with the subarachnoid space. Type II is characterized by longer clefts that communicate with the subarachnoid space. Neonatal diagnosis of <b>schizencephaly</b> on transfontanellar two-dimensional (2 D) sonography is rare, with only 1 report in the medical literature. the major limitation of 2 D sonography is its inability to assess neonatal prognosis. There are no reports on MEDLINE about the use of transfontanellar three-dimensional (3 D) sonography in the assessment of <b>schizencephaly.</b> We present a case of type II <b>schizencephaly</b> diagnosed on the 29 th week of gestation with 2 D sonography and describe the main findings with 3 D sonography in surface and transparency modes performed in the neonatal period via the fontanel.

40|$|<b>Schizencephaly</b> is an {{uncommon}} malformation of cortical development. Patients with <b>schizencephaly</b> present {{with a broad}} range of severe neurologic symptoms including pharmacoresistant epilepsy.
