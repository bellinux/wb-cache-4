50|$|Pitt Lake is in {{a typical}} U-shaped glacial valley in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. The overdeepening of {{the lower end of}} the valley over the span of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} created a trough over 140 m below current sea level. After initial glacial retreat at around 13,000 years ago a saltwater fjord occupied this basin when relative sea levels were <b>still</b> <b>ca</b> 120 to 140m above current levels in the region. Unlike neighbouring Indian Arm and Howe Sound farther west, this fjord basin became partly cut off from tidal waters by sedimentation of the lower Fraser River ca 10,500 years ago, and Pitt Lake is now considered a tidal fjord lake.The community of Pitt Meadows occupies the marshy lowland at the southern end of the lake, some of which has become drained and is known as the Pitt Polder. Just southwest of the lake is the community of Port Coquitlam, which is across the Pitt River from Pitt Meadows. At the north end of the lake is a locality named Alvin, which is a transport and shipping point for logging companies and their employees. The Upper Pitt, meaning the valley upstream from the lake, is considered one of BC's best fly-fishing rivers and one of its best steelhead streams.|$|E

MSS 4 {{was shown to}} stimulate nucleotide exchange on Rab proteins associated with the exocytic pathway and to have nucleotide-free-Rab chaperone activity. A detailed kinetic analysis of MSS 4 interaction with Rab 8 showed that MSS 4 is a relatively slow exchange factor that forms a long-lived nucleotide-free complex with RabGTPase. In contrast to other characterized exchange factor–GTPase complexes, MSS 4 :Rab 8 complex binds GTP faster than GDP, but <b>still</b> <b>ca.</b> 3 orders of magnitude more slowly than comparable complexes. The crystal structure of the nucleotide-free MSS 4 :Rab 8 complex revealed that MSS 4 binds to the Switch I and interswitch regions of Rab 8, forming an intermolecular β-sheet. Complex formation results in dramatic structural changes of the Rab 8 molecule, leading to unfolding of the nucleotide-binding site and surrounding structural elements, facilitating nucleotide release and slowing its rebinding. Coupling of nucleotide exchange activity to a cycle of GTPase unfolding and refolding represents a novel nucleotide exchange mechanism...|$|E

One cosmid hybrid plasmid pBW 8 was studied which carried a region of the virulence plasmid. This hybrid plasmid expressed in Escherichia coli K- 12 a novel temperature-inducible outer membrane protein which is immunologically related to and has the same molecular weight as protein 1. Protein 1 was purified to homogeneity, and 14 amino acids of the N-terminal end were determined. From this sequence, the tentative corresponding DNA sequence was deduced, and a set of 11 -nucleotide-long DNA probes was chemically synthesized. By using these probes in Southern blotting experiments, the genetic location of the N-terminal end of protein 1 was established. By introducing the transposon Tn 5 into the virulence plasmid pIB 1, mutants were obtained that did not express protein 1.

This paper aims {{to describe the}} changes in the structure and dynamics of these stands with age. It then assesses the impact of selective thinning in the upper storey on both structural and dynamic parameters. The experiment consisted of 34 Permanent Plots in stands from establishment to more mature stages (ca. 50 years old). Thirteen plots (17 [...] 45 years old) were thinned. More than 80 % of the removal came from supernumerary dominant A. klaineana. A. klaineana represented 60 % of the total density in stands ca. 15 years old but > 90 % of the dominant trees in older stands. The changes with age in the floristic composition of the unthinned stands showed three successional stages during which pioneer species associated with A. klaineana (from establishment to ca. 15 years) were progressively replaced by mature forest species. Basal area increased and density decreased with age before reaching stable values at ca. 40 [...] 45 years. Mortality was very high in young stands but decreased in the older ones. Mortality generally affected small diameter individuals in the dominated storey. Diameter and basal area increments showed that the stand growth resulted from the growth of dominant A. klaineana. Diameter increments of A. klaineana were elevated during the first years of colonisation (1. 9 cm/year) and were <b>still</b> <b>ca.</b> 0. 7 cm/year for 50 -year-old dominant trees. Thinning did not increase the mortality of the dominant population. It favoured the individual growth of A. klaineana. The gain was substantial for dominated trees and small dominant trees (from 60 to 100 %) but was lower for large dominant trees (ca. 25 [...] 30 %). Therefore, stimulation of individual growth did not compensate for the loss of basal area at the stand level...|$|E

40|$|The {{phorbol ester}} {{receptor}} protein kinase C (PKC) gene family encodes essential mediators of eukaryotic cellular signals. Molecular dissection of their mechanisms of {{action has been}} limited {{in part by the}} lack of random mutagenesis approaches and by the complexity of signaling pathways in mammalian cells which involve multiple PKC isoforms. Here we present a rapid screen which permits the quantification of mammalian PKC activity phenotypically in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bovine PKC alpha cDNA is functionally expressed in S. cerevisiae. This results in a phorbol ester response: a fourfold increase in the cell doubling time and a substantial decrease in yeast colony size on agar plates. We have expressed pools of bovine PKC alpha cDNAs mutagenized by Bal 31 deletion of internal, amino-terminal, or carboxyl-terminal sequences and have identified three classes of mutants {{on the basis of their}} distinct yeast phenotypes. Representatives of each class were analyzed. An internal deletion of amino acids (aa) 172 to 225 displayed ligand-dependent but reduced catalytic activity, an amino-terminal truncation of aa 1 to 153 displayed elevated and ligand-independent activity, and a carboxyl-terminal 26 -aa truncation (aa 647 to 672) lacked activity under any conditions. Additional mutations confirmed the distinct functional characteristics of these classes. Our data show that deletion of the V 1 and C 1 regions results in elevated basal catalytic activity which is <b>still</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + responsive. Internal deletions in the V 2 and C 2 regions do not abolish phorbol ester or Ca 2 + regulation of PKC activity, suggesting that most of the C 2 domain is not essential for phorbol ester stimulation and most of the regulatory domain is dispensable for Ca 2 + regulation of PKC activity. These distinct activities od the PKC mutants correlate with a specific and proportional yeast phenotype and are quantified on agar plates by yeast colony size. This provides a phenotypic screen which is suitable to identity rare, randomly altered but active mammalian PKC mutants. It quantifies their catalytic and biological activities in response to PKC activators or inhibitors for a systematic mapping of PKC structure and function or PKC-drug interaction...|$|E
40|$|Ghrelin (GRLN), Cholecystokinin (CCK) and the Neuropeptide Y (NPY) family member; PYY are {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) tract peptide hormones {{involved in}} the optimization of the digestive process and regulation of appetite in mammals. Although the functions of these hormones have been extensively studied in higher vertebrates, less is known for fish. The high diversity between fish species, suggest a species specific approach when studying the role of GI tract peptide hormones. Two isoformes of GRLN (GRLN- 1, GRLN- 2) and CCK (CCK-L, CCK-N), in addition to PYY were recently cloned and characterized in Atlantic salmon. However, no information {{is available on the}} postprandial involvement of these peptide hormones in Atlantic salmon GI tract. Therefore an experiment was initiated where the aim was to increase the knowledge of regulation of the digestive process and appetite by these key GI tract peptide hormones in Atlantic salmon. This study describes the spatial distribution and postprandial changes in GRLN, CCK and PYY mRNA expression in the GI tract during the complete processing of a single meal in Atlantic salmon (average body weight: 44. 7 ± 2. 1 g). The mRNA expression values were obtained by quantitative PCR from four GI tract segments covering stomach, pyloric cecae, midgut and hindgut. In order to assess the GI tract transit, the content of feed and chyme in each GI tract segment, and gallbladder content were assessed. Unfed fish were used as control, and these fish were also used to assess potential diurnal patterns of GRLN- 1, GRLN- 2, CCK-L, CCK-N and PYY mRNA expression in Atlantic salmon. With the exception of CCK-N which was not expressed in midgut and hindgut, the genes for all peptides were expressed in all GI tract segments analyzed in Atlantic salmon, although at different levels. Both CCK-L and CCK-N mRNA expression increased within 1. 5 hours past feeding (hpf) when the stomach was <b>still</b> <b>ca</b> 80 % full, the gallbladder was nearly empty and chyme had started to be transferred into the midgut. The CCK isoforms had different spatial and temporal mRNA expression patterns during the 24 h processing of the meal. PYY mRNA expression increased at 1. 5 hpf and then decreased after 3 hpf. No differences were detected between GRLN isoforms and both forms increased after processing of a single meal, indicating minor effect of GRLN on regulation of digestion. Taken together this suggests that CCK and PYY have in part similar roles in regulating digestive processes to that observed in higher vertebrates. The two isoforms of CCK appear to have different functions. The results did not identify a role for GRLN in regulating digestion and appetite comparable to mammals...|$|E
40|$|Severin from Dictyostelium discoideum is a Ca 2 (+) -activated actin- binding {{protein that}} severs actin filaments, nucleates actin assembly, and caps the fast growing ends of actin filaments. Sequence {{comparison}} with functionally related proteins, such as gelsolin, villin, or fragmin revealed highly conserved domains which {{are thought to}} be of functional significance. To attribute the different activities of the severin molecule to defined regions, progressively truncated severin polypeptides were constructed. The complete cDNA coding for 362 (DS 362) amino acids and five 3 ' deletions coding for 277 (DS 277), 177 (DS 177), 151 (DS 151), 117 (DS 117), or 111 (DS 111) amino acids were expressed in Escherichia coli. The proteins were purified to homogeneity and then characterized with respect to their effects on the polymerization or depolymerization kinetics of G- or F-actin solutions and their binding to G-actin. Furthermore, the Ca 2 + binding of these proteins was investigated with a 45 Ca-overlay assay and by monitoring Ca 2 (+) - dependent changes in tryptophan fluorescence. Bacterially expressed DS 362 showed the same Ca 2 (+) -dependent activities as native severin. DS 277, missing the 85 COOH-terminal amino acids of severin, had lost its strict Ca 2 + regulation and displayed a Ca 2 (+) -independent capping activity, but was <b>still</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + dependent in its severing and nucleating activities. DS 151 which corresponded to the first domain of gelsolin or villin had completely lost severing and nucleating properties. However, a residual severing activity of approximately 2 % was detectable if 26 amino acids more were present at the COOH-terminal end (DS 177). This locates similar to gelsolin the second actin-binding site to the border region {{between the first and second}} domain. Measuring the fluorescence enhancement of pyrene-labeled G-actin in the presence of DS 111 showed that the first actin-binding site was present in the NH 2 -terminal 111 amino acids. Extension by six or more amino acids stabilized this actin- binding site in such a way that DS 117 and even more pronounced DS 151 became Ca 2 (+) -independent capping proteins. In comparison to many reports on gelsolin we draw the following conclusions. Among the three active actin-binding sites in gelsolin the closely neighboured sites one and two share the F-actin fragmenting function, whereas the actin- binding sites two and three, which are located in far distant domains, collaborate for nucleation. In contrast, severin contains two active actin-binding sites which are next to each other and are responsible for the severing as well as the nucleating function. The single actin- binding site near the NH 2 -terminus is sufficient for capping of actin filaments...|$|E

40|$|Structure {{determination}} of protein-complexes and membrane-proteins with {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) {{is limited by the}} low sensitivity of this method. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can enhance the intensity of NMR-signals by up to two orders of magnitude due to the transfer of the large polarization of unpaired electrons to nuclei under microwave irradiation and at cryogenic temperatures. Not much is know about DNP-experiments with proteins. In this thesis, individual experimental parameters are investigated and optimized with the aim of recording resolved DNP spectra of proteins. Preliminary experiments show that protein signals broaden at cryogenic temperatures. To understand the underlying processes, two-dimensional spectra of the protein SH 3 were recorded at temperatures between 295 and 95 K and analyzed in detail. The line broadening was shown to be primarily inhomogeneous. The degree of broadening depends strongly on the individual sidechain and ist environment. Another difference between DNP and conventional NMR is the addition of stable radicals. Being paramagnets, the radicals change the NMR-parameters of nearby nuclei. These effects were investigated in detail and quantified with frozen solutions of proline. The radicals shorten the relaxation-times of surrounding nuclei. Faster T 1 -relaxation of protons allows for a shorted measurement time, whereas faster T 2 -relaxation of carbons homogeneously broadens their signals. In sum, the paramagnetic effects make nuclei closer than 10 angstrom to the radical undetectable with NMR and the optimal concentration of radicals is different for every sample. The observation of inhomogeneous broadening raises the question if DNP-experiments are feasible at intermediate temperatures without fully losing DNP-enhancement. To investigate this possibility, deuterated SH 3 was measured at 173 K. The enhancement of protons at this temperature is <b>still</b> <b>ca.</b> 11 and the resolution of the spectra is substantially better than at 95 K. This method has great potential for samples that can be deuterated. To investigate how membrane proteins can be measured with DNP, a model system of neurotoxin II bound to nicotinic acetylcholinreceptors in native membranes was chosen. The experiments show that the biradical preferentially accumulates at the protein and membrane surfaces. Hence, the NMR-signals of the ligand are strongly homogeneously broadened. The biradical then reacts with components of the sample becoming inactivated. By storing the sample at − 20 °C, this effect can be used to inactivate the radicals close to the analyte while also keeping active radicals in the solvent. Under these conditions NMR-spectra can be measured with a resolution otherwise only observed at room temperature. In this way it is possible to decrease the measurement time from ten days to ten hours without loosing information. In summary, this work shows how to optimize the DNP-parameters and sample preparation to refine DNP-spectroscopy for the application to proteins. Two different ways are shown, which allow the recording of DNP-enhanced and resolved spectra of proteins and to find new answers to the questions of structural biology...|$|E

Not all of the oil and water emulsions were stable for three weeks, whereas all of the oil and vinegar emulsions remained stable {{for up to three}} months. Addition of NaCl increased both emulsifying activity and emulsion stability. Emulsions with an acidic pH were the most stable. With pH emulsion stability was greatly reduced and more work was required to establish an emulsion. Heating and cooling, and freezing and thawing caused vary degrees and rapidity of emulsion breakdown. Addition of NaCl maintained the emulsion stability when subjected to these various treatments. Deglycosylation of MP with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid and anisole did not significantly reduce the emulsifying activity of the MP. These preparations <b>still</b> contained <b>ca.</b> 3 % carbohydrate and consisted of two distinct entities of mw ca. 36 and 41 kDa as observed by gradient SDS-PAGE...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe L-type Ca 2 + channel or {{dihydropyridine}} receptor (DHPR) in vertebrate {{skeletal muscle}} {{is responsible for}} sensing sarcolemmal depolarizations and transducing this signal to the sarcoplasmic Ca 2 + release channel RyR 1 via conformational coupling to initiate muscle contraction. During this excitation-contraction (EC) coupling process there is a slow Ca 2 + current through the mammalian DHPR which is fully missing in euteleost fishes. In contrast to ancestral evolutionary stages where skeletal muscle EC coupling is <b>still</b> depended on <b>Ca</b> 2 +-induced Ca 2 +-release (CICR), {{it is possible that}} the DHPR Ca 2 + conductivity during mammalian (conformational) EC coupling was retained as an evolutionary remnant (vestigiality). Here, we wanted to test the hypothesis that due to the lack of evolutionary pressure in post-CICR species skeletal muscle DHPR Ca 2 + conductivity gradually reduced as evolution progressed. Interestingly, we identified that the DHPR of the early ray-finned fish sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) is phylogenetically positioned above the mammalian rabbit DHPR which retained robust Ca 2 + conductivity, but below the euteleost zebrafish DHPR which completely lost Ca 2 + conductivity. Remarkably, our results revealed that sterlet DHPR <b>still</b> retained the <b>Ca</b> 2 + conductivity but currents are significantly reduced compared to rabbit. This decrease is due to lower DHPR membrane expression similar to zebrafish, as well as due to reduced channel open probability (Po). In both these fish species the lower DHPR expression density is partially compensated by higher efficacy of DHPR-RyR 1 coupling. The complete loss of Po in zebrafish and other euteleost species was presumably based on the teleost specific 3 rd round of genome duplication (Ts 3 R). Ts 3 R headed into the appearance of two skeletal muscle DHPR isoforms which finally, together with the radiation of the euteleost clade, fully lost the Po...|$|R
2500|$|On 3 March 1795 Censeur, {{under her}} captain Louis-Marie Coudé, formed {{part of a}} fleet of 15 ships of the line {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which sailed from Toulon bound for Corsica with 5,000 troops. The fleet was intercepted in the Gulf of Genoa on 13 March by a British force under the command of Vice-Admiral William Hotham, which {{promptly}} gave chase to the French. Martin attempted to flee, but in the confusion two of his 80-gun ships, Ça Ira and Victoire, collided, causing the Ça Ira to lose her fore and main topmasts. Several British ships, including the 64-gun [...] under Captain Horatio Nelson, came up to the straggling Ça Ira and opened fire, causing Martin to double back to protect her. A cautious Hotham called his ships back and reformed the line, and as night fell Martin disengaged and resumed his flight, with the Censeur towing the Ça Ira. At daybreak on 14 March the British resumed their attack on the <b>still</b> lagging <b>Ça</b> Ira and Censeur. Martin again attempted to come to their aid, but after some heavy fighting, withdrew with his transports, leaving both ships to be captured by the British. The two ships fought on until Censeur had lost her fore and main masts, and sustained combined casualties of 400 men.|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{photosynthesis}} {{comprise of}} a light driven water oxidation reaction and an electrochemical CO ‐ 2 reduction in dark. To achieve the efficient CO 2 reduction by the excited electron from the light driven anodic‐ reaction, the lowering the overvoltage of CO 2 reduction is an essential component. [Ni(cyclam) ] 2 + (cyclam= 1, 4, 8, 11 tetraazacyclotetradecane) and its derivatives {{are known to be}} efficient in CO ‐ 2 to CO conversion and the macrocyclic ligand, cyclam is known to stabilize Ni(I) state. However, those compounds <b>still</b> have <b>ca.</b> 0. 6 V of overvoltages and the use of mercury electrode is essential to suppress hydrogen evolution on the electrode at such a negative potential. We found that the incorporation of the Ni(cyclam) unit into polyallylamine (PALA) backbone by Schiff’s base condensation via axial coordination of 4 pyridine carboxaldehyde is effective in‐ lowering overvoltage and it enables the catalyst to be used with carbon electrode material in neutral aqueous solution. The resulting redox polymer, Ni(cyclam) PALA converts CO ‐ 2 to CO near its thermodymic potential, 0. 78 ‐ V vs. Ag/AgCl in pH 8, 50 mM tris buffer on glassy carbon electrode with current efficiency of over 90 %.
