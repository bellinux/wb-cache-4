50|$|Along {{with the}} second version of Harvey came a set of slides to show images of echoes and other medical imaging pieces helpful when {{diagnosing}} the disease. These <b>slide</b> <b>programs</b> were around 1998 replaced with software that allowed for video recordings. This software came in 1985, {{around the time of}} the first aortic stenosis, and was designed around that case. Part of diagnosing aortic stenosis is listening to sounds in the neck, which in the first Harvey version was not possible because it had no neck sounds. The software also contains the images and videos from the original <b>slide</b> <b>programs,</b> along with the history of the patient.|$|R

40|$|Slope {{failure is}} one of the most {{prominent}} difficulties experienced in geotechnical engineering where catastrophes lead to the destruction of property and ultimately significant loss of life. One such salient example of this was the Oso slope failure which occurred 6. 4 km east of Oso, Washington, USA on the 22 nd of March 2014. This disaster, deemed to be the single deadliest landslide event in United States history claimed the lives of 26 people whilst 7 people remain unaccounted for. The purpose of this dissertation is to accurately construct a model earth dam and design an experimental methodology that produces consistent and comparable results in terms of its slope stability. The experimental results are critically compared with the theoretical results produced by the SLIDE slope stability software, with the overall objective of determining if computer analysis can accurately predict the behaviour of a model earth dam. This dissertation was compiled by completing an extensive review of 4 salient method of slices available that can be applied to determine the stability or instability of the slope. A similar amount of experimental data collection was also completed to enable a comparable dataset of results to be compiled. This report determines that the <b>SLIDE</b> <b>program</b> does accurately predict the behaviour of a model earth dam with downstream slopes of 1 : 1, 1 : 1. 5, 1 : 1. 75 and 1 : 2 respectively. However, during the experimental testing of the 1 : 2. 5 and 1 : 3 downstream slopes it was observed that only initial erosion at the toe takes place. The <b>SLIDE</b> <b>program</b> applies its design principles and determines that the slope should fail. The experimental results contradict this as the slopes remained stable after the initial erosion subsided. An investigation was conducted to determine if the addition of a drainage blanket would negate the effect of erosion by altering the water flow path exit location. The result of this was conclusive and the dam was deemed to be stable at a downstream slope of 1 : 2. 5...|$|R

The CDs {{can be used in}} several ways to deliver educational programs. In lieu of traditional <b>slide</b> <b>programs,</b> specialists can use a CD equipped laptop computer and digital projector for CD based presentations to combine the graphics with still and video images in concise form to reinforce salient points and procedures. The greatest flexibility is for clients to use CDs for self tutorials and reference on their computers at home or work. In Georgia, CDs are being developed for use in educational program areas for training forest landowners and natural resource managers...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{covers the}} slope {{stability}} analysis, foundation and support measures of a lightweight wooden residential house on an avalanche-prone slope. The work discusses {{in detail the}} problematic of the stability of a slope in the <b>SLIDE</b> <b>program.</b> Stability of the slope is analyzed at an estimated average and critical water level. Two different geotechnical measures are carried out for the aforementioned water levels. The first set of measures consists of {{an analysis of the}} concrete grid, which is anchored in bedrock, while an example of the second measurements is an anchored pile wall with a few pilots in an additional row, which are also embedded in the bedrock. Due {{to the nature of the}} inclined slope a lot of the information had to be simplified in order to use the analytical methods described in the thesis. The end includes a financial overhaul of both implementations of the two geotechnical measures at different water levels...|$|R
50|$|Starting in May 1937 the Minnesota Mycological {{society had}} its regular {{meetings}} {{for the study}} of mushrooms at the Walker Library. The Minnesota Audubon Society also had regular meetings and film and <b>slide</b> <b>programs</b> at the library. The Audubon Society also had a display of birds in the basement Audubon room until 1959 when the birds were donated to the city school’s science departments. In the late 1930s the library had some WPA workers to help with day-to-day operations. Dexter Goulston, a labor organizer and auxiliary member of Truck Driver’s Local #544 attempted to get WPA and Library staff to rebel against management but Marion Crosby was so universally respected that his words fell on deaf ears and he was quite discouraged and was transferred. Crosby was a bit concerned that she may have done something to get the library involved with the very active truck drivers union but everything ended up working out for the best.|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that information on their disease {{is one of the}} prerequisites for improvement of patients' compliance with therapy. The authors have therefore developed a simple <b>slide</b> <b>program</b> presenting information on hypertension and obesity. Consisting of 52 slides, it was shown in the central waiting room of the medical outpatient department at the University Hospital, Zurich. In order to assess learning, 841 patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire. 485 had seen the program and 356 served as controls with the program switched off. Four main results emerged: 1. The percentage of subjects scoring {{greater than or equal to}} 4 correct answers (of a maximum of 5) rose significantly from 22. 6 % to 64. 2 %. 2. The number of incorrect answers (maximum 3) remained unchanged. 3. Learning decreased with age. 4. Occupation did not have a significant effect on learning. The results clearly show that the program represents an effective method of teaching patients and may therefore serve to improve compliance with therapy...|$|R
40|$|The current design {{approaches}} for reinforced earthfill structures are limit state methods, which involve nominal loads being increased by stated load factors, and material strengths reduced by stated partial material factors. Advanced numerical analyses do not {{suffer from the}} above shortcomings and {{have been used to}} assess the accuracy of the more approximate calculations. A case study of reinforced soil retaining wall sections is analysed using limit equilibrium methods. The behaviour of the walls for the same arrangement of reinforcements is examined using advanced numerical methods. Numerical analyses were performed using the finite difference program FLAC and the finite element program PLAXIS while analyses based on the codes of practice were performed using Excel calculation sheets and the <b>SLIDE</b> <b>program.</b> The global stability checks are confirmed by the observed performance of the walls when analysed using numerical methods while the latter result invariably in smaller tension forces developed in the reinforcement. Convergence in the displacement calculations and forces in the reinforcement is observed for both numerical methods of analysis. © 2007 Civil-Comp Press...|$|R
