Wilson introduced the IB Diploma Program in 1998. The turnaround Wilson orchestrated led to a quick resurgence and restoration of the school's academic reputation. Enrollment, <b>student</b> <b>performance,</b> {{and the quality of the}} colleges and universities to which graduates matriculated improved, which attracted critical acclaim from education professionals and international media attention. In 2000, City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, the highest academic honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2001, the Toronto National Post reported on its search for the perfect high school in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. One subject of the prominent feature article was Baltimore City College and its turnaround.|$|E

25|$|Implementing {{appropriate}} proxemic cues {{has been}} shown to improve success in monitored behavioral situations like psychotherapy by increasing patient trust for the therapist (see active listening). Instructional situations have likewise seen increased success in <b>student</b> <b>performance</b> by lessening the actual or perceived distance between the student and the educator (perceived distance is manipulated in the case of instructional videoconferencing, using technological tricks such as angling the frame and adjusting the zoom). Studies have shown that proxemic behavior is also affected when dealing with stigmatized minorities within a population. For example, those who do not have experience dealing with disabled persons tend to create more distance during encounters because they are uncomfortable. Others may judge that the disabled person needs to have an increase of touch, volume, or proximity.|$|E

25|$|In January 2002, Bush {{signed the}} No Child Left Behind Act, with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy as chief sponsor, {{which aims to}} close the {{achievement}} gap, measures <b>student</b> <b>performance,</b> provides options to parents with children in low-performing schools, and targets more federal funding to low-income schools. Critics, including Senator John Kerry and the National Education Association, say schools were not given the resources to help meet new standards, although their argument is based on premise that authorization levels are spending promises instead of spending caps. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce said that the Department of Education's overall funding increased by US$14 billion since the enactment of NCLB in fiscal year 2001, going from US$42.6 billion to US$56.6 billion in fiscal year 2005.

25|$|In 2012, {{the school}} {{declined}} to Corrective Action II 6th Year status due to intractable low student {{math and reading}} achievement. In 2011, the school was in Corrective Action II 5th Year status due to chronic lagging math and reading achievement. In 2010, the school declined to Corrective Action II 4th Year status due to continuing low student math and reading achievement. The attendance rate was 93% in both 2010 and 2011. In accordance with No Child Left Behind, due to low student achievement, the school was mandated to allow students to transfer to a successful school in the district. Students may transfer to either Stetser Elementary School or Chester Upland School of the Arts. The district must provide transportation. Free tutoring is offered after school to help eligible students improve in reading, mathematics and science. The school has a Title I and Parent- School Community Council which works with parents to improve <b>student</b> <b>performance.</b> In 2009–10, enrollment was 365 pupils with 40 children in preschool.

The Bronx School of Law and Finance and Bronx Theatre High School were opened in September 2003. The Bronx School for Law & Finance was opened in September 2004. The enrollment of John F. Kennedy High School began shrinking in 2004 as the small schools grew, with a target cap of 2,500 students. Results from the 2010-11 NYC School Survey were abysmally low. Over half {{of students who}} took the survey reported that their peers did not respect teachers or other students; over 70 percent of teachers reported the same; meanwhile the school became increasingly plagued by crime and poor academic results. In late-2010, the Department of Education decided to shut John F. Kennedy by eliminating one grade per year until it graduated its last class in 2014. Crucial to the decision to close the school was the DOE’s assertion that the school was under performing, earning an overall D on its 2009-10 progress report, with a F grade for <b>student</b> <b>performance.</b> According to the DOE, four-year graduation rate at Kennedy High School was 46%, {{as opposed to a}} 63% average for the city.
