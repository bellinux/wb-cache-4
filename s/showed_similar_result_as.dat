40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{knowledge}} and attitude of working moth- ers (WM) and non-working mothers (NWM) concerning immuniza- tion in children. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted on February, 18 - 23, 2002 at PT. Olagafood Industri, a noodle manufacture in Tanjung Morawa, Medan. Subjects were female workers and non-working wives of male workers who had under-five-year children. Mothers were interviewed using a questionnaire. Sample size for each group was 38. Degree of knowledge, attitude, and practice concerning immunization were classified into good, insufficient, and bad. Results Mothers’ age, educational level, and children’s age were comparable between the two groups. Ten WM and 8 NWM had good knowledge concerning immunization, which did not differ sig- nificantly (p> 0. 05). Good attitude toward immunization was found in 25 WM and 12 NWM; it was {{a statistically significant difference}} (p< 0. 05).

Soy flour was modified by repeated digestion of soy flour by sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. 5 %, 10 % and 20 % modified soy flour (MSF) was then prepared. Medium density fibreboard (MDF) of 810 kg/m 3 was made using wood fibre and thickness swelling properties and mechanical properties were analyzed to determine the performance of the board. In the second part, the MSF concentration with the best mechanical result was used to prepare MSF with enzymatic hydrolase lignin (EHL) of that particular concentration. Laccase enzyme was added to 5 % lignin to produce EHL. Thickness swelling and mechanical properties were analyzed to determine the performance of the board. FTIR and DSC analysis were performed to understand the structure and properties of all the different types of adhesive. Thickness swelling test exhibit that 5 % MSF showed the least thickness swelling. However it did not meet the requirement of ASTM. 10 % MSF with EHL did not show a better result either as it increased to more than 100 %. For mechanical testing, internal bonding for 10 % MSF showed the best result and it almost reached the ASTM standard. 10 % MSF with EHL also <b>showed</b> <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> <b>as</b> the 10 % modified soy flour.

40|$|Background: Since {{the birth}} of the first test tube baby, 25 years ago, more than three million babies have been born using {{assisted}} reproductive technologies (ART). Twin births by way of ART represent 20 - 30 % of U. S. and European births, as compared to only 1 % of natural births. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in ART dizigotic twins, compared with non-ART twins. Method: A review of the medical literature available in Pub Med, EBM review, the National Clinical Trials Registry and CINAHL databases. The search was limited to English language sources between 2000 and 2010. Three cohort studies were identified for the final systematic review. The GRADE tool was used to evaluate the evidence. Results: The three cohort studies found no higher risk of low birth weight in ART twins after stratification for maternal age and parity. Birth weight discordance and mortality rates <b>showed</b> <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> <b>as</b> low birth weight. Two of the studies found an increased risk of hospitalization and neonatal intensive care unit admissions and maintained this result after stratification for maternal factors. One study found a higher risk of prematurity in twins conceived by in vitro fertilization; no such association was found in the other study. Conclusion: A review of the evidence found an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome in twins conceived by in vitro fertilization, compared with twin not conceived by in vitro fertilization. However, no statistically significance differences were found after stratification for maternal confounders, with the exception of hospital and NICU admission.

40|$|Chromatographic {{efficiency}} can {{be defined}} as the maximal number of chromatographic peaks that can be separated within a section of a chromatogram. In isothermal gas chromatography (GC) it is usually measured by number of theoretical plates and modeled by the van Deemter equation. Number of theoretical plates is not a valid measure of efficiency in temperature programmed GC due to its variability with temperature. The van Deemter equation is also not useful since it does not account for the temperature factor. Thus the purpose of this work has been to investigate how the efficiency depends on carrier gas velocity and temperature rate in temperature programmed GC by expanding the van Deemter equation to a function that accounts for temperature rate in addition to carrier gas velocity, and to develop methodology for optimizing the separation efficiency. Fatty acid methyl esters of saturated homologous and unsaturated fatty acids were used as analytes. The study involved nine different columns of varying polarity using helium, hydrogen and nitrogen as a carrier gases. Efficiency was defined as the inverse of peak width in retention index units and thus peak width was used to measure efficiency where its minimum corresponds to maximum efficiency. Peak width was then used to model van Deemter equation where carrier gas velocity and temperature rate were varied. The data obtained from measurements at different levels of combinations of the varied factors resulted in good fit of van Deemter models at all levels of temperature rate and for all carrier gases used (overall mean R 2 = 0. 9885). Then by adding the temperature rate factor the ordinary van Deemter curve was expanded to a response surface function which explains peak width in retention index units as a function of carrier gas velocity and temperature rate. The response surface function contained main, interaction and quadratic terms. But since the interacting factors may vary and there is no theoretical basis that explains which of the terms in the response surface function are significant, a backward elimination procedure was employed to detect significant terms. The result revealed that five terms are always required to define the models obtained using each column and every carrier gas. The terms that appear significant depend on the type of carrier gas used. Experiments were carried out in general at 9 levels of carrier gas velocities and 3 levels of temperature rates. Experimental designs of full 9 x 3, 5 x 3, 3 x 3, skewed 3 x 3 and Doehlert designs of carrier gas velocity and temperature rate were compared. From comparison of predicted optimum velocity and peak width measurements the 5 x 3 design <b>showed</b> <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> <b>as</b> the full 9 x 3 design. The 3 x 3, skewed 3 x 3 and Doehlert design had lower performance than the 5 x 3 design. Nevertheless they may be good enough for practical purposes. The maximum difference in predicted optimum velocity from results of full design was 0. 98 cm/s for velocities measured in the range of 10 - 15, 20 - 30 and 30 - 40 cm/s for nitrogen, helium and hydrogen respectively whereas the difference in peak width measurements were less than 0. 0005 equivalent chain length units. In chromatography there is normally a trade-off between analysis time and separation efficiency. The time of analysis which was best represented with the retention time of the last eluting compound is related to both carrier gas velocity and temperature rate by power functions. This was taken as a basis for deriving response surface function of the retention time of the last eluting compound, which was combined with the models of efficiency. An optimum line of best time efficiency trade-off was then found by an iterative procedure from the overlapped plots and was found to lay 2 - 5 %, 3 - 6 % and 3 - 8 % above the velocity that gives the minimum in van Deemter curve in optimum velocity for helium, hydrogen and nitrogen respectively. Comparison of the carrier gases indicated that at similar efficiency with helium hydrogen as carrier gas reduces the time of analysis by 24 - 31 % whereas there is 80 - 92 % increase in retention time with nitrogen as a carrier gas. On the other hand at similar retention time with helium hydrogen gives 6 - 8 % more efficiency than helium while 12 - 18 % decreases in efficiency with nitrogen is observed. The performance of different polar columns with the right selectivity for FAME was evaluated and compared. The efficiency of the columns was found to depend on polarity of the columns. The less polar DB- 23 and BP- 20 columns are the most efficient columns whereas the more polar BPX 70 and IL 100 columns have moderate and less efficiency than the others. On the other hand at similar retention time with helium hydrogen gives 6 - 8 % more efficiency than helium while 1 2 - 18 % decreases in efficiency with nitrogen is observed.

The obtained <b>results</b> <b>show</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>as</b> those obtained analytically and confirm the validity of the approach for the end users and the operators...|$|R

Biological monitoring {{is an important component}} of the program, with macroinvertebrates serving as the primary tool for assessing water quality. We evaluated the validity and applicability of the GA AAS macroinvertebrate index on three impacted and two reference streams within an agricultural landscape in the Coastal Plain region of southwest Georgia. We compared these findings to a concurrent study that examined the condition of streams impacted by grazing livestock, through water quality, physical and vegetative parameters as well as macroinvertebrate metrics. The GA AAS index for macroinvertebrates proved to be effective in separating sites with different impacts, <b>showing</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>as</b> most invertebrate indices, and appears to be a valid tool to assess the ecological condition of Coastal Plain streams.

We {{study this}} problem and show the following results. (a) When the ideal I=〈m 1,m 2,…,mk〉 for a constant k, we can test whether f∈I in randomized polynomial time. This result holds even for f given by a black-box, when f is of small degree. (b) When I=〈m 1,m 2,…,mk〉 for a constant kandf is computed by a ΣΠΣ circuit with output gate of bounded fanin, we can test whether f∈I in deterministic polynomial time. This generalizes the Kayal–Saxena result [11] of deterministic polynomial-time identity testing for ΣΠΣ circuits with bounded fanin output gate. (c) When k is not constant the problem is coNP-hard. We also show {{that the problem is}} upper bounded by coMAPP over the field of rationals, and by coNPModpP over finite fields. (d) Finally, we discuss identity testing for certain restricted depth 4 arithmetic circuits. For ideals I=〈f 1,…,fℓ〉 where each fi∈F[x 1,…,xk] is an arbitrary polynomial but k is a constant, we <b>show</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>as</b> (a) and (b) above...|$|R

Target {{of this study}} was to determine concentration of cadmium in rabbit semen and subsequently to detect in vitro effects on spermatozoa motility parameters. Mean cadmium semen concentration in rabbits (n= 27) estimated by AAS method was 0. 09559 mg/kg. In in vitro experiment significant (p 5 µm/s) estimated by CASA method was detected after 60 and 120 minutes of culture. In groups with the lowest cadmium concentration this decrease was not significantly affected immediately after cadmium addition. Similar tendency of cadmium induced dose-dependent decrease was detected for progressive spermatozoa motility (> 20 µm/s). Comprehensive motility analysis of distance parameters (curve line; average path; straight line) detected significant alteration for all experimental groups after 60 a 120 minutes of culture. At time 0, only the tendency of decrease was detected. Evaluation of curve line distance <b>showed</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>as</b> for average path distance and also significant decrease in the group with maximum cadmium concentration at time 0 of culture was found. For straight line distance the same tendency was recorded. Non-significant (p> 0. 05) differences were detected for straightness, linearity of spermatozo...|$|R
40|$|Lateral ankle sprains {{represent}} {{the most common}} sports-related injuries. The Nintendo Wii Fit™ could be useful {{in the treatment of}} ankle sprains. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness of exercise training using the Wii Fit™ in ankle sprain patients: (a) with physical therapy; and (b) a control group not receiving any treatment. Ninety lateral ankle sprain patients were randomized to a Wii Fit™, physical therapy, or control group. We assessed the following outcome measures before, and 6 weeks after starting the allocated treatment: Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, pain during rest and walking, delay before return to sport, patient satisfaction, and effectiveness of the allocated treatment. Six weeks after the baseline measures, foot and ankle ability scores had improved in all groups, and pain had decreased during walking (P[*] [*] 0. 050). In conclusion, the Wii Fit™ could be used as an exercise therapy to treat ankle sprain patients. However, Wii Fit™ was not more effective than only physical therapy, or no exercise therapy at all. Patients who did not receive treatment <b>showed</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>as</b> people who got any kind of exercise therapy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{highlights}} teachers’ {{involvement in}} professional development (PD) activities {{teachers in the}} Darussalam Modern Islamic Boarding School (DMIBS), East Java, Indonesia. It evaluates the implementation of PD programs by identifying teachers` perception toward PD they participated in. The study used a survey research approach to investigate professional development {{and the level of}} teacher`s self-efficacy at the boarding school. The majority of teachers have a high level of satisfaction toward the implementation of PD activities in DMIBS in terms of course content, instructor, relevancy to teaching practice and course management. Also, teachers reported that the school had given them an adequate opportunity to participate in different types of PD activities. However, the study did not find significant differences between the length of teaching experience and teachers’ academic qualifications in teachers` perceptions towards PD activities. Some studies found that teachers with higher levels of academic qualification, showed higher and increased levels of efficacy. However, the current study did not <b>show</b> <b>similar</b> <b>results</b> <b>as</b> teachers with degrees and DMIBS qualifications respectively showed no significant differences in their levels of efficacy. This indicates that having different academic qualifications did not affect the increase in teachers` efficacy...|$|R
