50|$|Founded in 1996 by Alexandra Alex Wigington and Marawan El-Asfahani, {{the agency}} has grown to provide design and {{marketing}} services to accounts throughout North America. Within 30 days of opening, Oxygen landed accounts with Westin Hotels and Resorts, TD Bank and Nike Canada. The following year the agency added several clients in high tech and retail such as AVID Technology, Sprint, <b>Syndesis</b> and Microsoft. Alexandra is an advisor to the Graphic Design department of George Brown College, which was ranked {{one of the top}} 20 design schools in the world by Business Week Magazine. In the October 2007 issue of Strategy Magazine, Oxygen was referred to as a 'hot' design agency.|$|E
50|$|Arthrodesis, {{also known}} as {{artificial}} ankylosis or <b>syndesis,</b> is the artificial induction of joint ossification between two bones by surgery. This is done to relieve intractable pain in a joint which cannot be managed by pain medication, splints, or other normally indicated treatments. The typical causes of such pain are fractures which disrupt the joint, severe sprains, and arthritis. It is most commonly performed on joints in the spine, hand, ankle, and foot. Historically, knee and hip arthrodeses were also performed as pain-relieving procedures, but with the great successes achieved in hip and knee arthroplasty, arthrodesis of these large joints has fallen out of favour as a primary procedure, and now is only used as a procedure of last resort in some failed arthroplasties.|$|E
5000|$|Synapsis (also called <b>syndesis)</b> is the {{pairing of}} two {{homologous}} chromosomes that occurs during meiosis. It allows matching-up of homologous pairs {{prior to their}} segregation, and possible chromosomal crossover between them. Synapsis takes place during prophase I of meiosis. When homologous chromosomes synapse, their ends are first attached to the nuclear envelope. These end-membrane complexes then migrate, assisted by the extranuclear cytoskeleton, until matching ends have been paired. Then the intervening regions of the chromosome are brought together, and may be connected by a protein-RNA complex called the synaptonemal complex. Autosomes undergo synapsis during meiosis, and are held together by a protein complex along the whole length of the chromosomes called the synaptonemal complex. Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis; however, the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present {{at one end of}} each sex chromosome.|$|E
5000|$|David Hertz got {{his start}} in {{architecture}} at a young age. In high school Hertz often sneaked into construction sites because of his interest in building. After being caught by a property owner, he {{was introduced to the}} building's designer, famed Los Angeles architect John Lautner. Hertz then apprenticed under Lautner for four years. After receiving a degree from the Southern California Institute of Architecture in 1980, Hertz went on to work in the office of Frank Gehry before founding his own firm, <b>Syndesis,</b> in 1983. [...] That year, Hertz developed [...] "Syndecrete," [...] a form of concrete which incorporates post-consumer and industrial waste such as polypropylene carpet fibers and fly ash, and is lighter weight than traditional concrete, and may have other waste products such as wood, crushed glass, or plastic chips added for decoration. [...] Syndecrete was included in the MoMA show [...] "Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design" [...] in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|An {{architectural}} {{historian and}} design instructor, Castro wrote that {{his goal was}} to convey [...] "both the theortical and pragmatic aspects in a holistic way". Influenced by the work of architects Juhani Pallasmaa and Peter Zumthor and colleagues Alberto Perez-Gomez and Robert Mellin, Castro used the Greek term <b>sýndesis</b> to convey both the [...] "tangible and conceptual" [...] in monographs on Canadian architect Arthur Erickson and Colombian architect Rogelio Salmona. A concern with [...] "urban topography", or architecture within its environment, is central to his analysis of the Hispanic Baroque. Castro interests also include the 17th- and 18th-century European notion of limits as well as systemic thinking and mnemonics within design. Interested in literature and philosophy, Castro's analysis of architecture or art also incorporated literary concepts. Introduced to the writings of Alejo Carpentier by his uncle Dicken Castro, he elaborated on the idea of lo real maravilloso (the real-marvelous) in the 1992 essay [...] "Thoughts at the Edge of Architecture: Solitude and the Marvelous-Real" [...] in ARQ Architecture Québec. More recently Castro included W. G. Sebald's [...] "concept of the extraordinary" [...] in A Taxonomy of Collecting, an analysis of collages by John A. Schweitzer exhibited at the University of Western Ontario in 2014. In Syndetic Modernisms, Carlos Rueda Plata wrote that both [...] "syndesis and thaumaturgy (the marvelous)" [...] informed Castro's analysis of the ceremonial path of Punta Pite, Chile.|$|E
40|$|The author {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} »Ordo Celebrandi Matrimonium«, (Editio Typica Altera, 1991) {{in an attempt to}} discover the structure ofpneumatologic »changes« in models (formulae) of prayers super sponsos. The terminological analysis and many different conceptual interrelationships are concentrated 2 ̆ 7 around liturgico-sakramental theology, asking how it is represented in »new« texts. The views suggested by A. M. Triacca as starting-point have been further developed. The sacramental readings can be seen within the relationship: sacrament - liturgical act (actio) - life in a pneumatologi-cal connection in the direction epiclesis, pareclesis, and anaclesis, explai¬ning two neologisms: anaclesis and <b>syndesis.</b> They are situated within the structure between them, Le. anamnesis and methexis. The fourth expression (<b>syndesis)</b> is new, it was introduced in order to elucidate the terminological-sakramental strength of pneumatological dynamics which applies to many cases, always with special respect for the entireness of the matrimonial ceremony...|$|E

40|$|In this research, I {{argue that}} the {{involvement}} of the participant in a digital 3 D space is of a performative psychological/sociological nature, and I employ social realist ideology to connect programmatic syntax to meaningful and political semiologic rhetoric. I call this connection <b>syndesis,</b> and I combine it with the encyclopaedic multiplicity that digital environments inherently offer to produce an abstract but stable, organic, and procedurally self-expanding model of the fashion system. The practical outcome of this research is a study in designing and producing a game that utilises dress as its exclusive gameplay factor. I call this artefact Mannequin, and in it, play progresses through social interaction facilitated by choice of dress within a semiotic/programmatic model of the fashion system...|$|E
