5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a <b>seed</b> <b>treatment</b> because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} {{was originally}} synthesised in 1825 by Faraday. It {{is named after}} the Dutch chemist Teunis van der Linden (1884–1965), the first to isolate and describe γ-hexachlorcyclohexane in 1912. Its pesticidal action was discovered only in 1942, after which lindane production, by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd (ICI), and use started up in the United Kingdom. It {{has been used to}} treat food crops and forestry products, as a <b>seed</b> <b>treatment,</b> a soil treatment, and to treat livestock and pets. It has also been used as pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies, formulated as a shampoo or lotion. Between 1950 and 2000, an estimated 600,000 tonnes of lindane were produced globally, {{and the vast majority of}} which was used in agriculture. It has been manufactured by several countries, including the United States, China, Brazil, and several European countries, but as of 2007, only India and possibly Russia are still producing it.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, several peer-reviewed {{independent}} {{studies were}} published showing that neonicotinoids had previously undetected routes of exposure affecting bees including through dust, pollen, and nectar and that subnanogram toxicity resulted in failure {{to return to}} the hive without immediate lethality, one primary symptom of CCD. Research also showed environmental persistence in agricultural irrigation channels and soil. These reports prompted a formal peer review by the European Food Safety Authority, which stated in January 2013 that some neonicotinoids pose an unacceptably high risk to bees, and identified several data gaps not previously considered. Their review concluded, [...] "A high acute risk to honey bees was identified from exposure via dust drift for the <b>seed</b> <b>treatment</b> uses in maize, oilseed rape and cereals. A high acute risk was also identified from exposure via residues in nectar and/or pollen." [...] Dave Goulson, an author of one of the studies that prompted the EFSA review, has suggested that industry science pertaining to neonicotinoids may have been deliberately deceptive, and the UK Parliament has asked manufacturer Bayer Cropscience to explain discrepancies in evidence they have submitted to an investigation.|$|E

5000|$|In agriculture, {{usefulness}} of neonicotinoid <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> for pest prevention {{depends upon the}} timing of planting and pest arrival. For soybeans, neonicotinoid <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> typically are not effective against the soybean aphid, because the compounds break down 35-42 days after planting, and soybean aphids typically are not present or at damaging population levels before this time. Neonicotinoid <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> can protect yield in special cases such as late-planted fields or in areas with large infestations much earlier in the growing season.Overall yield gains are not expected from neonicotinoid <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> for soybean insect pests in the United States, and foliar insecticides are recommended instead when insects do reach damaging levels.Health Canada estimated that neonicotinoids provide benefits equivalent to over 3% of the national farm gate value of corn and 1.5% to 2.1% of the national farm gate value of soybean in 2013 [...]|$|R

40|$|Cotton growth {{early in}} the season is {{affected}} by damaging levels of thrips in many production fields in Arkansas. During this time, insecticides used to control thrips and herbicides used to control weeds are often present at the same time on the cotton plant. This research explores how various combinations of herbicides and insecticides influence thrips numbers and cotton plant growth parameters {{early in the}} growing season. Pathways evaluated included interactions between preemergence herbicides and insecticide <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> and interactions between common tank-mixed foliar herbicides and selected foliar insecticides. No interactions in thrips control or plant growth were observed when using preemergence herbicides in combination with insecticide <b>seed</b> <b>treatments.</b> However, efficacy varied between chosen insecticide <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> and it may be concluded that in this experiment imidacloprid <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> exhibited greater control of thrips numbers than thiamethoxam <b>seed</b> <b>treatments.</b> There were isolated herbicide-insecticide interactions affecting plant growth parameters, but overall the co-application of tested herbicides and insecticides offer cotton producers the ability to integrate thrips and weed control without loss of thrips efficacy or negative impact on plant growth.

40|$|Interactions between {{herbicides}} and insecticides in {{crop production}} {{have been documented}} {{for a number of}} years. Research has shown that applications of some organophosphate insecticides at planting can reduce cotton injury following applications of the soil-applied herbicide clomazone. Additionally, recent research has shown that, when applied as <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> prior to planting, some neonicotinoid insecticides can safen rice to drift from both glyphosate and imazethapyr. Since insecticide <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> are commonly used in many crop production systems throughout the Midsouth, exploring their ability to reduce injury from herbicides in other crops besides rice is of great interest. Presently no research exists examining the potential for insecticide <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> to reduce herbicide injury in soybean or grain sorghum, important rotational crops in Arkansas. Research contained herein investigates the possibility for commonly-used neonicotinoid insecticide <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> to reduce injury from herbicides via drift and soil application in both crops, in addition to applications of postemergence herbicides in soybean that typically cause injury. Results from these studies indicate that injury from herbicide drift may be reduced through the use of insecticide <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> in both crops. Injury from seven of the eight herbicides evaluated in soybean, and three of three herbicides in grain sorghum, was reduced in at least one of four site years. Additionally, safening to soil-applied herbicides was seen in five of nine herbicides evaluated in soybean in one or more site years. Injury from soil-applied herbicides in grain sorghum was not reduced in any of the four herbicides evaluated, nor was a safening effect seen in applications of postemergence herbicides in soybean. The amount of injury reduction varied substantially among site years, indicating a strong environmental effect on level of safening. However, {{based on the fact that}} insecticide <b>seed</b> <b>treatments</b> are incorporated across a wide array of environmental conditions each spring, it seems likely that some growers will see the benefits of reduced injury following herbicide exposure...|$|R
