In this paper we present {{an example of}} application of <b>smartcards</b> {{within the field of}} electronic voting schemes. To be concrete, the use of <b>smartcards</b> has helped us to develop the first electronic voting protocol which simultaneously satisfies three properties apparently contradictory: uncoercibility, verifiability and mobility. 1 Introduction <b>Smartcards</b> [GUQ 92] are an essential tool in a number of cryptographic protocols and security applications. The use of <b>smartcards</b> normally improves the level of security offered. At the same time, the complexity of the design and implementation of a certain security service could often be reduced. In certain cases, the use of <b>smartcards</b> allows to achieve goals which, otherwise, would be unreachable. In this paper we present an example of the latter cases. In particular, we have used <b>smartcards</b> to obtain a practical solution to the uncoercibility [BT 9 [...] ...|$|R

In 2005 GMPTE announced that rail passengers travelling from within Greater Manchester into Manchester city centre can use the Metrolink service between the nine City Zone stops for free.

In 2007 TfGM rolled out new ticket vending machines, designed to accept credit/debit card payments and permit the purchase of multiple tickets in a single transaction. These were replaced in 2009 with touchscreen machines, designed with the Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress system. In October 2012, TfGM announced it was devising a simpler zonal fare system, comparable to London fare zones, and preparing to introduce get me there, the region's new contactless <b>smartcard</b> system, for use on all public transport modes in Greater Manchester, including Metrolink.|$|E

Credit was pre-loaded onto the <b>smartcard</b> at ticket machines by cash, debit card or credit card, with a minimum top-up of €5 and a maximum credit on the card of €100, and the customer had to validate the card using readers on the platform before boarding the tram and then again after exiting the tram.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Smartcards</b> are trusted {{personal}} devices {{designed to}} store and process confidential data, {{and to act}} as secure tokens for providing access to applications and services. <b>Smartcards</b> are widely deployed and their usage spans over several application domains including banking, telecommunications, and identity. Open platform <b>smartcards</b> are new generation trusted personal devices with increased flexibility. Such devices, which benefit of increased connectivity and increased interoperability, can host several applets and allow new applets to be loaded post-issuance. Such an increased flexibility raises concerns {{about the possibility of}} logical attacks that could affect {{a very large number of}} devices, and requires the development of techniques and tools that can be used to increase the reliability of platforms and applications for trusted personal devices. The objective of this chapter is to describe some applications of formal methods to increase the reliability of <b>smartcards</b> and trusted personal devices. ...|$|R
