5|$|Slow to fast {{skeletal}} TnI isoform switch {{occurs as}} an indicator for slow to fast fiber type transition in muscle adaptations. Slow skeletal TnI has been proposed as a sensitive and muscle fiber type-specific marker for <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle</b> injuries. In patients with <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle</b> disorders, intact ssTnI or its degraded products may be detected in peripheral blood as a diagnostic indicator for slow fiber damages.|$|E
5|$|To date, no high {{resolution}} structure of ssTnI has been solved. As homologous proteins, ssTnI, fast <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle</b> TnI and cardiac TnI have highly conserved structures and crystallographic {{high resolution}} structure of partial cardiac and fast skeletal troponin complex are both available. Therefore, the structure-function relationship of ssTnI would {{rely on the}} information from studies performed on fast <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle</b> and cardiac TnI.|$|E
40|$|Consumption of fat diet causes {{deposition}} of fat into <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> and alcohol increases fat deposition. This study determined effects of fat diet, wine and ethanol on changes of <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of rats. It {{was found that}} the group of rats fed with fat diet and wine had the lowest daily nutrients energy intake, the lowest average muscle weight but had the highest percentage of fat in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> and the highest burning value. Average weights of <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of rats consuming alcohol (wine or ethanol) were significantly lower than average weights of <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of rats not consuming alcohol in case of fat diet. Results of chemical analysis show that chronic alcohol consumption increases fat deposition in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> and increases their burning value in case of fat diet.

The present study {{evaluated}} modifications of fatty acid concentrations both in brain and striated <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of rats genetically selected for voluntary high ethanol intake. Three groups of rats were tracked for 10 weeks of access to ethanol only as fluid (group 1) to free choice of ethanol and water (group 2) or to water only (group 3). At {{the end of the}} period, the animals were sacrificed and their brain hippocampus and striated <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> were removed and fatty acid content of these tissues was determined. Long-chain fatty acid content increased in the hippocampus while it decreased in the striated <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles.</b> Short chain fatty acid content decreased in the hippocampus while short chain fatty acid content increased in the striated <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles.</b> The data show that brain and striated <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> differently modulate fatty acid content perhaps because these areas utilize different cell membrane functionality regulation systems...|$|R

40|$|Adult {{offspring}} of diabetic rats or SDF rats {{are characterized by}} insulin resistance in the liver and extrahepatic tissues; this insulin resistance does not worsen during pregnancy. In this study, we determined the glucose metabolic index in tissues of anesthetized virgin and pregnant control and SDF rats in basal conditions and during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Tissues comprised insulin-sensitive tissues (five <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles,</b> diaphragm, and periovarian white adipose tissue) and control tissues (duodenum and cerebrum). In addition, this study measured the GMI of placenta and fetuses. In basal conditions, SDF rats showed a slight decrease (9 - 29 %) in the GMI of <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> compared with control rats; it was not altered by pregnancy {{in any of the}} tissues. During physiological hyperinsulinemia, virgin SDF rats exhibited a 25 - 70 % decrease in the GMI of <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> compared with control rats; this decrease was not observed in diaphragm, or in adipose tissue in which the GMI was found to be increased. During pregnancy, SDF rats did not show an additional drop in the GMI of <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles,</b> whereas the GMI of both <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> and adipose tissue was clearly diminished (25 - 60 %) in control rats. The GMI of <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> was therefore comparable in pregnant control rats and SDF rats. The placental, but not fetal, GMI was increased by 24 % during hyperinsulinemia in control rats; the placental and fetal GMIs, in basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions, were similar in control rats and SDF rats. In conclusion, <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles,</b> but not white adipose tissue, are involved in the peripheral insulin resistance of the SDF rats.

5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle.</b> AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle</b> and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. <b>Skeletal</b> <b>muscle</b> contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart is}} cone-shaped, with its base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). The heart is typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the heart muscle, similar to the response of <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Muscle tissues {{are derived}} from the mesodermal layer of {{embryonic}} germ cells in {{a process known as}} myogenesis. There are three types of <b>muscle,</b> <b>skeletal</b> or striated, cardiac, and smooth. Muscle action can be classified as being either voluntary or involuntary. Cardiac and smooth muscles contract without conscious thought and are termed involuntary, whereas the <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> contract upon command. <b>Skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> in turn can be divided into fast and slow twitch fibers.|$|R

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, but also in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle</b> relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscle</b> injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.|$|E

Striated muscle contracts and relaxes in short, intense bursts, whereas smooth muscle sustains longer or even near-permanent contractions.|$|R
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} is preceded {{by the development}} of insulin resistance, in which the action of insulin is impaired, largely in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles.</b> Caveolin- 3 (Cav 3) is a muscle-specific subtype of caveolin, an example of a scaffolding protein found within membranes. Cav is also known as growth signal inhibitor, although it was recently demonstrated that the genetic disruption of Cav 3 did not augment growth in mice. We found, however, that the lack of Cav 3 {{led to the development of}} insulin resistance, as exemplified by decreased glucose uptake in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles,</b> impaired glucose tolerance test performance, and increases in serum lipids. Such impairments were markedly augmented in the presence of streptozotocin, a pancreatic β cell toxin, suggesting that the mice were susceptible to severe diabetes in the presence of an additional risk factor. Insulin-stimulated activation of insulin receptors and downstream molecules, such as IRS- 1 and Akt, was attenuated in the <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of Cav 3 null mice, but not in the liver, without affecting protein expression or subcellular localization. Genetic transfer of Cav 3 by needle injection restored insulin signaling in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles.</b> Our findings suggest that Cav 3 is an enhancer of insulin signaling in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> but does not act as a scaffolding molecule for insulin receptors...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial {{apoptosis}} and apoptotic signaling modulations by aerobic training {{were studied}} in cardiac and <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of obese Zucker rats (OZR), a rodent model of metabolic syndrome. Comparisons were made between left ventricle, soleus, and gastrocnemius muscles from OZR (n = 16) and aged-matched lean Zucker rats (LZR; n = 16) that were untrained (n = 8) or aerobically trained {{on a treadmill}} for 9 wk (n = 8). Cardiac Bcl- 2 protein expression levels were ∼ 50 % lower in the OZR compared with the LZR, with no difference in either of the <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles.</b> Bax protein expression levels were similar in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of the OZR compared with the LZR. Furthermore, mitochondrial apoptotic signaling was not different in <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of OZR and LZR groups. However, there was an approximate sevenfold increase in the Bax protein accumulation in the myocardial mitochondrial-rich protein fraction of the OZR compared with the LZR. Additionally, {{there was an increase}} in cytosolic cytochrome c released from the mitochondria, caspase- 9 and caspase- 3 activity, with a corresponding elevation in DNA fragmentation in the cardiac muscles of the OZR compared with the LZR. Exercise training reduced cardiac Bax protein levels, the mitochondrial localization of Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, caspase activity, and DNA fragmentation in cardiac muscles of the OZR after exercise, with no change in the <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles.</b> These data show that mitochondrial apoptosis is elevated in the cardiac but not <b>skeletal</b> <b>muscles</b> of the OZR, but aerobic exercise training was effective in reducing cardiac mitochondrial apoptotic signaling...|$|R
