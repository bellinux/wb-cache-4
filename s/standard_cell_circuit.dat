On-chip decoupling capacitors have traditionally been allocated into the white space available on a die or placed inside the rows in <b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> <b>circuit</b> blocks. The efficacy of on-chip decoupling capacitors depends upon the impedance of the power/ground lines connecting the capacitors to the current loads and power supplies. A design methodology for placing on-chip decoupling capacitors is presented in this paper. A maximum effective radius is shown to exist for each on-chip decoupling capacitor. Beyond this effective distance, a decoupling capacitor is ineffective. Depending upon the parasitic impedance of the power distribution system, the maximum voltage drop seen at the current load is caused either by the first droop (determined by the rise time) or by the second droop (determined by the transition time). Two criteria to estimate the minimum required on-chip decoupling capacitance are developed based on the critical parasitic impedance. In order to provide the required charge drawn by the load, the decoupling capacitor has to be charged before the next switching cycle. For an on-chip decoupling capacitor to be effective, both effective radii criteria should be simultaneously satisfied.

In    this practical paper solution is easy {{and we can}} easily apply genetic operator {{in this type of}} problem. The bin packing problem is to find the minimum number of bins needed to pack a given set of objects of known sizes so they do not exceed the capacity of each bin. Complexity is both time in space, provided size of problem an as integer (count is infinite). This problem is known NP-hard. The technique of our approach is to be design module trick. We can be realizing with self standard IC chip. Obviously we have taken into account minimum power conjunction. The solution of a circuit partitioning problem is global optimum. Like circuit partitioning is the more critical step in the physical design of various circuit in VLSI. In the partitioning main objective is to minimize the number of cuts. This chapter addresses the problem of partitioning and particular the use of the genetic algorithms for circuit partitioning. The object to be partitioned in VLSI design are typically logic gates or instances of <b>standard</b> <b>cell.</b> <b>Circuit</b> partitioning is one of the important parts in chip designing. We let, the number of bins will be needed equal to be number of genes divided by number of bins. At first the genes will be insert in first bin until the bin is not full, when bin is full then insert second bin and so on. Our method calculates the fitness value and discards solution with low fitness value. The increase in number of crossover point does not necessarily increase the fitness, as the fitness achieved depends on crossover as well as mutation probability. Especially in the paper find minimum cut size. If we get, cut size is same on generation than change the crossover boundary. This paper shows bin packing approach for the circuit partitioning using genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithm is an evolutionary optimization technique based on Darwinian Theory of natural evolution and its concept of survival of the fittest. The main advantage of circuit partitioning using bin packing are- “Initial partition is  not required,  there are no  need to encoding chromosome with block number  also  chromosome will   be   encoded   by   gate   or   node    name  with  BFS  and Any sequence”.

The proposed circuit captures {{the state of the}} signals under measurement simultaneously at random instants of time and gathers a large sample data to estimate the relative phase between the signals. By carefully premeditating the sample size, the accuracy and confidence of the result can be set to a level as high as desired.

40|$|Presently, {{there are}} many {{difficulties}} associated with implementing application specific custom or semi-custom (<b>standard</b> <b>cell</b> based) integrated <b>circuits</b> (ICs) into JPL flight projects. One of the primary difficulties is developing prototype semi-custom integrated circuits for use and evaluation in engineering prototype flight hardware. The prototype semi-custom ICs must be extremely cost-effective and yet still representative of flight qualifiable versions of the design. A second difficulty is encountered in the transport of the design from engineering prototype quality to flight quality. Normally, flight quality integrated circuits have stringent quality standards, must be radiation resistant and should consume minimal power. It is often not necessary or cost effective, however, to impose such stringent quality standards on engineering models developed for systems analysis in controlled lab environments. This article presents work originally initiated for ground based applications that also addresses these two problems. Furthermore, this article suggests a method that has been shown successful in prototyping flight quality semi-custom ICs through the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service (MOSIS) program run by the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute. The method has been used successfully {{to design and fabricate}} through the MOSIS three different semi-custom prototype CMOS p-well chips. The three designs make use of the work presented and were designed consistent with design techniques and structures that are flight qualifiable, allowing one hour transfer of the design from engineering model status to flight qualifiable foundry-ready status through methods outlined in this article...|$|R
