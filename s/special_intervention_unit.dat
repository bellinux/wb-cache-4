50|$|On 31 August 2016, {{a person}} {{believed}} to be carrying the day's earnings from cannabis sales suddenly pulled a gun during a routine arrest and shot two police officers and a civilian. The injuries {{of one of the}} officers who {{was shot in the head}} were life-threatening (he survived, but needed a long period of rehabilitation), while the injuries of the other victims were less serious. Police sealed off the entire neighborhood and located the perpetrator in Kastrup a few hours later. During a brief shootout with Politiets Aktionsstyrke (a <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> police <b>unit)</b> he was seriously wounded and later died from his injuries in the hospital. The perpetrator, a 25-year-old Danish citizen of Bosnian descent (he arrived in Denmark as a child with his family), was well-known to the police for violence and involvement in cannabis sale. Although known to be a sympathizer of Islamic extremism, this is not considered to have played a role in his actions. Police officers very rarely receive life-threatening injuries during encounters with criminals (before the Christiania shooting, the last police officer to be killed by a criminal in Denmark was in 1995) and the incident was widely condemned.|$|R

5000|$|On 26 July 2011, {{during the}} {{operation}} {{to take control}} of the border posts, Enver Zymberi, a member of the Kosovo Police's <b>Special</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Unit,</b> was killed by a Serb sniper. Twenty five more policemen were wounded, with at least one being treated in hospital for severe wounds. The KFOR Mi-17 helicopter that had moved the 16 Kosovo special police personnel belonged to the Croatian Army. Later that day the same helicopter had been fired at. An hour later 14 new Kosovo police officers and three customs officers were located in Brnjak. Though the Kosovo police later withdrew and there was a lull in tensions, some Serbian protesters returned in the evening and attacked the post.Clashes continued on 27 July after armed Kosovar police took over two border posts to enforce the writ of the central government in Pristina; ethnic Serbs burned down the border post at Jarinje. The mob, which reportedly included [...] "dozens of masked men, armed with crowbars, clubs, axes, Molotov cocktails and handheld flares," [...] as well as rocks and other debris, were said to have attacked the NATO troops who were a part of KFOR operations. Reports also suggested the troops may have been fired upon. This was the same border post that had been burned down in 2008 after Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. Following the intervention of KFOR's NATO troops, a NATO operations officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ralf Adametz, said that [...] "the situation is now under control, but tense." ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. Data {{on smoking}} {{cessation}} and relapse for 6 yers of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses {{to determine the}} relationship between variables measured {{at the beginning of}} the trial and smoking cessation and relapse for <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> and usual care participants. RESULTS. The variables positively associated with smoking cessation in both the SI and the UC groups included age, education, and past success in quitting; there was a negative association with the number of cigarettes smoked per day. The expectation of quitting was positively associated with cessation in the <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> group only, while life events, alcohol, and the presence of a wife who smokes were significant predictors of reduced cessation for the usual care group. The <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> program may have overcome obstacles which interfered with cessation among the usual care participants. Associations with relapse were generally stronger in the usual care group than in the <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> group. For usual care participants, multivariate analyses showed that education, past success in quitting smoking, alcohol, and life events were associated with relapse rates. For <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> participants, only alcohol emerged as a significant predictor. CONCLUSION. The data are relevant in terms of factors that govern smoking cessation and relapse for adult smokers who take part in formal intervention programs and for those who are left to modify their behavior on their own...|$|R

5000|$|Jammeh {{was born}} on 25 May 1965 in Kanilai, a village in the Foni Kansala {{district}} of the Western Division. He {{is the son of}} Aja Fatou Ashombi Bojang, a housewife and trader, and Abdul Aziz James Junkung Jammeh, a career wrestler. Jammeh's grandparents migrated to the Gambia from the Casamance region of Senegal. He had a rural upbringing as part of a Muslim Jola family, primarily focused in Kanilai. One of his closest childhood friends was reportedly Mustapha James Kujabi. He attended Kanilai primary school, Saint Edwards primary school in Bwiam, from 1972 to 1978. Due to his result in the common entrance (CE) exam, he was awarded a government scholarship to Gambia High School in Banjul, in 1978. His formal education ended after he received his O Levels in 1983. In those days, he used to defend the rights of many Gendarmes who {{for one reason or another}} had felt apart with the Gendarmerie command and administration and were brought to the Policefor either investigation or punishment. What actually makes him changed into the biggest violator of the human and civic rights of ordinary Gambian citizens is beyond my comprehension [...] In April 1984, Jammeh joined what was then the Gambian National Gendarmerie as a private. He was part of the <b>Special</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Unit</b> from 1984 to 1986 and was an escort training instructor at the Gendarmerie Training School from 1986 to 1989. He was promoted to sergeant in April 1986, and to cadet officer in December 1987. A former Gendarmerie officer, Binneh S. Minteh, later claimed that Jammeh [...] "had always singled out Mandinka’s as bad people" [...] during his time as a Gendarme. In particular, Minteh recalled Jammeh's [...] "ruthless and disrespectful encounter" [...] with sergeant major Kebba Dibba, and when he [...] "brandished a pistol and threatened to shoot" [...] Captain Ebrima Camara simply on the basis of their ethnicity.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{results of}} MRFIT smoking {{intervention}} program are presented for the 4, 103 <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> and 4, 091 usual care men who reported smoking cigarettes {{at the first}} screening visit. RESULTS. Among the <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> men, the reported cessation rate increased from 43. 1 % at 12 months to 48. 9 % at 72 months. The reported cessation rate among the usual care men increased from 13. 5 % at 12 months to 28. 8 % at 72 months. Among smokers who reported cessation at 72 months, 51. 3 % of <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> men and 22. 7 % of usual care men had quit smoking within {{the first year and}} remained abstinent thereafter. Average thiocyanate and expired-air carbon monoxide served as objective measures of smoking and were significantly lower among the <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> men than among the usual care men over the entire follow-up period. The reported cessation rates at 72 months varied according to initial levels of smoking. Smokers reporting 1 - 19 cigarettes per day at entry were more likely to quit than heavier smokers. For each category of smoking at entry (1 - 19, 20 - 39, and 40 or more cigarettes per day) significantly more <b>special</b> <b>intervention</b> than usual care smokers reported cessation. CONCLUSION. These results indicate that the MRFIT smoking intervention program was successful in promoting early cigarette smoking cessation and maintaining cessation over the entire trial for a large percentage of cigarette smokers...|$|R
