40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{compositional}} approach presented in this folio is the <b>sounding</b> environment. The term <b>sounding</b> environment is used in this context {{to refer to the}} whole of our living experience in the world which we might register as relating to sound. It might include everything that is <b>sounding,</b> seemingly <b>sounding,</b> imagined <b>sounding,</b> remembered <b>sounding,</b> sensed as <b>sounding,</b> composed to sound. It includes thus the actual sound environment, all that is sensed or interpreted as sound and imaginary sounds. This dissertation accompanies the seven acousmatic and the two sound installation works included in the folio. It is divided into two parts. In the first part relevant ideas and theories both from the literature of electroacoustic music composition and soundscape composition are discussed while in the second the compositional approach to the <b>sounding</b> environment is presented as applied to the works...|$|R

5|$|The Challenger {{expedition}} {{was followed}} by the 1879–1881 expedition of the Jeannette, led by United States Navy Lieutenant George Washington DeLong. The team sailed across the Chukchi Sea and recorded meteorological and astronomical data in addition to taking <b>soundings</b> of the seabed. The ship became trapped in the ice pack near Wrangel Island in September 1879, and was ultimately crushed and sunk in June 1881.|$|E
5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth <b>soundings.</b> The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent <b>soundings</b> on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
5|$|Benbow was {{appointed}} to command a squadron in the <b>Soundings</b> in December 1696.

5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy {{survey ship}} HMS Challenger yielded {{a tremendous amount}} of bathymetric data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking <b>soundings</b> by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.|$|E
5|$|In Garden Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of their breath capacity). In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous <b>soundings</b> of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E

5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking <b>soundings</b> of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but hermit crabs everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous <b>soundings</b> FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20–30 fathoms (10–15m).|$|E
5|$|In the Spanish {{armament}} of 1790, Seymour {{was called}} to service {{in command of the}} ship of the line HMS Canada, opening his commission with a cruise off the Isle of Wight. Passing through shallow water, Seymour ordered the use of a lead line to measure the depth ahead, but was accidentally struck in the head by the lead weight while <b>soundings</b> were being taken. Although little immediate damage seemed to have been caused, during the firing of a salute several days later Seymour suddenly suffered a severely adverse reaction and had to be taken ashore for emergency medical treatment. The head injury rendered him unable to endure any loud noises or bright lights and {{for the next three years}} he lived as an invalid at his country estate in Hambleton. By 1793 he was sufficiently recovered to return to service, and escorted Lord Hood to the Mediterranean in HMS Leviathan. There Hood led the occupation, defence and ultimate withdrawal from Toulon during the Republican siege of the city. Following the collapse of the city's defences, Seymour was sent back to England with dispatches but returned shortly afterward to convoy Leviathan back to Britain.|$|E

40|$|AIRS {{contains}} 2376 high {{spectral resolution}} channels between 650 /cm and 2665 /cm, including channels {{in both the}} 15 micron (near 667 /cm) and 4. 2 micron (near 2400 /cm) COP <b>sounding</b> bands. Use of temperature <b>sounding</b> channels in the 15 micron CO 2 band has considerable heritage in infra-red remote sensing. Channels in the 4. 2 micron CO 2 band have potential advantages for temperature <b>sounding</b> purposes because they are essentially insensitive to absorption by water vapor and ozone, and also have considerably sharper lower tropospheric temperature <b>sounding</b> weighting functions than do the 15 micron temperature <b>sounding</b> channels. Potential drawbacks with regard to use of 4. 2 micron channels arise from effects on the observed radiances of solar radiation reflected by the surface and clouds, as well as effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium on shortwave observations during the day. These are of no practical consequences, however, when properly accounted for. We show results of experiments performed utilizing different spectral regions of AIRS, conducted with the AIRS Science Team candidate Version 5 algorithm. Experiments were performed using temperature <b>sounding</b> channels within the entire AIRS spectral coverage, within only the spectral region 650 /cm to 1614 /cm; and within only the spectral region 1000 /cm- 2665 /cm. These show {{the relative importance of}} utilizing only 15 micron temperature <b>sounding</b> channels, only the 4. 2 micron temperature <b>sounding</b> channels, and both, with regards to <b>sounding</b> accuracy.

40|$|Vibrational <b>sounding,</b> {{which is}} a form of echo{{location}}, is a means of host location by some parasitoid wasps. The wasp taps the substrate (wood, stem or soil) and detects the position of a potential host through the returning 'echoes'. The deployment of vibrational <b>sounding</b> is inferred through the form of the subgenual organ in the female tibia in combination with the presence of modifications to the female antenna used for tapping the substrate. Vibrational <b>sounding</b> and its associated modifications were found in two families. The use of vibrational <b>sounding</b> by parasitoid wasps was positively correlated with the depth of the host in the substrate relative {{to the size of the}} parasitoid. There were also significant correlations between the use of vibrational <b>sounding</b> and parasitism of immobile and concealed hosts and between vibrational <b>sounding</b> and idiobiosis. The data suggested that vibrational <b>sounding</b> evolved under a variety of ecological conditions, being employed in the location of wood-boring, stem-boring, soil-dwelling and cocooned hosts and stem-nesting aculeates, often in situations in which the host does not produce vibrations itself...|$|R
5|$|On June26, 2005, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave well-inland over Africa. The feature was tracked via radiosonde observations from various nations {{for two days}} before being analyzed as a surface feature on June28 over western Senegal. Accompanied by scattered convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—the westward moving system featured some cyclonic flow; it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early on June29. Conflicting observations from Dakar, Senegal, made tracking the wave difficult, with surface observations revealing a clear shift in wind direction and upper-level <b>soundings</b> showing no change. Regardless of the exact position of the system, accompanying convection soon diminished and the system became ill-defined. By June30, the system grew significantly and multiple low-level circulations developed within the broader cyclonic envelope. Weather models at the time depicted a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis in the subsequent days. Gradual development ensued over the following days, though the broad circulation initially remained largely devoid of convection due to dry air associated with the Saharan Air Layer.|$|E

5|$|When sailing {{the western}} side of Spitzbergen, a blade of the {{propeller}} of the Island was damaged in a collision with an ice floe. When the engine was run, severe vibration was felt and this forced Worsley to continue northwards under sail, searching for Gillis Land until the ship reached the pack ice. While doing so, <b>soundings</b> were taken which confirmed the presence of a submarine plain between Spitzbergen and the island group of Franz Josef Land. Turning south and sailing along the northern coast of Spitzbergen, a previously uncharted harbour was found, which Algarsson named after Worsley. The ship then sailed north, still seeking Gillis Land, but became trapped in the ice. Worsley took the opportunity to create an ice dock to facilitate repairs to the rudder, which had become damaged. After two weeks beset in the ice, he used the engine to break free but the last blade of the propeller was lost in the process.|$|E

40|$|Study Type - Symptom {{prevalence}} (case series) Level of Evidence 4 What's {{known on}} the subject? and What does the study add? Most {{of the medical}} literature regarding recreational urethral <b>sounding</b> pertains to foreign body retrieval. Very {{little is known about}} men who perform <b>sounding</b> and do not require medical attention. Of > 2000 men, who responded to a urinary and sexual wellness survey, 10 % had a history of recreational urethral <b>sounding.</b> Compared with men who did not sound, men who did reported higher risk sexual behaviours such as multiple sexual partners, sex with strangers and reported more sexually transmitted infections. Men who seek medical attention for complications resulting from <b>sounding</b> should be counselled regarding the hazards of the practice. Realistic strategies for risk reduction should be discussed with men who engage in recreational <b>sounding.</b> Objective To determine whether men who perform recreational <b>sounding</b> are at increased risk of engaging in unsafe sexual behaviours, developing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). SUBJECTS AND Methods In a cross-sectional, international, internet-based survey of the sexual practices of > 2000 {{men who have sex with}} men, subjects were asked if they had engaged in urethral <b>sounding</b> for sexual gratification. We compared ethnodemographic and health-related variables between the <b>sounding</b> and non-sounding populations. The International Prostate Symptom Score and a modified validated version of the International Index of Erectile Function were used to quantify LUTS and erectile dysfunction (ED) in both populations. Results There were 2122 respondents with complete data, 228 (10. 7 %) of whom had engaged in recreational <b>sounding.</b> Men who had engaged in <b>sounding</b> were more likely to report certain high risk sexual behaviours (e. g. multiple sexual partners and sex with partners who were not well known) and had increased odds of reporting STIs. Men who had engaged in <b>sounding</b> had a slight but statistically significant increase in LUTS but no significant difference in prevalence of ED. Conclusions Urethral <b>sounding</b> is a sexual practice that is associated with higher risk sexual behaviour and carries the potential for morbidity. Research on means for risk reduction for men who choose to engage in recreational <b>sounding</b> requires further study. © 2012 BJU INTERNATIONAL...|$|R
