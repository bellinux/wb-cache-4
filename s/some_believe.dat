5|$|The role of {{cleaning}} symbioses has been debated by biologists for over thirty years. <b>Some</b> <b>believe</b> that cleaning represents selfless co-operation, essentially pure mutualism, increasing the fitness of both individuals. Others such as Robert Trivers hold that it illustrates mutual selfishness, reciprocal altruism. Others again believe that cleaning behaviour is simply one-sided exploitation, {{a form of}} parasitism.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. It {{is easy to see}} why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humanity}} and the Overlords have peaceful relations, <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant. One {{of these groups}} establishes New Athens, an island colony {{in the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The Overlords conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and intervene to save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. The Overlords have been watching them since the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the film}} was not a major success, former Research Fellow at Australia's National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl, in his 2009 book Terrorism in American cinema: an {{analytical}} filmography, 1960–2008 argues that the film reveals an alarmingly realist insight into US-Middle Eastern politics and terrorism since the 2000s, dealing with an al-Qaeda-esque terrorist organization and the conspiracy theories that <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> the US government is using the Middle East as a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it {{has become one of the}} liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. <b>Some</b> <b>believe</b> the Big Bang implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> is proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E

5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that they were on the island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids.|$|E
5|$|He {{added that}} while he regretted that his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his {{manoeuvre}} had succeeded to admiration. <b>Some</b> <b>believe</b> that Sir Boyle, who was related to Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare's true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge, {{but in a way}} that provided Kenmare plausible deniability.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{may have}} {{remained}} in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> may {{have been written by}} Maximus. It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. <b>Some</b> <b>believe</b> {{it was a}} relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious {{nature of the relationship}} with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E
5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales. Different tales {{have been told}} of the corgi's origin: <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the Dachshund breed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar {{had changed}} his approach, forming the Parti Negara after IMP {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed to shake the Alliance's grip on power. However, <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E

5|$|The Wailers were {{scheduled}} to open 17 shows in the US for Sly and the Family Stone. After four shows, the band was fired because they were more popular than the acts they were opening for. The Wailers disbanded in 1974, {{with each of the}} three main members pursuing a solo career. The reason for the breakup is shrouded in conjecture; <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> that there were disagreements amongst Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Wailer and Tosh simply preferred solo work.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she never}} wed, rumours spread that Sophia became {{pregnant}} by Thomas Garth, an equerry of her father's, and {{gave birth to}} an illegitimate son {{in the summer of}} 1800. Other gossip declared the child was the product of rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland, who was deeply unpopular. Historians are divided on the validity of these stories, as <b>some</b> <b>believe</b> she gave birth to Garth's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family's political enemies.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. <b>Some</b> <b>believe</b> that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
