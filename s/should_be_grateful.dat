He persuaded a group of twenty-five writers, headed by Washington Irving, to sign a petition {{for him to take}} to Congress, but the press were generally hostile to this, saying that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated.|$|E
25|$|The {{school in}} Karlsruhe {{was founded by}} the Grand Duke of Baden whom Gude had good {{relations}} with. Because of this fact Gude received better pay than at the Düsseldorf Academy, had spacious and rent-free accommodations and was given generous periods of leave which allowed him to travel in the summer to perform studies for future paintings. Gude served {{as the director of}} Karlsruhe from 1866–1868 and again from 1869–1870, where he introduced several of his own educational principles designed to develop pupil's individual talent. But Gude's reign as director at Karlsruhe was not without resistance to his methods, and it is this opposition that he cites as his reason for visiting the Berlin Academy of Art that as early as 1874 in search of better conditions. Because of Gude's visits to Berlin, his relation with the Grand Duke became strained as the Grand Duke felt that the concessions he had made to Gude were so great that Gude <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> and not look for a professorships elsewhere. Gude remained at Karlsruhe for six more years after his first visits to the Berlin Academy of Art, but in 1880 he decided to retire from the Karlsruhe school to take up a position in Berlin.|$|E

Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and look for something he liked that he could shape the film into. He took the job, giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the studio}} version, {{released}} on A Moon Shaped Pool, were also mostly positive. Rolling Stone and Arizona Republic named [...] "True Love Waits" [...] the best song of May 2016; Arizona Republic critic Ed Masley {{wrote that the}} new arrangement [...] "heightens the sense of desperate yearning in Yorke's vocal as he begs his lover not to leave." [...] Pitchfork named it the week's best new track, with critic Jillian Mapes writing: [...] "You don't throw true love away. You don't walk out. People who mean this much to each other wait it out, they fight. We <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> that Yorke {{did the same with}} 'True Love Waits'." [...] In December 2016, Pitchfork placed the song #9 in its list of the best songs of the year; critic Nathan Reese wrote: [...] "'True Love Waits' is an elegiac coda to one of Radiohead's most inward-facing albums and a fitting treatment to a song that many already considered a classic. The wait was worth it." ...|$|E

A review in Monthly Film Bulletin in 1958 remarked that audiences in UK <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> that the international version was shortened by 40 minutes, and termed it a [...] "rag-bag pantomime". After its US release in 1959, Irene Thirer reviewed the film in the New York Post in which she praised its [...] "striking dramatic appeal", but feared it might not be accepted by American audiences due to cultural differences. In a 1976 article in the journal Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, author Michael Gallagher found the film [...] "an amazing mixture of political allegory and cheap musical, a cross between the impressiveness of Eisenstein and the banality of Show Boat". The New Internationalist in 1999 found Nargis's acting [...] "exemplary", and noted [...] "a clever interplay—artistically and politically—between the traditional and the radical" [...] evident in Mother India.|$|E

According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British {{businessman}} of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced {{when she was a}} child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: [...] "When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> for all the other things I have". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.|$|E
500|$|Maurice Richardson, of The Observer, {{considered}} the novel [...] "the usual sado-masochistic free-for-all, plus octopuses". The unnamed critic in The Manchester Guardian referred to Johnson's [...] "sex, snobbery and sadism" [...] complaint. They highlighted the [...] "sinister... cult of luxury {{for its own}} sake", with Bond's enjoyment of branded and bespoke products, but disagreed with part of Johnson's summary that the novel {{was a sign of}} moral decay; rather, [...] "we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> to Mr. Fleming for providing a conveniently accessible safety-valve for the boiling sensibility of modern man." [...] This reviewer also conceded that while [...] "the casualties take place on a somewhat narrower front than usual, they are heavy". In April 1958, Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work, referring to both that paper's review of Dr. No and the article in The Twentieth Century. Fleming partly accepted the criticism concerning the exclusivity of Bond's objects, such as cigarettes and food, but defended it on the basis that [...] "I had to fit Bond out with some theatrical props". These included his cocktail, ("The Vesper") and Bond's diet. Fleming called these devices [...] "vulgar foibles" [...] which he was saddled with, although maybe, he suggested, [...] "Bond's luxury meals are simply saying 'no' to toad-in-the-hole and tele-bickies." ...|$|E
500|$|Worried of Clarkson being {{continually}} typecast as {{a talent}} show winner, Davis met with various producers, primarily Max Martin, and {{encouraged them to}} produce records for Clarkson in a pop rock direction. Clarkson revealed that she expected that she'll always be labeled as an American Idol winner; she remarked, [...] "I'm the first one, so it's {{going to be on}} my grave, I'm aware of that. (There's no getting away from it) so why even try?" [...] Upon their meeting, Martin presented songs he wrote with Dr. Luke. These songs include [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and a demo version of what would have been [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes". Davis wanted Clarkson to record the songs, describing them having [...] "a sharp rock edge but were still capable of being pop hits. They would push Kelly in a promising direction for her, while maintaining and even growing her audience." [...] Martin insisted that the songs should be given to rock acts, wanting to stray from his reputation for producing pop singles for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in the 1990s. Davis recalled, [...] "Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an American Idol winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song." [...] Martin and Dr. Luke eventually agreed and invited Clarkson to travel to Sweden to record the songs. Upon hearing the tracks, Clarkson was skeptical of the pop elements; and the three eventually decided to develop a rock sound, a move Clarkson claimed Davis did not approve. Davis reiterated that he was ecstatic with the prospect, claiming that she disliked it and demanded that both the songs be removed from the album. Clarkson then asserted that she wanted it to be on the record and claimed that Davis had detested [...] "Because of You" [...] instead, saying that she [...] "was a shitty writer (sic) who <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> for the gifts that he bestows upon her". Davis reiterated that he loved the song and felt that Clarkson could indeed write hits.|$|E

2500|$|Bill {{returns to}} the country mansion in his own car and is met at the gate by {{a man with a}} note warning him to cease and desist his inquiries. After reading a {{newspaper}} story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose, Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy. [...] Bill is summoned to Ziegler's house, where he is confronted with {{the events of the past}} night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy, and identified Bill and his connection with Nick. Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection, and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy. However, he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who'd [...] "sacrificed" [...] herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about the disappearance of Nick, the piano player. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle. Ziegler also says the [...] "punishment" [...] was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill, and it had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick's disappearance or Mandy's death, but he says nothing further. When he returns home, Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days.
