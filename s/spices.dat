5|$|English cookery {{has been}} open to foreign {{ingredients}} and influence from {{as early as}} the thirteenth century, {{and in the case of}} a few foods like sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of <b>spices</b> such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that <b>spices</b> were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that <b>spices</b> were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Otto Frank {{started a}} second company, Pectacon, {{which was a}} {{wholesaler}} of herbs, pickling salts, and mixed <b>spices,</b> used {{in the production of}} sausages.

5|$|In Europe, cubeb {{was one of}} the {{valuable}} <b>spices</b> during the Middle Ages. It was ground as a seasoning for meat or used in sauces. A medieval recipe includes cubeb in making sauce sarcenes, which consists of almond milk and several <b>spices.</b> As an aromatic confectionery, cubeb was often candied and eaten whole. Ocet Kubebowy, a vinegar infused with cubeb, cumin and garlic, was used for meat marinades in Poland during the 14th century. Cubeb can still be used to enhance the flavor of savory soups.|$|E

5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of <b>spices.</b> The heavy use of <b>spices</b> has been popular as an argument to support the claim that <b>spices</b> were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of <b>spices,</b> and thereby the reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E

5|$|The cuisine of the Galilee is {{very similar}} to Lebanese cuisine, due to the {{extensive}} communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. The Galilee specializes in a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur, <b>spices</b> and meat, known as kubbi by Arabs. Kubbi bi-siniyee is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper, allspice and other <b>spices</b> wrapped in a bulgur crust, then baked. Kubbi bi-siniyee could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch. Kubbi neyee is a variation of kubbi, that is served as raw meat mixed with bulgur and a variety of <b>spices.</b> It is mostly eaten as a side dish and pita or markook bread is used for scooping the meat. Since the dish is raw, whatever is not eaten is cooked the next day in either the baked version or as fried kibbee balls.|$|E

40|$|MER <b>SPICE</b> Interface is a {{software}} module {{for use in}} conjunction with the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission and the <b>SPICE</b> software system of the Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. (<b>SPICE</b> is used to acquire, record, and disseminate engineering, navigational, and other ancillary data describing circumstances under which data were acquired by spaceborne scientific instruments.) Given a Spacecraft Clock value, MER <b>SPICE</b> Interface extracts MER-specific data from <b>SPICE</b> kernels (essentially, raw data files) and calculates values for Planet Day Number, Local Solar Longitude, Local Solar Elevation, Local Solar Azimuth, and Local Solar Time (UTC). MER <b>SPICE</b> Interface was adapted from a subroutine, denoted m 98 SpiceIF written by Payam Zamani, that was intended to calculate <b>SPICE</b> values for the Mars Polar Lander. The main difference between MER <b>SPICE</b> Interface and m 98 SpiceIf is that MER <b>SPICE</b> Interface does not explicitly call CHRONOS, a time-conversion program that is part of a library of utility subprograms within <b>SPICE.</b> Instead, MER <b>SPICE</b> Interface mimics some portions of the CHRONOS code, the advantage being that it executes much faster and can efficiently be called from a pipeline of events in a parallel processing environment...|$|R
