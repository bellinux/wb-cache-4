25|$|The {{operation}} allegedly {{centered on}} a falsified conversation between Karamanlis and Strauss, a Bavarian officer of the King. They also alleged that {{a photograph of the}} former New Democracy leader Konstantinos Mitsotakis, <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> uniformed Nazi officer, repeatedly published by the PASOK-leaning Greek daily Avriani, was really a photomontage that had been fabricated in Bulgaria.

25|$|A new {{technology}} has been developed and is slowly becoming more popular with police. Called the Rumbler, it is a siren that emits a low frequency sound which can be felt. Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may not hear the audible siren of a police car behind them, but will feel the vibrations of the Rumbler. The feeling is that of <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large speaker with pumped bass.|$|E
25|$|Network Rail, the British rail {{infrastructure}} owner and station operator, has produced {{guidelines for the}} behaviour and responsibilities of railway enthusiasts at its stations.

The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her. The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication {{at the request of}} Albuquerque, who stated, [...] "My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breaking Out Is Hard to Do" [...] is {{the first}} Family Guy episode to be written by Tom Devanney. When Stewie {{attempts}} to asphyxiate himself in the supermarket, he was originally meant to state [...] "Either I was a C-section or you're Stretch Vagstrong", {{which would have been}} a reference to the Stretch Armstrong action figure, but broadcasting standards prohibited them from showing it. During the [...] "Take On Me" [...] sequence, Family Guy had obtained full rights to use the [...] "Take On Me" [...] music video completely, but animators re-produced the video {{to make it easier for}} production. Originally, a joke had been drafted showing Brian <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tabloid newspaper with a picture of Kirstie Alley and commenting on her weight, only for her to enter the grocery shop in Godzilla-like size and throw items from the shelves, but the sketch was removed to save time during the episode. The Matisse painting shown in the Griffins' dining room is only animated similar to an actual Matisse painting due to a legal issue with the paintings. The episode production staff spent a lot of time deciding what would be Lois' motivation for stealing en masse.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey walking down some {{steps onto the}} beach wearing a black bathing suit and high heel shoes, which she takes off when she gets {{to the bottom and}} walks onto the sand. Carey is seen in {{different}} shots <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cliff-face {{as well as in the}} middle of the beach for the majority of the video. For the bridge, Carey is seen in multiple different shots as she walks along the shoreline, which changes as the last verse takes place, where her outfit changes from a black bathing suit to a different style white bathing suit whilst the sun sets in the background. As the video comes to an end, the scenery has changed to nighttime, and Carey is wearing another black bathing suit with a black jacket standing against a rock-face. Carey then inscribes into the sand [...] "H.A.T.E.U." [...] using her fingers, which she underlines as the video fades to black. The video is also inter-cut throughout with shots of the scenery on the beach. Rap-Up described the video as [...] "picturesque". Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that it is a [...] "slow-mo, beachwear fashion show". He continued, [...] "Equally depressed by the end of a relationship and inspired by the scenery, Mimi spends a few minutes suggestively touching herself and staring into the middle distance. What becomes of the broken-hearted?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lewis's sister Leslie Lewis {{provides}} backing vocals on two tracks, {{while her}} father Eddie Gordon plays the bass harp and harmonica. [...] "He was ill last year, {{so we started}} speaking to one another," [...] Lewis told The Independent. [...] "There were no hard feelings. He just wasn't around. Every couple of years I'd get a postcard from the road – {{a picture of him}} <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But I thought this was the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened. But for some reason, these two people are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up, that I want to keep writing about them... and maybe figure out who I am in the process." ...|$|E
500|$|Krøyer's Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, one of {{the best}} known of his works, shows many of the Skagen artists {{standing}} around the traditional Sankt Hans Aften bonfire. He had been working on the huge painting (...) for years before he finally completed it in 1906. Marie is <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fishing boat with her new lover, Hugo Alfvén, the Swedish composer, just {{to the left of the}} flames that seem to stream towards them. Despite Alfvén's affair with Marie, Krøyer had welcomed him to the house in Skagen and appeared to tolerate their relationship. The painting is Krøyer's last major work. The preparatory pastel sketch on which it is based was produced in a couple of hours, but the painting was completed with difficulty as not only had Krøyer spent several lengthy periods in a mental hospital from 1900 but he had also begun to lose his sight, particularly in one eye. He was not altogether happy with the finished product; he thought it had become [...] "too dark" [...] and felt it did not capture the [...] "pale radiance" [...] of the sky over Skagen on Midsummer Eve. Although it is an important work in the Skagens Museum collection it is not considered to be among the best of the group portraits produced by the Skagen Painters or even by Krøyer himself. In contrast, writing in Kristeligt Dagblad, Morten Rasmussen reports that the work is considered by many to be Krøyer's [...] "Magnum Opus", representing a reflection of his own life and a tribute to the people who contributed to his success. Marie left Krøyer for Alfvén in 1902, but it was not until 1905 when she was pregnant with Alfvén's child that Krøyer finally agreed to a divorce.|$|E
50|$|Each {{level in}} the game {{is made up of}} {{rectangular}} blocks, and contains various things including treasures, enemies, locked doors, bonus items and traps. P. P. Hammer carries a jackhammer, which allows him <b>to</b> drill through <b>a</b> block he's <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to.</b> <b>As</b> in Lode Runner, drilling through more than one layer of blocks requires creating a triangle-shaped cavity more than one block wide, and blocks reappear after a short while. A block reappearing on top of P. P. Hammer kills him.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of ten {{charcoal}} kilns at Wildrose Canyon in Death Valley, ca. 1900 - 1950.

2500|$|Hirst {{designed}} a cover image for the Band Aid 20 charity single featuring the [...] "Grim Reaper" [...] in late 2004, and image showing an African child perched on his knee.

2500|$|Scott {{decided on}} the man-in-suit {{approach}} for creating the creature onscreen. Initially circus performers were tried, then multiple actors {{together in the same}} costume, but neither proved scary. Deciding that the creature would be scarier the closer it appeared to a human, Scott decided that a single, very tall, very thin man be used. Scott was inspired by a photograph of Leni Riefenstahl <b>standing</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 6'4" [...] (1.93 m) Nubian. The casting director found 6'10" [...] (2.08 m), rail-thin graphic designer Bolaji Badejo in a local pub. Badejo went to tai chi and mime classes to learn how to slow down his movements.|$|E
