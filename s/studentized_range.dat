5000|$|If X1, ..., Xn are {{independent}} identically distributed random variables that are normally distributed, the probability distribution of their <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> {{is what is}} usually called the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> distribution. Note that the definition of [...] "q" [...] {{does not depend on}} the expected value or the standard deviation of the distribution from which the sample is drawn, and therefore its probability distribution is the same regardless of those parameters. tables of the distribution quantiles are available here.|$|E
50|$|The q {{statistic}} or <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> statistic is {{a statistic}} used for multiple significance testing across {{a number of}} means: see Tukey-Kramer method.|$|E
50|$|When {{the degrees}} of freedom {{approaches}} infinity the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> cumulative distribution can be calculated at all k using the standard normal distribution.|$|E
50|$|In statistics, the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> is the {{difference}} between the largest and smallest data in a sample measured in units of sample standard deviations.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} create the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> distribution, we first use the {{standard}} normal distribution for f and F, and change the variable r to q.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>studentized</b> <b>range,</b> q, {{is named}} for William Sealy Gosset (who wrote under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Student"), and was initially evoked by him (1927). The concept was later presented {{by a number of}} actual students, Newman (1939) [...] and Keuls (1952) [...] and John Tukey in some unpublished notes. q is the basic statistic for the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> distribution, which is used for multiple comparison procedures, such as the single step procedure Tukey's range test , the Newman-Keuls method, and the Duncan's step down procedure, and establishing confidence intervals that are still valid after data snooping has occurred.|$|E
5000|$|The {{procedure}} calculates {{for each}} pair the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> statistic: [...] where [...] is {{the larger of}} the two means being compared, [...] is the smaller, and [...] is the standard error of the data in question.|$|E
50|$|In statistics, Duncan's new {{multiple}} {{range test}} (MRT) is a multiple comparison procedure developed by David B. Duncan in 1955. Duncan's MRT {{belongs to the}} general class of multiple comparison procedures that use the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> statistic qr to compare sets of means.|$|E
5000|$|This qs value {{can then}} be {{compared}} to a q value from the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> distribution. If the qs value {{is larger than the}} critical value [...] obtained from the distribution, the two means are said to be significantly different at level [...]|$|E
5000|$|When {{the degrees}} of freedom {{approach}} infinity, the standard normal distribution {{can be used for}} the general equation above. If k is 2 or 3, the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> probability distribution function can be directly evaluated, where [...] is the standard normal probability density function.|$|E
50|$|Note that {{although}} this procedure {{makes use of}} the <b>Studentized</b> <b>range,</b> his error rate is neither on an experiment-wise basis (as with Tukey's) nor on a per- comparisons basis. Duncan's multiple range test does not control the familywise error rate. See Criticism Section for further details.|$|E
50|$|Duncan's Multiple {{range test}} {{makes use of}} the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> {{distribution}} {{in order to determine}} critical values for comparisons between means. Note that different comparisons between means may differ by their significance levels- since the significance level is subject {{to the size of the}} subset of means in question.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometric}} mean and the harmonic mean {{are allowed to}} measure the central tendency, {{in addition to the}} mode, median, and arithmetic mean. The <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> and the coefficient of variation are allowed to measure statistical dispersion. All statistical measures are allowed because all necessary mathematical operations are defined for the ratio scale.|$|E

50|$|The {{shortest}} critical range, (the actual {{critical value}} of the test) is computed as :.For ->∞, a tabulation exists for an exact value of Q (see link).A word of caution is needed here: notations for Q and R {{are not the same}} throughout literature, where Q is sometimes denoted as the shortest significant interval, and R as the significant quantile for <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> distribution (Duncan's 1955 paper uses both notations in different parts).|$|E
5000|$|Also {{note that}} the sample sizes must be equal when using the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> approach. [...] is the {{standard}} deviation of the entire design, not just that {{of the two groups}} being compared. It is possible to work with unequal sample sizes. In this case, one has to calculate the estimated standard deviation for each pairwise comparison as formalized by Clyde Kramer in 1956, so the procedure for unequal sample sizes is sometimes referred to as the Tukey-Kramer method which is as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Studentized</b> <b>range</b> {{distribution}} has {{applications to}} hypothesis testing and multiple comparisons procedures. For example, Tukey's range test and Duncan's new multiple range test (MRT), {{in which the}} sample x1, ..., xn is a sample of means and q is the basic test-statistic, {{can be used as}} post-hoc analysis to test between which two groups means there is a significant difference (pairwise comparisons) after rejecting the null hypothesis that all groups are from the same population (i.e. all means are equal) by the standard analysis of variance.|$|E
50|$|When {{only the}} {{equality}} {{of the two groups}} means is in question (i.e. whether μ1 = μ2), the <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> distribution is similar to the Student's t distribution, differing only in that the first takes into account the number of means under consideration, and the critical value is adjusted accordingly. The more means under consideration, the larger the critical value is. This makes sense since the more means there are, the greater the probability that at least some differences between pairs of means will be significantly large due to chance alone.|$|E
5000|$|With {{only one}} exception, given below, each {{difference}} is significant if it exceeds the corresponding shortest significant range; otherwise {{it is not}} significant. Where the shortest significant range is the significant <b>studentized</b> <b>range,</b> multiplied by the standard error.The shortest significant range will be designated as , where [...] is the number means in the subset.The sole exception to this rule is that no difference between two means can be declared significant if the two means concerned are both contained in {{a subset of the}} means which has a non-significant range.|$|E
50|$|Tukey's range test, {{also known}} as the Tukey's test, Tukey method, Tukey's honest {{significance}} test, Tukey's HSD (honest significant difference) test, or the Tukey-Kramer method, is a single-step multiple comparison procedure and statistical test. It can be used on raw data or in conjunction with an ANOVA (post-hoc analysis) to find means that are significantly different from each other. Named after John Tukey, it compares all possible pairs of means, and is based on a <b>studentized</b> <b>range</b> distribution (q) (this distribution is similar to the distribution of t from the t-test. See below). The Tukey HSD tests {{should not be confused with}} the Tukey Mean Difference tests ({{also known as}} the Bland-Altman diagram).|$|E
50|$|The Newman-Keuls or Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) {{method is}} a {{stepwise}} multiple comparisons procedure {{used to identify}} sample means that are significantly different from each other. It was named after Student (1927), D. Newman, and M. Keuls. This procedure is often used as a post-hoc test whenever {{a significant difference between}} three or more sample means has been revealed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Newman-Keuls method is similar to Tukey's range test as both procedures use <b>Studentized</b> <b>range</b> statistics. Unlike Tukey's range test, the Newman-Keuls method uses different critical values for different pairs of mean comparisons. Thus, the procedure is more likely to reveal significant differences between group means and to commit type I errors by incorrectly rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, the Neuman-Keuls procedure is more powerful but less conservative than Tukey's range test.|$|E
