5|$|During his quest, the Kid meets {{two more}} survivors: Zulf, an {{ambassador}} from the Ura, underground-dwelling {{people with whom}} Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl {{who was raised in}} Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists ("Mancers") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.|$|E

25|$|The Mbunda {{system of}} {{traditional}} rule {{had been such}} that sovereign rule of the entire Kingdom was vested in the king who had {{to come from the}} central matrilineal line of the royal hierarchy. This somewhat limited the number of aspiring royals to the central throne. The King had absolute authority <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> made a decision his or her decision was not questioned but was to be carried out. The two main functions of a King were to legislate rules and govern the community. At the same time there was an effective, decentralized system of traditional rule in the numerous areas and localities.|$|E

In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too {{powerful}} {{to fall into the}} wrong hands again, so he snaps it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest but decides not to look for it in the hope that no wizard or witch {{will ever be able to}} own all three Hallows. He keeps the Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he might pass it on to his children someday.|$|E
25|$|The Nantucketer, {{he alone}} resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, {{goes down to}} it in ships; to and fro {{ploughing}} it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his buisiness, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, {{out of sight of}} land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.|$|E
500|$|Bob has no {{lines of}} {{dialogue}} {{during the first}} half of [...] "Krusty Gets Busted"; the character's only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finally spoke, viewers would be surprised to hear his sophisticated vocabulary. An early version of the script for [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer. For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose [...] "lamenting tones became [...] foundation for Sideshow Bob".|$|E

500|$|When {{running along}} Blackpool's beach, at 7 am, {{no matter the}} weather, Matthews wore shoes that {{contained}} lead, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> changed into his football boots, his feet felt light, giving himself {{the impression that he}} could run faster. Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was very conscious of every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, [...] "I had some very good advice and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food. Just one day, on a Monday, but I felt better." [...] The only time he knowingly consumed alcohol was when drinking champagne out of the FA Cup in 1953.|$|E
500|$|On August 30, 2012, Melton and Dunstan {{stated in}} an IGN {{interview}} {{that they were}} hired to rework Self's screenplay as they considered it outdated, being written before recent films in the same genre, such as Clash of the Titans (2010) and its sequel, Wrath of the Titans (2012). The first step will be to apparently humanize Kratos, who will begin as a mortal and still have his family, with the pivotal change being the barbarian attack. Melton added, [...] "We're going to learn about [...] and understand how he operates. So it's potentially 30 minutes... of building up this character <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> ... becomes the Ghost of Sparta, we understand him as a human and ... the journey that he's going to take." [...] According to Dunstan, [...] "with a bigger movie like God of War, {{you have to go}} quite a bit deeper into the character as opposed to a horror film". Melton and Dunstan also have [...] "big plans" [...] for Ares. Melton said they are [...] "trying to build [...] up a bit more... so that he can become a true villain" [...] beyond his raid of Athens.|$|E
500|$|The Rising of the North in 1569 saw Catholic nobles in {{northern}} England rebel against the Protestant Queen ElizabethI. The Catholic Thomas Percy joined the rebellion and supporters congregated at the castles of Alnwick and Warkworth. Sir John Forster, Warden of the March, ordered those inside {{to leave and}} the castles were surrendered to his control. During the conflict that followed, Warkworth remained under royal control. Forster pillaged the castle, stripping it of its timbers and furnishings. The keep at least did not share in this fate, but in April 1572 Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, bemoaned the treatment meted out to the Percy castles, writing to the queen's chief minister, [...] "It is a great pity to see how Alnwick Castle and Warkworth are spoiled by him... I am creditably informed that he means utterly to deface them both." [...] An attainder was issued against Thomas Percy <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came into English custody he was executed without trial on 22 August. As a result, Percy's son was passed over, but {{under the terms of}} the attainder his brother was allowed to inherit. In 1574, Elizabeth granted Henry Percy permission to inherit the family's property and assume the title of 8thEarl of Northumberland.|$|E

500|$|Since the 1940s, Khrushchev had {{advocated}} {{the cultivation of}} corn (maize) in the Soviet Union. He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of acres to be planted with corn in the Virgin Lands. In February 1955, Khrushchev gave a speech in which he advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. While their intent was to visit only small farms, the delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to insist on visiting Garst's large farm. The Iowan visited the Soviet Union in September, where he became great friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR [...] of seed corn. Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn {{in the southern part}} of the country, and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. While Khrushchev warned against those who [...] "would have us plant the whole planet with corn", he displayed a great passion for corn, so much <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> visited a Latvian kolkhoz, he stated that some in his audience were probably wondering, [...] "Will Khrushchev say something about corn or won't he?" [...] He did, rebuking the farmers for not planting more corn. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later wrote that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to please him, had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and [...] "as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was I".|$|E

But God promised the Israelites' forbearers that God would bring the Israelites into a land full of good things, including (in the words of [...] ) [...] "houses full of all good things." [...] So God brought plagues upon a house of one of the Israelites <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> would pull it down, he would find a treasure.|$|E
2500|$|Bunin's travel {{sketches}} were lauded as innovative, notably Bird's Shadow (1907–1911). [...] "He's enchanted {{with the}} East, with the 'light-bearing' lands he now describes in such beautiful fashion... For [...] the East, both Biblical and modern, Bunin chooses the appropriate style, solemn and incandescent, full of imagery, bathing in waves of sultry sunlight and adorned with arabesques and precious stones, <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> tells of these grey-haired ancient times, disappearing {{in the distant}} haze of religion and myth, the impression he achieves is that of watching a great chariot of human history moving before our eyes," [...] wrote Yuri Aykhenvald. Critics noted Bunin's uncanny knack of immersing himself into alien cultures, both old and new, best demonstrated in his Eastern cycle of short stories {{as well as his}} superb translation of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha (1898).|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the pros}} Dempsey met were George Low, the popular Baltusrol club player and Tommy Kerrigan, the {{sharpshooter}} of the Siwanoy Country Club.

Summit, New Jersey, the home of Freddie Welsh's health farm, where Dempsey trained, is near the Baltusrol club, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went to Summit the title holder {{wasted no time in}} looking up his old friend Low. Since then Dempsey played a round daily. And he intended to play one round a day, or as often as possible, until he started strenuous training, three weeks before the time of his next fight. He had developed an interest in the game, liked it, and found it a big help in his training. For, as he said, [...] "it takes a person out into the air and makes a pleasure of walking".|$|E

2500|$|Marx's {{family was}} Jewish. Groucho's mother was Miene [...] "Minnie" [...] Schoenberg, whose family came from Dornum in {{northern}} Germany {{when she was}} 16 years old. His father was Simon [...] "Sam" [...] Marx, who changed his name from Marrix, and was called [...] "Frenchie" [...] by his sons throughout his life because {{he and his family}} came from Alsace in France. Minnie's brother was Al Schoenberg, who shortened his name to Al Shean when he went into show business as half of Gallagher and Shean, a noted vaudeville act of the early 20th century. According to Groucho, when Shean visited he would throw the local waifs a few coins <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> knocked at the door he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{so-called}} Watchful Peace {{began in}} 2063 T.A., when Gandalf went to Dol Guldur and the evil dwelling there (later {{known to be}} Sauron) fled east. [...] It lasted until 2460 T.A., when Sauron returned with new strength. During this period Gondor strengthened its borders, keeping a watchful eye on the east, as Minas Morgul was still a threat on their flank and Mordor was still occupied with Orcs. But no major escalations occurred except for minor skirmishes with Umbar. In the north, Arnor was long gone, but the Hobbits of the Shire prospered, getting their first Took Thain, and colonizing Buckland. The Dwarves of Durin's folk under Thorin I abandoned Erebor, and left for the Grey Mountains, where most of their kin now gathered. Meanwhile, Sauron was not idle in the east: he created a strong alliance between the various tribes of Easterlings, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> returned he was more powerful and had many Men in his service.|$|E
2500|$|Mordred, Arthur's illegitimate son, {{comes to}} Camelot to dishonor the King {{and tries to}} gain the throne for himself. Arthur puts him {{in charge of the}} knights’ {{training}} program, not knowing that Mordred is there to destroy the Round Table in revenge against Arthur for abandoning him, and detests the idea of being a Knight ("The Seven Deadly Virtues"). Arthur begins to feel the strain of ruling England, and both he and Guinevere wonder what commoners do without any such responsibilities ("What Do The Simple Folk Do?"). Mordred, meanwhile, has devised a plan to ruin Arthur and his kingdom permanently. He enters an enchanted glade where his aunt, the sorceress Morgan le Fay, dwells in an invisible castle. Morgan has a sweet tooth, and though she likes Arthur, Mordred manages to bribe her with a large supply of sweetmeats, to build one of her invisible walls around Arthur for one night, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> goes on his hunting trip the next day, he {{will not be able to}} get back to the castle ("The Persuasion"). [...] Meanwhile, Mordred incites the Knights to remember their former days of fighting and pillaging, and turns them against Arthur, ("Fie On Goodness!"). [...] With Arthur gone, Lancelot, unable to stop himself, visits Guinevere in her chambers, as Mordred fully suspected he would. [...] They kiss passionately ("I Loved You Once in Silence"). However, Lancelot and Guinevere's affair and Mordred's machinations come to a head when Mordred and some of the Knights of the Round Table interrupt, accuse Lancelot of treason, and try to take him prisoner. Lancelot fights them off and escapes, but Guinevere is arrested, tried, found guilty of treason by reason of her infidelity, and sentenced to be burned at the stake ("Guinevere"). At the execution, Arthur watches from a distance as Mordred taunts him for his failures; he is torn between upholding his law and doing his duty as a king, or sparing Guinevere, whom he still loves in spite of everything. At the last moment, Lancelot arrives with an army, rescues Guinevere and takes her off with him to France. But in the process, Lancelot has been forced to kill some of the other knights, leaving the survivors vowing revenge.|$|E
