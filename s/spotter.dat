5|$|In December, {{the ship}} became the testbed for the Navy's RQ-2Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The drone was {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} aerial <b>spotter</b> for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter <b>spotter.</b> Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Argus usually {{operated}} about 15 aircraft {{during the}} 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or Fairey Flycatchers), one of spotters (Parnall Panthers or Avro Bisons), and one <b>spotter</b> reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.|$|E
50|$|The lifter may {{enlist the}} help of <b>spotters</b> in {{removing}} the bar from the racks; however, once the bar has cleared the racks, the <b>spotters</b> shall not physically assist the lifter with regards to actually getting into the proper set position. The <b>spotters</b> may assist the lifter to maintain control should the lifter stumble or demonstrate any evident instability.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spotters</b> {{also are}} known to work amongst each other, for {{mutually}} beneficial situations, {{even if they are}} competitors. For instance, <b>spotters</b> for two cars running together might consummate a deal for their respective drivers to pit together, that way they could re-enter the track together, as drafting partners. <b>Spotters</b> on competing teams might also arrange for their respective drivers to [...] "gang up" [...] on another car, so that they work together to improve their positions. Altercations on the track can also lead to heated exchanges among the respective <b>spotters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} to mid-1990s, NASCAR began to {{standardize}} {{the organization of the}} <b>spotters,</b> and eventually made them mandatory. At each track, a special area was reserved for the <b>spotters,</b> one with the best view of the circuit. At certain tracks, such as Daytona, Talladega, and Indianapolis, multiple <b>spotters</b> are utilized, since {{it is not possible to}} see all the way around from one vantage point.|$|R
5|$|Plagis's {{first major}} {{operation}} was Operation <b>Spotter,</b> {{the first of}} many British endeavours to reinforce the besieged island of Malta in the face of German and Italian assaults during the Battle of the Mediterranean. Malta was considered to be of vital strategic importance, and its defence was looking increasingly precarious in March 1942. <b>Spotter</b> was a plan to strengthen its British garrison with 16 new Spitfire Mk Vs, which would be carried part of the way from Gibraltar on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, then flown to Malta; the pilots would then become part of the severely depleted No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron. The team of pilots comprised eight British airmen, four Australians, two New Zealanders and two Southern Rhodesians—Plagis and his close friend Pilot Officer Doug Leggo.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} errors in Cain's citation. The action {{described}} as occurring on the 20th actually {{took place on}} the 21st (indeed this is the day on which Lieutenant Meikle—his <b>spotter</b> in the building above—was killed), and the Tiger tank he engaged was in fact a StuG III.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Bond {{admits to}} his <b>spotter</b> {{that he did}} not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the mission will be {{considered}} a failure because he did not kill Trigger, and he hopes that M will fire him for it.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm <b>spotters</b> to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the <b>spotters</b> were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) <b>spotters,</b> storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these <b>spotters</b> look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|R
50|$|Bus <b>spotters</b> and enthusiasts {{are often}} found at major bus termini, bus depots, bus rallies and {{anywhere}} related to buses. There {{are a number}} of magazines aimed at bus enthusiasts and <b>spotters,</b> e.g. Buses Magazine.|$|R

5|$|In Canada, {{a similar}} network of {{volunteer}} weather watchers, called Canwarn, helps spot severe weather, {{with more than}} 1,000 volunteers. In Europe, several nations are organizing <b>spotter</b> networks {{under the auspices of}} Skywarn Europe and the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) has maintained a network of spotters in the United Kingdom since 1974.|$|E
5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's <b>spotter</b> alerted him to a potential target, and he took aim, {{only to find the}} target—Abdul—looking in his direction. Sing prepared to fire, trying not to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul. Very shortly thereafter, the Turkish artillery fired on Sing's position—he and his <b>spotter</b> barely managed to evacuate from Chatham's Post alive.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 12 October New Jersey trained her guns in {{anticipation}} of shelling the heavily fortified and well protected Vinh caves. For the next three days New Jersey pounded the area with her 16in shells in an effort to eliminate the Viet Cong presence in the region. Aided by <b>spotter</b> aircraft from the aircraft carrier , New Jersey engaged enemy targets, setting several enemy positions on fire and sealing one cave. On 14 October New Jersey shifted her gunfire to the coastal artillery sites on Hon Matt Island, destroying one battery on the island.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{was laid}} down on 17 December 1906 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. Her {{completed}} hull was launched on 26 May 1908; she was christened after the 26th state by Mrs. F. W. Brooks, daughter of Secretary of the Navy Truman Newberry. Fitting out work {{was completed by}} 4 January 1910, when she was commissioned into the US Navy. After entering service, she {{was assigned to the}} Atlantic Fleet. She then began a shakedown cruise down to the Caribbean Sea that lasted until 7 June. Michigan joined training maneuvers off New England beginning on 29 July. A training cruise to Europe followed; she departed Boston, Massachusetts on 2 November and stops included Portland in the United Kingdom and Cherbourg, France. She arrived in the latter port on 8 December and remained there until the 30th, when she left for the Caribbean. The ship reached Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on 10 January 1911 and continued on to Norfolk, arriving four days later. During this period, future naval aviation pioneer John Henry Towers served aboard the ship as a <b>spotter</b> for the main guns. The long range of the guns, which could shoot further than the horizon, convinced Towers of the need for <b>spotter</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|No threats {{came upon}} the embassy during the day, {{although}} truckloads of armed Somalis frequently drove by the embassy along Afghoy Road. Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy. A sniper and a <b>spotter</b> were positioned on the embassy's water tower (the highest structure in the compound) and came under fire; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower.|$|E
5|$|Normally, Furious {{could carry}} only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this {{commonly}} meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one <b>spotter</b> reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart). In 1935 {{there was one}} squadron of fighters with Hawker Nimrods and Hawker Ospreys, one squadron of Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.|$|E

50|$|Usually <b>spotters</b> {{are trained}} by the NWS {{on behalf of their}} {{respective}} organizations, and report to them. The organizations activate public warning systems such as sirens and the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and forward the report to the NWS.There are more than 230,000 trained Skywarn weather <b>spotters</b> across the United States.|$|R

5|$|On 1 August 1933, Haruna was drydocked at Kure Naval Arsenal in {{preparation}} for upgrades that would enable her to escort Japan's growing fleet of aircraft carriers. Her stern was lengthened by , and her bridge was completely reconstructed according to Japan's pagoda mast style of forward superstructure. Her 16 older boilers were removed and replaced with 11 oil-fired Kampon Boilers and newer geared turbines. Catapults and rails were added to support three Nakajima E8N or Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance and <b>spotter</b> floatplanes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond <b>Spotter.</b> Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Because New Jersey {{had been}} {{recalled}} for {{service in the}} Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters {{for a number of}} reasons. When reactivated in 1967 New Jersey had her 20mm Oerlikon and 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improved electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration helped reduce the time it took get New Jersey recommissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to New Jersey involved the removal of four of her ten 5inch gun mounts {{to make room for the}} Armored Box Launchers. In addition to saving time, this also made New Jersey cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suites, and improved radar and gun <b>spotter</b> technology.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, at {{its peak}} in late 1944 {{there were more than}} 150 <b>spotter</b> {{stations}} deployed on islands and mainland territories throughout Papua, New Guinea and Dutch New Guinea. The company's headquarters moved to Nadzab in June 1944, by which time stations had been established as far as Hollandia. However, in September 1944 the Australian military decided that it would not agree to American requests for the unit to serve outside the Australian area of operations and it was subsequently withdrawn after being left without a future operational role. Returning to Australia, it was disbanded in April 1945. Many of its members received awards for their actions, with the company having the distinction of being Australia's most highly decorated signals unit of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Hardee {{was also}} renowned as a talent <b>spotter</b> {{and owner of}} clubs which gave vital early {{exposure}} to up-and-coming comedians including Charlie Chuck, Alan Davies, Harry Enfield, Harry Hill, Paul Merton, Vic Reeves, Frank Skinner, Johnny Vegas and Jo Brand, {{with whom he had}} a two-year affair and whom he persuaded to become a comedian. He hosted the first-ever outing of the new circus group Ra-Ra Zoo, who performed comedy mime to a, for once, silenced audience. He also worked for a time as the manager of Jerry Sadowitz and was an occasional promoter and tour manager for his friend and neighbour Jools Holland.|$|E
5|$|Niagara I was {{completed}} {{during the third}} week of January, and the next phase, Niagara II, was launched on the 21st, the day of the first NVA artillery barrage. The Marine Direct Air Support Center (DASC), located at KSCB, was responsible for the coordination of air strikes with artillery fire. An airborne battlefield command and control center (ABCCC) aboard a C-130 aircraft, directed incoming strike aircraft to forward air control (FAC) <b>spotter</b> planes, which, in turn directed them to targets either located by themselves or radioed in by ground units. When weather conditions precluded FAC-directed strikes, the bombers were directed to their targets by either a Marine AN/TPQ-10 radar installation at KSCB or by Air Force Combat Skyspot MSQ-77 stations.|$|E
