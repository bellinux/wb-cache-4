5|$|Demosthenes was {{determined}} to prevent the capture of the city, and went on an embassy to Byzantion, which agreed to form an alliance with Athens. The Athenians general Chares {{was already in the}} vicinity with 40 ships, and was sent to support Byzantion; furthermore, Byzantion's other allies, Chios, Rhodes and Kos also sent aid to the city. Since he still did not control the seas, Philip already faced a difficult task to besiege Byzantion, made all the more difficult by the outside support. Again, Philip's engineers set to work, and created a breach; a night assault was then made, but was repulsed. Frustrated in the two sieges, Philip now lost patience with the Athenians, and wrote to them, declaring war. In Athens, Demosthenes proposed that the Athenians <b>should</b> <b>respond</b> by declaring war on Philip; the motion was passed, and the stone tablet recording the peace of Philocrates destroyed. The Athenians prepared another fleet under the command of Phocion, and dispatched it to Byzantion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Should</b> {{central banks}} <b>respond</b> to asset price bubbles? This paper explores this {{monetary}} policy {{question in a}} hypothetical economy subject to asset price bubbles. Despite the highly stylized structure of the model, the results reveal several practical monetary policy lessons. First, a monetary authority <b>should</b> generally <b>respond</b> to asset prices as long as asset prices contain reliable information about inflation and output. Second, this finding holds even if a monetary authority cannot distinguish between fundamental and bubble asset price behavior. Third, a monetary authority’s desire to respond to asset prices falls dramatically as its preference to smooth interest rates rises. Finally, a monetary authority <b>should</b> not <b>respond</b> to asset prices if there is considerable uncertainty about the macroeconomic role of asset prices. Monetary policy; Asset pricing...|$|R

25|$|Accordingly, absurdism is a {{philosophical}} {{school of thought}} stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information {{as well as the}} vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, <b>should</b> <b>respond</b> to it. The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.|$|E
25|$|The 1993 federal {{election}} focused mainly on economic policy, especially on how Australia <b>should</b> <b>respond</b> {{to the early}} 1990s recession. The Labor Party – led by Paul Keating – had been in power for 10 years at that point, and many polls suggested a Coalition victory. However, Labor was able to mount a successful countercampaign, with the party's net increase in seats allowing Keating to remain prime minister. Hewson continued on as Liberal leader for another year, losing a leadership spill to Alexander Downer in 1994. He left parliament the following year, but since then has remained a public figure as a business leader and political commentator.|$|E
25|$|A {{few months}} after the {{construction}} of the Bábíyyih, a large number of Bábís gathered in the village of Badasht for the purpose of seeking consensus on the core spiritual beliefs of Bábism and making plans for how the Bábí community <b>should</b> <b>respond</b> to increasing persecution and the continued imprisonment of the Báb. The Conference of Badasht was largely organized and funded by Bahá'u'lláh, and Quddús and Táhirih were also major players in the conference — an event that would mark the declared independence of the Bábí religion from Islam. During the weeks before the conference, large numbers of Bábís travelled to Mashhad from around the country, angering city authorities to the extent that Mullá Husayn's personal attendant was arrested and publicly tortured in an effort to drive Mullá Husayn from the city.|$|E

500|$|This work's title, {{translatable}} as [...] "tutor", {{refers to}} Christ {{as the teacher}} of all mankind, and it features an extended metaphor of Christians as children. It is not simply instructional : the author intends {{to show how the}} Christian <b>should</b> <b>respond</b> to the Love of God authentically. Clement, following Plato (Republic 4:441), divides life into three elements: character, actions and passions. The first having been dealt with in the Protrepticus, he devotes the Paedagogus to reflections on Christ's role in teaching us to act morally and to control our passions. Despite its explicitly Christian nature, Clement's work draws on Stoic philosophy and pagan literature; Homer alone is cited over sixty times in the work.|$|E

He defines architecture as [...] "the art of translating all the immaterial structures of society – social, cultural, economical and political – into physical structures."

In connection with his BIG practice, he explains: [...] "Buildings <b>should</b> <b>respond</b> to the local environment and climate {{in a sort of}} conversation to make it habitable for human life" [...] drawing, in particular, on the resources of the local climate which could provide [...] "a way of massively enriching the vocabulary of architecture." ...|$|E

[...] According to Glazier, Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony have left readers of Angelou's autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they <b>should</b> <b>respond</b> to the events she described. [...] Angelou's depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to explore their feelings about race and their own [...] "privileged status". [...] Glazier found that critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and on her literary techniques, but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with [...] "surprise, particularly when [...] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".|$|E

Sheppard was eventually ordained, becoming a radical clergyman and founder of the Peace Pledge Union. [...] Lang believed that socialism was a growing force in British life, and at a Church Congress in Great Yarmouth in 1907 he speculated on how the Church <b>should</b> <b>respond</b> to this.

This letter suggested that if hostilities occurred, the Memorial should suspend most of its activities and reorient its focus to become a memorial to all the wars in which Australia had taken part rather than just World War I. He further proposed that the Memorial building be used as a store and for government offices during the war, and that its staff establish a war records section similar to the AWRS. These proposals [...] "ran counter to all that had been planned in the preceding years" [...] and were rejected by the AWM board in October 1939. The board did decide, however, to offer the Department of Defence assistance with collecting records and artefacts. Accordingly, work continued on the Memorial throughout World War II, though in February 1941 the board decided to extend its scope to include the new war.|$|E
