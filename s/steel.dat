5|$|After 1872, <b>steel</b> {{started to}} be {{introduced}} as a material for construction. Compared to iron, <b>steel</b> allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way {{with the use of}} <b>steel</b> in its fleet, starting with the , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876. Redoutable nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than <b>steel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Annealing {{involves}} the heating {{of a piece}} of <b>steel</b> to 700–800°C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the <b>steel</b> softer and more workable.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a <b>steel</b> additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in <b>steel</b> containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of <b>steel.</b> From that time on, vanadium <b>steel</b> was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium <b>steel</b> alloys. Vanadium high-carbon <b>steel</b> alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS <b>steel</b> is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5000|$|High-strength <b>steels</b> {{generally}} {{fall into}} three basic categories, classified by the strengthening mechanism employed.1- solid-solution-strengthened <b>steels</b> (rephos steels)2- grain-refined <b>steels</b> or {{high strength low alloy}} <b>steels</b> (HSLA)3- transformation-hardened <b>steels</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Ferritic and {{martensitic}} stainless <b>steels</b> are magnetic. Annealed {{austenitic stainless}} <b>steels</b> are non-magnetic. Work hardening can make austenitic stainless <b>steels</b> slightly magnetic.|$|R
5|$|Stainless <b>steels</b> {{contain a}} minimum of 11% chromium, often {{combined}} with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some stainless <b>steels,</b> such as the ferritic stainless <b>steels</b> are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are nonmagnetic. Corrosion-resistant <b>steels</b> are abbreviated as CRES.|$|R
5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use <b>steel,</b> instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to <b>steel</b> plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to <b>steel</b> by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce <b>steel</b> {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) <b>steel,</b> rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E
5|$|At {{one time}} the second largest <b>steel</b> {{producer}} in the USA, TCI was listed on the first Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896. However, in 1907, the company was merged with its principal rival, the United States <b>Steel</b> Corporation. The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company was subsequently operated as a subsidiary of U. S. <b>Steel</b> for 45 years until it became a division of its parent company in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Before each episode, <b>Steel</b> {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which he is going to perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, <b>Steel</b> carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring <b>Steel,</b> such as The Mark <b>Steel</b> Lectures, in which <b>Steel</b> presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} the effect of plasma {{nitriding}} on the properties of <b>steels.</b> Parameters of different grades of <b>steels</b> are considered, such as structural and constructional <b>steels,</b> stainless <b>steels</b> and tools <b>steels.</b> The reader will find within the text an introduction to nitriding treatment, the basis of plasma and its roll in nitriding.

40|$|AbstractThe dependences of low-cycle {{durability}} of 11 corrosion-resistant <b>steels</b> {{of the main}} grades on gaseous hydrogen pressure {{within the range of}} 0. 1 … 35  MPa at 293  K have been obtained. Homogeneous austenitic <b>steels</b> as well as the <b>steels</b> with intermetallide strengthening possess the highest service ability in hydrogen. Ni–Al–Ti <b>steels</b> treated for maximum heat resistance have the durability in hydrogen which is proportional to the content of Ti/Al and Ti, and is also determined by the treatment conditions. Transition materials and <b>steels</b> with unstable austenite form a group of <b>steels</b> with medium sensitivity to hydrogen. The group of metals that are catasrophic embrittled in hydrogen includes high-strength martensitic-ageing and ferritic <b>steels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hot-rolled {{plates of}} both {{acicular}} ferrite (AF) and ferrite-pearlite (FP) pipeline <b>steels</b> were reheated at approximately 600 degrees C, named as non-quench aging in this paper. The experimental result {{indicated that the}} non-quench aging caused different effects in mechanical properties for different microstructural types of pipeline <b>steels.</b> AF pipeline <b>steels</b> could be greatly strengthened by non-quench aging while FP pipeline <b>steels</b> could not be. Role of non-quench aging on mechanical properties between AF and FP pipeline <b>steels</b> was analyzed. Strengthening for AF pipeline <b>steels</b> by a subsequent simple non-quench aging without any other change in chemical composition, TMCP and rolling equipment, etc., provides a lower economical cost approach {{for the development of}} high strength pipeline <b>steels...</b>|$|R
5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of <b>steel,</b> usually mild <b>steel.</b> Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile <b>steel</b> recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile <b>steel</b> for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged <b>steel</b> is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E

5|$|Contracts {{to build}} the Fort Henry Bridge were let to the American Bridge Company, a {{subsidiary}} of U.S. <b>Steel,</b> and Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Costing $6.8million, $1.8million over budget, and taking four years to complete, the Fort Henry Bridge opened to traffic on September 8, 1955 after a ribbon-cutting ceremony with then-governor William C. Marland {{in front of a}} crowd of 55,000 to 60,000 people. The bridge earned an Honorable Mention in 1955 from the National <b>Steel</b> Bridge Alliance, a part of the American Institute of <b>Steel</b> Construction, which recognizes the best <b>steel</b> bridges of the year. At the time of construction, the bridge was only the second tied-arch bridge across the Ohio River.|$|E

5|$|Crucible <b>steel</b> is <b>steel</b> {{that has}} been melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the <b>steel.</b> The early modern crucible <b>steel</b> industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister <b>steel</b> (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E
5|$|Eglin <b>steel</b> uses a {{combination}} of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost <b>steel</b> for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield <b>steel</b> (after Sir Robert Hadfield) or manganese <b>steel</b> contains 12–14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank tracks, bulldozer blade edges and cutting blades on the jaws of life.|$|E
5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in <b>steel</b> production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt <b>steel</b> warships. The Bessemer process for <b>steel</b> {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate <b>steel,</b> but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe controlled-forging and controlled-cooling {{has become}} the main process of the non-quenched and {{tempered}} <b>steels</b> now. However, {{there is a problem}} that the unstable toughness and its lower values restrict the expanded application and the development of the <b>steels.</b> In this study, the process of the non-quenched and tempered <b>steels</b> was optimized through the micro- alloying and the controlled-forging and controlled-cooling technology. The simulated rapid cooling followed by self tempering after forging was tried to control the microstructure and mechanical properties of the <b>steels.</b> A new process of the non-quenched and tempered <b>steels</b> was proposed to ensure high strength and high toughness for the studied <b>steels.</b> The toughening and strengthening mechanism of the <b>steels</b> processed by the new process was discussed and evaluated, which could provide the fundamental theory, technical support and process parameters for the industrialized production of the high strength and high toughness non-quenched and tempered <b>steels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{effects of}} {{ferritic}} rolling process on microstructures and mechanical properties especially drawability of ultra-low carbon (ULC) and Ti-stabilized interstitial-free (Ti-IF) <b>steels</b> were investigated and the precipitates of ferritic-rolled Ti-IF <b>steels</b> were also analyzed. The {{results show that}} good deep drawability are achieved as IF <b>steels</b> are ferritic rolled in good lubricant condition; on the contrary, lubricant condition has less influence on the deep drawability of ULC <b>steels.</b> And with the decrease of rolling temperature in ferrite region, deep drawability of Ti-IF <b>steels</b> are improved, but for ULC <b>steels,</b> when ferritic rolled at low temperature, the r-value is still less than one, which means insignificant deep drawability...|$|R

5|$|Evidence of the {{earliest}} production of high carbon <b>steel</b> in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka, and in Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka. This {{came to be known}} as Wootz <b>steel,</b> produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. The <b>steel</b> technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest <b>steel</b> in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – what they called Seric Iron. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and <b>steel</b> artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz <b>steel</b> from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon <b>steel.</b> Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of <b>steel</b> technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400–500 BC.|$|E
5|$|However, despite Ohio's large {{presence}} in the iron and <b>steel</b> market, employment rates have declined in Ohio, generally attributed to weakening national economy. Between 1998 and 2005, the number of Ohio iron and <b>steel</b> industry workers decreased from 52,700 to 34,000. The Ohio Department of Development predicts the decreases will continue in coming years. The average annual salary for iron and <b>steel</b> industry workers in Ohio was $59,686, compared the national industry average of $53,352.|$|E

40|$|Abstract High {{temperature}} wear of AlCrN {{coated tool}} <b>steels</b> sliding against the ultra-high strength boron <b>steels</b> used for hot press forming has been studied. The sliding wear tests {{have been carried}} out using a pin-on-disc of configuration under applied normal load of 50 N for 20 min with heating the ultra-high strength boron <b>steels</b> up to 800 o C. Characterizations of tribolayers formed on the contacting surfaces between the tribopairs of the AlCrN coated tool <b>steels</b> and the ultra-high strength boron <b>steels</b> have been studied. It was found on the tribolayers of the AlCrN coated tool <b>steels</b> that microcracking and oxides containing Fe and Cr to increase friction coefficient were formed at the early stage of sliding wear, followed by the generation of the smeared oxide layers containing Fe transferred from the tribopair to decrease friction coefficient. This may mainly contribute to very low specific wear rate of the AlCrN coated tool <b>steels</b> sliding against the ultra-high strength boron <b>steels,</b> resulting from oxide-oxide contact between the tribopair...|$|R

50|$|HSLA <b>steels</b> {{are also}} more {{resistant}} to rust than most carbon <b>steels</b> because of their lack of pearlite - the fine layers of ferrite (almost pure iron) and cementite in pearlite. HSLA <b>steels</b> usually have densities of around 7800 kg/m³.|$|R
