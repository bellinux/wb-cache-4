25|$|Airbus {{adopted a}} new {{philosophy}} for the attachment of the A350s main undercarriage {{as part of}} the switch to a composite wing structure. Each main undercarriage leg is attached to the rear wing spar forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double <b>side-stay</b> configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10.|$|E
40|$|Landing gear related {{airframe}} {{noise is}} one of the dominant aircraft noise components at approach, so continued research efforts to reduce landing gear noise are essential. This paper describes further development of an advanced low noise main landing gear that was previously designed and tested in the European SILENCER project. The work was carried out under the current European co-financed TIMPAN project (Technologies to IMProve Airframe Noise) using a 1 / 4 scaled landing gear model that was tested in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel. A variety of gear configurations were tested including a new <b>side-stay</b> design and various modifications to the bogie inclination, wheel spacing, bogie fairings with different flow transparency, leg-door configurations and brake fairings. The farfield noise data from the tests are compared with results from a landing gear noise prediction model, transposed to full scale flight conditions and compared with the full scale test data obtained for the original SILENCER advanced A 340 style 4 -wheel main landing gear. An optimal combination of tested gear modifications led to a further noise reduction of up to 8 dB(A) in terms of overall A-weighted noise levels relative to the original advanced gear configuratio...|$|E
