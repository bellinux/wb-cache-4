5|$|Tank Girl {{was filmed}} over sixteen weeks, in three locations: desert <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed in White Sands, New Mexico, the Liquid Silver club set was built at an {{abandoned}} shopping mall in Phoenix, Arizona, and all remaining <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed within forty miles of Tucson, Arizona. Many <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed {{in an abandoned}} open-pit mine, where filming had to be halted one day due to a chemical leak. Permission was received to film the water pipe scenes at the Titan Missile Museum, near the mine, but the day before shooting permission was withdrawn. These <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed instead in a tunnel at the abandoned mine. New sets were often found by simply searching the mine. Principal photography was completed on September27, 1994, two days over schedule though still within the original budget.|$|E
5|$|After London, filming {{continued}} in Bangkok in August 2013 and in Hyderabad in September; some <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed in and near Banjara Hills.

5|$|Basil Dearden's 1961 {{suspense}} film Victim, starring Dirk Bogarde as the barrister Melville Farr, {{was set in}} Chiswick, {{and many}} of its <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed on Chiswick Mall, where Farr lived.|$|E
5|$|Carice van Houten {{was cast}} as Roger's wife Gretchen Ferris, but all her <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> deleted {{and she does}} not appear in the final cut.|$|E
5|$|Cast {{and crew}} began {{arriving}} in Florida on October 1, to shoot scenes on Dania Beach and around South Florida. That same day, Downey {{returned to the}} set after his ankle injury.

Filming in the United States wrapped on November 7 in Wilmington.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this <b>scene</b> <b>were</b> preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|R
50|$|Most cabin <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> filmed at TVB {{sets and}} most cockpit <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> either {{on board the}} A330 or the A330 simulator.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{a series}} of related shots. It is {{analogous}} to a sentence. The study of transitions between <b>scenes</b> <b>is</b> described in film punctuation.|$|R
5|$|Coastal <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed at Bass Rock {{and near}} Trancas, while other <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large gas tank, which stood over 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to the cast and crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved to be a challenge, as the cast and crew had trouble communicating with each other, with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Llewelyn as Q: MI6's gadget designer. Llewelyn was {{disappointed}} {{because he was}} unable to travel to India since his <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed at Pinewood Studios.|$|E

5|$|Quantum of Solace {{was shot}} in six countries. Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007, {{although}} at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film. Some <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy. Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007; Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle; Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March, and at Talamone during the end of April. The main unit began on 3 January 2008 at Pinewood Studios. The 007 Stage {{was used for the}} fight in the art gallery, and an MI6 safehouse hidden within the city's cisterns, while other stages housed Bond's Bolivian hotel suite, and the MI6 headquarters. Interior and exterior airport <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed at Farnborough Airfield and the snowy closing <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in Aldershot.|$|E
5000|$|The pageant {{takes place}} in the evening and is made up of three main parts. After a prologue by a child, the first <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> a Shakespearean <b>scene</b> with romantic dialogue. The second <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> a parody of a {{restoration}} comedy, and the third <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> a panorama of Victorian triumph based on a policeman directing the traffic in Hyde Park. The final <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> entitled [...] "Ourselves", at which point Miss La Trobe shocks the audience by turning mirrors on them. The book ends quietly with life returning to normal.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{depicted}} in Beijing opera as a play called [...] "Killing Hua Xiong" [...] (...) [...] The same <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> played in {{other forms of}} Chinese opera as well.|$|R

5|$|<b>Scenes</b> <b>were</b> often {{filmed in}} east London, {{most notably the}} London Docklands, with other scenes filmed in Tooting, Greenwich and Croydon.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} also {{released}} in the United States, by the New York branch of Méliès's company. During the summer of 1905, Klaw & Erlanger showed it at the Aerial Gardens, on the rooftop of the New Amsterdam Theatre. In the American release, the <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> slightly rearranged: {{the first and second}} <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> switched in order, as were the sixth and seventh. In addition, because of a renumbering, ten tableaux were advertised instead of the French catalogue's twelve, although no <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> removed. (The two prints of the film surviving in the Méliès family's archive, the Cinémathèque Méliès, use the French ordering of the scenes.) Another discrepancy between the French and American catalogues occurs for political reasons: the American catalog specifies that the protagonist is King Leopold, but the French one keeps the identity anonymous, so as not to offend Belgian audiences. Similarly, the Alps in the film are named as such in the American catalog but are unnamed in the French one.|$|E
5|$|The {{role was}} {{subsequently}} recast to Nona Gaye. Aaliyah's <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{included in the}} tribute section of the Matrix Ultimate Collection series.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The village doctor suffocates under flour {{dropped from}} the mill above. This <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> added to the script during the film's production. German censors {{requested}} that the <b>scene</b> <b>be</b> toned down.|$|R
50|$|The {{first half}} of the film {{concentrates}} on the hero's romantic, financial, and scientific struggles, starting in 1873. Most <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> set in Boston and vicinity; a few late <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> in London.|$|R
5|$|The <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{primarily}} shot in Quiapo, Manila, church <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{recorded in}} Iguig and dream sequences in Currimao, Ilocos Norte. Guillen noted {{the stress of}} recording in Quiapo, due to {{the large number of}} extras, the already crowded nature of the area and the small size of the time periods during which they were allowed to film in the church itself.|$|E
5|$|Audition {{was shot}} in {{approximately}} three weeks, which was about one more week than usual for Miike's films at the time. Scenes {{such as those in}} Asami's apartment and at a restaurant were shot on location in a real apartment and a real restaurant. Outdoor <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> shot in Tokyo, along intersections in Omotesandō.|$|E
5|$|Common Sense Media gave {{it three}} stars {{out of five}} and, while not commenting further on its quality, stated that it was {{appropriate}} for grade-school children but that some violent <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> inadvisable for younger viewers. A second Famitsu review from later in 2003 called the anime an outstanding success and encouraged readers to tune in.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the film}} was shot in Millbrook, Ontario. The {{shopping}} centre <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> shot in Tottenham, Ontario and the climactic <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> shot at the historic Eaton Hall Mansion, located in King City, Ontario.|$|R
