40|$|Abstract Background HIV {{infection}} {{causes a}} {{qualitative and quantitative}} loss of CD 4 + T cell immunity. The institution of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) restores CD 4 + T cell responses to many pathogens, but HIV-specific responses remain deficient. Similarly, therapeutic immunization with HIV antigens of chronically infected, ART treated subjects results in poor induction of HIV-specific CD 4 responses. In this study, we used a macaque model of ART treatment during chronic infection to study the virologic consequences of <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> stimulation in lymph nodes early after immunization. Rhesus CMV (RhCMV) seropositive, Mamu A* 01 positive rhesus macaques were chronically infected with SIVmac 251 and treated with ART. The immune and viral responses to SIV gag and RhCMV pp 65 antigen immunization in draining lymph nodes and peripheral blood were analyzed. Animals were immunized on contralateral sides with SIV gag and RhCMV pp 65 encoding plasmids, which allowed lymph nodes draining each antigen to be obtained {{at the same time}} from the same animal for direct comparison. Results We observed that both SIV and RhCMV immunizations stimulated transient antigen-specific T cell responses in draining lymph nodes. The RhCMV-specific responses were potent and sustained (50 days post-immunization) in the periphery, while the SIV-specific responses were transient and extinguished quickly. The <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> stimulation selectively induced transient SIV replication in draining lymph nodes. Conclusions The data are consistent with a model whereby viral replication in response to <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> stimulation limits the generation of SIV antigen-specific responses and suggests a potential mechanism for the early loss and poor HIV-specific CD 4 + T cell response observed in HIV-infected individuals. </p...|$|E
40|$|Simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV), like the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), is a lentivirus that is both immunosuppressive and neurovirulent. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) inoculated with SIV often develop a giant cell encephalitis similar to that seen in humans infected with HIV. The authors examined SIV expression by immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization in the cerebrum, cerebellum, choroid plexus, and spinal cord from five macaques with and two macaques without giant cell encephalitis. Selected portions of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) also were examined by electron microscopy. Simian immunodeficiency virus was detected in the CNS of all seven monkeys whether or not they had giant cell encephalitis. Both <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> and RNA were present in all levels of the CNS examined. Macrophage/giant cell lesions always contained viral RNA and antigen and were the only sites where viral particles were detected by electron microscopy. However, <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> and RNA also were commonly associated with small vessels, the choroid plexus, and meninges; these were the only locations where virus was detected in animals without giant cell encephalitis. Immunophenotyping showed that the cellular infiltrates consisted primarily of monocyte/macrophages and occasional CD 8 -positive T cells. Macrophages and T cells also were present in the stroma of the choroid plexus and were intimately associated with vessels in the CNS of SIV-infected but not uninfected macaques.

SIV-free animals without pre-existing anti-SIV immune responses are generally needed to evaluate the effect of vaccine-induced immune responses against the vaccine epitopes. Here, in order to select such animals for vaccine studies, we screened 108 naïve female Mauritian cynomolgus macaques for natural (baseline) antibodies to <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens</b> using a Bio-Plex multiplex system. The antigens included twelve 20 mer peptides overlapping the twelve SIV protease cleavage sites (- 10 /+ 10), respectively (PCS peptides), and three non-PCS Gag or Env peptides. Natural antibodies to <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens</b> were detected in subsets of monkeys. The antibody reactivity to SIV was further confirmed by Western blot using purified recombinant SIV Gag and Env proteins. As expected, the immunization of monkeys with PCS antigens elicited anti-PCS antibodies. However, unexpectedly, antibodies to non-PCS peptides were also induced, as shown by both Bio-Plex and Western blot analyses, while the non-PCS peptides do not share sequence homology with PCS peptides. The presence of natural and vaccine cross-inducible SIV antibodies in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques {{should be considered in}} animal selection, experimental design and result interpretation, for their best use in HIV vaccine research...|$|R

With B- 5 fixative, viral antigens were readily detected in lymph nodes of 8 of 13 patients with follicular hyperplasia, but in only 1 of 12 patients with follicular atrophy. Antigen was detected in follicular dendritic reticular cells and rare blastlike cells, extracellularly, and in postcapillary venules, medullary lymphocytes, sinus histiocytes, and macrophages in some lymph nodes. In the brain at autopsy, antigen {{could be found}} in gliomesenchymal-cell nodules, astrocytes, vascular endothelial cells, multinucleated cells, and astrocytes and macrophages associated with demyelination. In contrast, 4 rhesus monkeys with experimental SIV infection had abundant antigen in sinus histiocytes, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells of lymph nodes and spleen and in thymic epithelial cells. Brain lesions of monkeys resembled those of humans, with antigen found in macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Antibodies to HIV also were immunoreactive in formalin-fixed tissue sections of monkeys containing <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens.</b> The ABC technique provided a fast and efficient method for localizing HIV and <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens</b> in fixed surgical and autopsy specimens.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection causes profound impairment of CD 4 + T cell immunity. Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) restores CD 4 + T cell responses to common antigens, but HIV-specific responses remain deficient. The immunization of chronically HIV infected, ART treated subjects also leads to poor HIV-specific CD 4 + T cell responses. The mechanisms {{are not fully}} understood. In this thesis, I demonstrate that HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env), when delivered {{in the form of}} a vaccine or when present on free viral particles, suppresses antigen-stimulated CD 4 + T cell proliferation. I investigate the potential involvement of human T regulatory cells (Treg) using an in vitro model system. I show that Env exposure neither changes the frequency nor the suppressive activity of Treg cells in human PBMC, and that Env-induced suppression of CD 4 + T cell proliferation is independent of Tregs. The studies of HIV-induced inhibition of CD 4 + T cell immunity were then moved to an in vivo model to determine physiological significance.

40|$|The simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) -rhesus macaque model of heterosexual human {{immunodeficiency virus}} transmission consists of atraumatic application of cell-free SIVmac onto the intact vaginal mucosa of mature female rhesus macaques. This procedure results in systemic infection, and eventually infected animals develop the clinical signs and pathologic changes of simian AIDS. To achieve 100 % transmission with the virus stocks used to date, multiple intravaginal inoculations are required. The current titration study utilized two stocks of SIVmac and demonstrated that a single intravaginal dose of cell-free SIV can reliably produce infection in rhesus macaques. This study also demonstrated that some animals intravaginally inoculated with cell-free SIVmac develop transient viremia characterized by a limited ability to isolate virus from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and lymph node mononuclear cells and no seroconversion to <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen.</b> SIV could be isolated from the peripheral lymph nodes of transiently viremic animals only during periods of viremia and not at times when SIV was not detected in circulating mononuclear cells. Thus, peripheral lymphoid tissues were not reservoirs of infection in the transiently viremic animals. Taken together, these results suggest either that the SIV infection was cleared in the transiently viremic animals or that SIV infection is limited to a compartment of the genital mucosal immune system that cannot be assessed by monitoring SIV infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peripheral lymphoid tissue...|$|E

Experiments were conducted to determine whether virally induced immune activation might promote the induction of apoptosis in GALT during acute SIVsmmPBj 14 infection. In situlabeling studies revealed {{a significant increase in}} the number of apoptotic cells within GALT from macaques with acute SIVsmmPBj 14 infection, compared to (i) other tissues from the same animals, (ii) GALT from virus-negative animals, or (iii) GALT from macaques that were sacrificed soon after infection with SIVmac 239, which does not cause acutely lethal enteropathy. These findings were confirmed by biochemical assays of DNA fragmentation, using DNA laddering and ELISA techniques. Immunostaining experiments revealed a strong positive correlation between the extent of apoptosis and the degree of immune activation, as assessed either by the number of cells which contained nuclear (activated) RelA, or by the number of cells immunoreactive for CD 25, a T-cell activation marker. Additional analyses of <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> expression revealed that the majority of the apoptotic cells were not productively infected by SIV (i. e., that they were bystander cells). Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that SIVsmmPBj 14 efficiently induces immune activation and that this results in extensive apoptosis within gut-associated lymphoid tissue during acute viral infection...|$|E

In this study, recombinant simian varicella viruses (rSVV) expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (env, gp 130) and gag antigens were constructed. Expression of the SIV env and gag transcripts and antigens in rSVV-infected Vero cells was confirmed. The rSVV-SIVenv and rSVV-SIVgag viruses replicated as efficiently as wild-type SVV in cell culture. The immunogenicity of rSVV-SIVenv and rSVV-SIVgag was investigated in immunized vervet monkeys.

All macaques were positive for SIV. Control macaques inoculated with heat-inactivated virus were consistently negative for SIV. SIV DNA was detected in the rectum as early as four hours post infection by nested PCR for gag in many laser-microdissected samples of lymphoid aggregates and lamina propria but never in follicle-associated epithelium. Scarce <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> positive cells were observed by immunohistofluorescence in the rectum, among intraepithelial and lamina propria cells as well as in clusters in lymphoid aggregates, four hours post infection and onwards. These cells were T cells and non-T cells that were not epithelial cells, CD 68 (+) macrophages, DC-SIGN(+) cells or fascin(+) dendritic cells. DC-SIGN(+) cells carried infectious virus.

This study evaluated the temporal development of antibodies to SIV in the parotid saliva of macaques inoculated with the virus and compared these findings {{with the development of}} antibodies to SIV in the animals' sera. Three animals (ages, 14, 18, and 18 years) were inoculated with the macrophagetropic strain SIVmac 239. Prior to inoculation and at consecutive weekly intervals during a four-week period following the initial virus inoculations, parotid saliva and serum were collected from each animal. A fourth animal (age, 9 years) served as a negative control, and the fifth and sixth animals (ages, 2 and 22 years) served as positive controls (6 and 18 months postinoculation, respectively) with SIVmac 239. Saliva and serum samples were reacted against <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> in Western blots (immunoblots) prepared in the standard fashion to determine the presence of antibodies. The reactions of these antigen-antibody complexes with biotinylated anti-human immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, and IgG and biotinylated anti-human secretory component (SC) determined the class of antibody present or the presence of SC in the original parotid saliva or serum samples. In infected animals, the IgM to SIV was detectable in serum and saliva at 13 days, and antiviral IgA and IgG in serum and saliva were detectable at 20 to 27 days postinoculation. The antibody to SC reacted to saliva from only two animals at 20 and 27 days, and long-term positive controls were positive for SC in saliva, indicating that either secretory IgA or secretory IgM was present in these samples. Antibodies to SIVmac 239 antigens have therefore been detected in saliva as early as 13 days postinfection.

40|$|Neurological {{dysfunction}} {{has been}} shown to be associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The incidence of these abnormalities is greater in HIV-infected children when compared with adults, and the patterns of neurological disease are also known to differ from those observed in the adult population. The reasons for these differences are unclear but are most likely related to the immaturity of the host's immune and central nervous systems at the time of infection. This is thought to be particularly true for infants infected with HIV prenatally. To examine these questions, the brains of fetal rhesus macaques that were infected with SIVmac 251 at various time points in utero were examined. Direct fetal inoculations were performed on gestational day (GD) 65 (n = 8; early second trimester), GD 110 (n = 4; early third trimester) and GD 130 (n = 2; mid third trimester), with harvest of fetal tissues on GD 80, 100, 130, or 145. Eleven sham controls were included with harvest at correlative time points. Specimens were examined by routine histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization to localize viral antigens and SIV nucleic acid. Histologically, scattered glial nodules, spongiosis, and mineralization were found in the basal ganglia and deep white matter in 4 of the 14 fetuses (3 inoculated on GD 65 and one on GD 110). These fetuses and those without histological lesions had viral nucleic acid and <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> in the stroma of the choroid plexus, meninges, and external granular layer of the cerebellum and in columns of cells in the cortical plate. In contrast to juvenile and adult macaques, very few SIV-positive perivascular mononuclear cells were present. These findings suggest that SIV has a different distribution in the brain of fetal macaques after direct infection when compared with adult or juvenile animals. Furthermore, the results of these studies suggest that differences in neurological disease between pediatric and adult patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome are most likely related to the time of infection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pigs are {{considered}} susceptible to influenza A virus infections from different host origins because earlier {{studies have shown}} that they have receptors for both avian (sialic acid-alpha- 2, 3 -terminal saccharides (SA-alpha- 2, 3)) and swine/human (SA-alpha- 2, 6) influenza viruses in the upper respiratory tract. Furthermore, experimental and natural infections in pigs have been reported with influenza A virus from avian and human sources. Methods This study investigated the receptor distribution in the entire respiratory tract of pigs using specific lectins Maackia Amurensis (MAA) I, and II, and Sambucus Nigra (SNA). Furthermore, the predilection sites of swine influenza virus (SIV) subtypes H 1 N 1 and H 1 N 2 as well as avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H 4 N 6 were investigated in the respiratory tract of experimentally infected pigs using immunohistochemical methods. Results <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> was widely distributed in bronchi, but was also present in epithelial cells of the nose, trachea, bronchioles, and alveolar type I and II epithelial cells in severely affected animals. AIV was found in the lower respiratory tract, especially in alveolar type II epithelial cells and occasionally in bronchiolar epithelial cells. SA-alpha- 2, 6 was the predominant receptor in all areas of the respiratory tract with an average of 80 - 100 % lining at the epithelial cells. On the contrary, the SA-alpha- 2, 3 was not present (0 %) at epithelial cells of nose, trachea, and most bronchi, but was found in small amounts in bronchioles, and in alveoli reaching an average of 20 - 40 % at the epithelial cells. Interestingly, the receptor expression of both SA-alpha- 2, 3 and 2, 6 was markedly diminished in influenza infected areas compared to non-infected areas. Conclusions A difference in predilection sites between SIV and AIV virus was found, and this difference was in accordance with the distribution of the SA-alpha- 2, 6 and SA-alpha- 2, 3 receptor, respectively. The results indicated that the distribution of influenza A virus receptors in pigs are similar to that of humans and therefore challenge the theory that the pig acts as a mixing vessel between human and avian influenza viruses. Furthermore, it was shown that AIV prefers to infect alveolar type II epithelial cells in pigs. This corresponds with findings in humans emphasising the resemblance between the two species. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} a {{therapeutic}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine is urgent for {{the control of the}} acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. The variability of the virus as well as its ability to undergo escape mutations in T cell epitopes are important obstacles facing the development of an AIDS vaccine. Consequently, a powerful strategy would be the induction of robust antigen specific T cell responses targeting patient-specific virus sequences expressed during the course of infection. An attractive vaccine approach to achieve this is the use of dendritic cells (DC) transfected with in vitro transcribed mRNA encoding autologous virus sequences. The rhesus macaque model provides an ideal preclinical setting to test the therapeutic potential of DC-based vaccination. We hypothesize that optimal antigen presentation and stimulation of potent T cell responses could be achieved by loading DC from SIV-infected macaques with mRNA encoding virus-derived sequences isolated during the course of infection. This represents a powerful strategy for the generation of a potential therapeutic AIDS vaccine. In support of our hypothesis, we generated the following evidence: (1) nucleofection is a superior method for efficient transfection of human and monkey monocyte-derived DC with DNA and mRNA to conventional electroporation and lipofection; (2) nucleofection of DC with mRNA led to better protein expression and DC maturation as compared to DNA transfection; (3) mRNA nucleofection of DC resulted in rapid and sustained gene expression, a critical factor in DC-based immunotherapy for durable antigen presentation; (4) nucleofection of monkey monocyte-derived DC with wild-type non codon-optimized gag mRNA was efficiently expressed and induced strong antigen-specific T cell responses whereas DNA transfection led to non-specific T cell stimulation; (5) enhanced CD 4 + T cell responses were observed when Gag was redirected to the lysosomal pathway via the targeting signal of the lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP- 1) following nucelofection of DC with mRNA; (6) rhesus DC transfected with lysosome-targeted gag mRNA encoding an escape mutation in an immunodominant CTL epitope stimulated CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses of almost equivalent magnitude directed towards undefined epitopes outside of the mutated region; (7) gag or env mRNA transfected-DC from SIV-infected macaques stimulated significant antigen-specific T cell responses in an entirely autologous system; (8) DC cotransfected with gag mRNA as well as mRNA encoding CD 70 or OX 40 L did not result in enhanced immunostimulatory functions. HIV/AIDS is a significant public health problem demanding action. This work demonstrates that mRNA-transfected DC expressing <b>SIV</b> <b>antigen</b> from infected monkeys stimulate broad and relevant T cell responses, thus supporting this approach for the generation of a therapeutic HIV vaccine to decrease the burden associated with the infection...|$|E

To explore whether a natural pathway to the inductive site of the mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue could be exploited for atraumatic immunization purposes, replication-deficient viral vector vaccines were sprayed directly onto the tonsils of rhesus macaques. Tonsillar immunization with viral vector vaccines encoding simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> <b>antigens</b> induced cellular and humoral immune responses. Viral RNA levels after a stringent SIV challenge were reduced, providing a level of protection similar to that observed after systemic immunization with the same vaccines.

40|$|Given {{the dual}} role of CD 4 T cells as both immune effectors and targets for HIV infection, {{the balance of}} CD 4 versus CD 8 T cell-mediated {{responses}} induced by candidate AIDS vaccines may be critical in determining postvaccination infection outcomes.

The tolerogenic vaccine induced MHC-Ib/E-restricted CD 8 (+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppressed SIV-harboring CD 4 (+) T cell activation and ex vivo SIV replication in 15 of 16 animals without inducing SIV-specific antibodies or cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

40|$|SummaryEfforts {{to develop}} a vaccine against HIV have so far met with limited success. Given that CD 4 + T cell {{activation}} drives the initial burst of viral replication, we explored in macaques whether an oral vaccine comprised of Lactobacillus plantarum, a commensal bacterium that favors immune tolerance, and inactivated simian immunodeficiency virus mac 239 (SIVmac 239) would induce CD 4 + T cell unresponsiveness/tolerance toward <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens</b> and thereby prevent the establishment of SIV infection. The tolerogenic vaccine induced MHC-Ib/E-restricted CD 8 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppressed SIV-harboring CD 4 + T cell activation and ex vivo SIV replication in 15 of 16 animals without inducing SIV-specific antibodies or cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Of 16 macaques that were intrarectally challenged with SIVmac 239 or heterologous strain SIVB 670, 15 were sterilely protected.

40|$|While {{mycobacteria}} {{have been}} proposed as vaccine vectors because of their persistence and safety, little has been done systematically to optimize their immunogenicity in nonhuman primates. We successfully generated recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG (rBCG) expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag and Pol as multigenic, nonintegrating vectors, but rBCG-expressing SIV Env was unstable. A dose and route determination study in rhesus monkeys revealed that intramuscular administration of rBCG was associated with local reactogenicity, whereas intravenous and intradermal administration of 106 to 108 CFU of rBCG was well tolerated. After single or repeat rBCG inoculations, monkeys developed high-frequency gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot responses against BCG purified protein derivative. However, the same animals developed only modest SIV-specific CD 8 + T-cell responses. Nevertheless, high-frequency SIV-specific cellular responses were observed in the rBCG-primed monkeys after boosting with recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd 5) expressing the <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens.</b> These cellular responses were of greater magnitude and more persistent than those generated after vaccination with rAd 5 alone. The vaccine-elicited cellular responses were predominantly polyfunctional CD 8 + T cells. These findings support the further exploration of mycobacteria as priming vaccine vectors...|$|R
40|$|Induction of virus-specific CD 8 + {{cytotoxic}} T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses is {{a promising}} strategy for AIDS vaccine development. However, {{it has remained}} unclear if or how long-term viral containment and disease control are attainable by CTL-based nonsterile protection. Here, we present three rhesus macaques that successfully maintained Env-independent vaccine-based control of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mac 239 replication without disease progression for more than 3 years. SIV-specific neutralizing antibody induction was inefficient in these controllers. Vaccine-induced Gag-specific CTLs were crucial for the chronic {{as well as the}} primary viral control in one of them, whereas those Gag-specific CTL responses became undetectable and CTLs specific for <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens</b> other than Gag, instead, became predominant in the chronic phase in the other two controllers. A transient CD 8 + cell depletion experiment 3 years postinfection resulted in transient reappearance of plasma viremia in these two animals, suggesting involvement of the SIV non-Gag-specific CTLs in the chronic SIV control. This sustained, neutralizing antibody-independent viral control was accompanied with preservation of central memory CD 4 + T cells in the chronic phase. Our results suggest that prophylactic CTL vaccine-based nonsterile protection can result in long-term viral containment by adapted CTL responses for AIDS prevention...|$|R

Previous studies using this system {{showed that a}} live poliovirus vector expressing a foreign antigen between the structural and nonstructural proteins generates both antibody and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in mice. Here we describe a novel in vitro method of cloning recombinant polioviruses involving a hybrid-PCR approach. We report the construction of recombinant vectors of two different serotypes of poliovirus-expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> <b>antigens</b> and the intranasal and intravenous inoculations of four adult cynomolgus macaques with these poliovirus vectors expressing the SIV proteins p 17 gag and gp 41 env. All macaques generated a mucosal anti-SIV immunoglobulin A (IgA) response in rectal secretions. Two of the four macaques generated mucosal antibody responses detectable in vaginal lavages. Strong serum IgG responses lasting for at least 1 year were detected {{in two of the}} four monkeys. SIV-specific T-cell lymphoproliferative responses were detected in three of the four monkeys. SIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes were detected in two of the four monkeys. This is the first report of poliovirus-elicited vaginal IgA or cytotoxic T lymphocytes in any naturally infectable primate, including humans.

Analysis of CD 4 + T cells puri®ed from SIV-stimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} of immunized macaques revealed that Th 2 cytokine production gradually increased after the second and third TLN immunization.

40|$|Most DNA-encoded {{adjuvants}} enhance immune {{responses to}} DNA vaccines in small animals but are less effective in primates. Here, we characterize the adjuvant {{activity of the}} catalytic A 1 domain of cholera toxin (CTA 1) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (<b>SIV)</b> <b>antigens</b> in mice and macaques delivered by GeneGun. The inclusion of CTA 1 with SIVmac 239 Gag dramatically enhanced anti-Gag antibody responses in mice. The adjuvant effects of CTA 1 for the secreted antigen HIV gp 120 were much less pronounced than those for Gag, as the responses to gp 120 were high {{in the absence of}} an adjuvant. CTA 1 was a stronger adjuvant for Gag than was granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and it also displayed a wider dose range than GM-CSF in mice. In macaques, CTA 1 modestly enhanced the antibody responses to SIV Gag but potently primed for a recombinant Gag protein boost. The results of this study show that CTA 1 is a potent adjuvant for SIV Gag when delivered by GeneGun in mice and that CTA 1 provides a potent GeneGun-mediated DNA prime for a heterologous protein boost in macaques. Most DNA vaccines have translated poorly from mice to primates. The exact reasons for this loss of potency are not fully elucidated.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{if there is an}} association between the isotype of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) –specific B cell responses and the profile of Th 1 and Th 2 cytokine expression, rhesus macaques were immunized with <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens</b> via the iliac lymph nodes, using a targeted lymph node (TLN) immunization procedure. When CD 4 / T cells purified from antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed, the levels of Th 2 cytokine production were gradually increased after the second and third immunizations. However, interferon-g production did not change. Analy-sis of SIV-specific B cell responses revealed that the main isotype was IgG after the second and third immunizations. In addition, a peak of SIV-specific IgA B cell responses was noted following the third immunization. These findings suggest that the induction of Th 2 type responses in TLN-immunized rhesus macaques reflects the sequence of initial induction of SIV-specific IgG-producing cells followed by IgA-secreting cells. The natural route of transmission of human immunodefi- mucosal (e. g., genitourinary tract) and the systemic (e. g., drain-ing lymph nodes, spleen, and the blood circulation) immuneciency virus (HIV) appears to be sexual contact via the mucosal compartments.

40|$|Recombinant polioviruses expressing foreign antigens {{may provide}} a {{convenient}} vaccine vector to engender mucosal immunity. Replication-competent chimeric viruses can be constructed by fusing foreign antigenic sequences to several positions within the poliovirus polyprotein. Artificial cleavage sites ensure appropriate proteolytic processing of the recombinant polyprotein, yielding mature and functional viral proteins. To study {{the effect of the}} position of insertion, two different recombinant polioviruses were examined. A small amino-terminus insertion delayed virus maturation and produced a thermosensitive particle. In contrast, insertion at the junction between the P 1 and P 2 regions yielded a chimeric poliovirus that replicated like the wild type. Eight different chimeras were constructed by inserting simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) sequences at the P 1 /P 2 junction. All recombinant viruses replicated with near-wild-type efficiency in tissue culture cells and expressed high levels of the <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens.</b> One of the inserted fragments corresponding to gp 41 envelope protein was N-glycosylated but was not secreted. Inserted sequences were only partially retained after few rounds of replication in HeLa cells. This problem could be remedied to some extent by altering the sequences flanking the insertion point. Reducing the homology of the direct repeats by 37 % decrease the propensity of the recombinant viruses to delete the insert. To determine the immunogenic potential of the recombinants, mice susceptible to poliovirus infection were inoculated intraperitoneally. The antibody titers elicited against Ga...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{indirect}} evidence suggests the male genital tract {{as a possible}} source of persistent HIV shedding in semen during antiretroviral therapy, this phenomenon is poorly understood due {{to the difficulty of}} sampling semenproducing organs in HIV+ asymptomatic individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a range of molecular and cell biological techniques, this study investigates SIV infection within reproductive organs of macaques during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. We demonstrate {{for the first time the}} presence of SIV in the testes, epididymides, prostate and seminal vesicles as early as 14 days postinoculation. This infection persists throughout the chronic stage and positively correlates with blood viremia. The prostate and seminal vesicles appear to be the most efficiently infected reproductive organs, followed by the epididymides and testes. Within the male genital tract, mostly T lymphocytes and a small number of germ cells harbour <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens</b> and RNA. In contrast to the other organs studied, the testis does not display an immune response to the infection. Testosteronemia is transiently increased during the early phase of the infection but spermatogenesis remains unaffected.

40|$|Foreskin is the {{principal}} site of heterosexual HIV- 1 infection in men. However, {{little is known about}} HIV- 1 -specific immune responses or inflammation in foreskin. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have assessed immune responses to candidate HIV- 1 vaccines in foreskin. Using the rhesus monkey model, we show that intramuscular immunization with adenovi-rus serotype 26 and 35 vectors expressing <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens</b> elicited durable <b>SIV</b> Gag-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T cell responses in foreskin that were detectable for more than 1 year following vaccination. Gag-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T cells were also detect-able in foreskin of SIV- and SHIV-infected animals and were at least comparable in magnitude to those in peripheral blood. However, unlike peripheral blood T cells, the majority of foreskin T cells exhibited transitional memory or effector memory phe-notype and expressed higher levels of the activationmarkers CD 69, HLA-DR, and CCR 5, although vaccination did not further enhance foreskin CD 4 T cell activation. These findings suggest that systemic vaccination strategies can elicit potentially impor-tant SIV-specific cellular immunity in foreskin. Further characterization of vaccine-elicited immune responses and inflamma-tion in foreskin is warranted.

Lu, B. Brosio, M. Lafaile, J. Li, R. G. Collman, J. Sodroski, and C. J. Miller, J. Virol. 70 : 3045 - 3050, 1996). A total of five rhesus macaques have each been infected {{by exposure to}} at least three intravaginal inoculations of SHIV 89. 6. The SHIV 89. 6 infection {{is characterized by a}} transient viremia that evokes humoral and cellular immune responses to HIV and <b>SIV</b> <b>antigens,</b> but disease does not develop in animals infected with SHIV 89. 6. To determine if a previous infection with SHIV 89. 6 by vaginal inoculation could protect animals from vaginal challenge with pathogenic SIV, all five animals were intravaginally inoculated twice with pathogenic SIV-mac 239. After challenge, all of the SHIV-immunized animals had low or undetectable viral RNA levels in plasma compared to control animals. Three of the five of the SHIV-immunized animals remained virus isolation negative for more than 8 months, while two became virus isolation positive. The presence of SIV Gag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and SIV-specific antibodies in cervicovaginal secretions at the time of challenge was associated with resistance to pathogenic SIV infection after vaginal challenge. These results suggest that protection from sexual transmission of HIV may be possible by effectively stimulating both humoral and cellular antiviral immunity in the systemic and genital mucosal immune compartments...|$|R
