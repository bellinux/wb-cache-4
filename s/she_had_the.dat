5|$|She starred as Daisy Buchanan, {{opposite}} Leonardo DiCaprio, in The Great Gatsby, {{which was}} released in May 2013. Mulligan auditioned {{for the role of}} Daisy in late 2010. While attending a Vogue fashion dinner in New York City in November, Baz Luhrmann’s wife, Catherine Martin, told her <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> part. In May 2012, she was a co-chair, alongside Anna Wintour, for the Gatsby-themed 2012 Met Ball Gala.|$|E
5|$|Throughout her career, Trimmer {{worked with}} four {{different}} publishers — John Marshall, T.N. Longman, G. Robinson, and Joseph Johnson — and, by 1800, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> most works of any author in the Newbery catalogue, the catalogue that sold the most children's literature. Eventually, Trimmer stopped publishing with Joseph Johnson, because she disagreed with his politics—he was {{a supporter of}} the French Revolution and was publishing works that she considered subversive.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{and after}} Perry Ellwood died in 1943, May Ellwood again altered the home; {{to save on}} fuel oil, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> upper floors of the house closed off. During this period, the library functioned as a guest room and a {{bathroom}} was added across the library's west wall. The bathroom was removed before the house opened as a museum in 1967. The library's plaster cornice and other architectural details have been restored based on a 1912 photograph. In 1964 the home was donated {{to the city of}} DeKalb and converted into a museum.|$|E

5|$|During her regency in Hungary, Elizabeth faced several rebellions led by John Horvat and John of Palisna, who {{attempted}} {{to take advantage of}} Mary's insecure reign. In 1385, they invited King CharlesIII of Naples to depose Mary and assume the crown. Elizabeth responded by having Charles murdered two months after his coronation, in 1386. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> crown restored to her daughter and established herself as regent once more, only to be captured, imprisoned and ultimately strangled by her enemies.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 season, Engen {{appeared}} in 23 games, starting all 23. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> third most {{points on the}} team during the season with 20. She scored six goals and recorded eight assists in the season, her first goal being against the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. In the NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament, Engen scored two goals and recorded an assist against High Point University in the first round. In addition, she had goals in matches against Ohio State, Duke, and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in the second round. At {{the end of the}} season, Engen was named to the All-ACC Academic team.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E

Margaret also says that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> dream again about losing her daughter; Mulder takes this as a hopeful sign that Scully may still be alive. A mournful Mulder later returns to Skyland Mountain, to the field where Scully was abducted. Seemingly alone without her, he looks up into the stars.|$|E
5|$|Perez began {{training}} at Jesse Hernandez's School of Hard Knocks in San Bernardino, California, {{and made her}} in-ring debut in April 2002. Many officials stated that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> most natural ability of any woman who came through their school. In late 2002, Perez auditioned for World Wrestling Entertainment's reality show Tough Enough III, making it through to the final twenty-one, before being eliminated in the final cut of the first episode. After she was eliminated from the contest, trainer Al Snow encouraged her to keep trying to pursue her dream as a wrestler.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of high-explosive shells made {{the use of}} iron armor plate on warships necessary. In 1859 France launched , the first ocean-going ironclad warship. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, Gloire was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor. Gloire prompted further innovation from the Royal Navy, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.|$|E
5|$|Three of Sullivan's cousins, {{the daughters}} of his uncle John Thomas Sullivan, {{performed}} with D'Oyly Carte: Rose, Jane ("Jennie") and Kate Sullivan, the first two of whom used the stage surname Hervey. Kate was a chorister who defected to the Comedy Opera Company's rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore, where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to play Josephine in 1879. Jennie was a D'Oyly Carte chorister for fourteen years. Rose took principal roles {{in many of the}} companion pieces that played with the Savoy operas.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E

5|$|Beginning at 8:00 the {{following}} day, Revithi ran the marathon course on her own. Before starting, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> town's only teacher, the mayor, {{and the city}} magistrate sign a statement testifying to the time she departed from the village. She ran the race at a steady pace and reached Parapigmata (the place where the Evangelismos Hospital stands today, near the Hilton Athens) at 13:30 (5½hours). Revithi {{was not allowed to}} enter Panathinaiko Stadium—her race was stopped in Parapigmata by a few Greek military officers whom she asked to sign her handwritten report to certify her time of arrival in Athens. She stated to the reporters that she wanted to meet Timoleon Philimon (the General-Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee) to present her case. Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement. Neither her reports nor documents from the Hellenic Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell and {{her parents}} lived in Lula, until 1936 when she was three years old; Blackwell's father left the {{plantation}} on which he worked, and fled to Memphis, Tennessee, fearing for his life after he confronted his boss about speaking to his wife. Soon afterwards, Blackwell and her mother left the plantation to live with him. Blackwell's family traveled frequently in search of work. On June 20, 1938, Blackwell's parents separated due to religious differences. Blackwell and her mother went to West Helena, Arkansas, to live with Blackwell's great aunt so that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to receive an education. A quality education in Mississippi {{was not an option}} for Blackwell because the schools there were centered on the cultivation of crops and the plantation system. While living in West Helena, Blackwell often visited her father in Memphis. During the summer months she would leave West Helena and live with her grandfather and grandmother in Lula, where she helped plant and harvest cotton. Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and peeling tomatoes in Florida. She was 14 when she finished the eighth grade, the final year of school at Westside, a school in West Helena for black children. Blackwell had to quit school to earn for her family.|$|E
5|$|In late September 2010, Sauerbrunn {{made her}} return to the {{national}} team when she was called into a national team training camp in Atlanta to replace Joanna Lohman, who was recovering from an ankle injury. Immediately following the 20-day training camp, Saeurbrunn {{was named to the}} 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament held from October 28 to November 8. With two caps, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> least experience on the roster. She made one appearance during the tournament, coming in for Amy LePeilbet in the 56th minute of the match against Guatemala on October 30. The United States placed third in the tournament and a berth in a two-game series against Italy for the last spot in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Sauerbrunn was on the preliminary roster for the two matches.|$|E
