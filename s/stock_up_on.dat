Officials urged residents to <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> supplies and they closed beaches. Even though the Central Pacific Hurricane Center remarked that that watch will likely be upgraded into a hurricane warning, this failed to occur; instead, the watch was discontinued on July 20 because meteorologists were now expecting the storm to pass south of the island chain.|$|E

Brian would <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5|$|Mexican {{officials}} {{issued a}} tropical storm warning 37hours prior to the storm's landfall between Chetumal and Cabo Catoche, Quintana Roo.

5|$|Following the {{identification}} of a tropical disturbance on November6, a level four Typhoon Condition of Readiness (TCOR), {{the lowest level of}} alert, was raised for Guam. By November8, three days prior to Karen's arrival, this was raised to level three, prompting residents and military personnel to <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> supplies. A public announcement was made that day as well, warning residents that the typhoon would likely strike the island. At 9:00p.m. on November10 (11:00UTC), a level two TCOR was put in place for Guam and a typhoon emergency was declared. Buildings were boarded up and emergency supplies were distributed. By 8:00a.m. (22:00UTC on November10), this was raised to level one, the highest level of warning.

All personnel on the island were ordered to evacuate to typhoon-proof shelters and emergency rations were prepared. Strategic air command planes stationed on the island were relocated to avoid damage. Many residents on the island sought refuge in government buildings designed to withstand powerful storms while others evacuated to Wake Island. Roughly 24hours after the typhoon's passage, all warnings were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} warnings for Guadeloupe on August 2 and {{the rest}} of the Leeward Islands extending to the Virgin Islands. The uncertainty of the hurricanes forecast track forced residents and tourists in the Lesser Antilles to evacuate. In the British Virgin Islands, 80 American and Canadian tourists evacuated to hotels. In Puerto Rico, residents were advised to secure or stow away loose objects and <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> emergency supplies. 1.1million residents in the city of San Juan went to supermarkets to get much needed supplies in anticipation that the storm might hit Puerto Rico. In Humacao, the National Guard evacuated 1,966 people living along a coastal highway. The islands of Martinique and Dominica were placed under a hurricane watch. The warning for Guadeloupe was discontinued at 2200 UTC when the hurricane posed no threat to the island. Simultaneously, the hurricane watches in effect for Martinique and Dominica were also discontinued. As Dean continued westward, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands. The watch was soon canceled as Dean made its northward turn towards Bermuda.|$|E
50|$|William Modell {{first became}} {{involved}} in Modell's Sporting Goods, a family business, after World War II. The store had been founded in 1889 by Modell's Hungarian immigrant grandfather, Morris Modell, who opened the first store on Cortlandt Street in Lower Manhattan.

25|$|Still, {{even during}} the time when France did not send {{official}} explorers, Breton and Basque fishermen came to the new territories to <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> codfish and whale oil. Since {{they were forced to}} stay {{for a longer period of}} time, they started to trade their metal objects for fur provided by the indigenous people. This commerce became profitable and thus the interest in the territory was revived.|$|E
25|$|Another unique aspect, {{compared}} to other minor pro leagues of North America, {{is the absence of}} a veteran limit rule, which allows teams to <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> experienced players. The league is slowly trying to clean itself up (for 2005–06, the roster limit went from 20 to 19 players, which for most teams meant one less enforcer), but this is no easy task for a league that has always been popular with the fans for its reputation of being the toughest league in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch East India Company (in the Dutch of the day: Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC) {{decided to}} {{establish}} a permanent settlement at the Cape. The VOC, {{one of the major}} European trading houses sailing the spice route to the East, had no intention of colonising the area, instead wanting only {{to establish a}} secure base camp where passing ships could shelter and be serviced, and where hungry sailors could <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> fresh supplies of meat, fruit, and vegetables. To this end, a small VOC expedition under the command of Jan van Riebeeck reached Table Bay on 6 April 1652.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of West Virginia American Water's notice that the tap water was unsafe {{following}} the spill, Charleston area businesses closed and hospitals took emergency measures to conserve water. School systems within the affected eight counties were also closed. Charleston area residents hurried to nearby stores to <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> available bottled and packaged water. The West Virginia Legislature, which had reconvened following its winter break, cancelled its business on January 9. On January 9, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in Charleston and the courts in Boone and Lincoln counties closed. West Virginia State University in Institute also cancelled its classes {{for the duration of}} the tap water outage.|$|E
25|$|New Jersey was {{a site of}} {{shipbuilding}} {{throughout the}} World War I period. Refineries and ammunition factories were also built to supply war material. Factories such as the Singer Company based in Elizabeth converted from making sewing machines to making weapon parts. Several camps and the forts were opened for soldiers during the war. The roles of these sites were generally to provide a location for soldiers to <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> supplies, receive medical treatment, or become discharged. Several Allied ships were sunken off of the coast of New Jersey. Other factors contributing to the U.S. Entry into the war include German sabotage of both Black Tom in Jersey City, and the Kingsland Explosion {{in what is now}} Lyndhurst.|$|E
25|$|The La Cerería Museum and Cultural {{center is}} housed in a {{building}} which covers an entire city block and {{dates back to the}} 16th century. Its original function was the Encomendero Español or the headquarters for the local encomendero system. In the 17th century, it {{became one of the first}} waxworks in the Americas. This waxworks was noted in the region for making beautiful candles, and became a place to <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> these for those traveling to and from Mexico City. The building was enlarged over time showing a number of different architectural styles. It contains a large alijbe or water storage tank in the main courtyard. There are also gargoyles.

25|$|When it {{was learned}} in Baltimore that Southern armies {{had crossed the}} Potomac, the {{reaction}} was one of instantaneous hysteria followed quickly by stoic resolution. Crowds milled in the street outside newspaper offices waiting for the latest bulletins, and the sale of liquor was halted to restrain the excitable. The public <b>stocked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> food and other essentials, fearing a siege. Philadelphia was also sent into a flurry of frenzied preparations, despite being over 150 miles (240km) from Hagerstown and in no immediate danger.|$|R
