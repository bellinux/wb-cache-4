50|$|The {{conditions}} in the atmospheres of late-type stars support the pumping of different maser species at different distances from the star. Due to instabilities within the nuclear burning sections of the star, the star experiences periods of increased energy release. These pulses produce a shockwave that forces the atmosphere outward. Hydroxyl masers occur {{at a distance of}} about 1000 to 10000 astronomical units (AU), water masers at a distance of about 100 to 400 AU, and <b>silicon</b> <b>monoxide</b> masers at a distance of about 5 to 10 AU. Both radiative and collisional pumping resulting from the shockwave have been suggested as the pumping mechanism for the <b>silicon</b> <b>monoxide</b> masers. These masers diminish for larger radii as the gaseous <b>silicon</b> <b>monoxide</b> condenses into dust, depleting the available maser molecules. For the water masers, the inner and outer radii limits roughly correspond to the density limits for maser operation. At the inner boundary, the collisions between molecules are enough to remove a population inversion. At the outer boundary, the density and optical depth is low enough that the gain of the maser is diminished. Additionally, the hydroxyl masers are supported chemical pumping. At the distances where these masers are found water molecules are disassociated by UV radiation.|$|E
