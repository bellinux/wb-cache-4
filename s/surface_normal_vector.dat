For a diffractive seismic event, the specularity can be sub-unitary. During the seismic migration, one can filter each seismic event according to the value of specularity, in order to enhance the contribution of diffractions in the seismic image. Alternatively, the events can be separated in different sub-images according to the value of specularity to produce a specularity gather.|$|E

50|$|Cube maps can {{be useful}} for {{modelling}} outdoor illumination accurately. Simply modelling sunlight as a single infinite light oversimplifies outdoor illumination and results in unrealistic lighting. Although plenty of light does come from the sun, the scattering of rays in the atmosphere causes the whole sky {{to act as a}} light source (often referred to as skylight illumination). However, by using a cube map the diffuse contribution from skylight illumination can be captured. Unlike environment maps where the reflection vector is used, this method accesses the cube map based on the <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> to provide a fast approximation of the diffuse illumination from the skylight. The one downside to this method is that computing cube maps to properly represent a skylight is very complex; one recent process is computing the spherical harmonic basis that best represents the low frequency diffuse illumination from the cube map. However, a considerable amount of research has been done to effectively model skylight illumination.|$|E

30|$|There {{is another}} {{difficulty}} in shape-from-shading {{that is often}} overlooked, the non-convex {{nature of the problem}} due to the unit norm constraint. Even assuming a linear (Lambertian) reflectance model, the problem of inferring shape in the form of surface normal requires the <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> to be in the unit norm, namely, ∥n∥ 2 = 1, for a <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> n∈R^ 3. Oftentimes, a two-parameter notation of a <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> (p,q, 1)⊤ is used, but it comes with the normalization of its magnitude, resulting in n = (p,q, 1)^ / √(p^ 2 + q^ 2 + 1).

40|$|Abstract. i Integration of <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> {{is a vital}} {{component}} in many shape reconstruction algorithms that require integrating <b>surface</b> <b>normals</b> to produce their final outputs, the depth values. In this paper, we introduce a fast and efficient method for computing the depth values from <b>surface</b> <b>normal</b> <b>vectors.</b> The method is based on solving the Eikonal equation using Fast Marching Method. We introduce two ideas. First, {{while it is not}} possible to solve for the depths Z directly using Fast Marching Method, we solve the Eikonal equation for a function W of the form W = Z + λf. With appropriately chosen values for λ, we can ensure that the Eikonal equation for W can be solved using Fast Marching Method. Second, we solve for W in two stages with two different λ values, first in a small neighborhood of the given initial point with large λ, and then for the rest of the domain with a smaller λ. This step is needed because of the finite machine precision and rounding-off errors. The proposed method is very easy to implement, and we demonstrate experimentally that, with insignificant loss in precision, our method is considerably faster than the usual optimization method that uses conjugate gradient to minimize an error function. ...|$|R
