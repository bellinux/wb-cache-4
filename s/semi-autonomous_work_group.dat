40|$|In {{flexible}} manufacturing, the shop-floor {{staff is}} increasingly organized in semi-autonomous work groups with an enriched task spectrum, including preventive maintenance assignments. In this domain, the work groups are frequently instructed {{to adopt the}} classical expert approach, to perform a time-based preventive maintenance strategy. However, one might question whether this strategy {{is compatible with the}} dispositions of the shop-floor staff. This question was investigated in a field study, analyzing the maintenance activities of a <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>group</b> in a CIM pilot plant. The work group performed especially condition-based preventive activities, followed by corrective and timebased measures (81, 12, and 7 %, respectively). But, as the field study did not allow to determine why the work group chose the condition-based approach, a supplementary laboratory experiment was conducted, in which the availability of a simulated manufacturing system had to be optimized. Two conditions were realized, in which a time-based and a condition-based strategy would have been optimal, respectively. In both conditions the majority of the subjects decided to perform condition-based preventive maintenance (100 and 90 %, respectively), indicating a general preference regarding this strategy, which is fairly independent of efficiency considerations. As a consequence, semi-autonomous work groups should be allowed to pursue a condition-based strategy, rather than to insist that they adopt the timebased approach favored by experts in this field.

40|$|Les auteurs cherchent à approfondir l'analyse du problèmede la différenciation interne aux travailleurs en {{situation}} de changement organisationnel. This {{article is}} based on the analysis of different reactions observed among workers of a <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>group,</b> operating for eight years, particularly regarding key aspects of this organizational change. At the time of the empirical research, social relations among workers were conflictual and tense. In this paper, the authors develop an analytical framework for the study of this problem of internal social differentiation, which has generally not been investigated in the literature on semi-autonomous groups. According to this framework, it is hypothesized that this kind of social differentiation and conflict among workers members of the work group depends on factors related to the organizational context, the work organization and Personal characteristics of the workers. The empirical evidence shows that {{in the first years of}} the project, the autonomous work group had been creative and rather cohesive regarding key aspects of the experience, such as: job rotation, the decision-making process, the payment system and supervision. However, at the time of the empirical research (eight years after the beginning of this organizational change), the work group appeared divided and lacking in cohesiveness. In fact, three subgroups were identified within the work group, having very different attitudes towards such aspects as productivity, discipline and job rotation. In this article, the authors describe these attitudes and try to explain why members of the work group evolved so differently. The three subgroups are a minority of leaders, another minority of restricters and, between them, the majority of the workers who had silently followed the leaders at the beginning but now hold a different view of the work groups future. While the leaders are pushing to attain higher group productivity and self-discipline, it appears that the restricters overtly opposed the leaders, criticizing almost every aspect of the new work organization, and trying to do the least possible work. The majority of the workers nevertheless, are satisfied with the present state of affairs and trying to stabilize and institutionalize the work group formula. Within the analytical framework proposed, the authors explain the differences observed among workers by a set of factors. First of all, there are significant differences between subgroups concerning personal characteristics of their members, such as seniority and career expectations. Secondly, it appears that subgroups are influenced by some characteristics of the organizational context such as: the company's initial plan to extend the work group formula to other departments, the presence of a union, the rules of the collective contract and the established pattern for labour relations. The authors conclude that the evolution of this autonomous work group is largely opposed to what could have been anticipated from a socio-technical point of view. Based on socio-technical approach, autonomous work groups are supposed to evolve towards more and more internal integration, unless external factors keep them from doing so. The present research shows that that has not been the case here. The work group has evolved towards more and more internal differentiation and a reduced cohesiveness. Moreover, the empirical evidence shows the prominent influence of personal characteristics of the work group's members as the determinant factor in the explanation of such an evolution. In fact, this case study calls for a more strategic approach to the autonomous work group's dynamics...|$|E

National minimum standards for competence in foodservice requires practical experience in the workforce which can lead to saturation of professional practice sites. Innovative approaches to fulfil requirements are necessary if competence based learning is to be sustained. A seven day camp for 2200 people was used as a site for students to attain competence in foodservice management. Students completed the three phase planning, implementation and evaluation of the centrally catered foodservice for the residential camp. Phase 1 was the theoretical planning and development of recipes and menus. Recipes were selected to meet the nutritional needs of the camp participants. Phase 2 was the practical application and management of the foodservice system during the camp. Students were divided into <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> and managed the preparation, distribution and collection of all meals and snacks. Phase 3 was the evaluation of the project in terms of learning and assessment of competencies. The innovative elements of this teaching were the residential approach, the <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>work</b> teams, the “inability to avoid ” and the ability of students to receive immediate feedback on their decisions. This style of teaching promoted leadership skills, initiative and flexibility in those that participated as well as reducing the burden of student placements at traditional sites. This opportunity allowed dietetic students to demonstrate competence in foodservice management in an innovative manner while gaining other less tangible skills that can greatly enhance professional practice...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Crisis {{management}} entails {{among other}} things developing organizational systems {{that are capable of}} reacting to unpredictable and different types of crises. It also involves designing cohesive operational elements to deal with the local dynamics of an actual crisis situation. This challenge of responsiveness – where organizations simultaneously need to react to change demands of different task environments – has hardly been investigated in management theory. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to initiate to shed more light on this blind spot. Design/methodology/approach Modular organizing and organizational sensing are introduced as key drivers of organizational responsiveness. Based on a large-scale survey among 1, 200 senior officers the study investigates how these two variables have influenced the responsiveness of the Netherlands armed forces for crisis response deployment. Findings The findings indicate that the level of modularization is an important facilitator of organizational responsiveness. Organizational systems that are made up of <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> are in a better position to simultaneously live up to the change demands of different environmental levels than organizations that follow a fine-grained modularization approach.

A multilevel safety climate measurement tool was proposed, which identified five important safety agents, i. e. client, principal contractor, supervisor, co-workers, and individual workers. Surveys were conducted at three construction projects commissioned by Fonterra Co-operative Group. A total of 356 participants completed the survey. The data was subject to scale reliability analysis and factor analysis. The results showed that all scales achieved satisfactory internal consistency and the multilevel factorial structure was generally supported. At the organizational level, the tool measures clients&# 039; overall safety priority and safety actions, and principal contractors&# 039; general commitment to safety. At the group level, the tool measures supervisors&# 039; safety actions and safety expectations, and co-workers&# 039; general safety values and practices. The tool also measures individual safety responses reflected by safety compliance and safety participation. The measurement tool would help construction organizations to diagnose potential weaknesses in their safety management practices for safety improvement and also help to develop a social and cultural work environment that is supportive of safety at all levels...|$|R
40|$|Teams {{have become}} a {{permanent}} part of the industrial <b>work</b> place. <b>Semi-autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> are in place to staff production systems; executive teams are working together to lead organizations; cross-functional teams are solving a myriad of problems at various levels within companies. The purpose {{of this research is}} to better understand how cross-functional project teams work together to successfully complete their assigned task(s). In order to accomplish this purpose, the relationship between dynamic team behavior and team goal attainment was investigated. The influence of task complexity on this relationship was also explored. Dynamic team behavior is explained as a joint function of interaction among team members, flexibility of team members to handle changes, unity of team members to maintain group solidarity, and involvement of the team leader in the day to day activities of the team. Fifty-five cross-functional project teams from a variety of industries, government laboratories, and not-for-profit organizations were studied. Several new reliable measures were developed in this work, including measures of team flexibility, team culture, and task complexity. The attainment of cost goals was found to be negatively influenced by team flexibility, and this relationship was stronger as the number of task alternatives increased. Ambiguous tasks were found to negatively influence the attainment of timing goals and attainment of organizational goals. Other exploratory findings and future research opportunities are also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{creative}} {{design of}} the business process enables the manufacturing enterprises to safeguard and extend their competitive position despite the burden of high costs. One of these creative solutions is a close-to-the-market manufacturing strategy in which the accumulation of large inventories of finished products can be avoided. When putting this strategy into practice, {{a high degree of}} adaptability is required {{not only in terms of}} the changing market conditions but also with regard to the short-term fluctuations of the order inflow. Production systems with many manual operations and therefore relatively low fixed costs can adapt well to the changing market conditions. The co-ordination of required and available manufacturing resources is possible through a flexible deployment of manpower. This concept is accompanied by increased decentralisation of co-ordination functions, transferring the task of flexibly adapting manpower to demand to <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>groups.</b> The systematic support required for handling this co-ordination task has obvious shortcomings: one example being the lack of supporting tools to match the user requirements and another occurring in processed data, where there is a lack of up-to-dateness and practical relevance. Finding a remedy for these deficiencies is a prerequisite for the widespread and successful use of market-oriented <b>group</b> <b>work</b> systems. The objective of this thesis is to help in the resolution of this problem by developing and testing a control system that corresponds to the above-mentioned requirements i. e. that helps homogeneous <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> to process sequential orders on time. This method is based on individual performance measures which are created for each <b>work</b> <b>group</b> and updated daily. This performance figure is based on the ratio of actual to target time (efficiency rate), which is constantly updated to ensure that the determination of the necessary manufacturing resources is based on the latest data. Suitable modelling methods allow for the description and interpretation of the resulting time series and its use for forecasting activities. Mathematical calculations are then used to identify the forecast intervals for the efficiency rate. The length of these intervals depends on the confidence interval chosen by the user. The resulting information can be used to control the deployment of manpower. For this purpose, a continuous progress chart has been devised as a means of graphic representation. This chart shows the quantitative correlation between the use of human resources and the products to be manufactured. The forecasts derived from the analysis of the time series can be transferred and used for realistic and statistically valid predictions concerning the completion time of orders, even when performance fluctuations in the work system are considered. It is also possible to make predictions as to the possible work progress at a certain point in time. Since the continuous progress chart is automatically generated from operational data, it can be used as a control tool by the <b>work</b> <b>groups.</b> Varying the planned deployment of manpower during a certain period of time allows the <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> to find the best solution to suit not only the requirements of the market but also the personal requirements of the staff. Of greatest importance in this regard is the staff's judgement concerning the capability of the work system and its additional logistical conditions. As a result, effective controlling variables and local decision criteria for the co-ordination task in <b>work</b> <b>groups</b> were developed. A systematic link-up between the controlling variables and the performance variables of the work system was achieved, described by characteristic curves and proved by simulation runs. This thesis makes it clear that a statistical theory of labour economics can be established by expanding into further areas of production and identifying other correlation points of the system. A systematic study of the tolerance range for time variables allows them to become the success factors of an efficient customer-oriented production system...|$|R

Les résultats de l'enquête par questionnaire auprès de dirigeants locaux de la FTQ, de la CSN et de la CSD démontrent que les positions varient selon {{la nature}} des nouvelles formes d'organisation du travail. De façon générale, les positions syndicales sont favorables et elles ont évolué en ce sens au cours des dernières années. La volonté de s'adapter à un environnement changeant, la position de la centrale syndicale et l'expérience passée sont les facteurs qui expliquent le mieux les variations des positions syndicales locales. Flexibility between trades, job rotation, <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>work</b> <b>groups,</b> quality circles, total quality management, just-in-time: {{all of these}} are new forms of work organization (NFWO) which have been part of labour-management discussion, particularly {{since the beginning of the}} 1990 's. The policies of the labour central organizations on these are pretty well known. But what about local union offîcers' positions? What are the factors motivating these? Is it correct to claim that the latter have changed?In November 1991, questionnaire was sent to a sample of 266 offîcers from various local unions in the Quebec's manufacturing sector. These offîcers belong to local unions with more than 50 members and affiliated to the QFL, the CNTU or the CDU. A total of 114 questionnaires were returned including 63 from the QFL, 39 from the CNTU and 20 from the CDU. Key findings from the data and from statistical analysis include the following. The NFWO most often introduced were: total quality (54 %), job enrichment and enlargement (50 %), job rotation (49 %), quality circles (44 %) and flexibility between trades (44 %). After their introduction, initiatives were maintained in the majority of cases (85 %), with the exception of the quality circles (50 % of cases). NFWO are normally introduced outside the collective bargaining process. Offîcers expressed favourable positions concerning quality of working life, favourable but critical position concerning job rotation and total quality management, critical (ambivalent) positions vis-à-vis job enrichment/jobs enlargement and flexibility between trades, and defensive positions regarding quality circles. Factor analysis resulted in two groupings of officer's positions, the first including initiatives related to the allocation of work and the second to quality. The results of linear regression analysis suggest that policies related to the first group were positively influenced by the officer's willingness to adapt to his/her environment and by the position of his/her labour confederation. For the second group, the position of the labour confederation exerted a negative influence and the officer's experience with NFWO a positive influence. A trend toward more favourable policies was noticed among the offîcers of the three labour confederations, especially within the CNTU...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{leadership}} typically {{assumes a}} single leader who has managerial {{authority over the}} group, unit or organisation. Shared leadership is an emerging concept of leadership as a group-level phenomenon. It builds on antecedents such as democratic leadership, <b>semi-autonomous</b> and self-managed <b>work</b> <b>groups,</b> participative decision-making and co-leadership that are typically studied as variations of leadership by a single leader. Shared leadership is seen as more distributed, informal and emergent than these. Recent empirical research shows shared leadership can have beneficial effects {{on a variety of}} group process and outcome variables. However, so far its effects on creativity have not been empirically examined. This is surprising, since creativity is an important response to increased competition and rapid change in the business environment. Much creativity research identifies important pre-requisites that {{are more likely to be}} found in shared than hierarchical leadership. Improved creativity may be one of the most valuable benefits of shared leadership. This study provides empirical evidence on this relationship from a naturalistic experiment in which student groups were allowed to self-manage over a three-month creative project. In assessing shared leadership, two methodological innovations were introduced. First, previous studies have either used aggregated measures of group performance, or more recently the measures of group ‘degree centrality’ (degree of hierarchy) or ‘density’ (degree of sharing) developed in Social Network Analysis research. However, none of these measures by themselves adequately captures the distinction between hierarchical and shared leadership, although the SNA measures are potentially more precise. Following recommendations of previous authors, this study explored the combined use of centrality and density to better reflect the underlying construct. A second refinement was to use a general construct of leadership based on Bass and Bass’s (2008) extensive literature review, rather than constructs such as transformational leadership that have a narrower theoretical base and tend to assume a hierarchical context. Results from items measuring sharing of Bass and Bass’s five ‘leadership functions’ were compared with a ‘global’ measure of leadership sharing. Creativity was assessed by a panel of judges who rated the groups’ creative outputs (movies), rather than the more common method of rating creativity in the work process. The results provide evidence for the hypothesised link between shared leadership and creativity that, although qualified by aspects of the study design, suggests further research is worthwhile. Implications for future research on both leadership and creativity are explored, along with consequences for the practice of management. The issues of how to best measure shared vs. hierarchical leadership, and how much a construct can reflect both forms of leadership, are of particular relevance to the future development of this field. In summary, this study offers the first evidence directly linking shared leadership to <b>work</b> <b>group</b> creativity, and suggests improvements to current methods for measuring the extent of leadership sharing in a group...|$|R
