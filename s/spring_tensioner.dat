5000|$|Created as {{a refined}} luxury engine with {{improved}} {{power over the}} EA82T, Subaru introduced the ER series engine in 1988 exclusively to be featured in the Subaru Alcyone VX. Like the EA series engines, the ER series engine featured 2-valve cylinder heads with hydraulic lash adjusters and the block shared the same bore and stroke. While recognised as bearing many similarities to the Subaru EA82 engine, there are numerous differences in design between the two engines and {{a large portion of}} parts are unique to the ER27. The oil and water pumps are unique to the ER27, sharing similar bolt patterns and design to the EA82, but being of a higher flow in both cases.The intake manifold uses a two piece design with a lower section bolting to the heads containing the coolant bridge, injectors and various vacuum lines. The upper intake manifold then bolts to the lower section and is unlike the EA82 or EJ22 [...] "spider" [...] manifold designs in that there is no central plenum chamber. The valve timing system is belt-drive using two individual timing belts, curiously one belt uses a <b>spring</b> <b>tensioner</b> (like the EA82) whilst the other uses a hydraulic tensioner (like the EJ22). Both JDM and USDM versions of the ER27 used multi-point electronic fuel injection. The ER27 designation was the first time Subaru incorporated the engine's displacement into the series name and all future engines have retained this nomenclature.|$|E

50|$|Because most full {{suspension}} frame designs either {{have a single}} pivot that is not concentric with the bottom bracket, or a linkage with a variable center of rotation, {{the distance between the}} bottom bracket and rear axle varies throughout the suspension's travel. This requires a <b>sprung</b> chain <b>tensioner,</b> similar to a rear derailleur, to be used. Only relatively uncommon frame designs with single pivots that are concentric with the bottom bracket allow the use of more desirable static chain tensioners. Another consideration is the generally increased amount of pedalling while standing up that is inherent to single speed mountain biking, which increases losses from suspension bob and squat. Therefore, full suspension mountain bikes are fairly rare, with hardtails and rigid bikes being much more common.|$|R
40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation {{describes the}} {{modeling and simulation}} of the Ares Upper Stage Transportation, lifting, stacking, and mating operations within the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). An aerial view of KSC Launch Shuttle Complex, two views of the Delmia process control layout, and an upper stage move subroutine and breakdown are shown. An overhead image of the VAB and the turning basin along with the Pegasus barge at the turning basin are also shown. This viewgraph presentation also shows the actual design {{and the removal of}} the mid-section <b>spring</b> <b>tensioners,</b> the removal of the AFT rear and forward tensioners tie downs, and removing the AFT hold down post and mount. US leaving the Pegasus Barge, the upper stage arriving at transfer aisle, upper stage receiving/inspection in transfer aisle, and an overhead view of upper stage receiving/inspection in transfer aisle are depicted. Five views of the actual connection of the cabling to the upper stage aft lifting hardware are shown. The upper stage transporter forward connector, two views of the rotation horizontal to vertical, the disconnection of the rear bolt ring cabling, the lowering of the upper stage to the inspection stand, disconnection of the rear bolt ring from the upper stage, the lifting of the upper stage and inspection of AFT fange, and the transfer of upper stage in an integrated stack are shown. Six views of the mating of the upper stage to the first stage are depicted. The preparation, inspection, and removal of the forward dome are shown. The upper stage mated on the integrated stack and crawler is also shown. This presentation concludes with A Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) utilizing male and female models for assessing risk factors to the upper extremities of human beings in an actual physical environment...|$|R
50|$|Given this, and {{the lack}} of funds to develop an all-new power unit, it was decided to upgrade the A-Series unit at a cost of Â£30 million. The result was the 'A-Plus' Series of engines. Available in 998cc and 1275cc, the A-Plus had {{stronger}} engine blocks and cranks, lighter pistons and improved piston rings, <b>Spring</b> loaded <b>tensioner</b> units for the timing chain and other detail changes to increase the service interval of the engine (from 6,000 to 12,000 miles). More modern SU carburettors and revised manifold designs allowed for small improvements in power without any decrease in torque or fuel economy. Many of the improvements learnt from the Cooper-tuned units were also incorporated, with A-Plus engines having a generally higher standard of metallurgy on all units, where previously only the highest-tuned engines were upgraded in this way. This made the A-Plus engines generally longer-lived than the standard A-Series, which had a life between major rebuilds of around 80,000 to 100,000 miles in normal service. Studies were made into upgrading the engine to use five main crankshaft bearings but the standard three-bearing crank had proven reliable even in high states of tune and at high engines speeds, so it was not deemed worth the extra funding.|$|R
