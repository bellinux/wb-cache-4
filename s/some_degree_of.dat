Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to compare and {{contrast}} the treatment of vowel harmony, a kind of long-distance assimilatory phonological process involving vowels, in Turkey's Turkish and Azerbaijani Turkish (Iran). Examining carefully the linguistic data obtained from the dialects and within the framework of generative phonology, the author of the paper has attempted to evaluate the present-day situation of vowel harmony (a synchronic study) in the above- mentioned members of Oghuz languages. The results of the study showed that, except some violations mostly observed in loanwords, there is an innate and high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> harmony in both of them, along with <b>some</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> disharmony. It can be claimed that one of the main factors of the observed disharmony, among other factors, is the effect of other languages and the existence of loanwords. Generally speaking, we may conclude that vowel harmony is one of the most active and prominent phonological rules both in Turkey's Turkish and Azerbaijani Turkish (Iran), <b>of</b> course with <b>some</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> difference...|$|R

More simply, the shape resonance total energy is more than the separated fragment energy.Practical implications of this difference for lifetimes and spectral widths are mentioned in works such as Zobel.|$|R
5|$|B. coccinea {{is killed}} by fire and regenerates {{afterwards}} from seed released from burnt follicles. It has is <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> serotiny, that is, {{it has an}} aerial seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. However, numbers of seed are less than other co-occurring species of banksia on the southern plains and peak several years after a fire. Unusually for banksias, B. coccinea can release seed with resulting seedlings growing in the absence of a bushfire trigger. Plants flower and fruit three years after germination and are shorter-lived than other banksias, appearing in poor health or dying before 20 years of age. They hence appear to be suited to fire intervals of less than 20 years.|$|E
