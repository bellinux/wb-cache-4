In layman's terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes {{him one of the}} most dangerous human beings on the planet." [...] There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> father, likely due to the abusive nature of his own father.|$|E

Though conflicted, Tittle decided to get into shape and prepare for the next season. He stated in his 2009 autobiography that at times he thought, [...] "The hell with it. Quit this damned game.

[...] He went on to state that the episode featured more [...] "lighthearted" [...] content before what he predicted would be a return to more dramatic elements.

500|$|Digital Devil Saga 2 {{received}} {{an even better}} reception: its aggregate scores from GameRankings and Metacritic were 83% and 83/100 respectively. While critics generally cited a necessity for knowledge of the first game, the story and gameplay were generally cited as an improvement over the original. Famitsu was again fairly positive, enjoying the story and characters, while also noting the accommodations for first-time players. Dengeki PlayStation was highly positive about the game, praising its story and gameplay additions, though saying that the two games were a little too similar, and that people who had not played the first game would be confused by the story and character relations. 1UP.com's Shane Bettenhausen {{said that while the}} game shared many similarities with its predecessor, it was not as repetitive as other games such as the [...]hack series, and was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> game. Masimilla said that Digital Devil Saga 2 had managed to realize the first game's storytelling ambitions, enjoying the experience despite noting some design flaws. Fahey said that the game was [...] "everything that an excellent sequel should be", generally praising its mechanical and narrative improvements over Digital Devil Saga.

Morison missed the opening {{games of the season}} through injury, making his first league appearance for Leeds in over a year as a substitute against Huddersfield Town on 20 September. On 25 October 2014, Morison was named in Leeds' starting 11 {{for the first time in}} 18 months for the game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, replacing the suspended Souleymane Doukara. The match proved to be Darko Milanic's last match as head coach. On 19 April 2015, Morison scored his first goal for Leeds since March 2013, when he scored a volley in a 2–1 loss against Charlton Athletic. After scoring against Charlton, Morison followed this up by scoring in the consecutive game on 25 April in a 2–1 win against Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday. It would have been three goals in three games if his goal against Rotherham hadn't been wrongly called offside. He started off the 2015/16 pre season in good form, scoring against Harrogate Town on 10 July 2015, and then scoring against Eintracht Frankfurt in a 2–1 defeat on 21 July 2015. On 31 July 2015, Morison was given the number 20 shirt for the upcoming 2015/16 season.|$|E
500|$|On {{the next}} day of battle, Klenau was ordered to a forward position, to {{complete}} a double-envelopment of Napoleon's force, envisioned by Charles as the best means of inducing panic among the French troops. [...] At dawn, or so, at 0400, his cannonade rained havoc on Boudet's division of Massena's IV Corps; Massena sent another division under Claude Legrand to support Boudet. Klenau's corps managed to retake both Essling and Aspern, without the same vigorous contest that had occurred two months earlier. Half the pincer movement was well underway, although Klenau's force could not move further ahead: The guns on the Island of Lobau prevented further advance. There was no support from Kollorat's forces on his flank, and for the closing prong of the pincer movement, Archduke John was no where in sight; he had not abandoned his baggage, and was plodding slowly, with his army, toward the battlefield, but <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> day's march away. Despite the mile-long gap in the French line, and the advance of Austrian cavalry, Klenau's men could not hold them against André Masséna's prolonged mid-day assault. Charles watched from his command post at Wagram as Klenau's forces stubbornly clung to their positions, but were overwhelmed by the inexorable progress of Masséna's troops, what Klenau later called Masséna's Infernal Column. Klenau organized the rear guard for the Army's retreat into Moravia, and lost 15 percent of his force. General René Savary, who directed part of the French pursuit, wrote that the Klenau's soldiers had [...] "fought in a manner calculated to instill a cautious conduct into any man disposed to deeds of rashness." ...|$|E
500|$|Anniemal {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork {{referred to the}} songs as a [...] "dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annie's breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals." [...] The site's endorsement was uncommon during a period when sites covering independent music were often dismissive of pop acts. In his review for AllMusic, Andy Kellman described Anniemal as [...] "cunning" [...] but also [...] "deeply affecting". Dylan Hicks' review for The Village Voice stated that the blogosphere and British music press overrated Anniemal but that [...] "an overrated good record is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> record". Jody Rosen wrote for The New York Times that the album [...] "is a true album, strong from top to bottom" [...] and that [...] "there is charm in [...] deadpan delivery, and her songwriting is full of the flair for melody for which Scandinavian pop is famous." [...] Rosen also contributed a review to Slate, where she noted that [...] "other singers have made whole careers out of singles less winning than 'Chewing Gum,' but [...] includes several other superb songs". Kitty Empire's review in The Observer stated that the album's songs [...] "boast a winning combination of innocence and experience, breezy blonde melodies and just-so productions". PopMatters Pierre Hamilton called Anniemal [...] "riveting" [...] for how [...] "it lacks the waxy sheen" [...] that listeners were used to hearing in manufactured pop music. However, a second PopMatters review, written by Rob Horning, criticised the album for using a similar formula to previous generations of electropop, adding that the result was [...] "exquisitely empty…enough to suck the feelings out of its listeners and leave them happily vacant, blank and unburdened." [...] In his review for Billboard magazine, Michael Paoletta described the album as [...] "slinky and sensual, cool and classy, fun and fiery" [...] and labeled it [...] "one of the best debut albums of 2005." ...|$|E
