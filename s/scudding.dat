500|$|As {{the authors}} of the {{official}} history of the Welsh Rugby Union, David Smith and Gareth Williams, wrote of him: [...] "The clue to an understanding of his achieved style lies in what he could make others do to themselves. The kicking, whether spinning trajectories that rolled away or precise chips or <b>scudding</b> grubbers, was a long-range control, but his running, deft, poised, a fragile illusion that one wrong instant could crack, yet rarely did, was the art of the fly-half at its most testing. He was the dragonfly on the anvil of destruction. John ran in another dimension of time and space. His opponents ran into the glass walls which covered his escape routes from their bewildered clutches. He left mouths, and back rows, agape." ...|$|E
60|$|Very true; {{and that}} thought very early {{occurred}} to me; for no idea had I of <b>scudding</b> round Cape Horn in my shirt; for {{that would have}} been almost <b>scudding</b> under bare poles, indeed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Scud's</b> {{first flight}} was on 11 January 1931 at Totternhoe, piloted by Marcus Manton. By the Summer of 1931 {{it was in}} {{production}} in the Abbott-Baynes works. Production numbers are uncertain; {{it is known that}} a total of 12 <b>Scud</b> 1 and <b>Scud</b> 2 were built here, including <b>Scud</b> 1 BGA 300. Another <b>Scud</b> was built before World War II in the Channel Islands. The <b>Scud</b> 1 in the Brooklands Museum is a replica built by the late Mike Beach.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, Baynes {{designed}} the <b>Scud</b> light sailplane, built at first by Brant Aircraft Limited at Croydon. The <b>Scud</b> was successful, and in 1931, Baynes went into partnership with E.D. Abbott as Abbott-Baynes Sailplanes Ltd, of Farnham, Surrey, to build <b>Scud</b> I sailplanes, {{and later the}} <b>Scud</b> II (1932). In 1935, a <b>Scud</b> II flown by Mungo Buxton took the British Height Record for a glider to 8,750 feet (2,666 m).|$|R
50|$|Iran has {{an arsenal}} of short-range, liquid-fueled {{missiles}} including the <b>Scud</b> B and <b>Scud</b> C, and is now able to produce <b>SCUD</b> type missiles on its own, such as the R-17E, {{a variant of the}} Russian <b>Scud</b> B. The Aerospace Industries Organization, a subsidiary of Iran's Ministry of Defense, supports the manufacturing process by engaging in <b>SCUD</b> missile restoration. Its short-range missile inventory also includes solid-fueled missiles, such as the Tondar-69 and the Fateh-110.|$|R

50|$|<b>Scuds</b> are {{frequently}} {{associated with the}} unaccented syllables of long words; there are almost no duplex tilts. Rhymes are not <b>scudded</b> (that is, there is no <b>scud</b> in the final foot).|$|R

6000|$|When we got fairly out, our sail filled, {{and we went}} <b>scudding</b> away on a good wind. Then said old Menendez, as {{he sat at the}} tiller: ...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Scud</b> 2 was a {{development}} of the single seat, parasol winged intermediate-level Abbott-Baynes <b>Scud</b> 1 glider flown a year earlier. The two aircraft were both designed by L. E. Baynes and had many common features but the <b>Scud</b> 2 has a wing of much higher aspect ratio, intended for serious rather than introductory soaring. [...] The wing loading is 3.5 lb/ft2 (17.1 kg/m²), {{similar to that of}} the <b>Scud</b> 1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} <b>Scud</b> 2s built is uncertain, though Abbott-Baynes {{produced}} {{a total of}} 12 <b>Scud</b> 1 and <b>Scud</b> 2 in all. There were also attempts to build <b>Scud</b> 2s from kits or plans. At least 5 <b>Scud</b> 2 were built, including one completed by Slingsby Aviation. [...] One was flown from Dunstable Downs with the London Gliding Club and another with the Ulster Gliding Club. These two met at the 1934 BGA competition, held at Sutton Bank. [...] G. M. Buxton, who flew the prototype from Dunstable, set a British glider altitude record in 1935 at 8,750 ft (2.666 m). [...] One <b>Scud</b> 2 went to the Orkney Islands and was {{on display in the}} gliding club club-house after World War II.|$|R
5000|$|One <b>Scud</b> crashed {{early in}} the aircraft's career. On 8 March 1931 Thomas Lander was killed {{immediately}} after a first attempt at a winch launching. A <b>Scud</b> 1 was {{on display at the}} Gliding Exhibition held at Islington in May 1931. [...] Over the Summer of 1931 Flight recorded several meetings with <b>Scuds</b> in attendance, such as those at Portsmouth and Balsdean. [...] A <b>Scud</b> continued in service in 1934 with the Guernsey glider club.|$|R

60|$|<b>Scudding</b> {{makes you}} a slave to the blast, which drives you headlong before it; but running up into the wind's eye enables you, in a degree, to hold it at bay. <b>Scudding</b> exposes to the gale your stern, the weakest part of your hull; the {{contrary}} course presents to it your bows, your strongest part. As with ships, so with men; he who turns his back to his foe gives him an advantage. Whereas, our ribbed chests, like the ribbed bows of a frigate, are as bulkheads to dam off an onset.|$|E
60|$|The Brenda was <b>scudding</b> {{along with}} all sail set to catch the rising wind, and {{everyone}} on board was rejoicing, for the long voyage was drawing towards an end.|$|E
50|$|In all, between October 1988 and February 1992, with 1,700 to 2,000 <b>Scud</b> launches, Afghanistan saw the {{greatest}} concentration of ballistic weapons fired since World War II. After January 1992, the Soviet advisors were withdrawn, reducing the Afghan army's {{ability to use}} their ballistic missiles. On 24 April 1992, the mujahideen forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud captured the main <b>Scud</b> stockpile at Afshur. As the communist government collapsed, the few remaining <b>Scuds</b> and their TELs were divided among the rival factions fighting for power. However, the lack of trained personnel prevented a sustained use of such weapons, and, between April 1992 and 1996, only 44 <b>Scuds</b> were fired in Afghanistan. When the Taliban arrived in power in 1996, they captured {{a few of the}} remaining <b>Scuds,</b> but lack of maintenance had reduced the state of the missile force {{to such an extent that}} there were only five <b>Scud</b> firings, until 2001. After the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the last four surviving <b>Scud</b> launchers were destroyed in 2005.|$|R

Twenty-eight members of the Pennsylvania National Guard were killed when a <b>Scud</b> struck a United States Army barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.|$|R

50|$|In rainstorms, <b>scud</b> often {{form in the}} updraft {{area where}} the air has been cooled by {{precipitation}} from the downdraft, thus condensation occurs below the ambient cloud deck.

50|$|The Abbott-Baynes <b>Scud</b> 2 was a 1930s {{high-performance}} sailplane, {{built in}} the UK. It was a development of the intermediate-level <b>Scud</b> 1 with a new, high aspect ratio wing.|$|R
50|$|Due to its imprecision, the <b>Scud</b> {{was used}} as an area bombing weapon, and its effect was {{psychological}} as well as physical: the missiles would explode without warning, as they travelled faster than the sound they produced in-flight. At the time, reports indicated that <b>Scud</b> attacks had devastating consequences on the morale of the Afghan rebels, who eventually learned that by applying guerilla tactics, and keeping their forces dispersed and hidden, they could minimize casualties from <b>Scud</b> attacks.The <b>Scud</b> was also used as a punitive weapon, striking areas that were held by the resistance. In March 1991, shortly after the town of Khost was captured, it was hit by a <b>Scud</b> attack. On 20 April 1991, the marketplace of Asadabad was hit by two <b>Scuds,</b> that killed 300 and wounded 500 inhabitants. Though the exact toll is unknown, these attacks resulted in heavy civilian casualties. The explosions destroyed the headquarters of Islamic leader Jamil al-Rahman, and killed a number of his followers.|$|R
