5|$|Hensley met Inez Hutcheson, a widow {{with ten}} children, in 1946 while {{performing}} a service in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee. After Hensley <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> she accepted {{the doctrine of}} snake handling. He soon proposed marriage, which she accepted. They lived in the Soddy-Daisy area for several months. Although he had hoped that she would travel with him and read Bible passages during his services, she left him after {{less than a year}} of marriage, and their union was soon dissolved. In 1951, Hensley married Sally Norman in Chattanooga. After their marriage, she traveled with him as he ministered in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
500|$|Tony Brown, {{author of}} Jimi Hendrix: The Final Days (1997), {{had been in}} regular contact with Dannemann from 1980 until her death in 1996. He visited with her on {{multiple}} occasions and <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> numerous times over the phone. Soon after contacting her, Brown {{came to the conclusion}} that her account of the events of Hendrix's final days [...] "would change from one call to the next." [...] In the days following Hendrix's death, she gave two significantly different accounts of the morning of September 18.|$|E
500|$|Kubizek, a {{childhood}} friend and later biographer of his childhood experience with Hitler, wrote about Stefanie in his book, Adolf Hitler, My Childhood Friend. [...] He alleges that Hitler {{fell in love with}} her after she passed by him during her daily daughter-mother stroll in Linz, glancing at him. In Kubizek's account, although in love with her to the point of suicide, Hitler never once <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> and she later married an Austrian army officer. Stefanie stated in interviews that she was unaware of Hitler's feelings towards her, and little is known about her life.|$|E
60|$|Though Faith <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> vexation, {{she also}} <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> feeling. <b>Her</b> dark eye swam in tears, {{and the color}} of her brown cheek deepened, until her {{companion}} saw new reasons to forget his discontent in sympathies, which, however obtuse they might be, were never entirely dormant.|$|R
60|$|Lady Deringham's {{face was}} as pale as death, and she <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> downcast head, <b>her</b> eyes fixed upon her clenched hands.|$|R
50|$|To {{the end of}} her life, Sr Justine {{maintained}} silence {{about these}} visions, and <b>spoke</b> only <b>with</b> <b>her</b> superior and her spiritual director about these. The Green Scapular was approved by Pope Pius IX in 1870.|$|R
500|$|Schlesselman {{publicly}} claimed {{white people}} were the master race and would often say [...] "Sieg Heil" [...] and [...] "Heil Hitler." [...] He {{spoke out against}} Obama, saying things like, [...] "Obama would make the world suffer." [...] His anti-racist sister Kayla, who is two years younger than Paul, often argued with him about his racial beliefs. A few days before his arrest, a neighbor said he heard semiautomatic gunfire coming from an open field behind Schlesselman's house. After his arrest, Schlesselman's family expressed doubt that he seriously intended {{to carry out the}} plot; his father, Mike, said, [...] "I think it's just a lot of talk. He would never do something like this." [...] Kayla said she <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> brother after the charges were made public, and that Paul [...] "said he's sorry about everything he's done." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Rawlings faced a {{libel suit}} for Cross Creek, filed by her {{neighbor}} Zelma Cason, whom Rawlings {{had met the}} first day she moved to Florida. Cason had helped to soothe the mother made upset by her son's depiction in [...] "Jacob's Ladder". Cason claimed Rawlings made her {{out to be a}} [...] "hussy". Rawlings had assumed their friendship was intact and <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> immediately. Cason went ahead with the lawsuit seeking $100,000 US for invasion of privacy (as the courts found libel too ambiguous). It was a cause of action that had never been argued in a Florida court.|$|E
2500|$|In perpetuating and {{expanding}} the modernizing {{tradition of the}} Reform movement, Gottschalk performed the June 1972 ordination of Rabbi Sally Priesand, {{the first woman to}} be ordained in the United States and believed to be only the second woman ever to be formally ordained in the millennia-long history of Judaism. Rabbi Gottschalk called the ordination of Priesand [...] "historic", one that breaks stereotypes and allows [...] "Jewish women to consider seeking the rabbinate" [...] and a testament to Reform Judaism's efforts at achieving [...] "equality of women in the congregation of the Lord". Priesand wept when Gottschalk <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> as she was handed her ordination certificate.|$|E

60|$|Bertha--now Bertha Considine--who {{leaned on}} Charlie's arm, <b>spoke</b> not <b>with</b> <b>her</b> lips, but {{she lifted her}} bright blue eyes, and with these orbs of light {{declared}} her thorough belief in the wisdom of what ever Charlie might say or do.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next month}} {{she was called}} into her supervisor's supervisor's office, and told {{to go to an}} {{employee}} counseling service, an act she knew to be punitive, [...] "because you look stressed". The therapist who <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> seemed to Francis to be more interested in finding out what she knew about the Lazarus case and who she might have shared it with. After two sessions in which she declined to share that information, she was again called into her supervisor's office and told she was not cooperating and needed to [...] "talk this out". She told the therapist she was getting a lawyer, after which further sessions were canceled as a [...] "mistake".|$|E
2500|$|Lodzinski {{reported}} to investigators {{that she and}} her son had spent time at Holmdel Park during the afternoon before driving to the evening carnival. According to park police, the Holmdel lot where she claimed to have parked was closed that day. Despite her claim to have spent more than an hour at the Elks carnival, with Timmy dressed in bright red, the authorities could find no one who had seen her son that night. As one witness testified: [...] "I <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> and she did not have a child with her. I was very upset. There was a child missing and there was no child." [...] The last confirmed sighting of Timmy was by a neighbor who saw him playing outside that morning.|$|E

Dann called her mother again and this time Mr. Andrew spoke with Mrs. Wasserman, asking her to persuade Dann {{to give up the}} gun.

Mr. Andrew told Dann that he would not remain in the house if she did not put down the gun, and also left the house. [...] Dann ordered Philip to stay. Just before noon, seeing the police advancing on the house she shot Philip in the chest, but he managed to escape out the back door before collapsing and being rescued by the police and ambulance personnel.|$|E

2500|$|Ishrat {{had left}} her house on 11 June 2004, four days before she was killed. According to her brother, their mother Shameema did not like her going out of town with Javed. Therefore, she did not inform her when she left for Nashik. Ishrat made {{a phone call to}} her mother on 11 June <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother. According to her mother, Ishrat called her from a public phone booth outside a Nashik bus stop, and told her that [...] "Uncle Javed Sheikh hasn't come yet." [...] A few minutes later, Ishrat made a second call and told her mother in a terrified voice that Javed had come but with some [...] "strange men", and then hung abruptly. She {{reportedly}} made another phone call on 12 June, informing her family that she had met Javed.|$|E
2500|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} St. Guillen <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> friend, Brooklyn police {{received}} an anonymous phone call alerting {{them to a}} dead woman's body. They soon identified it as St. Guillen. Her body was nude, wrapped in a comforter. Her broken fingernails showed she fought against her attacker. Her hands and feet were tied, a sock had been shoved down her throat, and her head was wrapped in packing tape. Some of her hair had been cut off. An autopsy revealed {{that she had been}} beaten and sexually assaulted before being asphyxiated. According to forensic psychologist Dr. Stephanie Stolinsky, the killer [...] "tried to dehumanize her completely. ... Whenever you hide someone's face, it means that you don't want to see them as a human being. [...] You want to pretend that they're just an object".|$|E
2500|$|Warrick's {{first big}} break was being hired {{by a young}} Orson Welles for Citizen Kane (1941), in which she played Emily Monroe Norton, niece of the President of the United States and Kane's first wife. Welles pulled her {{photograph}} from the hundreds he had been sent by agents; he recognized her from a radio show they had worked on together in 1938. He <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> in New York: [...] "I'm not looking for an actress that can play a lady," [...] he said, [...] "I want an actress who is a lady." [...] She was in California within days, making several screen tests including one with Welles, and was regarded as perfect for the role. Warrick was expecting her first child during the filming of Kane, which prevented her being cast in The Magnificent Ambersons; but she worked on a 1942 episode ("My Little Boy") of Welles's radio series, and Welles hired her again for Journey into Fear (1943).|$|E

60|$|Stephanie, {{with the}} air of one a little weary of the conversation, broke away from a distant group and came towards them. Her {{beautiful}} eyes seemed tired, she moved listlessly, and she even <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> less than <b>her</b> usual assurance.|$|R
60|$|Of her husband, or of his {{individual}} family, {{she never}} <b>spoke,</b> but <b>with</b> <b>her</b> admirers she would often allude in a mysterious {{way to her}} married life and isolated state, and, pointing to her daughter, would call her {{the last of the}} blood of the emperors, thus referring Neroni's extraction to the old Roman family from which the worst of the Caesars sprang.|$|R
2500|$|Ward {{said that}} {{although}} Burton is a talented actress and {{has done a great}} job with the character, she did not feel she had to get to know her in order to proceed with the drawings. [...] "It was the character I was drawing for and I learned what I needed to from the show and the scripts," [...] she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. [...] "Schwahn always knew exactly what he wanted and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches," [...] stated Ward. All of their communication was via e-mail. [...] "I wish I could say something more exciting, like [...] and I would chat about what Peyton would be drawing," [...] stated Ward, [...] "but the only time I ever <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> was when they were filming at my house in Wilmington (which oddly enough was Peytonâ€™s house on the show.)" [...] Despite this, Ward said she did not mention to Burton that she was the artist behind Peyton's artwork.|$|E

50|$|Verdena Parker is {{the last}} fluent speaker of the Hupa {{language}}, an Athabaskan language spoken by the Hoopa Valley Tribe, indigenous to northern California. While other children of her generation were sent to boarding schools, isolating them from their families, Parker was raised by her grandmother, who <b>spoke</b> Hupa <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Through adulthood, Parker continued to speak Hupa <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother daily, maintaining {{a high level of}} fluency despite language loss {{in the rest of the}} Hupa community.|$|R
60|$|They <b>spoke</b> no more <b>with</b> <b>her</b> at that time, {{seeing that}} she was a witchwoman. But Asmund took her up to Middalhof, and gave her a farm, and she lived there alone, and he profited much by her wisdom.|$|R
