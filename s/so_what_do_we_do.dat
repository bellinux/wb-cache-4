The deal has been questioned by many and it criticized for being illegal and violating human rights. But it is still in effect. This study aims to detect the motives of the EU-leaders that led to the deal and subsequently with the motives detect what kind of decision-process that made the decision possible.

On-site fabrication infrastructure {{will be needed}} to support habitat structure development, tools and mechanical part fabrication, as well as repair and replacement of ground support and space mission hardware such as life support items, vehicle components and crew systems. The on-site fabrication infrastructure will need the In Situ Fabrication and Repair (ISFR) element, which is working in conjunction with the In Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU) element, to live off the land. The ISFR element has worked closely with the ISRU element in the past year to assess the ability of using lunar regolith as a viable feedstock for fabrication material. Preliminary work has shown promise and the ISFR Element will continue to concentrate on this activity. Fabrication capabilities have been furthered with the process certification effort that, when completed, will allow for space-qualified hardware to be manufactured. Materials being investigated include titanium and aluminum alloys as well as lunar regolith simulants with binders.

In 2013, the Canton Public Library began to plan for improvement of patron service through user-centered library design. Based on information collected from library staff and patrons, a Patron Service Improvement Project was established. In 2014 the first Phase was completed, with Phase II and Phase III slated to be finished over the next two years. The results of these renovations are a completely reimagined main service area, improved ADA compliance, unified design, increased study space and streamlined workflows for staff. The Patron Service Improvement Project reflects the Library’s core values, stressing minimal impact on library operations and allowing continued access to collections and programming. In this talk two key members of the Canton Public Library administrative team will describe the planning and implementation of this multi-phase redesign, including budgeting, communication of project plans and progress with the public and library staff, and designing for better patron experiences.

40|$|Despite {{thousands}} {{of medical and}} scientific arti-cles published every year about Alzheimer dementia, it remains a clinically neglected disease. There is no Heisenbergian uncertainty that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{has become one of}} the most ominous medical challenges of the 21 st century. It follows that if rapid action is not taken to substantially reduce its expo-nential growth, a socio-economic crisis will develop and devour many government-sponsored health plans within the next few decades. <b>So,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> about it and how do we do it? It makes a lot of sense to sort out what has been done in the field of AD so far and how we might learn from prior failures. The time, effort, and bil-lions of dollars spent by industry in the last twenty years searching for a pharmaceutical nostrum to pro-vide questionable palliation to patients who may not be aware of their surroundings has not helped in the battle to limit the number of people affected by AD. These nostrums, which are charitably called ‘cogni-tive enhancers’, do no such thing, not even in treating mild cognitive impairment or slowing-down conver-sion to AD [1].

40|$|Most {{students}} bring a {{range of}} everyday experiences and a rich sense of curiosity to learning in science. They come asking how cells grow and divide, why two equal and opposite forces continue to act when a book sits on a table and why indicators change colour in acids and bases. With their desire to explore these questions they also bring their personal ideas of what counts as knowledge, commitments and preconceptions and intuitive knowledge. These elements in their conceptual background are the bricks and mortar from which you, the teacher, help them build new scientific knowledge. But student conceptual backgrounds are also the source of many folk explanations and alternative conceptions. [...] . And so, in a constructivist classroom, the challenge is how to employ the sutdents' prior knowledge, experiences and preferences in ways that develop scientifically acceptable ideas without confusing and discouraging them. Working scientifically is a constructivist approach that encourages students to ask questions, design experiments, collect and interpret data and communicate their findings to their peers and interested adults. But inquiry learning (or investigating, understanding and communicating) is not discovery learning because the teacher {{plays a key role}} in the learning performance. Left to their own devices, students cannot investigate and explain scientific concepts like floating and sinking, chemical reactions and blood circulation. Our aim is to place as much of the planning, experimenting and explaining that the students are capable of in their hands and minds. <b>So,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> when we see the blank looks on students' faces or hear them confusing scientific terms and ideas?

We all love new technology but where do the raw materials for these products come from? Few people consider this question, and even less so, the cumulative and residual impacts, the environmental consequences if you like, of sustaining our digital lifestyle. Even much touted alternative energy technologies (wind, solar, wave etc.) require {{a great deal of}} raw minerals and rare earths in their construction and operation. The love affair we all have with technology, raises interesting questions around sustainability, and how and where we source these minerals and manage their extraction. These minerals continue to be the foundation of virtually all manufacturing and infrastructure in our society. They all come from various types of open cut and underground mines. But what happens to a mine and the surrounding landscape once the resource in that mine is depleted and the mine is closed? In Australia, it is estimated there are some 50, 000 abandoned mines. The legacy issues many of these mines present, are enormous. Here in Western Australia it is estimated there at least 1800 abandoned mines with legacy issues, dating back to the early 20 th Century. This figure does not include current operational mines that number in the thousands. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with all the holes? In areas of intense mining, what will a post-mining landscape look like? Rather than viewing old mine sites as legacy issues, is there an alternative, a set of new decisions we can make?

40|$|Everyone {{knows that}} {{officials}} in China are corrupt. It {{would be difficult}} to find a China scholar who would disagree outright with this statement. However, because official corruption is illegal, immoral or both, it is painstakingly concealed from the public and from researchers alike. <b>So,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> about it if we can’t even measure it? Many authors have answered this challenge by using descriptive methods that discuss political corruption as a broad phenomenon that has commonalties of both cause and effect across many different situations. These works often focus more on the effects and potential future effects of corruption than on explanations and possibly helpful responses to its existence. In this paper, I propose that {{a solution to the problem}} of studying political corruption in China can be found in the analytic approach of game theory. I model particularistic gift-giving from citizens to officials for necessary goods as a product (equilibrium outcome) of choices made by different players attempting to maximize their individual payoffs in the context of certain clearly understood and common priors (a specific institutional framework and incentive structure). Using this method, we can then proceed to a discussion of how part of a “stably corrupt system” such as China’s might be altered or broken by exploring how changes in the system and the incentive structure might shift players’ choices and thus the equilibrium outcome. In this way, I hope to replace interesting but vague and finally unhelpful descriptions of modernization, democracy and marketization as ‘natural’ and long-term cures for corruption with a more concrete discussion of specific policy options and institutional and political structural changes that can begin to address corruption and its related problems in the short to medium term (though may not promise to eliminate it). Thus, using game theory, not only can we hope to explain the macro phenomenon of corruption as an aggregation of individual choices, but we will also discover that it takes extreme environmental changes to crack corruption as the modus operandi of Chinese citizen/official interactions...|$|E

We find radio-bright objects which are unexpectedly invisible in the infrared, and which may be very high redshift radio galaxies and quasars.
