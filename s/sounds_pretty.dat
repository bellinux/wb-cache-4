25|$|It is {{the form}} that allows a writer the {{greatest}} opportunity to explore human experience....For that reason, reading a novel is potentially a significant act. Because {{there are so many}} varieties of human experience, so many kinds of interaction between humans, and so many ways of creating patterns in the novel that can’t be created in a short story, a play, a poem or a movie. The novel, simply, offers more opportunities for a reader to understand the world better, including the world of artistic creation. That <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> grand, but I think it’s true.|$|E

I was in love at the time, and (the song) <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> happy, but it’s {{a little bit of a}} dark song. You’re so obsessed with somebody you start acting like a weirdo. … I write about falling in love, being in love, breaking up because he’s a loser, being heartbroken. I not only sing about getting rowdy, but love." ...|$|E
500|$|Taking note of Idol's {{assertion}} {{that he had}} attempted to use technology in creating his early music, Ira Robbins of Newsday was sceptical. [...] " [...] is hardly obvious in his work." [...] Though if his early work had been mild attempts to use technology, Cyberpunk itself, Robbins wrote, was [...] "the sound of science gone too far." [...] The ideology of futurism Idol adopted was panned by Robbins, while the music itself was hardly different from his previous work. [...] "For the most part, other than keyboards that add a pervasive nod to the jittering beat of techno-rave music, Cyberpunk <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> much like every other Idol album." ...|$|E

500|$|Square Enix Music Online's Juan2Darien {{reviewed}} the game's symphonic scores: Dragon Quest Suite; Dragon QuestI Remix Symphonic Suite (London Philharmonic Orchestra); Dragon QuestI & II Symphonic Suite (London Philharmonic Orchestra Remastered); and Dragon QuestI Symphonic Suite (Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra). Comparing {{each of the}} suites, he gave all ratings ranging 7 through 9 out of 10, and found the Tokyo Strings Ensemble recording superior to the aforementioned symphonic suites. While the music is somewhat flat, Juan2Darien acknowledged {{this is due to}} the source material and praised Koichi Sugiyama's and the orchestras' efforts to compose an above-average piece despite the limitation. Gamasutra's Kurt Kalata also praised the symphonies' melody, commenting that [...] "the overworld theme... is pretty simplistic and grating, but actually <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> beautiful when played by a live orchestra".|$|E
500|$|Laura Herbert of BBC News {{said that}} many of the album's songs, {{including}} [...] "Radar" [...] and [...] "Toy Soldier" [...] "are repetitive and over-produced." [...] Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel said that [...] "Musically, songs such as 'Piece of Me,' 'Radar' and 'Break the Ice' are one-dimensional, robotic exercises." [...] Chris Wasser from the Irish Independent said the album had single potential, exemplifying that [...] "There's little doubting we'll hear the bouncing and digitally affected vocals of Radar and the livelier Hot As Ice on the radio soon enough, but both tracks still seem a little under par." [...] After the release of [...] "Radar" [...] single from Circus, Nick Levine of Digital Spy said it [...] "still <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> ace, one of the best examples of the robopop sound Blackout essentially invented, but its fresh-out-the-box sheen has long since faded". On July 29, 2009, [...] "Radar" [...] was chosen as single of the week by FHM.|$|E
500|$|Spins Colin Joyce was {{impressed}} by [...] "Start a War". He stated that [...] "the number {{seems to be the}} sort of skyward ballad that [...] has made her wheelhouse" [...] and found it to be [...] "a good look for Stefani". Stassa Edwards of Jezebel was equally positive, declaring that it [...] "has all of the hallmarks of a Sia ballad – those mournful, moody bridges that Sia does so well". Edwards concluded by saying she enjoyed the feathery-inspired setup that accompanied Stefani's performance. Richard Baxter, a blogger on Popology Now, largely praised the track. He wrote: [...] "As expected, 'Start a War' is very much in the veins of a typical Sia ballad. Same sound, same melodies, yet Gwen makes the song her own by not channeling Sia's vocals." [...] Baxter continued: [...] "It's got a bit of radio appeal, at least from what we can understand, and Gwen <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> phenomenal." [...] Also writing of Stefani's vocals, Julien Goncalves on the French website Purebreak Charts was pleased that the [...] "aerial" [...] song was strong enough to emphasize her voice.|$|E

5000|$|BrooklynVegan {{described}} the record as [...] "appealingly mellow pop, with arpeggiated guitars, gentle electronics, {{and the occasional}} melotron. Mostly, though, it's about Caws and Hatfield's voices which <b>sound</b> <b>pretty</b> great together." ...|$|R
500|$|The Stone Tape was a {{significant}} influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which {{a group of scientists}} investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered {{in the basement of a}} church. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym [...] "Martin Quatermass", and included a reference to [...] "Kneale University". This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in The Observer, [...] "For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and I have not seen it. It <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> bad. With an homage like this, one might say, who needs insults? I can only imagine that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [...] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust". The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist. In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial [...] "Ghost Zone", a character refers explicitly to the [...] "Stone Tape theory" [...] as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is [...] "replaying" [...] scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, she was fourth in the line of {{succession}} to the British throne. Her father was Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. Her mother was Elizabeth, Duchess of York, the youngest daughter of the 14th Earl and the Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. The Duchess of York originally wanted to name her second daughter Ann Margaret, as she explained to Queen Mary in a letter: [...] "I am very anxious to call her Ann Margaret, as I think Ann of York <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty,</b> & Elizabeth and Ann go so well together." [...] King George V disliked the name Ann but approved of the alternative [...] "Margaret Rose".|$|E
2500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{received a}} range of critical reaction, from competently done for a budget title to horribly executed. The gameplay of Deadly Premonition drew comparisons to that of Shenmue the Clock Tower series, and its combat was {{compared to that of}} Resident Evil 4. According to 1UP's Frank Cifaldi, Deadly Premonitions combination of similar gameplay to Shenmue, The Last Express, Resident Evil 4, and the Grand Theft Auto series proved to be [...] "a 'jack of all trades, master of none' scenario." [...] Erik Brudvig of IGN US wrote: [...] "The Twin Peaks meets Resident Evil with a dash of Grand Theft Auto formula <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> great, but it was well beyond the capabilities of this development team." [...] The controls were criticized as detracting from the game's appeal. The combat sections received mixed reactions. IGN UK's Matt Wales wrote that while the combat was [...] "simplistic", the atmosphere and profiling worked nicely. [...] According to Eurogamer's Chris Shilling, the sudden appearances of the Raincoat Killer made the sections frightening and the profiling made for some unsettling yet [...] "relatively restrained" [...] moments of horror, despite the [...] "over-long and frequently clumsy" [...] combat sequences. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot described the supernatural enemies as not particularly aggressive and boss battles as taking too long.|$|E

5000|$|On September 11, 2001, the band's first album, Valium, {{conceived}} {{eight years}} earlier, was finished {{and received a}} limited release. When asked why now was {{the right time to}} release the album, Cunningham replied:"Primarily just because it never even saw the light of day. Back at that point I had rejoined the Deftones, with Phallucy having broken up and I had a cassette copy of it that wasn't even finished and it <b>sounded</b> <b>pretty</b> bad, and then 6 or 7 months ago Sonny and I got back together with Dave and we just decided {{to see what would happen}} if we actually finished it and it turned out to <b>sound</b> <b>pretty</b> cool. You can tell it's very young but it is what it is." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the release was to finally offer most of the early hits by the band on a CD as Hipodil's first three albums were {{released}} on audio cassettes only. Despite the CD release however most of the tracks were hardly remastered and still <b>sound</b> <b>pretty</b> similar to the original versions.|$|R
60|$|This {{was very}} curious, very curious indeed. Sammy flew a little nearer {{and then a}} little nearer, taking the {{greatest}} care not to make a <b>sound.</b> <b>Pretty</b> soon he was so near that he could see those Ducks very plainly, and he stared with all his might. He couldn't see any feathers! No, Sir, he couldn't see any feathers! Then he understood.|$|R
5000|$|Greene {{said that}} he was {{inspired}} by Danny Elfman and Oingo Boingo when composing the theme and used his voice for singing the [...] "Bill Nye the Science Guy" [...] refrain. [...] "I used my voice for the first demo to send to the producers, Jim and Erren," [...] he said. [...] "After they approved it, I hired singers because I wanted to make it better. I hired a guy to sing it who <b>sounded</b> <b>pretty</b> cool. He had like a rock‑and‑roll kind of voice, so it <b>sounded</b> <b>pretty</b> slick. Then as another option, I hired a girl to sing it to give it a bit more R&B kind of sound. Then I sent those versions to Jim and Erren, and they said, 'Why have you got them on it? We want your voice. It’s funnier.' I thought, 'My voice is funnier??? Good thing I’m not touchy about my singing!' So we kept my voice on there.|$|R

6000|$|... "I suppose {{our story}} would <b>sound</b> <b>pretty</b> fair {{if it was}} put into a book; but whoever wrote it couldn't be all the time telling about how hungry and tired we were, how the {{mosquitoes}} and flies nearly ate us up, how thoroughly we were frightened the greater portion of the time, nor how disagreeable {{it is to be}} where there's precious little chance for a fellow to keep clean." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{might say}} I know every {{trick of the}} trade. Tell Jones how all the other film makers are crazy to get me. But say how I refuse more money because I believe our {{directors}} will wake up to my value and raise my salary. That <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> good, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell what}} you meant to do and couldn't <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> weak, but I had two objects when I came home," [...] he said. [...] "I wanted to help Dick and {{keep him out of}} trouble; but the proper kind of help needs tact, and I haven't much. Besides, there's {{something}} peculiarly elusive about Dick; you think you have him, so to speak, in a corner, and the next moment he slips away from you. Sometimes I suspect he's a good deal more clever than we imagine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then,--Lurella. You {{have no idea}} of the grotesqueness {{of these}} people's minds. I used to see a great deal of their {{intimate}} life when I went on my tramps, and chanced it among them, for bed and board, wherever I happened to be. We cultivated Yankees and the raw material seem hardly of the same race. Where the Puritanism has gone out of the people in spots, there's the rankest growth of all sorts of crazy heresies, and the old scriptural nomenclature has given place to something compounded of the fancifulness of story-paper romance and the gibberish of spiritualism. They make up their names, sometimes, and call a child by what <b>sounds</b> <b>pretty</b> to them. I wonder how the captain picked up that scoundrel." ...|$|E
