The earliest records of a lottery offering tickets for sale is the lottery organized by Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar. The funds were for repairs in the City of Rome, and the winners were given prizes in the form of articles of unequal value.|$|E

[...] He wrote, [...] "This may be Russell T Davies’s smartest, funniest script. It’s certainly the warmest, and somehow it feels like the most personal." [...] While Setchfield was {{not a fan of}} Kay, he found his performance in this episode funny. IGN's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, particularly praising the dialogue. However, he felt that some of the sadder aspects [...] "seemed out of place in {{what should have been a}} purely light-hearted comedic episode". Slant Magazine reviewer Ross Ruediger was positive towards [...] "Love & Monsters", saying that [...] "there's no reason the series can't do <b>something</b> <b>this</b> quirky and beautiful when an inspired mind conjures up such a scenario."

[...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's still a bit weird that <b>something</b> <b>this</b> goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes. In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird thing to me, because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match."

Bass guitarist, Jeremy Pritchard, explained to Skiddle that the group were keen to create a record that would [...] "stand up for the huge amount of time you spend touring a record", which in turn inspired a more pop-oriented sound than had appeared on Arc. Higgs later discussed how they used their previous sound to inform the direction of Get to Heaven, seeking to avoid [...] "quiet songs" [...] and [...] "tenderness" [...] {{in an effort to}} [...] "inject a new fire into ourselves".|$|E

IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try <b>something</b> <b>this</b> radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E

I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break <b>something.</b> <b>This</b> isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, writing [...] "Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka {{may be a}} stone freak, but he is {{also one}} of Burton's classic crackpot conjurers, like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood." [...] Roger Ebert gave an overall {{positive}} review and enjoyed the film. He was primarily impressed by Tim Burton's direction of the younger cast members, but was disappointed with Depp's performance: [...] "What was Depp thinking of? In [...] he was famously channeling Keith Richards, which may have primed us to look for possible inspirations for this performance." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Burton's [...] "best work in years. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor." [...] Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that [...] "Depp's deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka's secret heart than what Gene Wilder did. Depp and Burton may fly too high on the vapors of pure imagination, but it's hard to not get hooked on <b>something</b> <b>this</b> tasty. And how about that army of Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy, in musical numbers that appear to have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley on crack." ...|$|E
