25|$|Weinzweig’s {{move toward}} <b>serialism</b> {{was not a}} {{complete}} transition; he was very selective and deliberate in which principles he chose to adopt. While he acknowledged that Schoenberg’s influence on the musical world was powerful, he was not particularly taken with Schoeberg’s music and preferred that of composers such as Berg and Webern. His attraction to <b>serialism</b> {{was not the same}} as that of its Viennese founders. Since he was not taught strictly using tonality in his early education, he did not feel the need to rebel and use <b>serialism</b> simply as a means to avoid tonality. While he often employed the techniques used by Stravinsky, Bartók, Copland and Varèse, he did not teach these methods to his students exclusively.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of <b>serialism</b> eventually became rooted in set theory, {{and uses a}} seemingly quasi-mathematical vocabulary to describe how the basic sets are manipulated to produce the final result. Musical set theory {{is often used to}} analyze and compose serial music, but may also be used to study tonal music and nonserial atonal music.|$|E
25|$|<b>Serialism,</b> {{along with}} John Cage's {{indeterminate}} music (music composed {{with the use}} of chance operations), and Werner Meyer-Eppler's aleatoricism, was enormously influential in post-war music. Theorists such as George Perle codified serial systems, and his 1962 text Serial Composition and Atonality became a standard work on the origins of serial composition in the work of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern.|$|E
25|$|A second {{direction}} {{in the search for}} a new tonality was twelve-tone <b>serialism.</b> Arnold Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone method of composition {{as an alternative to the}} structure provided by the diatonic system. His method entails building a piece using a series of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, permuting it and superimposing it on itself to create the composition.|$|E
25|$|In America, composers like Milton Babbitt, John Cage, Elliott Carter, Henry Cowell, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, George Rochberg, and Roger Sessions, formed {{their own}} ideas. Some of these composers (Cage, Cowell, Glass, Reich) {{represented}} a new methodology of experimental music, which {{began to question}} fundamental notions of music such as notation, performance, duration, and repetition, while others (Babbitt, Rochberg, Sessions) fashioned their own extensions of the twelve-tone <b>serialism</b> of Schoenberg.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of {{electronic}} dance music that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards, techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of Western music and such strictures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone. Thus techno inherits from the modernist tradition of the so-called Klangfarbenmelodie, or timbral <b>serialism.</b> The use of motivic development (though relatively limited) and the employment of conventional musical frameworks is more widely found in commercial techno styles, for example euro-trance, where the template is often an AABA song structure.|$|E
25|$|The final orchestral work by Debussy, {{the ballet}} Jeux (1912) written for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, {{contains}} {{some of his}} strangest harmonies and textures {{in a form that}} moves freely over its own field of motivic connection. At first, Jeux was overshadowed by Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which was composed in the same year as Jeux, and was premiered only two weeks later by the same ballet company. Decades later, composers such as Pierre Boulez and Jean Barraqué pointed out parallels to Anton Webern's <b>serialism</b> in this work.|$|E
25|$|John Weinzweig’s {{early works}} {{concentrate}} primarily on orchestra. Some pieces {{that he wrote}} as a student include Whirling Dwarf, The Enchanted Hill, and A Tale of Tuamoto (based on a Polynesian legend). While none of these gained much recognition at the time, some did receive readings by the orchestra at Eastman. One of his earliest orchestral works, written shortly after obtaining his master's degree, is Rhapsody (1941). This version was not particularly successful, but was later salvaged {{by one of his}} first pupils, Victor Feldbrill, and revived. In some of his early piano suites, the emergence of 12-tone <b>serialism</b> as a method of pitch organization can be seen.|$|E
25|$|However, operatic modernism's use of {{atonality}} also {{sparked a}} backlash {{in the form}} of neoclassicism. An early leader of this movement was Ferruccio Busoni, who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical number opera Arlecchino (first performed in 1917). Also among the vanguard was the Russian Igor Stravinsky. After composing music for the Diaghilev-produced ballets Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio Oedipus Rex (1927). Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works The Nightingale (1914), and Mavra (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore serialist technique and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style diatonic number opera The Rake's Progress (1951). His resistance to <b>serialism</b> (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many other composers.|$|E
25|$|While his {{teaching}} abilities were widely acknowledged, Hanson struggled to gain recognition for his talents as a composer {{for much of}} his career, as his music was often unpopular with the audience at that time and also unfashionable. He was fifty-four years old before receiving his first commission for a piece of music, and many of his works lay unperformed for many decades. Part of the problem lay with his independence of mind. Hanson ignored prevailing trends in the pursuit of his own muse. In the 1940s and 1950s, his work was regarded by his Australian contemporaries as too avant-garde, but by the 1960s it was being dismissed as not avant-garde enough. Hanson's rejection of <b>serialism,</b> responsible for the latter dismissal, was ultimately vindicated by history, but this vindication came late in his career.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, composers of classical music were experimenting with an increasingly dissonant pitch language, which sometimes yielded atonal pieces. Following World War I, as a backlash against what they saw as the increasingly exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism, certain composers adopted a neoclassic style, which sought to recapture the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles (see also New Objectivity and Social Realism). After World War II, modernist composers sought to achieve greater levels of control in their composition process (e.g., through the use of the twelve tone technique and later total <b>serialism).</b> At the same time, conversely, composers also experimented with means of abdicating control, exploring indeterminacy or aleatoric processes in smaller or larger degrees. Technological advances led to the birth of electronic music. Experimentation with tape loops and repetitive textures contributed to the advent of minimalism. Still other composers started exploring the theatrical potential of the musical performance (performance art, mixed media, fluxus).|$|E
25|$|Henze's {{music has}} {{incorporated}} neoclassicism, jazz, the twelve-tone technique, <b>serialism,</b> and some rock or popular music. Although he did study atonalism {{early in his}} career, after his move to Italy in 1953, Henze's music became considerably more Neapolitan in style. His opera König Hirsch ("The Stag King") contains lush, rich textures. This trend is carried further in the opulent ballet music that he wrote for English choreographer Frederick Ashton's Ondine, completed in 1957. While Mendelssohn and Weber were important influences, the music for Ondine contains some jazz and there is much in it redolent of Stravinsky—not only Stravinsky the neo-classical composer, but also the composer of The Rite of Spring. His Maratona di danza, on the other hand, required much tighter integration of jazz elements, complete with an on-stage band, which {{was very different from}} the more romantic Ondine. Henze received much of the impetus for his ballet music from his earlier job as ballet adviser at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden.|$|E
25|$|The {{large-scale}} St. Luke Passion (1963–66) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, {{not least}} because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Western audiences {{saw it as a}} snub to the Soviet authorities. Various different musical styles {{can be seen in the}} piece. The experimental textures, such as were seen in the Threnody, are balanced by the work's Baroque form and the occasional use of more traditional harmonic and melodic writing. Penderecki makes use of <b>serialism</b> in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the BACH motif, which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The Stabat Mater section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple chord of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.|$|E
25|$|Born in Montbrison in the Loire {{department}} of France, {{the son of}} an engineer, Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen, and privately with Andrée Vaurabourg and René Leibowitz. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as Music Director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. As a young composer in the 1950s he quickly became a leading figure in avant-garde music, playing {{an important role in the}} development of integral <b>serialism</b> and controlled chance music. From the 1970s onwards he pioneered the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of completed works was relatively small, but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as Le Marteau sans maître, Pli selon pli and Répons. His commitment to the modernist project and the trenchant, polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist, a reputation which softened in later years.|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} years Bax's music fell into neglect. Sir John Barbirolli wrote, [...] "I think he felt keenly that his richly wrought and masterly scores were no longer 'fashionable' to-day, but nothing could deter him from the path of {{complete}} honesty and sincerity in his musical thought." [...] The neglect became more complete after the composer's death. He had always sustained a Romantic outlook, distancing himself from musical modernism and especially Arnold Schoenberg's <b>serialism,</b> of which Bax wrote in 1951: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} tonality, [...] Tippett shifted his {{ground in the}} course of his career. His earlier works, up to The Midsummer Marriage, are key-centred, but {{thereafter}} he moved through bitonality into what the composer Charles Fussell has summarised as [...] "the freely-organized harmonic worlds" [...] of the Third Symphony and The Ice Break. Although Tippett flirted with the [...] "twelve-tone" [...] technique—he introduced a twelve-tone theme into the [...] "storm" [...] prelude that begins The Knot Garden—Bowen records that he generally rejected [...] <b>serialism,</b> as incompatible with his musical aims.|$|E
500|$|It {{had also}} been some time since a Copland piece had been {{appreciated}} widely by audiences. His opera The Tender Land had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet Dance Panels, {{despite the fact that}} he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—Connotations, Music for a Great City, Emblems and Inscape—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. [...] Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, [...] "By the sixties, <b>serialism</b> had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore." [...] Nonetheless, he did not want to be pigeonholed. He told American composer Walter Piston in 1963, [...] "People always want to shove me into the American idea more than I really want. Nobody wants to be an 'American' composer now as they did." [...] He told another friend, [...] "Young composers today wouldn't be caught dead with a folk tune!" [...] He heard a considerable amount of new music through his association with Tanglewood and might not have wanted to be left behind. At the same time, he might not have become totally at home with <b>serialism.</b> He confided to Verna Fine, [...] "I don't feel comfortable with the twelve-tone system, but I don't want to keep repeating myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Whittall {{believes}} {{that one reason}} for Britten's enduring popularity is the [...] "progressive conservatism" [...] of his music. He generally avoided the avant garde, and did not challenge the conventions {{in the way that}} contemporaries such as Tippett did. Perhaps, says Brett, [...] "the tide that swept away <b>serialism,</b> atonality and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been {{out of step with the}} times". Britten defined his mission as a composer in very simple terms: composers should aim at [...] "pleasing people today as seriously as we can".|$|E
500|$|Although in {{his youth}} Sorabji was {{attracted}} to what were then the newest developments in European art music, his musical tastes were essentially conservative. He had a particular affinity for late Romantic and Impressionist composers, such as Mahler, Debussy, Medtner and Delius, and his main [...] were Stravinsky, the late Schoenberg and Hindemith. He rejected <b>serialism</b> and dodecaphony, considering both {{to be based on}} artificial precepts, and he criticised even the later tonal works and transcriptions of Schoenberg. He loathed the rhythmic character of Stravinsky's music and what he perceived as its brutality and lack of melodic qualities. He viewed Stravinsky's neoclassicism as a sign of lack of imagination. Shostakovich and Fauré are among the composers whom Sorabji initially condemned but later admired.|$|E
500|$|Connotations is twelve-tone, a {{style of}} {{composition}} which is among the first introduced, and certainly most well known, forms of musical <b>Serialism.</b> Through this technique, Copland wrote that he felt he could express [...] "something of the tensions, aspirations and drama" [...] of that time. Three four-note chords, musicologist Neil Butterworth writes, spell out the 12-note row on two trumpets and two trombones. Each chord is separated by echoes from the remaining trumpets and trombones, which also introduces one of the work's main rhythmic elements. The row is repeated, transposed up an augmented fourth with a different distribution of notes within each chord. The chords [...] "are repeated several times in various transpositions" [...] so they can become firmly established in both the musical fabric and the listener's ear.|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, Górecki {{began to}} {{distance}} himself from the <b>serialism</b> and extreme dissonance of his earlier work, and his Third Symphony, like the preceding choral pieces Euntes ibant et flebant (Op. 32, 1972) and Amen (Op. 35, 1975), starkly rejects such techniques. The lack of harmonic variation in Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's progression towards the harmonic minimalism and the simplified textures of his more recent work. Because of the religious nature of many of his works during this period, critics and musicologists often align him with other modernist composers who began to explore radically simplified musical textures, tonality, and melody, and who also infused many of their works with religious significance. Like-minded composers, such as Arvo Pärt and John Tavener, are frequently grouped with Górecki under the term [...] "holy minimalism," [...] although none of the composers classified as such has admitted to common influences.|$|E
500|$|In {{the post-war}} period Poulenc crossed swords with composers {{of the younger}} {{generation}} who rejected Stravinsky's recent work and insisted that only the precepts of the Second Viennese School were valid. Poulenc defended Stravinsky and expressed incredulity that [...] "in 1945 we are speaking as if the aesthetic of twelve tones is the only possible salvation for contemporary music". His view that Berg had taken <b>serialism</b> as far as it could go and that Schoenberg's music was now [...] "desert, stone soup, ersatz music, or poetic vitamins" [...] earned him the enmity of composers such as Pierre Boulez. Those disagreeing with Poulenc attempted to paint him as a relic of the pre-war era, frivolous and unprogressive. This led him to focus on his more serious works, and to try to persuade the French public to listen to them. In the US and Britain, with their strong choral traditions, his religious music was frequently performed, but performances in France were much rarer, so that the public and the critics were often unaware of his serious compositions.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} he wrote Connotations, Copland {{had come to the}} view that serial {{composition}} was [...] "like looking at a picture from a different point of view" [...] and used it [...] "with the hope that it would freshen and enrich my [...] technique." [...] Part of that changed viewpoint, Copland said, [...] "was that I began to hear chords that I wouldn't have heard otherwise. Heretofore, I had been thinking tonally, but this was a new way of moving tones about." [...] <b>Serialism</b> also allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices that had long concerned Copland and he had previously felt impossible to attain. One challenge Copland said he faced while he composed Connotations was [...] "to construct an overall line that had continuity, dramatic force and an inherent unity." [...] He stated that he had faced a similar challenge in his Orchestral Variations (his orchestration of the Piano Variations). He added that while dodecaphonic techniques supplied [...] "the building blocks" [...] for Connotations, it was up to him to supply [...] "the edifice" [...] that these blocks would eventually form.|$|E
2500|$|Integral <b>serialism</b> or total <b>serialism</b> {{is the use}} of {{series for}} aspects such as duration, dynamics, and {{register}} as well as pitch [...] Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post–World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are general <b>serialism</b> and multiple <b>serialism</b> [...]|$|E
2500|$|In music theory, <b>serialism</b> is {{a method}} or {{technique}} of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements. <b>Serialism</b> began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, though his contemporaries were also working to establish <b>serialism</b> as one example of post-tonal thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations. Other types of <b>serialism</b> also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called [...] "parameters"), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre. The idea of <b>serialism</b> is also applied in various ways in the visual arts, design, and architecture ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Serialism</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} post-war movements among the high modernist schools. <b>Serialism,</b> more specifically named [...] "integral" [...] or [...] "compound" [...] <b>serialism,</b> was led by composers such as Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna, Luigi Nono, and Karlheinz Stockhausen in Europe, and by Milton Babbitt, Donald Martino, Mario Davidovsky, and Charles Wuorinen in the United States. Some of their compositions use an ordered set or several such sets, which may be the basis for the whole composition, while others use [...] "unordered" [...] sets. The term is also often used for dodecaphony, or twelve-tone technique, which is alternatively regarded as the model for integral <b>serialism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|However, <b>serialism</b> is not {{by itself}} a system of composition, {{nor is it a}} style. Neither is pitch <b>serialism</b> {{necessarily}} incompatible with tonality, though it is most often used as a means of composing atonal music [...]|$|E
2500|$|In music, <b>serialism</b> [...] is {{a method}} or {{technique}} of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements. <b>Serialism</b> began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish <b>serialism</b> {{as a form of}} post-tonal thinking.

2500|$|<b>Serialism</b> of {{the first}} type is most {{specifically}} defined as the structural principle according to which a recurring series of ordered elements (normally a set—or row—of pitches or pitch classes) are used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity. <b>Serialism</b> is often broadly applied to all music written in what Arnold Schoenberg called [...] "The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ), or dodecaphony, and methods that evolved from his methods. It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series. In such usages post-Webernian <b>serialism</b> {{will be used to}} denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music. Other terms used to make the distinction are twelve-note <b>serialism</b> for the former, and integral <b>serialism</b> for the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Twelve-tone <b>serialism</b> first {{appeared}} in the 1920s, with antecedents predating that decade (instances of twelve-note passages occur in Liszt's Faust Symphony , [...] and in Bach , [...] ). Schoenberg was the composer most decisively involved in devising and demonstrating the fundamentals of twelve-tone <b>serialism,</b> though it is clear it is not the work of just one musician [...]|$|E
2500|$|Structures, Book I was {{a turning}} point for Boulez. Recognising a lack of {{expressive}} flexibility in the language (described in his essay [...] "At the Limit of Fertile Land...") Boulez loosened the strictness of total <b>serialism</b> into a more supple and strongly gestural music: [...] "I am trying to rid myself of my thumbprints and taboos", he wrote to Cage. His first venture into this new kind of <b>serialism</b> was a work for twelve solo voices titled Oubli signal lapidé (1952), but it was withdrawn after a single performance. Its material was reused in the 1970 composition Cummings ist der Dichter.|$|E
2500|$|That {{revolution}} entered {{its most}} extreme phase in 1950–52, when Boulez developed a technique in {{which not only}} pitch but other musical parameters—duration, dynamics, timbre and attack—were organised according to serial principles, an approach known as total <b>serialism</b> or punctualism. Messaien had already made an experiment in this direction in his Mode de valeurs et d’intensité for piano (1949). Boulez's first sketches towards total <b>serialism</b> appeared in parts of Livre pour quatuor (1948/49, revised 2011/12), a collection of movements for string quartet from which the players may choose at any one performance (foreshadowing Boulez’s later interest in variable form).|$|E
2500|$|Some music {{theorists have}} criticized <b>serialism</b> {{on the basis}} that the {{compositional}} strategies employed are often incompatible with the way information is extracted by the human mind from a piece of music. Nicolas Ruwet (1959) {{was one of the first}} to criticise <b>serialism</b> through a comparison with linguistic structures, citing theoretical claims by Boulez and Henri Pousseur, and taking as specific examples bars from Stockhausen's Klavierstücke I & II, and calling for a general re-examination of Webern's music. Ruwet specifically names three works as exempt from his criticism: Stockhausen's Zeitmaße and Gruppen, and Boulez's Le marteau sans maître [...]|$|E
2500|$|Cage's pre-chance works, {{particularly}} {{pieces from}} the late 1940s such as Sonatas and Interludes, earned critical acclaim: the Sonatas were performed at Carnegie Hall in 1949. Cage's adoption of chance operations in 1951 cost him a number of friendships and led to numerous criticisms from fellow composers. Adherents of <b>serialism</b> such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen dismissed indeterminate music; Boulez, who was once on friendly terms with Cage, criticized him for [...] "adoption of a philosophy tinged with Orientalism that masks a basic weakness in compositional technique." [...] Prominent critics of <b>serialism,</b> such as the Greek composer Iannis Xenakis, were similarly hostile towards Cage: for Xenakis, the adoption of chance in music was [...] "an abuse of language and [...] an abrogation of a composer's function." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Serialism</b> is {{a method}} , [...] "highly {{specialized}} technique" [...] , or [...] "way" [...] of composition. It may also be considered, [...] "a philosophy of life (Weltanschauung), a way of relating the human mind {{to the world and}} creating a completeness when dealing with a subject" [...]|$|E
2500|$|Technically speaking, Hanson {{rejected}} <b>serialism</b> {{with its}} rigid rules of development, but retained {{a fascination with}} the twelve-note scale and its full potentialities. This {{should not be taken}} to indicate, however, that he disdained melody. On the contrary, he has been described as [...] "a lyrical composer who thought naturally in evolving lines".|$|E
