5000|$|In Dune, {{there is}} only one source of melange: the sands of the planet Arrakis, colloquially known as Dune and millennia later called simply [...] "Rakis". Herbert notes in Dune that a pre-spice mass is [...] "the stage of fungusoid wild growth {{achieved}} when water is flooded into the excretions of Little Makers", the [...] "half-plant-half-animal deep-sand vector of the Arrakis sandworm". Gases are produced which result in [...] "a characteristic 'blow', exchanging the material from deep underground for the matter on the surface above it." [...] This blow is explosive in nature, erupting with enough force to kill anyone in the vicinity of it. Frank Herbert describes such a spice blow in the following passage from Dune:Then he heard the sand rumbling. Every Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the noises of worms or other desert life. Somewhere beneath him, the pre-spice mass had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had reached the critical stage of wild growth. A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous [...] "blow" [...] with a dust whirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand for whatever lay on the surface.Herbert writes that the pre-spice mass, [...] "after exposure to sun and air, becomes melange". [...] He later indicates its color in Children of Dune (1976), when Leto II passes [...] "the leprous blotches of <b>violet</b> <b>sand</b> where a spiceblow had erupted".|$|R
