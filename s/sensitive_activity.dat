We found that various human tumor cell lines that do not produce SF secrete factors that stimulate SF production by fibroblasts, suggesting a paracrine mechanism for regulation of SF production.

The logical consequence of such short-term and structural evolutions is that companies in the arms industry are looking to access markets beyond national borders.

Using this method we found two active revertants of the inactive AsnlO 2 trypsin mutant, by screen-ing- 4. 4 X lo 4 random mutants that were generated by the polymerase chain reaction on a cDNA fragment.

40|$|The {{photochemistry}} of vesicular and detergent-solubilized preparations of plasma membrane-associated ATPase {{was investigated}} in Rosa damascena. The cholate-solubilized ATPase activity fractionated into two peaks on a Sephadex G- 150 column with simple, but different ultraviolet (UV) sensitivities. The larger enzyme was UV sensitive; the smaller enzyme was relatively insensitive. The activity of both ATPase fractions depended on environment: both were inactive in cholate, relatively inactive in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, and active in phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylserine. The UV sensitivities of both fractions also depended on their environment. For the UV sensitive fraction, the action spectrum differed in the 300 to 400 nanometers range when the fraction was irradiated with and without lipids. For the resistant fraction, UV sensitivity at 290 nanometers differed (up to 6 -fold) in different lipids. The resistant fraction solubilized in octylglucoside had an action spectrum {{very different from that}} in cholate or in lipid vesicles. The absorption spectra of the different preparations reflected the action spectra. For both UV sensitive and insensitive fractions, the action spectra for photoinactivation had peaks at 290 nanometers, suggesting that the chromophores were tryptophanyl residues. The loss of ATPase activity was strictly correlated with the loss of fluorescence from tryptophan in the partially purified enzymes. Cs+ protected the UV <b>sensitive</b> <b>activity</b> but not the insensitive one.

40|$|A cytochemical {{method for}} the light and {{electron}} microscope localization of the K- and Mg-dependent phosphatase component of the Na- K-ATPase complex was applied to rat kidney cortex, utilizing p- nitrophenylphosphate (NPP) as substrate. Localization of K-N-ATPase activity in kidneys fixed by perfusion with 1 % paraformaldehyde - 0. 25 % glutaraldehyde demonstrated that distal tubules are the major cortical site for this sodium transport enzyme. Cortical collecting tubules were moderately reactive, whereas activity in proximal tubules was resolved only after short fixation times and long incubations. In all cases, K-NPPase activity was restricted to the cytoplasmic side of the basolateral plasma membranes, which are characterized in these neplron segments by elaborate folding of the cell surface. Although the rat K- NPPase appeared almost completely insensitive to ouabain with this cytochemical medium, parallel studies with the more glycoside-sensitive rabbit kidney indicated that K-NPPase activity in these nephron segments is sensitive to this inhibitor. In addition to K-NPPase, nonspecific alkaline phosphatase also hydrolyzed NPP. The latter could be differentiated cytochemically from the specific phosphatase, since alkaline phosphatase was K-independent, insensitive to ouabain, and specifically inhibited by cysteine. 	Unlike K-NPPPase, alkaline phosphatase was localized primarily to the extracellular side of the microvillar border of proximal tubules. A small amount of cysteine- <b>sensitive</b> <b>activity</b> was resolved along peritubular surfaces of proximal tubules. Distal tubules were unreactive. In comparative studies, Mg- ATPase activity was localized along the extracellular side of the luminal and basolateral surfaces of proximal and distal tubules and the basolateral membranes of collecting tubules...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{in-depth}} analysis of stellar activity {{and its effects}} on radial velocity (RV) for the M 2 dwarf GJ 176 based on spectra taken over 10 years from the High Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. These data are supplemented with spectra from previous observations with the HIRES and HARPS spectrographs, and V- and R-band photometry taken over 6 years at the Dyer and Fairborn observatories. Previous studies of GJ 176 revealed a super-Earth exoplanet in an 8. 8 -day orbit. However, the velocities of this star are also known to be contaminated by activity, particularly at the 39 -day stellar rotation period. We have examined the magnetic activity of GJ 176 using the sodium I D lines, which {{have been shown to be}} a <b>sensitive</b> <b>activity</b> tracer in cool stars. In addition to rotational modulation, we see evidence of a long-term trend in our Na I D index, which may be part of a long-period activity cycle. The sodium index is well correlated with our RVs, and we show that this activity trend drives a corresponding slope in RV. Interestingly, the rotation signal remains in phase in photometry, but not in the spectral activity indicators. We interpret this phenomenon as the result of one or more large spot complexes or active regions which dominate the photometric variability, while the spectral indices are driven by the overall magnetic activity across the stellar surface. In light of these results, we discuss the potential for correcting activity signals in the RVs of M dwarfs. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E
