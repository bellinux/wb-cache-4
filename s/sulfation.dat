40|$|Although heparan sulfate (HS) {{serves as}} an initial {{receptor}} for the binding of both herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) and HSV- 2 to cell surfaces, the two serotypes differ in epidemiology, cell tropism, and ability to compete for viral receptors in vitro. These observations are not necessarily contradictory and can be explained if the two serotypes recognize different structural features of HS. To compare the specific features of HS important for the binding and infection of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2, we took advantage of structural similarities between heparin and cell surface HS and compared the abilities of chemically modified heparin compounds to inhibit plaque formation. We found that the antiviral activity of heparin for both serotypes was independent of anticoagulant activity. Moreover, specific negatively charged regions of the polysaccharide, including N <b>sulfations</b> and the carboxyl groups, are key structural features for interactions of both HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 with cell surfaces since N desulfation or carboxyl reduction abolished heparin's antiviral activity. In contrast, 6 -O <b>sulfations</b> and 2 -, 3 -O <b>sulfations</b> are important determinants primarily for HSV- 1 infection. The O-desulfated heparins {{had little or no}} inhibitory effect on HSV- 1 infection but inhibited HSV- 2 infection. Using a series of intertypic recombinant mutant viruses, we found that susceptibility to O-desulfated heparins can be transferred to HSV- 1 by the gene for glycoprotein C of HSV- 2 (gC- 2). This supports the notion that the envelope glycoproteins of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 interact with different affinities for different structural features of heparin. To determine if the modified heparin compounds inhibited plaque formation by competing with cell surface HS for viral attachment, binding studies were also performed. As anticipated, most compounds inhibited binding and plaque formation in parallel. However, several compounds inhibited the binding of HSV- 1 to cells during the initial attachment period at 4 degrees C; this inhibitory effect was reversed when the cells and inoculum were shifted to 37 degrees C. This temperature-dependent differential response to modified heparin compounds was evident primarily when glycoprotein C of HSV- 1 (gC- 1) was present in the virion envelope. Minimal temperature-dependent differences were seen for HSV- 1 with gC- 1 deleted and for HSV- 2. These results suggest differences in the interactions of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 with cell surface HS that may influence cell tropism...|$|R

In this work, we show that ShhNp (lipidated and membrane-tethered Sonic hedgehog) is released from Bosc 23 cells by metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding, resulting in a soluble and biologically active morphogen. ShhNp shedding is increased by ADAM 17 coexpression and cholesterol depletion of cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and is reduced by metalloprotease inhibitors as well as ADAM 17 RNA interference. We also show that the amount of shed ShhNp is modulated by extracellular heparan sulfate (HS) and that ShhNp shedding depends on specific HS <b>sulfations.</b> Based on those data, we suggest new roles for metalloproteases, including but not restricted to ADAM 17, and for HS-proteoglycans in Hedgehog signaling...|$|R

Attempting to decode this diversity, we analyzed C. elegans animals lacking three HS-modifying enzymes, glucuronyl C 5 -epimerase, heparan 6 O-sulfotransferase, and 2 O-sulfotransferase. Each of the mutant animals exhibit distinct as well as overlapping axonal and cellular guidance defects in specific neuron classes. We have linked individual HS modifications to two specific guidance systems, the sax- 3 /Robo and kal- 1 /Anosmin- 1 systems, whose activity is dependent on different HS modifications in different cellular contexts.

Metazoan genomes encode two putative PAPS transporters (PAPST 1 and PAPST 2), which have been shown in vitro to preferentially transport PAPS across membranes. We have identified the C. elegans orthologs of PAPST 1 and PAPST 2 and named them pst- 1 and pst- 2, respectively. We show that pst- 1 is essential for viability in C. elegans, functions non-redundantly with pst- 2, and can act non-autonomously to mediate essential functions. Additionally, pst- 1 is required for specific aspects of nervous system development rather than for formation of the major neuronal ganglia or fascicles. Neuronal defects correlate with reduced complexity of HS modification patterns, as measured by direct biochemical analysis.

Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating disaccharide galactose units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This <b>sulfation</b> is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse showed a significant up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice.

25|$|NET has a {{terminal}} half-life of 5.2 to 12.8 hours, {{with a mean}} terminal half-life of 8.0 hours. The metabolism of NET {{is very similar to}} that of testosterone (and nandrolone) and is mainly via reduction of the Δ4 double bond to 5α- and 5β-dihydro-NET, which is followed by the reduction of the C3 keto group to the four isomers of 3,5-tetrahydro-NET. These transformations are catalyzed by 5α- and 5β-reductase and 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues such as the pituitary gland, uterus, prostate gland, vagina, and breast. With the exception of 3α,5α- and 3β,5α-tetrahydro-NET, which have significant affinity for the ER and are estrogenic to some degree, the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of NET are inactive in terms of affinity for sex steroid receptors (specifically, the PR, AR, and ER). A small amount of NET is also converted by aromatase into EE. NET is metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation as well, mainly by CYP3A4. Some conjugation (including glucuronidation and <b>sulfation)</b> of NET and its metabolites occurs in spite of steric hindrance by the ethynyl group at C17α.

40|$|Neuronal {{development}} {{is the result of}} a multitude of neural migrations, which require extensive cell-cell communication. These processes are modulated by extracellular matrix components, such as heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides. HS is molecularly complex as a result of nonrandom modifications of the sugar moieties, including <b>sulfations</b> in specific positions. We report here mutations in HS 6 -O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS 6 ST 1) in families with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). IHH manifests as incomplete or absent puberty and infertility as a result of defects in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron development or function. IHH-associated HS 6 ST 1 mutations display reduced activity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that HS 6 ST 1 and the complex modifications of extracellular sugars are critical for normal development in humans. Genetic experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans reveal that HS cell-specifically regulates neural branching in vivo in concert with other IHH-associated genes, including kal- 1, the FGF receptor, and FGF.

25|$|The {{structure}} and function of the Golgi apparatus are intimately linked. Individual stacks have different assortments of enzymes, allowing for progressive processing of cargo proteins as they travel from the cisternae to the trans Golgi face. Enzymatic reactions within the Golgi stacks occur exclusively near its membrane surfaces, where enzymes are anchored. This feature {{is in contrast to}} the ER, which has soluble proteins and enzymes in its lumen. Much of the enzymatic processing is post-translational modification of proteins. For example, phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins occurs in the early CGN. Cis cisterna are associated with the removal of mannose residues. Removal of mannose residues and addition of N-acetylglucosamine occur in medial cisternae. Addition of galactose and sialic acid occurs in the trans cisternae. <b>Sulfation</b> of tyrosines and carbohydrates occurs within the TGN. Other general post-translational modifications of proteins include the addition of carbohydrates (glycosylation) and phosphates (phosphorylation). Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. Another important function of the Golgi apparatus is in the formation of proteoglycans. Enzymes in the Golgi append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans are long unbranched polysaccharide molecules present in the extracellular matrix of animals.|$|E

However, their synthesis still remains a considerable challenge. A general approach to the synthesis of sulfated carbohydrates was examined in which sulfate group is incorporated at the beginning of the syntheses as a protected sulfodiester. Towards this end, a series of sulfuryl imidazolium salts (SIS), a new class of sulfating agents, was prepared and examined as reagents for incorporating 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethyl-protected sulfate esters into monosaccharides. The SIS that contained a 1, 2 -dimethylimidazolium moiety proved to be a superior sulfating agent compared to SIS bearing no alkyl groups or bulkier alkyl groups on the imidazolium ring. Difficult O- and N- <b>sulfations</b> that required prolonged reaction times and a large excess of the SIS bearing a 1 -methylimidazolium group were achieved in high yield and in less time when employing less than half the 1, 2 -dimethylimidazolium derivative.

These studies revealed some of the limitations of the sulfate protecting group approach to the synthesis of sulfated oligosaccharides.

To define the specific features of HS important for viral binding, we {{took advantage of the}} structural similarities between heparin and cell surface HS and compared the ability of chemically modified heparin compounds to inhibit the binding of viral particles to the cell surface and subsequent plaque formation. Because binding presumably involves multiple, complex interactions between both known heparin-binding glycoproteins, gC and gB, and cell surface HS, we compared the effects of modified heparin compounds on the binding and subsequent plaque formation of wild-type and gC-negative strains of HSV- 1 and, in select cases, the binding of gB-negative virus to cells. We identified specific structural features of heparin essential for the inhibition of viral binding. For example, both N-sulfation and 6 -O-sulfation must be important determinants since desulfation of heparin at these sites abolished or decreased the antiviral activity of heparin. Moreover, we found that the antiviral activity of heparin was independent of its anticoagulant activity. Carboxyl-reduced and 2 -, 3 -O-desulfated heparin selectively inhibited binding of gC-positive viruses (wild-type or a gB-negative strain) to cells, but had little or no inhibitory effect on binding and subsequent plaque formation for a gC-deletion virus.

Functionally distinct, cell type-dependent HS modification patterns arise {{as the result}} of a conserved network of enzymes that catalyze deacetylations, <b>sulfations,</b> and epimerizations in specific positions of the sugar residues. To understand the genetic interactions of the enzymes during the HS modification process, we have measured the composition of HS purified from mutant strains of Caenorhabditis elegans. From these measurements we have developed a genetic network model of HS modification. We find the interactions to be highly recursive positive feed-forward and negative feedback loops. Our genetic analyses show that the HS C- 5 epimerase hse- 5, the HS 2 -O-sulfotransferase hst- 2, or the HS 6 -O-sulfotransferase hst- 6 inhibit N-sulfation. In contrast, hse- 5 stimulates both 2 -O- and 6 -O-sulfation and, hst- 2 and hst- 6 inhibit 6 -O- and 2 -O-sulfation, respectively. The effects of hst- 2 and hst- 6 on N-sulfation, 6 -O-sulfation, and 2 -O-sulfation appear largely dependent on hse- 5 function. This core of regulatory interactions is further modulated by 6 -O-endosulfatase activity (sul- 1). 47 % of all 6 -O-sulfates get removed from HS and this editing process is dependent on hst- 2, thereby providing additional negative feedback between 2 -O- and 6 -O-sulfation.

In the present study, we investigated the transcellular migration of HIV- 1 as a cell-free virus through primary genital epithelial cells (PGECs). The absence of CD 4 on PGECs implicates an unusual entry pathway for HIV- 1. We found that syndecans are abundantly expressed on PGECs and promote the initial attachment and subsequent entry of HIV- 1 through PGECs. Although CXCR 4 and CCR 5 do not contribute to HIV- 1 attachment, they enhance viral entry and transcytosis through PGECs. Importantly, HIV- 1 exploits both syndecans and chemokine receptors to ensure successful cell-free transport through the genital epithelium. HIV- 1 -syndecan interactions rely on specific residues in the V 3 of gp 120 and specific <b>sulfations</b> within syndecans. We found no obvious correlation between co-receptor usage and {{the capacity of the}} virus to transcytose. Since viruses isolated after sexual transmission are mainly R 5 viruses, this suggests that the properties conferring virus replication after transmission are distinct from those conferring cell-free virus transcytosis through the genital epithelium.

50|$|There are no known, {{independently}} verified ways {{to reverse}} <b>sulfation.</b> There are commercial products claiming to achieve desulfation through various techniques (such as pulse charging), {{but there are}} no peer-reviewed publications verifying their claims. <b>Sulfation</b> prevention remains the best course of action, by periodically fully charging the lead-acid batteries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfation</b> is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) in the Golgi apparatus. The {{reaction}} catalyzed by TPST is {{a transfer}} of sulfate from the universal sulfate donor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the side-chain hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. <b>Sulfation</b> sites are tyrosine residues exposed {{on the surface of}} the protein typically surrounded by acidic residues; a detailed description of the characteristics of the <b>sulfation</b> site is available from PROSITE (PROSITE pattern: PS00003)http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/nicedoc.pl?PS00003 and predicted by an on-line tool named the Sulfinator http://web.expasy.org/sulfinator/http://web.expasy.org/sulfinator/sulfinator-doc.html. Two types of tyrosylprotein sulftotransferases (TPST-1 and TPST2) have been identified.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of the ultracapacitor integrated in the UltraBattery acts to limit the formation of hard <b>sulfation</b> inside the cell. REF This supports the battery’s ability to operate for long periods in a partial SoC where the battery operates more efficiently. REF Conventional VRLAs are somewhat constrained {{to operate in the}} inefficient region toward the top of their charge capacity in order to protect them against damage by <b>sulfation.</b> Research continues into the reasons why the {{presence of}} the ultracapacitor reduces <b>sulfation</b> so successfully. Experimental results show that the presence of carbon within VRLA cells has some mitigating effect but the protective effects of the parallel-connected ultracapacitor within the UltraBattery are much more significant. Hund et al., for instance, found that typical VRLA battery failure modes (water loss, negative plate <b>sulfation,</b> and grid corrosion) are all minimized in the UltraBattery. Hund’s results also showed that the UltraBattery, used in a high rate partial state of charge application, exhibits reduced gassing, mimimized negative plate hard <b>sulfation,</b> enhanced power performance and minimized operating temperature compared with conventional VRLA cells.|$|E
