40|$|The {{problem with}} {{high water level}} alarm that led to power {{shutdown}} did first occurred on the 3 rd of May 2008 at Ringhals 1. In the beginning there was a theory that boiling triggered the measurement system that consists of a floating switch, {{it has not been}} verified if the alarm was triggered by steam or liquid. During the investigation process data was collected from Vattenfalls’ information systems and a RELAP 5 model of the drainage system. This model was built with the purpose of simulating different scenario and to gather data that Vattenfall was lacking. It was first stated from Vattenfall that power shutdown was avoided on the 9 th of May due to opening a valve more gradually. Analyzes comparing the cases 3 rd of May and 9 th of May show that the conditions was not equal enough to make the conclusion. Model simulations show that both <b>super</b> <b>heaters</b> take half of the mass flow (assuming negligible differences) from the high pressure turbine under all circumstances, therefore the crossflow pipe takes the other half in cases on the 3 rd and 9 th of May 2008. A theory that one of the <b>super</b> <b>heaters</b> at 3 rd of May was overloaded is not the case according to the model. Liquid that was accumulated and dumped from pipe systems and then triggered the high level alarm was investigated. Results show that the pipe system after the drainage tank can acquire enough water if it is assumed that the water is pushed up into the tank from a back flow. The main goal should be to examine the measured data that occurs more than 3 hours before the high level alarm is triggered and caused a power shutdown at 3 rd of May.

50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> bank, pendant <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> platens, and pendant final <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> bank. The <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> and the <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|E

30|$|Fouling is the {{formation}} of sintered ash deposits on conventional heating surfaces such as reheaters and <b>super</b> <b>heaters</b> [40] that are not directly exposed to flame radiation. It takes place as the suspended fly ash cools down along with flue gases [41]. Excessive fouling may {{lead to an increase}} in gas temperature and deposition rate which leads to continually changing conditions in the boiler, hence, reducing its efficiency [42]. Temperature variation for high temperature fouling lies in the range from 900 to 1300  °C, and for low temperature fouling, this range is from 300 to 900  °C [38]. Fouling in boilers is caused due to reduction in heat transfer, which further leads to sufficient loss of superheat and hot flue gas temperatures [43, 44]. Major factors that lead to the removal of fouling are the deposit strength and the adhesive bonding between the heat transfer surface and ash deposit. Deposit removal process involves breaking of deposit matrix and/or breaking of adhesive bonding. In coal-fired power plant boilers a lot of production problems are generated due to fouling. Lack in timely maintenance and cleaning can also lead to fouling problem [45].|$|R
40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of coal-fired power plants has been a goal for the power generation industry for many years, and would bring benefits not only in cheaper electricity but also with respect to reducing the carbon emissions. Such increases in efficiency are achieved through thermodynamic means, principally by increasing steam temperatures and pressures. The development and qualifications of high-temperature materials for critical components such as <b>super</b> <b>heaters,</b> thick section boiler components and turbine {{is the key to}} reaching such advance steam conditions Future high efficiency coal-fired steam power plants will operate at higher temperatures. Important efforts to develop new steels to protect high creep strength steels in order to allow operation of steam turbines at 650 ºC, corresponding to efficiencies of 46 - 48 %, are being carried out worldwide. Under steam atmosphere, existing ferritic and austenitic alloys, commonly employed in steam plants, form Cr containing oxides which become less protective at temperatures higher than 550 º C. New alloy development activities have been very successful in improving the creep strength at higher temperatures, generally by lowering the chromium content[225, 226]. However, when the Cr content is lower that 10 w%, such as P 92, very thick oxide scales form, consisting of a top layer of Fe 3 O 4 and an inner zone mainly (Fe, Cr) 3 O 4 spinels (figure 77). These scales spall causing metal cross-section loss (figure 78 and 79), blockage and erosion of components located down-stream and also produce a thermal insulating effect resulting in overheating [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Agglomeration problem mainly {{occurs on}} the fireside in the {{fluidized}} bed boilers [27]. Agglomeration {{is basically the}} ash-related problem of biomass-fired boilers. Ashes which are formed from high-sulfur and low-ash fuel agglomerate, if they are prone to sulfating condition for long time. The degree of sulphation varies with both time and temperature. It varies proportionally with increase in temperature and time. Ashes agglomerate {{when there is a}} production of 50 – 60 % or more amount of calcium sulfate and Ca–K-silicates in the deposit. Loop seal and bed ashes are more prone to agglomeration than fly ash. Fly ash produces weaker deposits than bed ashes, but they all will agglomerate with respect to time [28]. The rate of agglomeration increases if the temperature increases from 850 to 950  °C. Agglomeration occurs first due to carbonation and then due to sulphation at lower temperatures [29]. The agglomeration tendency of ash increases with the increase in iron or alkali metal content [27]. Silvennoinen reported that alkali silicate mixture of low melting point is produced when alkali-rich ash reacts with the free quartz which is present in the sand and this mixture forms an adhesive bond between the fluidizing bed particles, thus leading to agglomeration [30]. The low-melting alkali chlorides may enhance the stickiness of fly ash particles and increase the ash deposition rate on the superheater tubes. The deposited alkali chlorides may increase the corrosion rate of <b>super</b> <b>heaters,</b> as the chlorides may form low melting point eutectics and cause aggressive liquid-phase corrosion [31].|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{topic of}} this thesis is inorganic gases from combustion that form particles via gas-to-particle conversion. The particles formed in gas-to-particle conversion {{have an effect}} on fouling of the <b>super</b> <b>heaters</b> and corrosion in boilers. These are the main reasons for unscheduled shutdowns and tube failure. Aerosol particlesformed from inorganic gases are challenging to study in boiler conditions. To be able to measure the particles formed via gas-to-particle conversion, the related processes need to be isolated from the boiler to a smaller and easily controllable environment. The experiments of this thesis were conducted in laboratory environment. The most important facilities used were high-temperature chambers, particle sampling and particle instruments. The ﬁrst high-temperature chamber is used for the vaporization of the reactants, and the latter is used to achieve the gas-to-particle equilibrium. Water solution of solid reactants is fed to the chamber in order to control the amount of reactants. In addition, different gases are fed to the chamber. The reactants used in this thesis were selected from black liquor recovery boiler process. Black liquor composition is highly affected by the quality of the wood used in pulping, and that is why the reactant concentrations should be controllable. Black liquor consists mainly of sodium and sulphur but also of chloride from the wood. The chloride has been observed to be problematic since it causes corrosion in recovery boilers. A sample was taken from the second high-temperature chamber by diluting it in three steps before the particle measurement equipment. The measurement results show two mode particle size distributions. Results indicate that one of the mode is formed in high-temperature conditions and the other in the dilution. It was discovered that alkali sulphate formation is the key component of the particle formation in the second high-temperature chamber. Indirect references of alkali chloride formation are observed by studying the nucleation mode. The nucleation mode particle number is decreased when temperature of the second high-temperature chamber is lowered because more alkali chloride compounds is transferred to the particle phase already in high temperature conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} a sum {{of a master}} thesis carried out at Lulekraft AB, with the purpose to size a flue gas {{recirculation}} (FGR) system. The goals were to decrease the amount of NO$_x$ in the flue gases, to minimize the fluctations of {{the temperature of the}} steam in the <b>super</b> <b>heaters</b> and to investigate how the efficiency changes with implemented FGR. There are numerous methods for reduction of NOx emissions well described in the litterature, both from modifications of the burners and from methods reagarding the flue gas path. Modifications in the flue gas path can be e. g. FGR or SCR (selective catalytic reduction). Burner modifications can be e. g. flame less combustion or staging combustion. When air is used as heat carrier the temperature fluctuates when the operator is switching fuel. With implemented FGR the fluctations can be minimized with respect to the specific heat capacity. That is higher for the flue gases as a heat carrier than that for air. This leads to higher power output with shorter time for heating up the steam as a result, compared to air as heat carrier. Results show that the adiabatic flame temperature decreases with higher flow of FGR, but also with higher flow of the extra supplied air. The difference can be explained as follows: For FGR the O 2 concentration in the flue gases is constant, while for the extra supplied air the O 2 concentration increases. With a decreased flame temperature the emissions of thermal NOx will be reduced, {{due to the fact that}} thermal NOx is approximately exponentially dependent of the flame temperature. Results also show that the efficiency increases with implemented FGR. This is because that it is possible to increase the power input in the water/steam cycle. The flue gas temperature difference, along the flue gas path, between FGR and supplied extra air can be neglected. This justifies the increased power input in the water/steam-cycle. The efficiency when extra air is supplied is 76. 3 %, and with FGR the efficiency is 82. 5 %. Validerat; 20150216 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. In {{a thermal}} power plant, the boiler is a portion {{responsible}} of converting incoming water into steam which {{is followed by}} various apparatus which turn it to super heated steam. This steam is supplied to steam turbines. The dryer the incoming steam greater is {{the efficiency of the}} turbines and greater is the electricity produced. The general issue with the incoming water to the boiler is it is filled dissolved gases, very tiny particles and other stuff that damage the boiler and the adjoining apparatus. The presence of these cause damage to the boiler and other devices on the longer run and reduce their lifestyle. Even a single replacement of the boiler coupled with other apparatus can cause exaggerating expenditure. In general, the apparatus attached with a boiler are <b>super</b> <b>heaters,</b> steam turbines and condensate pump. The dissolved gases present in water can react with the walls of these, form oxides, and corrode them. With time, the walls of these devices develop cracks and hence loose their working capability. This project comes up with a pre set apparatus before water is let to the boiler. This set up cleans the water of all visible impurities so that they are not deposited at any point in the whole process. Next, it goes ahead and gets rid of most of the dissolved gases present that have chances of reacting with the boiler or other following apparatus following boiler. In this way, a sure and reliable set up can be installed to improve the lifetime of the apparatus used in the power plant. This will end up saving cost at a very high level. This project depicts and explains such a set up and uses SCADA to present its functioning. With the help of SCADA, this system becomes foolproof by installing artificial intelligence by the use of sensors and alarms.

50|$|To {{significantly}} {{reduce the amount of}} work on designing a new engine and speed up the order, it was decided to base the project on the design of the Ел engine. To reduce costs and accelerate production of steam cylinders, brass bushings were used, and the cast iron dome was pressed, and the firebox was now welded. Because of the possibility of the motion locking up, Zyablova valves were replaced with valves of the Celler type. These valves allowed saturated steam directly into the cylinders while preventing combustion gases from the firebox to enter. The number of tubes for the <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> elements was increased from 28 to 35, raising the superheater area to 76.2 m2. The evaporative heating surface of the boiler was therefore decreased to 229.2 m2 (with the number of boiler tubes reduced to 162). Due to the increase in weight the engine, and the possible damage in transit across the ocean, the thickness of the frame’s sidewalls was increased from 114.3 to 127 mm. For supplying coal to the firebox, tenders were equipped with an HT-1 automatic stoker. In addition, there were a few minor improvements. Otherwise, the locomotives were unchanged.|$|E
50|$|A {{superheater}} {{increases the}} distance between the throttle and the cylinders in the steam circuit and thus reduces the immediacy of throttle action. To counteract this, some later steam locomotives were fitted with a front-end throttle - placed in the smokebox after the superheater. Such locomotives can sometimes be identified by an external throttle rod that stretches the whole length of the boiler, with a crank {{on the outside of the}} smokebox. This arrangement also allows superheated steam to be used for auxiliary appliances, such as the dynamo and air pumps. Another benefit of the front end throttle is that superheated steam is immediately available. With the dome throttle, it took quite some time before the <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> actually provided benefits in efficiency. One can think of it in this way: if one opens saturated steam from the boiler to the superheater it goes straight through the superheater units and to the cylinders which doesn't leave much time for the steam to be superheated. With the front-end throttle, steam is in the superheater units while the engine is sitting at the station and that steam is being superheated. Then when the throttle is opened, superheated steam goes to the cylinders immediately.|$|E

The performance of the power plant was estimated by a mathematical modelling which considers the off-design operating conditions of each component.

40|$|Power {{generation}} through decentralized {{small scale}} CHP would facilitate {{the use of}} biomass as an energy source, with the externally fired gas turbine (EFGT) being a promising technology due to its high electrical efficiency. In an EFGT hot flue gases are heat-exchanged with an air cycle, driving the turbine. The operation requires higher flue gas temperatures than other technologies, for example steam turbines, to achieve optimal performance.  The operating conditions subjects the high temperature heat exchanger (HT-HE) to both physical and chemical stress, with the corrosion related issues yet to be solved. Problems concerning deposit formation and corrosion, on for example <b>super</b> <b>heaters</b> and heat exchangers, when firing biomass are important issues even in commercially available technologies, where the choice of fuel and fuel additives together with component design and choice of material plays important roles {{in order to minimize}} the problems. The significantly higher temperatures of the heat transferring surfaces for an EFGT entails combustion deposit related problems less studied. The evaluation of turbine control, deposit formation and corrosion as well as design of the HT-HE and system integration will enable the development of the EFGT technology for applications with small- and medium-size biomass combustion. In this work four potential HT-HE alloys of various grades have been evaluated with respect to corrosion resistance, when exposed to alkali salts and salt mixtures in the KCl-K 2 CO 3 -K 2 SO 4 system. The exposures were done in a tube furnace during 24 h for each experiment at four temperature levels between 700 – 1000 oC. Morphological and elemental analysis of the alloy surface and corrosion layers was performed with SEM-EDS. The presence of KCl in the salt caused the most severe corrosion attacks while the corrosion attacks of the pure sulfate and carbonate were more modest. Significant differences between the four materials were observed. X 20 experienced severe corrosion, with corrosion scale formation in most cases. The KCl-containing salts caused 253 MA to form corrosion scales at all temperatures, while the corrosion resistance to other salts was fairly good. Inconel 600 had the second best overall corrosion resistance. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that in some cases the alloy was surpassed by 253 MA.

During the commissioning phase and first months of operation the start-up procedure has been optimised for the solar field and turbine system resulting in a reduced start-up time. The DSG process can be controlled well in the evaporator and <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> section securing a safe operation of the solar field and keeping live steam parameters in an acceptable range for the turbine even at fluctuating DNI. Apart from pressure control also control of the plant’s electrical power output is possible, depending on DNI and electricity demand...|$|E
40|$|Cause {{of failure}} of two {{adjacent}} <b>super</b> <b>heater</b> tubes made of Cr-Mo steel of a coal based 60  MW {{thermal power plant}} has been portrayed in present investigation. Oxide deposits were found on internal surface of tubes. Deposits created significant resistance to heat transfer and resulted in undesirable rise in component temperature. This situation, in turn, aggravated the condition of gas side that was exposed to high temperature. Localized heating coarsened carbides as well as propelled precipitation of new brittle phases along grain boundary resulting in embrittlement of tube material. Continuous exposure to high temperature softened the tube material and tube wall was thinned down with bulging toward outside. Creep void formation along grain boundary was observed and steered intergranular cracking. All these effects contributed synergistically and tubes were failed ultimately due to overload under high Hoop stress...|$|E
