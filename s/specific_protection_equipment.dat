50|$|IEC 60870-5-103 IEC103 is a {{standard}} for power system control and associated communications. It defines a companion standard that enables interoperability between <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> and devices of a control system in a substation. The device complying with this standard can send the information using two methods for data transfer - either using the explicitly specified application service data units (ASDU) or using generic services for transmission of all the possible information. The standard supports some <b>specific</b> <b>protection</b> functions and provides the vendor a facility to incorporate its own protective functions on private data ranges.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{infection}} control measures, breakthrough transmission of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) occurred for many hospital workers in Hong Kong. We conducted a case-control study of 72 hospital workers with SARS and 144 matched controls. Inconsistent use of goggles, gowns, gloves, and caps {{was associated with}} a higher risk for SARS infection (unadjusted odds ratio 2. 42 to 20. 54, p < 0. 05). The likelihood of SARS infection was strongly associated with the amount of personal <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> perceived to be inadequate, having < 2 hours of {{infection control}} training, and not understanding infection control procedures. No significant differences existed between the case and control groups in the proportion of workers who performed high-risk procedures, reported minor <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> problems, or had social contact with SARS-infected persons. Perceived inadequacy of personal <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> supply, infection control training < 2 hours, and inconsistent use of personal <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> when in contact with SARS patients were significant independent risk factors for SARS infection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Photodamage is {{partially}} mitigated by darker skin pigmentation, but immune suppression, photoaging and cataracts occur among individuals with all skin types. Methods To assess practices and acceptability to Black African mothers of sun <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> {{for their children}} living in a rural area, participants were recruited {{at the time of}} their child’s 18 -month vaccinations. Mothers completed a baseline questionnaire on usual sun behaviours and sun protection practices. They were then provided with sun <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> and advice. A follow-up questionnaire was administered two weeks later. Results Mothers reported that during the week prior to the baseline questionnaire, children spent on average less than 1 hour of time outdoors (most often spent in the shade). Most mothers (97 %) liked the sun <b>protection</b> <b>equipment.</b> However, many (78 of 86) reported that their child did not like any of the sun <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> and two-thirds stated that the sun <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> was not easy to use. Conclusions Among Black Africans in rural northern South Africa, we found a mismatch between parental preferences and child acceptance for using sun protection when outdoors. A better understanding of the health risks of incidental excess sun exposure and potential benefits of sun protection is required among Black Africans...|$|R

This study will transform physical characteristics into electrical characteristics such as pipe metal, pipe insulator, conductors in corrosion protection circuit and earth as parameters in the analysis. The result of this simulation found that the transient voltage will rise higher if length is longer and higher than safety allowance of pipe corrosion <b>protection</b> <b>equipment.</b> To limit this over voltage, this study used proper lightning <b>protection</b> <b>equipment</b> characteristics. From the result of simulation and the proper characteristics of lightning <b>protection</b> <b>equipment,</b> the transient voltage was limited follow BS 60950 standard.
