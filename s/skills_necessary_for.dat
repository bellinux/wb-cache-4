These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback.

5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E

40|$|Summary {{writing has}} long been {{perceived}} as a core academic literacy <b>skill</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> students studying in American universities to achieve academic success, yet limited {{research has been conducted}} with regards to the actual summary writing tasks that L 2 writers encounter across the curriculum. To fill in this gap, this qualitative study examined the summary writing experiences and practices of a group of international undergraduate students as they navigate across different disciplinary courses. The major findings of the study will be discussed in this chap-ter, and pedagogical implications outlined. In Anglophone universities, reading-based writing tasks are commonly assigned (Bridgeman & Carlson, 1984; Hale et al., 1996), and students are often expected to effectively work with source texts in various assignments, such as reading responses, critical reviews, and research papers. Of the major source-based assignments, summary writing {{has long been}} perceived as a core academic literacy <b>skill</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> students studying in American universities to achieve academic success. Because of this, ESL writing programs, which are designed to socialize second language writers into the target academic community, often incorporate summary writing as {{an important component of the}} curriculum. ESL students enrolled in such courses are provided with ample opportunities to practice summarization skill based on the readings selected by the writing teachers. Despite this central focus on the teaching of summarization, however, ESL writing courses often do not seem to take into consideration L 2 writers’ actual uses of summarization in disciplinary courses.

25|$|Tuvaluans {{are well}} known for their {{seafaring}} skills, with the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute on Amatuku motu (island), Funafuti, providing training to approximately 120 marine cadets each year so {{that they have the}} <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> employment as seafarers on merchant shipping. The Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union (TOSU) is the only registered trade union in Tuvalu. It represents workers on foreign ships.

The ADB estimates that, at any one time, about 15% of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers. Job opportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is to monitor compliance with the boat's tuna fishing licence.|$|E
25|$|Historians have contrasted the {{efficiency}} of Somerset's takeover of power in 1547 with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. Until recent decades, Somerset's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class. In the early 20th century this line {{was taken by the}} influential A. F. Pollard, to be echoed by Edward VI's 1960s biographer W. K. Jordan. A more critical approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the mid-1970s.

25|$|OBE can be {{compared}} across different institutions. On an individual level, institutions can look at what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the student would be at within a new institution. On an institutional level, institutions can compare themselves, by checking to see what outcomes they have in common, and find places where they may need improvement, based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions. The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease. The institutions can compare outcomes to determine what credits to award the student. The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly, leading to increased movement of students. These outcomes also work for school to work transitions. A potential employer can look at records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved. They can then determine if the potential employee has the <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the job.|$|E
25|$|Others mate in December with a {{gestation}} period {{of four to}} five months, and give birth in April or May. Mothers {{give birth to a}} single pup in a litter. Mothers take care of the young after birth; the males take no part in raising it. The pup clings to its mother's abdomen during flight and when perched. The young will remain with the mother, clinging to her chest wherever she goes, until it is able to fly. The mother nurses the young during this time. The young drink their mother's milk until they are weaned onto their adult diet of insects.

25|$|Romantic {{relationships}} tend {{to increase}} in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month {{over the course of}} the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity. While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.|$|E
500|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at Baltimore City College went {{through a series of}} further changes. The most {{significant}} was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits. From 1927 to the early 1990s, the college preparatory curriculum at Baltimore City College was divided into two tracks: the [...] "A" [...] course and the [...] "B" [...] course. Though both tracks were intended to provide students with the <b>skills</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> college, the [...] "A" [...] course was intended to be more rigorous, enabling students to complete sufficient college-level courses to enter directly into the second year of college.
