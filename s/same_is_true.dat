5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% less than the US fluid ounce, and the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E
5|$|These {{facts are}} {{obscured}} by the omission of the solvent from the expression that is normally used to define pKa, but pKa values obtained in a given mixed solvent {{can be compared to}} each other, giving relative acid strengths.

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E

5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|The lightest {{isotopes}} were synthesized {{by direct}} fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes {{have only been}} observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only 267Rf has been confirmed. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission: {{it seems likely that}} the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of 270Rf, a likely daughter of 270Db. While the isotope 264Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5s.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2001 UK census, the {{industry}} of employment of Salford's residents aged 16–74 was 18.0% retail and wholesale, 14.4% property and business services, 12.3% manufacturing, 11.7% {{health and social}} work, 8.6% education, 7.3% transport and communications, 6.8% hotels and restaurants, 5.8% construction, 4.4% finance, 4.2% public administration, 0.6% energy and water supply, 0.3% agriculture, 0.1% mining, and 5.7% other. Compared with national figures, Salford had a relatively low percentage of residents working in agriculture. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 4.4% students were with jobs, 9.1% students without jobs, 6.3% looking after home or family, 11.2% permanently sick or disabled, and 4.8% economically inactive for other reasons. The proportion of students economically active in Salford was higher than the City of Salford and England averages (3.0% and 2.6% respectively); the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for economically inactive students (5.1% in City of Salford and 4.7% in England). The rest of the figures were roughly inline with national trends.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
