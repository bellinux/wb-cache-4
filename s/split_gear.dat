5000|$|BTR-60 {{modernization}} {{designed by}} Saymar. Following operations {{are carried out}} {{as a part of}} this modernization: Removing of all of the vehicle's systems and parts. Adding a bolted on superstructure with two hatches in its front, going {{all the way from the}} front hatches to the engine compartment which is necessary to adapt the vehicle to the new systems and parts (The engine compartment now externally resembles the one Russian MWS however it doesn't have a service hatch in the back and is angled near the top, also it too has rear lights mounted on both sides of the engine compartment although the lights themselves are different.). Sand blasting and repainting the hull. Resembling the vehicle with new and improved systems and parts as well as installing a new split transfer box that includes a limited split differential and a monitoring system allowing driving in rough terrain and improving the cross-country capabilities. Replacing the two GAZ-40P petrol engines with a single Caterpillar diesel engine developing 300 hp. Fitting a number of new parts for the new engine including a clutch system, <b>split</b> <b>gear</b> case, axillary engine systems, cooling systems, air inlet system, exhaust system. Converting and adapting a new fuel system for the diesel engine and integrating new and bigger fuel tanks to increase the maximum operational range. Installing a new and advanced electrical system including an advance control panel as well as replacement of all internal and external lighting. Increasing the driver's field of view by installing a rear view camera with an LCD screen. Improving the man-machine interface. The vehicle is armed with a pintle-mounted M2 heavy machine gun in the front and a second machine gun of a smaller caliber mounted on a [...] "ring" [...] in the rear. The rear machine gun is controlled from the inside, uses the [...] "ring" [...] to move and can rotate a full 360°. The vehicle also has two whip antennas in the front part of the superstructure. The modernization can also be applied to the BTR-70.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash {{planetary gear system}} that has an input sun gear, a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' gear above the sun <b>gear,</b> a <b>split</b> ring <b>gear</b> that has a fixed lower ring gear coaxial with the sun gear and a rotating upper ring gear also coaxial with the sun gear. A preload bolt is used for securing the <b>split</b> ring <b>gears</b> together. Within the <b>split</b> ring <b>gear</b> is an even number of planet <b>gears</b> between the <b>split</b> ring <b>gear</b> and the sun gear. Each planet gear consists of an upper planet gear, and lower planet gear with {{the upper and lower}} planet gears splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and lower planet gears. The lower planet gear meshes with the input sun gear and the fixed ring gear while the upper planet gear is driven by the lower planet gear and meshes with the rotating ring gear...|$|R
50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side frames, hoist motors, drag lines, pinion <b>gears,</b> <b>split</b> <b>gears,</b> and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|R

5000|$|Planetary {{reduction}} drives {{are typically}} attached between {{the shaft of}} the variable capacitor and the tuning knob of any radio, to allow fine adjustments of the tuning capacitor with smooth movements of the knob. Planetary drives are used in this situation to avoid [...] "backlash", which makes tuning easier. If the capacitor drive has backlash, when one attempts to tune in a station, the tuning knob will feel sloppy {{and it will be}} hard to perform small adjustments. Gear-drives can be made to have no backlash by using <b>split</b> <b>gears</b> and spring tension but the shaft bearings have to be very precise.|$|R
40|$|A weight {{reduction}} of 23 percent, noise reduction greater than 10 dB, and almost a fourfold increase in {{mean time between}} transmission removals has been demonstrated for a helicopter gearbox having a high output reduction ratio <b>split</b> path <b>gear</b> arrangement. These performance gains have been achieved by application of advanced transmission technology concepts in areas which offer high gain but are outside of normal design practices. New technology is being developed {{in such areas as}} <b>split</b> power <b>gear</b> concepts, composites, double helical gears, new gear materials, high speed spring clutches, and ceramic rolling element bearings. The programs, when completed, will provide demonstrated component and drive arrangement technology supported by analytical tools. The work is being accomplished under a CR&D program funded by NASA/Army termed the Advanced Rotorcraft transmission (ART) program. It is expected that the ART technology will be incorporated in future rotorcraft of the 1990 s and 2000 s. This paper summarizes the work accomplished to date on the program by Sikorsky Aircraft...|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the single}} engine was a semi-{{enclosed}} cockpit for the crew, roofed but without side glazing. There was an enclosed and heated cabin for four passengers with {{windows and doors}} in the fuselage sides. Passenger seats were fitted with seat belts, unusual for the time. The F.13 used a fixed conventional <b>split</b> landing <b>gear</b> with a rear skid, though some variants landed on floats or on skis.|$|R
5000|$|Gear pumps (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the pump housing. Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating <b>split</b> <b>gears,</b> helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, {{truck drivers}} use the engine brake to help match the engine speed to the gear. The most common {{situation}} {{is with a}} loaded vehicle which has no <b>split</b> <b>gears</b> or half gears in the lower range, from gears 1-4. In this case, it is especially difficult and sometimes impossible to get from 1 to 2, and sometimes even from 2-3 while starting on a hill. The problem is {{that by the time}} the engine speed has dropped sufficiently to enable a shift into the higher gear, the vehicle will have slowed down too much or possibly even stopped, making the shift impossible. The engine brakes, which on some models can be set to different intensities (retarding variable numbers of engine cylinders) enable a shift by dropping the engine speed quickly enough to catch the higher gear before the vehicle has decelerated too much. This technique, sometimes called [...] "jake shifting", requires high skill and much practice shifting without the clutch, and is usually not recommended among truck drivers because mistakes can cause damage to the transmission.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next step}} up from the simple nut is a split nut, whose halves can be {{adjusted}} and locked with screws so that one side rides leftward thread faces, {{and the other side}} rides rightward faces. Notice the analogy here with the radio dial example using <b>split</b> <b>gears,</b> where the <b>split</b> halves are pushed in opposing directions. Unlike in the radio dial example, the spring tension idea is not useful here, because machine tools taking a cut put too much force against the screw. Any spring light enough to allow slide movement at all would allow cutter chatter at best and slide movement at worst. These screw-adjusted split-nut-on-an-Acme-leadscrew designs cannot eliminate all backlash on a machine slide unless they are adjusted so tight that the travel starts to bind. Therefore, this idea can't totally obviate the always-approach-from-the-same-direction concept; but backlash can be held to a small amount (1 or 2 thousandths of an inch), which is more convenient and in some non-precise work is enough to allow one to ignore the backlash (i.e., act as if there weren't any).|$|R

50|$|In general, New Process {{transfer}} {{cases are}} identified by a three-digit code. The first digit (1 or 2) determines {{the number of}} gear ranges. The second digit is a series number that reflects design, and provides minimal information about torque handling. For example, if the second digit is a 1, there is no two-wheel-drive option; {{if it is a}} 2, 2WD is available. Other numbers have similar meanings. The third digit indicates differential type: 1 means locked (no differential), 2 means open, 3 means electric locked, 4 and 5 both indicate an asymmetrical torque <b>split</b> planetary <b>gear</b> and gear drive, 6 means an electronic clutch pack, 7 means a hydraulic clutch pack (except for the unique 207), and 9 means a viscous coupler.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the work accomplished {{to date on}} the NASA/Army Advanced Rotorcraft Transmission (ART) program. A 23 -percent weight reduction has been demonstrated for a high output reduction ratio split path transmission compared to an aggressive program goal of 25 -percent. Greater than 10 dB noise reduction in the cabin is achieved by the use of high contact ratio spur and double helical gears. In addition, mean times between transmission removals have been increased by almost four fold. These performance gains have been achieved by application of advanced transmission technology concepts. Technology areas are being explored which offer high gain but at relatively high risk in such areas as composites, <b>split</b> power <b>gear</b> concepts, double helical gears, new gear materials, high speed spring clutches, and ceramic rolling element bearings...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates two {{mild hybrid}} drive trains for a mid-class {{passenger}} {{car with a}} gasoline engine by means of comptuer simulation. The term mild hybrid is used for vehicles with sustained electric propulsion. The mild hybrid drive trains both have a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) with a Van Doorne metal V-belt and a torque assist device used to enhance fuel economy, driveability, comfort and emissions at minimal additional costs. The aim is to carry out an objective analysis of the electrical and mechanical torque assist systems on acceleration performance with equally efficient engine operation. In the electrical torque assist system, a 4. 5 kW (10 kW peak) starter-alternator with NiMH battery {{is added to the}} CVT drive train and the mechanical torque assist system connects a 0. 4 kg. m 2 flywheel inertia in parallel to the CVT using a power <b>splitting</b> planetary <b>gear</b> set...|$|R

40|$|A high {{reduction}} ratio <b>split</b> torque <b>gear</b> train {{has been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} a planetary configuration for the final stage of a helicopter transmission. A split torque design allows a high ratio of power-to-weight for the transmission. The design studied in this work includes a pivoting beam that acts to balance thrust loads produced by the helical gear meshes in each of two parallel power paths. When the thrust loads are balanced, the torque is split evenly. A mathematical model was developed to study the dynamics of the system. The effects of time varying gear mesh stiffness, static transmission errors, and flexible bearing supports are included in the model. The model was demonstrated with a test case. Results show that although the gearbox has a symmetric configuration, the simulated dynamic behavior of the first and second compound gears are not the same. Also, results show that shaft location and mesh stiffness tuning are significant design parameters that influence the motions of the system...|$|R
50|$|The {{best example}} {{here is an}} analog radio tuning dial where one may make precise tuning {{movements}} both forwards and backwards. Specialized gear designs allow this. One of the more common designs <b>splits</b> the <b>gear</b> into two gears, each half {{the thickness of the}} original. One half of the gear is fixed to its shaft while {{the other half of the}} gear is allowed to turn on the shaft, but pre-loaded in rotation by small coil springs that rotate the free gear relative to the fixed gear. In this way, the spring tension rotates the free gear until all of the backlash in the system has been taken out; the teeth of the fixed gear press against one side of the teeth of the pinion while the teeth of the free gear press against the other side of the teeth on the pinion. Loads smaller than the force of the springs do not compress the springs and with no gaps between the teeth to be taken up, backlash is eliminated.|$|R
50|$|The 190XT had a six {{cylinder}} {{engine and}} a 3.875 by 4.25 inch bore/stroke. Its displacement was 301 cubic inches and its rated RPMs was 2200. It was tested at 94 {{power take off}} and 79 drawbar (haulage) horsepower. The tractor's engine was a new design and, for the time, offered excellent performance for its displacement. Its main transmission, basically a carryover from the D19, had 4 forward and 1 reverse gear and was not synchronized. The 190XT had a power director like the D Series, but it could smoothly shift on the go just like the D series. The main transmission could not be shifted while the PTO was engaged and turning, and as such, the 190 did not offer true live PTO. The tractor could be started and stopped using the power director, but the tractor could not, for example, shuttle from forward to reverse without first stopping the PTO. The power director did <b>split</b> each <b>gear</b> allowing {{for a total of}} 8 forward speeds and 2 reverse speeds.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Gearbox {{top cover}} {{is a vital}} {{component}} of horizontally <b>split</b> integrally <b>geared</b> centrifugal compressor. Reliability of top cover {{is directly related to}} the structural rigidity and structural integrity of compressor. Assuming that the top cover is designed within the mechanical limits of its construction material, one of the most common causes of top cover failure is resonance. The aim of the designer while designing top cover is to have minimum weight and still have sufficient rigidity to avoid resonance. It is imperative; however, that rigorous engineering analysis is applied in the initial design phase to prevent resonance that will result in failure of gearbox top cover. To meet the objectives of designing a reliable integrally geared centrifugal compressor, gearbox top cover modal analysis is of utmost importance. Numerical modal analysis, usually based on Finite Element Method, is commonly used to determine the vibration characteristics, such as natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of a structure. This paper addresses finite element analysis and modal testing of gearbox top cover of an integrally geared centrifugal compressor. The goal is to determine, verify and validate the vibration characteristics of the gearbox top cover using both analytical and experimental techniques. The 3 -D solid model of the gearbox top cover was built using Autodesk Inventor®. ANSYS workbench 13 ® was used for preprocessing, solving and post processing. Modal analysis involved extraction of mode shapes and natural frequencies. Impact testing using hammer excitation was used to experimentally determine the vibration properties of the gearbox to...|$|R
