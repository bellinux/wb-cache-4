Information obtained from job analyses are used for many purposes, including the creation of job-relevant selection procedures, performance appraisals and the criteria they require, and the development of training programs.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{inactivity}} {{has been}} considered a major public health issue among adolescents because of its high prevalence and its association with numerous adverse health outcomes during adolescence which may carry over to adulthood. A key to addressing this issue has been to identify the determinants that may influence an adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s decision to be physically active. A determinant that has been hypothesised {{is the level of}} proficiency of the motor skills used to participate in physical activity; however, this relationship has been virtually unexplored. This study investigated how organised sports and games, nonorganised physical activity, and cardiorespiratory endurance were each related to fundamental motor <b>skill</b> <b>ability</b> among adolescents. One thousand and seventy-two and 954 adolescents from Year 8 and Year 10, respectively, participated as subjects in this study. Organised sports and games and nonorganised physical activity were assessed by a self-report recall questionnaire of participation in physical activity. Cardiorespiratory endurance was measured by performance on the Multistage Fitness Test. Fundamental motor <b>skill</b> <b>ability</b> was qualitatively assessed by performance on a six-item fundamental motor skills test battery. Descriptive statistics plus multiple regression were used to analyse the data. Results suggested that participation in organised sports and games was significantly related to fundamental motor <b>skill</b> <b>ability,</b> F (4, 1831) = 14. 30, p less than. 0001, and that this relationship was stronger for males than for females. Participation in nonorganised physical activity was not significantly related to fundamental motor <b>skill</b> <b>ability.</b> Cardiorespiratory endurance was significantly related to fundamental motor <b>skill</b> <b>ability,</b> F (4, 1808) = 79. 05, p less than. 0001. For adolescents, fundamental motor <b>skill</b> <b>ability</b> may be an important variable influencing participation in organised sports and games and cardiorespiratory endurance and development of motor skills may increase adherence to a physically active lifestyle during adolescence which may carry over to adulthood...|$|R

As described above, Power Points (abbreviated pp.) are used to purchase powers, feats, <b>skills,</b> <b>abilities,</b> and devices. The specific nature of Power Points was changed drastically with the 2nd edition (2e) of Mutants & Masterminds. In the first edition, when a character accrues 15 pp, they advance a Power Level, thus raising the caps on power and skill ranks, {{as well as on}} power bonus stacking. There were options to keep the Power Level the same while increasing total number of points (and many sample antagonists in the Game Master setting have more points than their Power Level would suggest), but these have been incorporated into the 2nd edition rules.|$|E

For healthy conditions, {{it is necessary that}} employees’ attitudes, <b>skills,</b> <b>abilities</b> and resources match the demands of their job, and that work environments should meet workers’ needs, knowledge, and skills potential. Lack of fit in either of these domains can cause problems, and the greater the gap or misfit (either subjective or objective) between the person and their environment, the greater the strain as demands exceed abilities, and need exceeds supply. These strains can relate to health related issues, lower productivity, and other work problems. Defense mechanisms, such as denial, reappraisal of needs, and coping, also operate in the model, to try and reduce subjective misfit" ...|$|E
2500|$|Education {{plays an}} {{especially}} influential {{part in the}} lives of the impoverished. According to Mirowsky and Ross, education determines other factors of livelihood like occupation and income that determines income, which determines health outcomes. Education is a major social determinant of health, with educational attainment related to improved health outcomes, due to its effect on income, employment, and living conditions. (Ross & Wu, 1995; Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2006; Bloom, 2007). Social resources, such as education, determine life expectancy and infant mortality, which measures health. Education has a lasting, continuous, and increasing effect on health. [...] Education is a special determinant of health because it enables people toward self-direction, which leads them to seek goals such as health. [...] Education helps the impoverished develop usable <b>skills,</b> <b>abilities,</b> and resources that help individuals reach goals, including bettering health. Parent's educational level is also important to health, which influences the health of children and the future population. Parent's education level also determines child health, survival, and their educational attainment (Caldwell, 1986; Cleland & Van Ginneken, 1988). [...] "Children born to more educated mothers are less likely to die in infancy and more likely to have higher birth weights and be immunized. Studies in the United States suggest maternal education results in higher parity, greater use of prenatal care, and lower smoking rates, which positively affects child health. An increase in child schooling in Taiwan during the educational reform of 1968 reduced the infant morality rate by 11%, saving 1 infant per 1000 births.|$|E

Academic writing competencies have a central position in the educational path, so the writing skills of university students are a matter of increasing interest at the international level. In the Italian context it is also an important topic of scientific debate, as research, study and institutional and regulatory frameworks show. Specifically, this paper describes the educational experience of plane writing courses started in 2000 in the Department of Philological, Linguistic and Literary Studies (formerly Faculty of Humanities) at the Sapienza University of Rome. The theoretical starting points are an awareness of the teachability of writing and – therefore – the importance of educational work. The approaches, methods and integrated practice activities presented in this paper assume that writing involves the following skills: language skills (mastery of writing tools, mastery of morphosyntax, mastery of lexical and semantic levels of speech); textual <b>skills</b> (<b>ability</b> to organize a text, ability to structure and organize ideas); cognitive <b>skills</b> (<b>ability</b> to develop, select and combine information); pragmatic <b>skills</b> (<b>ability</b> to deliver a consistent message within a communicative situation); and metacognitive <b>skills</b> (<b>ability</b> to decentralize oneself from the text in order to submit it for review and evaluation of its acceptability and consistency). Therefore essential objectives are that students learn to be able to select, organize and formulate their own ideas on the basis of a specific communicative situation, in which the context, purposes and recipient are clearly defined...|$|R
