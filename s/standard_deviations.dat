25|$|In {{probability}} theory, Chebyshev's inequality (also spelled as Tchebysheff's inequality, , {{also called}} Bienaymé-Chebyshev inequality) guarantees that, {{for a wide}} class of probability distributions, {{no more than a}} certain fraction of values can be more than a certain distance from the mean. Specifically, no more than 1/k2 of the distribution's values can be more than k <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> away from the mean (or equivalently, at least 1−1/k2 of the distribution's values are within k <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of the mean). The rule is often called Chebyshev's theorem, about the range of <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> around the mean, in statistics. The inequality has great utility because it can be applied to any probability distribution in which the mean and variance are defined.
