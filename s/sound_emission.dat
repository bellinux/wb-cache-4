It {{is limited to the}} {{determination}} of airborne <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> for the specified setups. Vibration is not measured, nor is the sensitivity of airborne <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> to vibration effects determined. The test setup requirements in this standard establish the laboratory conditions necessary for a successful test. Rarely will it be possible to meet these requirements in a field situation. This standard is not intended for field measurements.|$|E

40|$|The {{portfolio}} of impacts that are quantified in {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) has grown to include rather different stressors than those that were the focus of early LCAs. Some of the newest life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models are still in an early phase of development and {{have not yet been}} included in any LCA study. This is the case for <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> and noise impacts, which have been only recently modeled. <b>Sound</b> <b>emissions</b> are matter-less, time dependent, and bound to the physical properties of waves. The way <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> and the relative noise impacts are modeled in LCA can show how new or existing matter-less impacts can be addressed. In this study, we analyze, through the example of <b>sound</b> <b>emissions,</b> the specific features of a matter-less impact that does not stem from the use of a kilogram of matter, nor is related to the emission of a kilogram of matter. We take as a case study the production of energy by means of wind turbines, contradicting the commonly held assumption that windmills have no emissions during use. We show how to account for <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> in the life cycle inventory phase of the life cycle of a wind turbine and then calculate the relative impacts using a noise LCIA model...|$|R
50|$|The most fertile {{areas for}} roadway noise {{mitigation}} are in urban planning decisions, roadway design, noise barrier design, speed control, surface pavement selection and truck restrictions. Speed control is effective since the lowest <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> arise from vehicles moving smoothly at 30 to 60 kilometres per hour. Above that range, <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> double with each five {{miles per hour}} of speed. At the lowest speeds, braking and (engine) acceleration noise dominates.|$|R

50|$|Echolocation is {{the same}} as active sonar, using sounds made by the animal itself. Ranging is done by {{measuring}} the time delay between the animal's own <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> and any echoes that return from the environment. The relative intensity of sound received at each ear as well as the time delay between arrival at the two ears provide information about the horizontal angle (azimuth) from which the reflected sound waves arrive.|$|E

50|$|Noise {{control is}} an active or passive means of {{reducing}} <b>sound</b> <b>emissions,</b> often for personal comfort, environmental considerations or legal compliance. Active noise control is sound reduction using a power source.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of cetacean mass strandings, coincident with anthropogenic <b>sounds</b> <b>emissions,</b> have raised concerns {{on the potential}} environmental impact of underwater noise. Cuvier’s beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) was reported in all the cited stranding events. Within the NATO Marine Mammal Risk Mitigation project (MMRM), multiple interdisciplinary sea trials have been conducted in the Mediterranean Sea {{with the objective of}} developing tools and procedures to mitigate the impact of underwater <b>sound</b> <b>emissions.</b> During these cruises, visual observations, passive acoustic detections and environmental data were collected. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate ‘‘a priori’’ predictions of Cuvier’s beaked whale presence in the Alboran Sea, using models developed in the Ligurian Sea that employ bathymetric and chlorophyll features as predictors.

40|$|The Lusitanian toadfish Halobatrachus didactylus (Bloch & Schneider) (Batrachoididae) is a {{well-known}} sound producer that has an unusual large acoustic repertoire for fish. This repertoire consists so far of five distinct sound categories: boatwhistles, grunt trains, croaks, double croaks and a mixed grunt–croak call. Sixteen males that spontaneously occupied artificial concrete nests placed in the intertidal zone of the Tagus estuary (Portugal) were recorded over 8 days in June/July 2006.

50|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated this bat's amazing ability to find motionless food within clutter. Echolocating bats discriminate between background and prey based on glints or Doppler shifts in the echo induced by the (wing-)movements of the prey, but M. microtis can detect completely motionless prey. The species shares both the leaf-nose formation and the trait of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> through the nostrils with all Phyllostomidae, but its behavior is understood to be unique: the bat is able to discriminate ecologically relevant stimuli within an extremely complex cluttered sonic environment.|$|E
5000|$|Singing sand dunes, {{an example}} of the {{phenomenon}} of singing sand, produce a sound described as roaring, booming, squeaking, or the [...] "Song of Dunes". This is a natural sound phenomenon of up to 105 decibels, lasting as long as several minutes, that occurs in about 35 desert locations around the world. The sound is similar to a loud low-pitch rumble. It emanates from crescent-shaped dunes, or barchans. The <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> accompanies a slumping or avalanching movement of sand, usually triggered by wind passing over the dune or by someone walking near the crest.|$|E
50|$|When {{searching for}} prey they produce sounds {{at a low}} rate (10-20 clicks/second). During the search phase the <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> is coupled to respiration, which is again coupled to the wingbeat. This {{coupling}} appears to dramatically conserve energy as there is little to no additional energetic cost of echolocation to flying bats. After detecting a potential prey item, microbats increase the rate of pulses, ending with the terminal buzz, at rates as high as 200 clicks/second. During approach to a detected target, the duration of the sounds is gradually decreased, as is the energy of the sound.|$|E

50|$|ANSI/AMCA Standard 320 - Laboratory Methods of Sound Testing of Fans Using Sound Intensity {{establishes}} {{a method of}} determining the octave band sound power levels of a fan. The sound power levels are determined using sound intensity measurements on a measurement surface that encloses the sound source. Guidelines are provided on suitable test environment acoustical characteristics, the measurement surface, {{and the number of}} intensity measurements. Test setups are designated generally to represent the physical orientation of fans as installed following ANSI/AMCA 210 and also used in ANSI/AMCA 300. The method is reproducible when all requirements of the method are met. This standard applies to fans of all types and sizes. It is limited to the determination of airborne <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> for the specified setups.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is an objective emission control. Unlike the Tampering provision, this is specific to motor vehicles. It requires that a vehicle muffler not create more sound {{than the original}} equipment which has been measured. It prohibits any modification or replacement that increases the <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> beyond that of the original equipment. It prohibits the sale of mufflers that do not meet original equipment standards. Many states have requirements that a muffler shall be in good working order which is not specific enough. California (Section 27150.1)) requires that a retail seller that sells a product {{in violation of the}} muffler regulation must install a replacement muffler that meets the regulation and must reimburse the purchaser for the expense of replacement.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is an objective emission control. It applies maximum sound levels to various categories of moving vehicles {{and for several}} vehicle speeds. It is the backbone of vehicle <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> regulations. It generally requires a measurement of A-weighted sound level of a moving vehicle at a specific distance from the vehicle path (normally 50 feet). This provision has level restrictions on trucks over 10,000 GVW used locally and in interstate commerce. It also covers motorcycles of two horsepower ratings, mopeds, and all other vehicles on public rights-of-way. The federal government has set maximum levels for heavy trucks used in interstate commerce (40 CFR 202)and for motorcycles (40 CFR 205). Most states and many cities have maximum limits and they generally agree with federal standards where they apply. The most common speed division is 35 mph.|$|E

[...] (Roscelin, De gener. et spec., 524). Universals are words that can to call several individuals; for example the word [...] "homo". Therefore, a universal is reduced to a <b>sound's</b> <b>emission</b> (Roscelin, De generibus et speciebus).|$|R
40|$|<b>Sound</b> <b>emissions</b> of {{ventilation}} {{units are}} mostly {{referred to as}} noise and are subject to a minimization policy. Silencing causes technical effort and sometimes even higher energy consumption. Additionally, this study reveals that silencing may be counterproductive in open-plan offices, since employees may even benefit from higher volume ventilation sound. This positive effect occurs when disturbing background speech is masked by ventilation sound. In this study acoustics of an open-plan office at one receiver positon incorporating background speech were auralized. Then ventilation sounds of two different decentralized ventilation units at three ventilation rates producing <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> in between 25 and 45 dB(A) were added. Participants were exposed to these sound scenarios during a laboratory experiment. Results reveal that participants performed better at a working memory task during presentation {{of one of the}} high volume ventilation sounds and acoustic comfort and privacy were judged to be better as well. However, sound quality of ventilation sounds needs to be investigated and purposefully adapted since different effects were found for the two ventilation units, although the overall A-weighted sound pressure levels were comparable...|$|R

50|$|Glossotherium {{had large}} ear ossicles, {{similar to those}} in elephants, which imply the loss of hearing acuity of higher frequencies, further {{implying}} an advantage for sensing low frequency sounds, infrasound, or bone-conducting seismic waves. Low frequency sound is useful for long range communication and it is possible that ground sloths used low frequency communication {{in much the same way}} that it is utilized by elephants. Sloths may have used low frequency sounds for communication in mating calls or other social interactions, or for long-range sound sensing as in predator-prey interactions or weather forecasting. Another possible explanation for hearing in low frequencies may be due to fossorial habits: low hearing frequencies coupled with a short interaural distance suggest that Glossotherium probably had very poor sound localization. This indicates evidence of an underground lifestyle since loss of high frequency hearing is common to fossorial mammals. Glossotherium’s huge nostrils were likely effective for <b>sound</b> <b>emission,</b> with expanded nares possibly related to emission of low frequency sounds up to 600 Hz.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike closed box loudspeakers, {{which are}} {{substantially}} airtight, a bass reflex system has an opening called a port or vent {{cut into the}} cabinet, generally consisting of a pipe or duct (typically circular or rectangular cross section). The air mass in this opening resonates with the [...] "springiness" [...] of the air inside the enclosure {{in exactly the same}} fashion as the air in a bottle resonates when a current of air is directed across the opening. Another metaphor often used is to think of the air like a spring or rubber band. The frequency at which the box/port system resonates, known as the Helmholtz resonance, depends upon the effective length and cross sectional area of the duct, the internal volume of the enclosure, and the speed of sound in air. In the early years of ported speakers, speaker designers had to do extensive experimentation to determine the ideal diameter of the port and length of the port tube or pipe; however, in the 2010s, there are numerous tables and computer programs that calculate, for a given size of cabinet, how large the port should be and how long the tube should be. Even with these programs, however, some experimentation with prototypes is still necessary to determine if the enclosure sounds good.In this vent air mass/box air springiness resonance is so chosen as to lie lower in frequency than the natural resonance frequency of the bass driver, an interesting phenomenon happens: the backwave of the bass driver <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> is inverted in polarity for the frequency range between the two resonances. Since the backwave is already in opposite polarity with the front wave, this inversion brings the two emissions in phase (although the vent emission is lagging by one wave period) and therefore they reinforce each other. This has the useful purpose of producing higher output (for any given driver excursion compared to a closed box) or, conversely, a similar output with a smaller excursion (which means less driver distortion). The penalty incurred for this reinforcement is time smearing: in essence the vent resonance augments main driver output by imposing a [...] "resonant tail" [...] on it. For frequencies above the natural resonance of the driver, the reflex alignment has no influence. For frequencies below the vent resonance, polarity inversion is not accomplished, and backwave cancellation occurs. Furthermore, the driver behaves as though suspended in free air, as box air springiness is absent.|$|E

50|$|Plants emit audio {{acoustic}} emissions between 10-240 Hz {{as well as}} ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) within 20-300 kHz. Evidence {{for plant}} mechanosensory abilities are shown when roots are subjected to unidirectional 220 Hz sound and subsequently grow {{in the direction of}} the vibration source. Using electrograph vibrational detection, structured <b>sound</b> wave <b>emissions</b> were detected along the elongation zone of root tips of corn plants in the form of loud and frequent clicks. When plants are isolated from contact, chemical, and light signal exchange with neighboring plants they are still able to sense their neighbors and detect relatives through alternative mechanisms, among which sound vibrations could play an important role. Furthermore, ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) have been detected in a range of different plants which result from collapsing water columns under high tension. UAE studies show different frequencies of <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> based on whether or not drought conditions are present. Whether or not UAE are used by plants as a communication mechanism is not known. Although the explicit mechanisms through which <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> are created and detected in plants are not known, there are theories which shed light on possible mechanisms. Mechanical vibrations caused by charged cell membranes and walls is a leading hypothesis for acoustic emission generation. Myosins and other mechanochemical enzymes which use chemical energy in the form of ATP to produce mechanical vibrations in cells may also contribute to sound wave generation in plant cells. These mechanisms may lead to overall nanomechanical oscillations of cytoskeletal components, which can generate both low and high frequency vibrations.|$|R
