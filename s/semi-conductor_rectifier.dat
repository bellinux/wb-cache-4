40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{software}} package for the numerical analysis in transient and steady-state modes of power electrical networks or variable speed drives with arbitrary topologies. The package is composed {{of a series of}} units, each representing a specific cell in the network: voltage supply, electrical machine, mechanical system, transmission line, circuit-breaker, phase shifting transformer, static converter with control and command organ, regulator, etc. SIMSEN is highly flexible and efficient. It is implanted on microcomputer or on workstation. The network or the variable speed drive to be simulated is assembled using a graphic input interface by adequatly choosing and linking the building units, so as to fulfill a desired topology. An existing system may be easily extended or modified. A simple procedure can be used in order to define a new unit or to modify an existing one. The initial conditions of operation can be partly or entirely specified by the user. A transient mode of operation may include several successive perturbations. The simulation results are displayed through an efficient graphic interface. An original feature of SIMSEN is its ability to analyse electrical networks involving <b>semi-conductors</b> (diodes <b>rectifiers,</b> thyristor or GTO current converters, voltage inverters, etc.). Thus, systems having a complex structure can be simulated. Practical examples of applications to such systems constitute the main part of this paper: constant or variable speed groups involving induction and synchronous machines, HVDC networks, reactive power static converter SVC. These examples show how SIMSEN can be used for an optimized design of complex networks. 2...|$|R
40|$|For energy {{conservation}} in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, based on vapor compression cycles, capacity modulation is necessary. In addition, individual {{components of the}} system have to be improved. Although electromagnetic linear motor compressors {{are supposed to be}} most suitable for this purpose, they have not found wide acceptance because the interaction of various design parameters is not completely understood. In this thesis, the nonlinear behavior of the electromagnetic linear compressor was investigated and described in analytical form. Cyclic simulation, based on the linear load model as used in this thesis, is less accurate than numerically integrated simulation in the time domain, but can provide better physical insight of the interaction of the system design parameters. In addition, the computer time required is much reduced. ^ The compressor was divided into three sub systems: electromagnetic, mechanical and thermodynamic. The phenomena for each part were described in terms of lumped-parameter models. These models include the coupling effects between sub systems. Heat transfer was not modeled but is indirectly included in the polytropic coefficient. ^ A <b>semi-conductor</b> half-wave <b>rectifier</b> is not necessary to the operation of the compressor, but rather seems to degrade its efficiency for relatively large capacity compressors. Despite the unnecessity of a diode, it was included {{as a part of the}} analysis because the compressor available for the experiment was designed with a diode. Considering the final application, the differential equations of the model were solved by using the harmonic balance method. The harmonic balance showed good results for the diode case in the range of operation tested. The cyclic simulation based on the linear load model and the harmonic balance method seems to be applicable to the final design objectives of the compressor. ^ The behavior of the compressor without a diode becomes less nonlinear, thus making the use of the harmonic balance method and linear load model for final design performance studies even more attractive. ...|$|R
