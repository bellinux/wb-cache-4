It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a man like that from the firing -line.|$|E

For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard.

Emily Exton from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the peacock storyline [...] "felt too silly", and that Forte [...] "was too underused as Paul", nonetheless said that despite not being the greatest 30 Rock episode of all time [...] "there were still some hilarious lines." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning liked Grizz's dilemma plot, commenting that Grizz not trying to hurt Tracy's feelings while Tracy tried to keep Dot Com away from Grizz's bride-to-be [...] "offered up some inspired lunacy."

Not a whole lot happened, but it was all very funny." [...] Nick Catucci from New York magazine, who did not enjoy the two other stories, appreciated Jenna's, explaining that by having the character date one of her own impersonator was [...] "outrageous and funny without relying on any cheap insults to trannies." [...] Sean Gandert from Paste magazine reported that [...] "Argus" [...] was an episode that [...] " [...] us back to the show's roots", explaining that recapturing the [...] "old tone" [...] also worked to [...] "recapture the old joke-writing expertise.

40|$|China's {{emergence}} as a manufacturing juggernaut selling <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>goods</b> to <b>so</b> <b>many</b> countries has attracted enormous attention from academics, policymakers, and the media. In this article, Behzad Kianian and Kei-Mu Yi put China's manufacturing performance into a broader context. They emphasize two key themes: The wages of China's manufacturing workers are rising rapidly; and China's production of export goods relies heavily on imported inputs and the final exported goods face large mark-ups in their destination markets. The first theme implies that China will lose global market share in some categories of goods. The second implies that China's trading relationship with many countries is complementary, not competitive, and that the omnipresence of China's goods exaggerates the extent of its manufacturing performance. The authors conclude that China's {{emergence as}} a global manufacturing power should not be overstated, and concerns that China will "take over" all manufacturing markets are unfounded.
