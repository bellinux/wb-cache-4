The design objective is the minimization of blockage of streamline curvature or {{the reduction of}} both. The <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> boundary condition is derived both for flow from the tunnel into the plenum and vice versa, and the {{procedure for}} evaluating wall interference is described.

40|$|The flowfield on a {{segmented}} multi-slotted {{wind tunnel}} wall was studied at transonic speeds by measurements in {{and near the}} wall layer using five port cone probes. The <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> flowfield was observed to be three-dimensional in nature for a relatively significant distance above the slot. The boundary layer characteristics measured on the single <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> {{were found to be}} very sensitive to the applied suction through the slot. The perturbation in the velocity components generated due to the flow through the slot decay rapidly in the transverse direction. A vortex-like flow existed on the single <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> for natural ventilation but diminished with increased suction flow rate. For flow on a segmented multi-slotted wall, the normal velocity component changes were found to be maximum for measurement points located between the segmented slots atop the active chamber. The lateral influence due to applied suction and blowing, through a compartment, exceeded only slightly that in the downstream direction. Limited upstream influence was observed. Influence coefficients were determined from the data in the least-square sense for blowing and suction applied through one and two compartments. This was found to be an adequate determination of the influence coefficients for the range of mass flows considered...|$|E
40|$|A nonlinear, four wall, {{post-test}} wall interference assessment/correction (WIAC) {{code was}} developed for transonic airfoil data from solid wall wind tunnels with flexibly adaptable top and bottom walls. The WIAC code was applied over {{a broad range of}} test conditions to four sets of NACA 0012 airfoil data, from two different adaptive wall wind tunnels. The data include many test points for fully adapted walls, as well as numerous partially adapted and unadapted test points, which together represent many different model/tunnel configurations and possible wall interference effects. Small corrections to the measured Mach numbers and angles of attack were obtained from the WIAC code even for fully adapted data; these corrections generally improve the correlation among the various sets of airfoil data and simultaneously improve the correlation of the data with calculations for a 2 -D, free air, Navier-Stokes code. The WIAC corrections for airfoil data taken in fully adapted wall test sections are shown to be significantly smaller than those for comparable airfoil data from straight, <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> test sections. This indicates, as expected, a lesser degree of wall interference in the adapted wall tunnels relative to the <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> tunnels. Application of the WIAC code to this data was, however, somewhat more difficult and time consuming than initially expected from similar previous experience with WIAC applications to <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> data...|$|E

30|$|Jeennakorn et al. (2017) {{conducted}} further laboratory {{investigation of}} the effect of changing the <b>slot</b> <b>wall</b> angle, the disc thickness, and the instantaneous flow condition on the sealing efficiency. The experiment showed that increasing the <b>slot</b> <b>wall</b> angle tended to decrease the sealing pressure. Increasing simulated disc thickness in taper slot discs improved the sealing pressure. The study provided some ideas about the effect of testing conditions that change the testing results and should be considered in LCM sealing evaluation. Observation during the experiment provided more understanding about the bridging and sealing mechanism on the simulated fracture discs.|$|R

40|$|Calibrations were {{obtained}} in the Langley 6 by 28 -inch transonic tunnel with newly installed controllable reentry flaps and test section floor and ceiling. Using available theory, {{the top and bottom}} <b>slotted</b> <b>walls</b> were redesigned for minimum wind tunnel interference errors of blockage and stream-line curvature. To minimize Mach number gradients along the tunnel axis downstream of the model, controllable flaps were installed to regulate the flow reentering the test section through the <b>slotted</b> <b>walls.</b> The flap setting is independent of stagnation pressure and varies only with Mach number. The freestream Mach number is determined from the pressrue measured at a station 66. 04 cm upstream of the model station. The model has no significant influence on the vertical Mach number distribution at this station. This method of Mach number determination appears to be more accurate than one using the plenum pressure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Torque in {{orthodontics}} {{is vital}} in final {{positioning of the}} teeth during fixed appliance therapy. Torqueing of archwires is {{a significant factor in}} transferring the applied forces to the bracket which might cause deformation of the slot. Any deformation in the bracket slot can vary the torque prescription and thus can affect the tooth position. Aim: To evaluate and compare the deformation of stainless steel (SS) and ceramic bracket slots during torque, using finite element analysis. Materials and methods: A maxillary right central incisor bracket (0. 022 x 0. 028 inch) dimensions were measured using a profile projector, and a finite element (FE) model was constructed. Bracket materials considered were stainless steel (SS) and ceramic. An SS rectangular archwire (0. 019 x 0. 025 inch) with angles of twist ranging from 5 ° to 40 ° was theoretically converted into torque. The bracket slot deformation was obtained at the top, middle and bottom locations using FE analysis. Results: There is a uniform increase in deformation in the bracket <b>slot</b> <b>walls</b> from torque of 9. 7 to 77. 62 Nmm except that there is a 100 percent increase in deformation when the torque changed from 38. 81 to 48. 51 Nmm. The top location in the gingival <b>slot</b> <b>wall</b> showed maximum deformation compared with middle and bottom slot positions in both the materials. The deformation of SS bracket slot was more than the ceramic bracket slot. Conclusion: This study showed that the bracket <b>slot</b> <b>walls</b> of both SS and ceramic brackets are subjected to deformation by application of torque and the maximum deformation was in {{the upper part of the}} bracket slot...|$|R

When the theory is applied to perforated wall test sections, it predicts the experimentally observed closely spaced modes that occur when the wavelength is not long compared with he plenum depth...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{simulation of}} a transonic {{wind tunnel test}} section with longitudinally <b>slotted</b> <b>walls</b> is developed and described herein. The nonlinear slot model includes dynamic pressure e ects and a plenum pressure constraint, and each slot is treated individually. The solution is performed using a nite-di erence method that solves an extended transonic small disturbance equation. The walls serve as the outer boundary conditions in the relaxation technique, and an interaction procedure is used at the <b>slotted</b> <b>walls.</b> Measured boundary pressures {{are not required to}} establish the wall conditions but are currently used to assess the accuracy of the simulation. This method can also calculate a free-air solution as well as solutions that employ the classical homogeneous wall conditions. The simulation is used to examine two commercial transport aircraft models at a supercritical Mach number for zero-lift and cruise conditions. Good agreement between measured and calculated wall pressures is obtained for the model geometries and ow conditions examined herein. Some localized disagreement is noted, which is attributed to improper simulation of viscous e ects in the slots...|$|R

This code was developed by modifying the outer boundary conditions of an existing aerodynamic wing-body-pod-pylon-winglet analysis code. The boundary conditions are presented in the form of equations which simulate the flow at the wall, as well as finite difference approximations to the equations. Comparisons are presented at transonic flow conditions between computational results and experimental data for a wing alone in a solid wall wind tunnel and wing-body configurations in both slotted and solid wind tunnels...|$|R
30|$|Since forces {{transmitted}} at {{the points}} of contact are composed of normal forces and frictional (tangential) forces (Johnson 1985), the <b>slot</b> <b>walls</b> support the seal element by both the normal component and the friction component. While the coarse particles set in place as the first barrier, the normal and frictional forces control the equilibrium of the seal. As discussed above, better force distribution improves both the normal and friction force distribution to be more uniform within the seal element. Improving the normal force distribution to the walls also improves the friction, and the better the friction the higher the seal element can withstand the load. Overall, the load can be transferred more uniformly toward the <b>slot</b> <b>walls</b> and better shared among the particles, resulting in higher seal integrity. The results from adding {{a good portion of}} fine particles such as adding hematite, barite or fine-sieved barite seem to coherently support this idea. Fine particles appear to stay everywhere they could occupy the void space and essentially contribute in stress distribution of the granular system, but more importantly, they should be the material properties that takes responsibility for the impermeable capability of the seal at the upstream surface.|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} {{will continue}} to be a primary source of validation data for many types of mathematical and computational models in the aerospace industry. The increased emphasis on accuracy of data acquired from these facilities requires understanding of the uncertainty of not only the measurement data but also any correction applied to the data. One of the largest and most critical corrections made to these data is due to wall interference. In an effort to understand the accuracy and suitability of these corrections, a statistical validation process for wall interference correction methods has been developed. This process is based on the use of independent cases which, after correction, are expected to produce the same result. Comparison of these independent cases with respect to the uncertainty in the correction process establishes a domain of applicability based on the capability of the method to provide reasonable corrections with respect to customer accuracy requirements. The statistical validation method was applied to the version of the Transonic Wall Interference Correction System (TWICS) recently implemented in the National Transonic Facility at NASA Langley Research Center. The TWICS code generates corrections for solid and <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> interference in the model pitch plane based on boundary pressure measurements. Before validation could be performed on this method, it was necessary to calibrate the ventilated wall boundary condition parameters. Discrimination comparisons are used to determine the most representative of three linear boundary condition models which have historically been used to represent longitudinally slotted test section walls. Of the three linear boundary condition models implemented for ventilated walls, the general <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> model was the most representative of the data. The TWICS code using the calibrated general <b>slotted</b> <b>wall</b> model was found to be valid to within the process uncertainty for test section Mach numbers less than or equal to 0. 60. The scatter among the mean corrected results of the bodies of revolution validation cases was within one count of drag on a typical transport aircraft configuration for Mach numbers at or below 0. 80 and two counts of drag for Mach numbers at or below 0. 90...|$|E

The boundary layer characteristics were sensitive to the mass transfer through the slot. The projection on the flow field velocity vectors on the transverse plane reveals a vortex-like flow formation. The center of this secondary flow was located nearly {{at the edge of}} the wall shear layer and decreased in strength with applied suction.

This interpolation made sure that the corrected Mach number of a given run would be constant. Overall, the agreement between corresponding interpolated lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficient sets was very good. Buoyancy corrections were also investigated.
