The Head of House is immune from being nominated for the week they hold the title, but they can still nominate others. The Head of House does not participate {{in any of the}} weekly shopping tasks, but supervises instead. Once a housemate has been Head of House they could not stand a second time, but could compete to stay in heaven. After the divide was removed, only eligible housemates competed to become Head of House, except for Week 12 when all housemates were eligible. On Day 88 all previous Heads of House joined Mohamed Mohamed in becoming Head of House for one day, putting an end to the role of Head of House.|$|E

On April 25, 1941, the United States and China formally signed a $50 million stabilization agreement to support the Chinese currency. By December 23, 1940, upon approval by the War Department, State Department and the President of the United States, an agreement was reached to provide China the 100 P-40B Tomahawk aircraft which had originally been built for Britain, but which the British were persuaded to give up in preference for newer models rapidly being built. With an agreement reached, General Mow returned to China aboard the SS Lurline, departing from Los Angeles, California on January 24, 1941. Chennault followed shortly after with a promise from the War Department and President Roosevelt to be delivered to Chiang Kai-shek that several shipments of P-40C fighters were forthcoming along with pilots, mechanics, and aviation supplies.|$|E

500|$|In the 26thcentury, a 17-year-old novice named Brother Francis Gerard is on a vigil in the desert. While {{searching for}} a rock to {{complete}} a shelter, Brother Francis encounters a Wanderer, apparently looking for the abbey, who inscribes Hebrew on a rock that appears the perfect fit for the shelter. When Brother Francis removes the rock, he discovers the entrance to an ancient fallout shelter containing [...] "relics," [...] such as handwritten notes on crumbling memo pads bearing cryptic texts resembling a 20th-century <b>shopping</b> <b>list.</b> He soon realizes that these notes {{appear to have been}} written by Leibowitz, his order's founder. The discovery of the ancient documents causes an uproar at the monastery, as the other monks speculate that the relics once belonged to Leibowitz. Brother Francis' account of the Wanderer, who ultimately never turned up at the abbey, is also greatly embellished by the other monks amid rumours that he was an apparition of Leibowitz himself; Francis strenuously denies the embellishments, but equally persistently refuses to deny that the encounter occurred, despite the lack of other witnesses. Abbot Arkos, the head of the monastery, worries that the discovery of so many potentially holy relics in such a short period may cause delays in Leibowitz's canonization process. Francis is banished back to the desert to complete his vigil, and defuse the sensationalism.|$|E

As Siavash refused to nominate, Big Brother allocated his nominations to Charlie and Sophie and Marcus and Siavash were put up for eviction. On Day 85, Siavash accepted the offer of £10,000 towards the prize fund for exchanging his clothes with an outfit provided by Big Brother and the Housemates received a £20 cheque after requesting a mystery prize from the weekly <b>shopping</b> <b>list.</b> Later that day, Marcus rejected Big Brother's offer of £15,000 to shave his ponytail and the group turned down the chance to win £1,500 by swimming 1,500 lengths of the pool.

500|$|What's Cooking? is an {{interactive}} cookbook and food preparation video game with recipes that each list preparation times, ingredients and courses. Recipes can be sorted by criteria such as dishes that take less than 20 minutes to prepare, or vegetarian-only meals. After opening a recipe, an ingredient list is presented. Items {{on the list}} can be earmarked and added to a <b>shopping</b> <b>list</b> as a reminder to purchase in the future. A timer option is also available, which counts down from a specified time and makes an audible sound when it is done. Before doing any real cooking, a virtual representation of each step in the recipe is given on the screen that must be performed by the player. The Nintendo DS touchscreen and stylus are used to perform tasks such as whisking eggs, pouring sauces and cutting vegetables. Tutorials are also available to teach the player how to perform simple cooking preparation tasks. While cooking, the Nintendo DS responds to audible commands; saying [...] "next" [...] into the device's microphone will move the recipe {{on to the next}} step. One hundred recipes are included in the game, and players can create their own dishes in the game. Afterward, they can share them with others via Wi-Fi. In addition to the game's cooking aspects, What's Cooking? features challenges in which the player uses the stylus to chop, stir, and serve as quickly as possible.|$|E
500|$|Whether any {{of these}} women could confirm their {{addresses}} for publication in Harris's List is something that author Sophie Carter doubts. [...] She views the annual as [...] "primarily a work of erotica", calling it [...] "nothing {{so much as a}} <b>shopping</b> <b>list...</b> textually arrayed for the delectation of the male consumer", continuing [...] "they [...] await his intervention to institute an exchange", epitomising the traditional male role in pornography. [...] Elizabeth Denlinger includes a similar sentiment in her essay, [...] "The Garment and the Man": [...] "This varied display of women to satisfy the 'great itch'... is a fundamental aspect of the sphere to which Harris's List offered British men a carte d'entrée". [...] Rubenhold writes that the variability in the descriptions of prostitutes over the years the list was published defy [...] "all attempts to categorise it as either exclusively up-market or simply middle of the road." [...] She suggests that the annual's purpose was to [...] "conduct the desirous to the embrace of a prostitute", and that its prose was designed for [...] "solitary sexual enjoyment" [...] (H. Ranger also sold back-issues of Harris's List). [...] Sold to a London public which was mostly patriarchal, its listings reflect the prejudices of the men who authored them. [...] They were therefore not representative of women generally, and as she concludes, [...] "it is likely that their stories would have differed quite significantly from those recounted by their customers {{for the benefit of the}} List's publishers." ...|$|E

In an analysis of teaching tools for remedial readers, Maurice Saxby notes in the book Books in the Life of a Child: Bridges to Literature & Learning, [...] "Hutchins's Don't Forget the Bacon has been one of my most successful texts." [...] The book is utilised in author Andrea Hillbrick's Tuning in with Task Cards as a teaching lesson: children are assigned to collect items from the initial and final versions of the <b>shopping</b> <b>list</b> from the boy in the story, and subsequently total the prices of the tabulated items.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend a {{previous}} recent work on Ambient Intelligence, deployed into a scenario of Intelligence Shopping Malls, with a privacy layer. In fact nowadays, in the Ambient Intelligence context, privacy issues {{are more and}} more considered an urgent and main issue to take care of. The success of this permeated ubiquitous intelligence seems to be strongly correlated to how much the scenario is able to protect the privacy and the rights of the users. The Intelligence Shopping Mall is a physical environment for commerce equipped with sensors and actuators for supporting shoppers. These latters have a wish list of the items to buy. Once in the mall, the wish list should be disclosed to steer the shopper towards the right shop selling the wished item. Anyway, from shops' point of view, <b>shopping</b> <b>lists</b> contain valuable information about shoppers. Indeed, from <b>shopping</b> <b>lists</b> one could easily infer users' personal preferences or tendency (e. g., users' lifestyle) {{that could be used for}} marketing purpose. Hence, <b>shopping</b> <b>lists</b> could reveal shoppers' sensitive information. In this paper, to preserve the shoppers' privacy without limiting the possibility to guide users towards shops selling the sought products, we propose an efficient and efficacious privacy preserving protocol. Using such a protocol, shops can steer shoppers towards the shops selling the desired items without knowing the items in their <b>shopping</b> <b>lists</b> (excluding the items bought in the shop itself) ...|$|R
