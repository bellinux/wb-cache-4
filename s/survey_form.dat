500|$|As {{the meeting}} progressed, some delegates {{publicly}} {{demanded that the}} congress {{should be given the}} authority to elect the general secretary {{and the head of the}} Central Commission for Inspection. This was approved and a <b>survey</b> <b>form</b> which listed four possible candidates; Mạnh, Nguyễn Minh Triết, Nguyễn Văn An and Nguyễn Phú Trọng was created. Nguyễn Văn An withdrew his candidacy, knowing he would not be elected to the 10th Politburo because he was not elected to the 10th Central Committee. However, because of party rules which stated that the Central Committee after the congress elected the general secretary, the vote at the congress was considered a survey. Another version of the proceedings, that given by [...] Mạnh at the press conference after the congress, was that the 1,176 congress delegates were given a list of the elected members of the 10th Central Committee, and were given a free choice of electing any of them to the general secretaryship. After the congress, on 25 April, the 1st plenum of the Central Committee convened to elect the general secretary. The two leading candidates at the congress survey, Mạnh and Nguyễn Minh Triết, stood for election at the plenum. Mạnh was elected and Nguyễn Minh Triết was appointed state president. However, rumours that Mạnh won narrowly over his rival, and that Nguyễn Minh Triết withdrew his candidature following the party tradition of appointing the general secretary, circulated after the congress.|$|E

40|$|Report {{produced}} {{as part of}} the Green Logistics project (EPSRC and Department for Transport funded). This report contains examples of <b>survey</b> <b>forms</b> used in urban freight studies both in the UK and overseas. The studies from which these examples have been drawn range in data from 1970 - 2008. The purpose of the report is to provide insight into the types of questions used in different survey techniques and also into the design of <b>survey</b> <b>forms.</b> It is hoped that bringing together in a single document these examples of urban freight <b>survey</b> <b>forms</b> will be of use to researchers involved in such studies in future in planning and designing their survey work.

This was disputed by Kentucky Right to Life, however, who endorsed Paul's primary opponent instead and said that Paul had not, in fact, answered the stem-cell research question. As reported by the Cincinnati Enquirer at the time, the Kentucky Right to Life produced a hard-copy of the <b>survey</b> <b>form</b> from Paul showing that he had not answered the question while Paul's campaign produced an electronic copy of the form showing that he had answered the question.

The Small Craft penetrates this installation's defenses and causes a massive explosion, resulting in the ship being sent back to the surface, heavily damaged. The player sets off again in search of another beacon. The Small Craft begins to fall apart, system after system failing and shutting down until only the most basic systems are left online. The player finally discovers a working beacon {{in the middle of a}} harsh blizzard that, despite generating maximum heat, threatens to freeze the Small Craft solid. After filling out a casual <b>survey</b> <b>form,</b> the beacon puts the player in stasis to await extraction.

These devices offer innovative ways to gather data, and eliminate the laborious [...] "data entry" [...] (of paper form data into a computer), which delays data analysis and understanding. By eliminating paper, mobile data collection can also dramatically reduce costs: one World Bank study in Guatemala found a 71% decrease in cost while using mobile data collection, compared to the previous paper-based approach.|$|E
50|$|In 1937 the League of American Writers {{sent out}} surveys to over 1,000 American writers asking their {{position}} on the Spanish Civil War. Some 418 returned the survey forms, with 410 supporting the Loyalists to the Spanish Republic, 7 professing neutrality, and only one — Gertrude Atherton — supporting General Francisco Franco and his nationalist forces. In accord with the CPUSA's political line, no {{effort was made to}} contact writers known to be sympathetic to Leon Trotsky. When Max Eastman, a translator of Trotsky and opponent of Joseph Stalin, was inadvertently mailed a <b>survey</b> <b>form,</b> Eastman's reply was excluded at the insistence of Communist Party newspaper editor Moissaye Olgin. The other replies were distilled into a pamphlet published by the League of American Writers, entitled Writers Take Sides.|$|E

5000|$|Tour Guides: Immediately {{after the}} Assault Course, the group {{selected}} Fiona and Shane {{as the two}} players who they thought were most handy at spinning a yarn. The {{two of them were}} taken to Melbourne, and given the assignment of posing as guides on a tour bus, and lying to 26 complete strangers. They had to two boldfaced lies and be believed, and tell two jokes, getting a laugh from each. Shane tried to lie first, but told an unbelievable, absurd, and overly detailed story. Fiona then managed to tell outrageous lies that were counted. Shane next tried a joke, but since he asked the tourists to laugh, it was disallowed. They then each managed to tell a joke that got at least someone in their group to laugh. At the end of the trip, each tourist was presented a <b>survey</b> <b>form,</b> and to win the $5,000, each of them had to grade Fiona and Shane's job as tour guides either [...] "excellent" [...] or [...] "very good." [...] They received nine [...] "very good" [...] and seventeen [...] "excellent" [...] ratings, winning the money.|$|E
5000|$|These distinctions were {{simplified}} in a 2005 independent survey {{requested by}} the EU's Directorate-General for Education and Culture regarding {{the extent to which}} major European languages were spoken in member states. The results were published in a 2006 document, [...] "Europeans and Their Languages", or [...] "Eurobarometer 243", which is disavowed as official by the European Commission, but does supply some scientific data concerning language use in the EU. In this study, statistically relevant samples of the population in each country were asked to fill out a <b>survey</b> <b>form</b> concerning the languages that they spoke with sufficient competency [...] "to {{be able to have a}} conversation". Some of the results showing the distribution of major languages are shown in the maps below. The darkest colors report the highest proportion of speakers. Only EU members were studied. Thus data on Russian speakers were gathered, but Russia is not an EU member and so Russian does not appear in Russia on the maps. It does appear as spoken to the greatest extent in the Baltic countries, which are EU members that were formerly under Soviet rule; followed by former Eastern bloc countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and the northeastern part of Germany (former socialist East Germany).|$|E
