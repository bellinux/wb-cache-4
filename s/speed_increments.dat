Stator units are composed of the proteins MotA and MotB in proton-driven motors, and they are composed of PomA and PomB in sodium-driven motors. Strains of Escherichia coli lacking functional stator proteins produce flagella that do not rotate, and induced expression of the missing proteins leads to restoration of motor rotation in discrete <b>speed</b> <b>increments,</b> a process known as "resurrection. " Early work suggested a maximum of eight units. More recent indications that WT motors may contain more than eight units, based on recovery of disrupted motors, are inconclusive. Here we demonstrate conclusively that the maximum number of units in a motor is at least 11. Using back-focal-plane interferometry of 1 -mum polystyrene beads attached to flagella, we observed at least 11 distinct <b>speed</b> <b>increments</b> during resurrection with three different combinations of stator proteins in E. coli.

As {{a result of a}} need for a test to measure this physiological attribute, the Yo-Yo tests were developed. The Yo-Yo tests incorporate 2 [*]×[*] 20  m shuttles interspersed with 10  s of active recovery with <b>speed</b> <b>increments</b> regulated by audio signals from a CD player. Participants continue until they can no longer maintain the speed imposed by audio signals, and the distance covered at that moment is the test result [10, 12]. Yo-Yo IR 1 begins at lower speed (10  km/h) than Yo-Yo IR 2 (13  km/h) with slighter <b>speed</b> <b>increments.</b> The Yo-Yo IR 1 assesses an individual’s capacity to repeatedly perform aerobic exercise leading to maximal activation of the aerobic system whilst the Yo-Yo IR 2 focuses on the ability to recover from repeated high intensity exercise with a large anaerobic contribution alongside a significant aerobic component [10]. In untrained participants, the Yo-Yo IR 1 elicits this physiologic response. In trained participants, the Yo-Yo IR 1 typically lasts 15 – 20  min whilst Yo-Yo IR 2 lasts 5 – 15  min. Accordingly, Yo-Yo IR 1 [6, 7] has been reported to be more suitable for recreational players whereas the Yo-Yo IR 2 is more applicable to trained subjects [10]. Both Yo-Yo recovery tests allow for quick determination of maximal heart rate in participants, with faster increases in heart rate observed in Yo-Yo IR 2 [10]. Increased blood lactate and muscle lactate accumulation is elicited in Yo-Yo IR 2, as well as lower creatine phosphate levels on completion of the test and a higher rate of average muscle glycogen utilization during Yo-Yo IR 2 [36, 87].|$|E

40|$|Terrain {{rendering}} {{has always}} been an expensive task due to large input data models. Hierarchical mul-tiresolution triangulation and level-of-detail rendering algorithms over regular structures of grid digital elevation models have been widely used for interactive terrain visualization. The main drawbacks of these are the large cost of memory storage required and the possible over-sampling of highresolution terrain models. Triangulated irregular networks (TIN) can reduce the amount of vertices at the expense of more complex and slower memory data access. We present a hyper-block quadtree based triangulated irregular networks approach, where the notion of vertex-selection is extended to block-selection. The hyper-block structure allows to store different pre-calculated triangulations. This reduces the vertex selection time per frame and removes the calculations needed to build the geometric rendering primitives (triangle strips) of the scene at the expense of a larger number of selected vertices.
