50|$|After {{the success}} of this scheme, two similar tunnels were driven 1500 yd west from the same point of origin, gaining access to the White and Black seam in the south western field. The {{increased}} coal capacity resulted in the rope haulage system being replaced by a trunk conveying system in the main horizon tunnel, which had been extended to No.4 pit bottom. A 200-ton capacity <b>surge</b> <b>bunker</b> was installed to avoid delays in the event of stoppage at the shaft. A minor re-organisation and efficiency scheme was completed in 1967 which concentrated all production and coal winding in the Nos. 3 and 4 shafts, leaving Nos. 1 and 2 shafts for ventilation purposes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBesides the {{inspection}} of material {{behaviors of the}} collapsed raw-coal <b>surge</b> <b>bunker,</b> comprehensive safety of the loading bunkers and the clean-coal bunkers were inspected. The parameters involve apparent characteristics, carbonized depth, compression strength of concrete, corrosion rate of steel bar, decline degree of bunkers and so on. In addition, analyses were made on the special natural, technologic, mechanical and geologic environment around the bunkers. On this basis, this paper studied the deterioration and collapse mechanism of reinforced concrete (RC) bunkers. The {{results suggest that the}} coupling action of poor concrete quality, severe natural environment, complex technologic and mechanical environment, and also special geologic environment speed up the deterioration rate of RC, which is a major reason for collapse of raw-coal <b>surge</b> <b>bunker.</b> And then further investigation was made on the curing techniques of degraded RC bunkers. It can provide theoretical basis for ensuring the long-term safety, workability and durability of degraded RC coal bunkers...|$|E
