40|$|Nowadays, {{one of the}} {{important}} problems in translation field will be Translation of Proper Nouns. This is an arduous task in Translation Studies to convey the main essence of the nouns amongst cultures. This is somehow {{due to the fact that}} every culture has its own system of rendering of proper nouns. Longman Dictionary of Language Teaching and Applied Linguistics (Richards & Schmidt, 2002, p. 429) defines the proper name as "a name which is the name of a particular person, place, or thing. Proper nouns have disparate allusions such as age, sex, specific connotations, and geographical regions. This study scrutinized two major translations of Animal Farm of George Orwell. The first rendering is pertained to Amirshahi (2010) and the second one Firuzbakht (1988). Finally, this study seeks to investigate the translation procedures of proper nouns in accordance with Newmark and Vermeer’s (<b>Skopos)</b> <b>theories</b> of translation. This study shows that Newmark mostly peruses proper noun artificially to saturate the taste of the reader. While, Vermeer sets up the mutual agreement between the reader as the client and the translator in this process. nrpages: 19 - 28 status: publishe...|$|R

Based on the questions proposed by <b>skopos</b> and polysystem <b>theories</b> {{as well as}} the recent advances in perspectives on the ideology of translation, this translation studies thesis suggests a first step in analyzing the reception of contemporary Polish literature in translation in North America {{within the context of a}} world language market. Four Polish novels, written after 1989 by an author born and living in Poland and translated in English and in French have been scrutinized to determine if the translation of contemporary Polish literature regularly transmits a specific image that would give rise to a stereotype of the contemporary Pole. First, the study aims to suggest possible reasons why these novels were successful in Poland. What national policy do the authors and their works have to comply with in order meet the Polish critics' and reader's approval? Then, it is commonly accepted that literary quality, content representativeness and the historical importance of a work as well as its success in the original target culture are what partly determines what will be translated. These questions will allow us to consider a few of the reasons as to why these novels were selected for translation. Finally, it is interesting to assess and suggest an explanation with regard to the reception of the works. In broader terms, it is also significant to examine the impact these translations have had in the target cultures insofar as translation provides a significant representation of the source culture...|$|R

40|$|In translation, {{there are}} many {{theories}} offered. The <b>Skopos</b> <b>theory</b> of translation is said as the most accountable theory for all observed translation types (Colina, 2003 : 11). This <b>Skopos</b> <b>theory</b> gives focus on {{the purpose of the}} translation (Nord as quoted in Munday, 2001 : 78). It means that the quality of the translation depended on the fulfillment of the intended purpose. Based on Colina's, the writer wondered about the Skopos' perspective in the translation of one of the best-seller books i. e. Chicken Soup for the Teacher's Soul. The sampling was taken purposefully in accordance with the target reader's setting. The total sampling was 20 out of 94 texts. Using qualitative research, those 20 texts were analyzed within <b>Skopos</b> <b>theory</b> to find out whether the text was in line with the purpose (Skopos) and how the translational action and translation brief in <b>Skopos</b> <b>theory</b> lead the translator in translating. Since this study analyzed the data {{from the point of view}} of the <b>Skopos</b> <b>theory,</b> the writer brought up the theory itself along with its arguments, the translational action and translational brief. To support and validate the writer's analysis and findings, she used investigator triangulation. The writer distributed 20 questionnaires to 20 teachers ranging from elementary to high school. Based on the finding of the questionnaires, 19 out of 20 respondents appeared to well understand and were inspired by the text. The writer found out that most text (19 out of 20 texts) could support the intended Skopos. It indicated that the Skopos did not explicitly state or in other words it is against what Vermeer (in Munday, 2001 : 79) said that the Skopos is a crucial element in the translation. Though in such condition, the translator as well as the target readers could perceive the purpose of the texts very well because they had been knowledgeable about the texts. That is why the Skopos, the translational action, translation brief are not necessarily stated. Therefore, to avoid confusion, it is suggested that a preface in the translation version be provided and have the students of translation course know about texts that would be translated. However, this study is not exhaustive. It did not cover the texts that were not suitable with the TT readers' setting nor discussed the influence of time and place difference of ST and TT.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the practice of}} Bible translation {{from the perspective of}} contemporary translation studies and provides a fresh translation and accompanying commentary of aspects of Paul's Letter to the Romans. The emergence of functionalism, particularly <b>skopos</b> <b>theory,</b> {{in the latter part of}} the 20 th century is seen as a key moment in the development of translation theory. The thesis argues that it has significant advantages over source text orientated approaches which have traditionally dominated Bible translation practice. An essential history documents this evolution of theoretical developments in translation study. The advantages of <b>skopos</b> <b>theory</b> over equivalence-based approaches are discussed with particular reference to Bible translation theory and the work of E. A. Nida. The functionalist approach increases the range of possible translations, with this thesis adopting a foreignising purpose in a new translation of Romans 1 : 1 - 15, 15 : 14 - 16 : 27. The foreignising approach owes its origins to F. Schleiermacher (popularised more recently by L. Venuti among others) and involves rendering a text so as to preserve or heighten the sense of otherness of the source text, thereby retaining something of the foreignness of the original. An accompanying commentary is provided to explain the translator's choices. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|For the html presentation, please see: [URL] audienceDrawing on the author’s {{experience}} of translating a French scenario de film for multiple uses – from ‘pitching’ at Cannes to location shoots in India – this paper examines how an overlooked field challenges functionalist translation theories. <b>Skopos</b> <b>theory,</b> in particular, (Vermeer, Reiss, Nord etc.) is {{stretched to the}} limit by such a multifunctional text type. While skopos can be criticized for a reductive intentionality – limiting a text’s flexibility and transferability in reception, and excluding the scriptible (Barthes) – such concerns are relevant mostly to literary translation. Functionalist theory is well established in specialised technical translation and its teaching. The translation of pre-production film scripts is notable for its absence in functionalist work on text typology. Like other cinematic translation types, it {{calls into question the}} dichotomy of technical and literary translation (and the implicitly correlative division of ‘documentary’ and ‘instrumental’ translation). Unlike subtitling or dubbing, however, it involves producing a TT designed to function simultaneously in a vast array of specialised reading contexts: from ‘grabbing’ a prospective investor (silent reading) to technical production uses. Even a monolingual script is both an advertisement and a blueprint for its own ‘intersemiotic’ translation, designed for use by the various specialists involved in producing such an adaptation. A translated script in a multilingual/multicultural production can serve many of the same functions – replacing some of those in the ST – whilst also performing concomitant intercultural ‘documentary’ functions in relation to the ST, as it is used (for instance) in performance by actors [...] . While <b>skopos</b> <b>theory</b> seems well equipped to deal with global concerns of function – such as adaptation to different norms of presentation based on different uses of a script across cinematic cultures (France, Hollywood, Bollywood) – and even particular skopoi in a ‘granularised’ ST, it is poorly equipped to deal practically with a form of meta-intersemiotic translation for which the TT is both simultaneously multi-functional and designed to augment, rather than to replace, the ST. The author therefore suggests that his model of synoptic strategic layering (described elsewhere in relation to poetry and journalism) might be applied to the translation of film scripts, as part of a modified functionalist approach. Metaphorically founded on Disney’s multi-plane animation, and integrating Tophoven’s theory of Transparenz, strategic layering is capable of overlaying and tracing instrumental function layers in both ST and TT and therefore improving the practical applicability of <b>skopos</b> <b>theory</b> to the translation of simultaneously multifunctional (meta) texts...|$|E
40|$|M. A. University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Humanities (Translation), 2012 This {{research}} report discusses {{the translation of}} advertisements paying attention to persuasion, semiotics, and symbolism. It illustrates the importance of symbolism and semiotics in persuading consumers across cultures. The research uses Coca‐Cola {{as a case study}} in order to discuss the strategies used by translators in translating persuasive text in print advertisements across cultures and to elaborate on key issues in the translation of advertisements and on theories that are very useful to translators of advertising materials. Semiotics, symbolism and the techniques used by advertisers and translators in persuading, as well as theories related to the translation of advertisements such as <b>skopos</b> <b>theory,</b> relevance theory and functional equivalence are discussed in the literature review and are assessed in the corpus analysis. The importance of sociology, culture and ideology is also illustrated in the study and a brief discussion of the discourse of advertisements is given {{in order to understand the}} mechanism of advertisement. This is because translators need to understand how advertising functions before they can translate it. This {{research report}} performs a comparative analysis of 30 Coca‐Cola advertisements in English and their translations into French from 1905 to 2011. By analysing and comparing the English advertisements of Coca‐Cola and their translations, this study shows how semiotics and symbolism may be used to analyse the techniques that are used in the advertisements to achieve persuasion in the different French settings. The analysis is further based on Relevance theory, Equivalence theory and <b>skopos</b> <b>theory</b> within the framework of DTS. Observations include translators’ understanding and good management of the visual and textual elements and good understanding of how to render an advertisement truly global by focussing on global, universal and neutral values...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} effects and {{implications}} {{of the use of}} non-standard language in Irvine Welsh’s novel Trainspotting (1993) and examines the treatment of language in the Estonian translation of the novel by Olavi Teppan (2010) proceeding from the concept of the dominant as well as <b>skopos</b> <b>theory.</b> The main hypothesis of the thesis is that the specifically Scottish elements of the source text have been reduced in the target text and that the translator has conveyed thematic rather than linguistic concerns. The thesis consists of an introduction, two core chapters, and a conclusion. The introduction provides a brief overview of the socio-historical context of Trainspotting as well as the novel’s key features, such as a quest for linguistic authenticity {{and the use of the}} vernacular, and the main thematic concerns of the novel, such as the depiction of working-class life and transgressive subject matter. The first core chapter focuses on the use of language in the source text, examining the relationship between the languages spoken in Scotland, namely Scots and Scottish English, and discussing their relation to Standard English. The terms ‘language’ and ‘dialect’ are observed in the light of sociolinguistics and the sociolect spoken by the central characters of the novel is explored and illustrated with examples of informal register and colloquial vernacular. The second core chapter introduces the theoretical framework of the study: the concept of the dominant, originating in Russian Formalism and expounded on by Roman Jakobson, and the target-text-based and target-culture-oriented <b>skopos</b> <b>theory</b> developed by Hans J. Vermeer. Thereafter, the idiolects of the novel’s eight first-person narrators are analysed by comparing and contrasting their representation in Welsh’s novel and in Teppan’s translation of the novel into Estonian. The results of the study will be presented in the conclusion...|$|E

40|$|The article {{addresses}} Ferdinand de Saussure’s translation into French of Aeschylus’ tragedy, Agamemnon.  Through {{the comparison}} with other French translations, it examines the double mechanism of condensation- -dissemination, which allows the translator to produce a particularly vivid version of the playwright’s poetic images. In order to achieve a high-quality translation, Saussure embraces the author’s literary intention, which entails taking into account two types of condensation-dissemination: that of present traits and that of absent traits. The latter are evoked by the selected syntagmatic combinations. The process developed by Saussure is especially interesting due to the convergence of his linguistic theory, his style of writing, and his translating and pedagogical activity. For this reason, the article also analyzes the didactics of the professor-translator, {{on the basis of}} two time periods that can be related to two translation theories: the theory of meaning and <b>skopos</b> <b>theory...</b>|$|E

The model is structured in ten stages, each addressing one of the specific linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects of the contract as a text type. When translating contracts, a very specific situation may arise with respect to the cultural embeddedness of the target text, since memes of different legal cultures may co-exist at various levels. This is especially the case when the contracting parties decide to use a third language as a lingua franca, which may lack any direct correlation with the legal culture(s) underlying the contract...|$|E
