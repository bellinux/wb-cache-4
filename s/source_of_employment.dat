5|$|Lurgan has {{historically}} been an industrial town in which the linen industry predominated as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> during the Industrial Revolution, and {{is said to have}} employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers {{at the end of the}} 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town's resident population at the time. That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of outsourcing to low wage countries.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar Ales {{is a small}} brewery {{based in}} the village, {{producing}} beer for local public houses.

5|$|Since 1942 {{research}} and development into physics and electronics has been the major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in Malvern when during World War II the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) moved from Worth Matravers on the south coast for safety from enemy action. Its staff worked on airborne radar and other electronic warfare resources for the RAF.|$|E
5|$|Ashford {{has been}} a {{communications}} hub and has stood at the centre of five railway lines since the 19th century. The arrival of the railways became a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> {{and contributed to the}} town's growth. With the opening of the international passenger station it is now a European communications centre, with new lines running between London and the Channel Tunnel (via High Speed 1). The M20 motorway also links Ashford to those two destinations for road traffic.|$|E

5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning {{to fall out of}} favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{today has}} only two small cities, Bath and Wells, and only small towns in {{comparison}} with other areas of England. Tourism is a major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> along the coast, and in Bath and Cheddar for example.

5|$|The {{headquarters}} of North Yorkshire County Council (County Hall) and Hambleton District Council (the Civic Centre) are both located in Northallerton; these serve many parishes in the area. The RPA (Rural Payments Agency) was based here until 2014. The nearby base at RAF Leeming {{is a major}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and income in the area. Northallerton Prison, which used to house young offenders and adults from the North Yorkshire area, closed in 2014. It once had the world's largest treadmill.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|By the Elizabeth period, Dunham Massey Castle {{had been}} demolished. Probably during the medieval period, Dunham Massey Hall became {{the home of}} the manorial lord, and a centre of power in the area. The hall was rebuilt in 1616, leaving no remains of the old medieval manor house. A mill at Dunham was {{documented}} in 1353, although the its present structure dates to the 1860s. It lies on the River Bollin, opposite Little Bollington. The first record of Dunham's deer park was also in 1353. The settlement at Dunham Woodhouse (named after an outlying lodge on the estate) dates from the 15th century. During the medieval period, the primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> was agriculture, mainly arable farming.|$|E
5|$|Farming was {{the main}} {{occupation}} in Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became a significant <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> although this later declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming had virtually died out, and the town became a residence for the middle classes.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} Great Depression of the 1930s, and many Puerto Ricans {{moved to the}} East Coast of the United States looking for jobs and {{a better way of}} life. On the island, the unemployment rate continued to rise and many Puerto Ricans who were unable to find a job looked to the Armed Forces of the United States as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> Not only were they paid better than at the few other available jobs, but they were also guaranteed three meals a day, clothing, and shelter.|$|E
5|$|The Corsica and Elba mines {{remained}} the chief <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> until 1926, when the underground Elba mine closed. It had been mined out. A few years later, the Corsica mine was converted {{into an open}} pit, {{and the future of}} the town once again seemed secure. Then the Great Depression hit. In the fall of 1929, Corsica closed and stayed closed for many years, with only a few salaried people retained. The mine remained idle until 1940, ironically receiving an honorable mention in the National Safety Competition from the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1934. Once World War II began, the mining business boomed again.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{sector is}} {{considered}} a cornerstone of the economy, being a large <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> hard currency and economic growth. In 2010, there were 8 million visitors to Jordan. The result was $3.4 billion in tourism revenues, $4.4 billion with the inclusion of medical tourists. The majority of tourists coming to Jordan are from European and Arab countries. The tourism sector in Jordan has been severely affected by regional turbulence. The most recent blow to the tourism sector {{was caused by the}} Arab Spring, which scared off tourists from the entire region. Jordan experienced a 70% {{decrease in the number of}} tourists from 2010 to 2016.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century Stretford was {{a largely}} {{agricultural}} village. The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, beginning in the late 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford's subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000workers; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land. Trafford Park is still a very significant <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people. As at the 2001 UK census, 0.3% of Stretford's working population was employed in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered {{from the fact that the}} harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the harbour area but were still the largest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> thanks in part to the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and the slaughterhouse (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E
5|$|During {{the medieval}} period, {{most of the}} land was used for growing crops and raising {{livestock}} such as cattle. The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes. Agriculture provided the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> for Sale's residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to develop in the area, as in most of what would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area, the Stamfords and the de Traffords, to invest. Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in that industry.|$|E
