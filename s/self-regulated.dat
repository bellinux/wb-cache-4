5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} <b>self-regulated</b> by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Within this {{framework}} certain sectors of GA are governed on a devolved basis. In all cases the CAA/EASA retains responsibility for safety regulation, but representative bodies, particularly of sectors {{that are not}} included in the scope of EASA, are granted greater oversight of their activities. The majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA), although a significant number are regulated by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA), formerly known as the Popular Flying Association. The LAA is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft, as well as vintage and classic aircraft. Parachuting is governed by the British Parachute Association, although the aircraft used in this activity are generally CAA-regulated. Balloon and airship flying is overseen by the British Balloon and Airship Club. The UK-specific National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) is administered by the National Pilots Licensing Group Ltd., supported by the LAA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association UK, the British Gliding Association, and the British Microlight Aircraft Association. Separate from these devolved groups, gliding in the UK is <b>self-regulated.</b> The British Gliding Association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness, now formally regulated as a result of EASA legislation, and still retains control of pilot certification. Hang gliding and paragliding activities (i.e. foot-launched gliders) are governed by the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and <b>self-regulated</b> body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal Trade Commission found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to outline and explain students' {{responsibility}} for learning by investigating the importance of the constructivist <b>self-regulating</b> learning approach to information technology student learning at a tertiary institution in Australia. A research model was developed from the fundamental of the constructivist <b>self-regulating</b> learning principles and theories to evaluate tertiary students learning. Six factors (intrinsic motivation, mental representations, levels of understanding, developmental constraints on learning and reflection to stimulate learning) were identified. A total of 147 students participated in this research between 2005 and 2007. The learning environment and assessment tasks were carefully developed to be aligned with the constructivist <b>self-regulating</b> learning approach. Results suggest that constructivist <b>self-regulating</b> learning is an important approach for Information Technology students.

So it necessary that researches investigate origins of <b>self-regulating</b> and factors that related to it. One factors that effect on <b>self-regulating</b> is perceptions of class and university activities. Purpose of StudyThe aim {{of this research is}} studying the relations among classroom perceptions, and <b>self-regulating</b> and predicting <b>self-regulating</b> by perceptions of class activities components. Research MethodsTo do the study, a multi-stage cluster sampling method was used and a sample of 600 students from Iranian students, were selected, Students’ The motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (Pintrich & De Groot, 1990), and Students’ Perceptions of Classroom Activities (Gentry, Gable, & Rizza, 2002), were administrated to students as a group. Questionnaires validity and reliability were verified. FindingsThe results of Pearson correlation showed that the mutual correlations between all components of classroom perceptions, (interest, joint, challenge and choice), with <b>self-regulating</b> were positive and significant statistically (p< 0. 01). Results of regression analysis show that <b>self-regulating</b> learning was predicted by perceptions of class activities (F (4, 487) = 13 / 23, p< 0 / 001).

The purpose of the article is to explore the content features of <b>self-regulating</b> organizations, to identify problems in their implementation and offer recommendations for their solution. Methodology. The methodological basis for the study: general scientific methods (analysis, synthesis, comparison, description); private and academic (interpretation, formal-legal method). Results, scope. Under self-regulation this article is to understand the management activities carried out by self-regulatory organizations, and consisting in the development and establishment of standards and rules of professional activity, as well as sanctions for non-compliance or inadequate performance. Set forth in the Law on SRO powers to <b>self-regulating</b> organizations United by the author and summarized as to their functions – activities of the SRO. The main functions of the SRO as special entities, the following: – regulatory, which manifests itself in the development of standards and rules, conditions of membership in <b>self-regulating</b> organizations and other internal documents SRO; – control: <b>self-regulating</b> organizations exercise control over the professional activities of its members; – organizational and security: an example of this function is the maintenance of the register of members of the SRO, ensuring property liability of members of <b>self-regulating</b> organizations to consumers of goods (works, services) and other persons forming management authorities of the <b>self-regulating</b> organization, lodging of statutory documents and information on the official website of SRO; – jurisdictional: SRO consider complaints against actions of members of <b>self-regulating</b> organization and cases on breaches of its members of the standards and rules of <b>self-regulating</b> organizations, conditions of membership in <b>self-regulating</b> organization, apply disciplinary measures against its members. Conclusions. The combination of ongoing <b>self-regulating</b> organizations against their members functions determines features of the legal status of SRO. Analysis of peculiarities of <b>self-regulating</b> organizations of these functions has allowed the author come to the conclusion that, at present, administrative and legal status of <b>self-regulating</b> organizations in need of further refinement, since the content of normative legal acts regulating relations in the sphere of self-regulation, often contradictory and requires improvement. In the case of mandatory self-regulation SRO vested with the special administrative-legal status, carry out in relation to their member state authority, which means that the implementation of these authority relationships are vertical. </p...|$|R

25|$|This {{partnership}} with the community was in line with Sir Stamford Raffles' vision of a thriving colony largely <b>self-regulated</b> by local social structures, with the British masters administrating it via indirect rule. The large influx of migrants from China, however, began to test this system when the hands-off approach by the British allowed secret societies in Singapore to thrive. Although originally formed with legal intentions of community bonding {{and the provision of}} assistance to fellow migrants, these societies gradually became influential, competitive, and increasingly engaged in illegal activity including monetary extortion from the masses, the operation of gambling dens, and the smuggling of illegal goods on top of more legal commercial operations to meet their financial needs.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 a study {{conducted}} by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi was published in the Journal of Social Psychology, in which they intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of <b>self-regulated</b> performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.|$|E

2500|$|Pierpont Bay (Pierpont) is a {{residential}} {{neighborhood in the}} one-mile stretch between the Ventura Harbor and San Buenaventura State Beach. Reclaimed marshland was subdivided in 1925 and houses were built in fits of development interrupted by years of economic depression, war, and coastal floods (in 1937 and 1962). Long a hodge-podge of rental dwellings, weekend cottages and vacant lots, it was transformed by successive California real estate booms into a fashionable but eclectic mix of newer large homes and older modest beach cottages, now mostly owner-occupied. Piecemeal development, not overly burdened by planning efforts or regulatory attentions, left Pierpont with widely varying architectural styles, a spotty retail district Seaward Avenue, newer residents' demands for increased municipal [...] maintenance, and continuing disputes about the proper regulation of the neighborhood's public beaches. Recently plans have been announced for high-density development on some streets, and state authorities have begun to more actively manage beaches that were mostly <b>self-regulated</b> for eighty years.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond rules restricting {{takeover}} defences, {{a series}} of rules are in place to partly protect, and partly impose obligations on minority shareholders. Under CA 2006 section 979 when a takeover bidder has already acquired 90 per cent of a company's shares it can [...] "squeeze out" [...] or compulsorily purchase the minority's shares at the same price per share as paid {{for the rest of}} the takeover. Only if a court determines that price is [...] "manifestly unfair" [...] (and market prices are presumed fair) can the shareholder object, or if the whole arrangement is merely a trick for incumbent shareholders to expropriate a minority they find undesirable, or it can be shown that shareholders had been given insufficient information to properly evaluate the offer. Conversely section 983 allows minority shareholders to require that their stakes are bought out. Further standards apply to listed companies under the Takeover Code. The Code contains six principles for takeover bids. Shareholders in the same class should be equally treated, there must be time for them to adequate information including consequences for employees, the board must act in the company's whole interests not their own, false markets and share prices should not artificially fluctuate, bids should only be announced when bidders can follow through with money, and a bid should not distract the business longer than reasonable. Following on from these principles are 38 rules, designed to flesh out in legal terms the [...] "common sense" [...] standards embodied in the 6 principles. The Takeover Panel administers the Code, and enforces it. Originally established in 1968 as a private club that <b>self-regulated</b> its members' practices, was held in R (Datafin plc) v Takeover Panel to be subject to judicial review of its actions where decisions are found to be manifestly unfair. Despite a handful of challenges, this has not happened.|$|E
