[...] While many Saudis are employed by the government, {{there are not enough}} jobs for the growing number of youth. As of 2006 the private sector was largely dominated by expatriate workers from Southeast Asia and the Arab world.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{being an}} oil-rich country, Saudi Arabia, {{like any other}} {{developing}} country, is faced with the difficulty of economic development {{and the creation of}} jobs for its growing population. Since human resources in the initial period of economic development were met with immigrant workers in Saudi Arabia, expatriates constitute {{a large part of the}} workforce in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, in responding to job creation needs, the Government of Saudi Arabia initiated the process of <b>Saudisation,</b> aiming to transfer the available jobs currently filled by expatriates to Saudi nationals. This research, hence, aimed to explore the perceptions of <b>Saudisation</b> in the private sector among employers, employees and Saudi job seekers in Saudi Arabia through a questionnaire schedule. Perceptions of Saudisation-related issues, the government’s policies to ensure <b>Saudisation,</b> and initiatives to enhance <b>Saudisation</b> were surveyed. Relevant issues, such as the type of employment competencies and personal specifications required in the private sector, and whether Saudi workers and jobseekers possessed them to an adequate level, were also explored. The research findings on perceptions of Saudisation-related issues included the willingness of employers to employ adequately qualified Saudi workers; lack of skills required in the private sector among Saudi workers and their lower productivity compared to non-Saudi workers; social prestige among Saudi workers; and the negative impact of imposed-Saudisation on the private sector. Support for the proposed government policies of minimum wage and social security policy to ensure <b>Saudisation</b> in the private sector and awareness among employers of their Saudisation-related social responsibility to encourage <b>Saudisation,</b> were found. Rewarding businesses that achieved a high level of <b>Saudisation,</b> increasing awareness of the importance of work among Saudis, and offering them more jobs in the private sector were initiatives advocated to enhance <b>Saudisation.</b> Employment competencies and person specifications required by private sector employers included IT or technology; language; vocational, management and administrative skills; continuous training and self-development; respect for work and regulations; and education with more emphasis on degree and post-secondary qualifications. Differences in the extent of agreement on all the issues were explored and fundamental differences in perceptions between employers on one hand and employees and job seekers on the other were found. Statistically significant associations were also found between employers' perceptions and their demographic and organizational characteristics (qualifications, length of tenure in organisation, type of business, size of business in terms of number of employees). These differences and associations seem supportive of the inferences and arguments made in the discussion on the main findings of the research on perceptions. The dearth of research on <b>Saudisation,</b> especially in the private sector, as perceived by its employers, employees and Saudi job seekers, who are the stakeholders most affected by it, render the above findings a significant contribution to knowledge on <b>Saudisation</b> and the localization of human resources in the Gulf Corporation Council and MENA countries.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} <b>Saudisation</b> practices in the Saudi private sector. The focus of the empirical research is five supermarket firms operating in Saudi Arabia. The thesis investigates the development of <b>Saudisation</b> practices over time with a particular focus on the period between 2003 and 2007. Methodologically, this research adopts the mixed methods approach to data collection by using both quantitative and qualitative data. The study applies explanation-building and pattern-matching techniques to analyse the data collected. Theoretically, the study draws on analytical models from institutional theory, in particular {{from the work of}} Greenwood, Paauwe, Scott, Oliver and others. The thesis makes a further contribution to existing work by scholars of contextual human resources management and the Dutch HR network. The research findings show that <b>Saudisation</b> practices are an institutional field. The field has prime actors such as the Ministry of Labour, leading supermarket chains and young Saudis. Those primary actors and other secondary ones apply regulative, normative and culture-cognitive pressures. The result of these pressures is the isomorphism of <b>Saudisation</b> practices, in which practices are diffused in the industry. This study shows that under limited and contradictory institutional pressure, practices are not diffused. However, <b>Saudisation</b> practices are diffused under extensive pressure or where there is potential return for the business. This research also suggests that the leading firms tend to have a common demographic composition, both as entire organisations and also, in part, in their senior management teams...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of nurses in the Saudi health system are expatriates and <b>Saudisation</b> of nursing faces difficulties in attracting students and retaining Saudi nurses in the workforce. Objectives: Whilst {{previous studies have}} focused on cultural and religious issues, this paper focuses on the Saudi nurse-training pathway and its contribution to <b>Saudisation.</b> Method: In the absence of centrally-collected data, a survey of all nurse-training institutions in KSA was conducted. Results: It was found there has been a great {{increase in the number of}} places, but the vast majority are at Diploma level. Considerable regional disparities were observed and the private sector is playing an increasing role in provision. Whilst males have over half the places there is no degree-level provision for them. Conclusions & Recommendations: It is concluded that to achieve <b>Saudisation</b> more places, central data collection and planning are needed. In addition, regional and gender disparities in provision might affect <b>Saudisation</b> negatively. Despite the fact that applications exceed places, there are fewer entrants than places. It is difficult to determine the exact number of qualified applicants and thus to conclude how strong demand for places is. Recommendations are made relating to planning and policy issues, nursing education and attracting more students. More attention should be given to publicising and making the nursing profession more attractive. For example, salaries for Saudi nursing staff should be increased. A nursing admissions service should be established which provides high school leavers with the information they need about nursing and job guarantees should be offered to nursing graduates. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the wage differentials and wage discrimination among {{employees in the}} chemical and petrochemical industries in Saudi Arabia. The context of segmentation is discussed through a detailed examination of the distinct features of the Saudi labour market, with a special emphasis on the <b>Saudisation</b> labour policy that reflects government intervention in the labour market. Under the <b>Saudisation</b> labour policy, the government compelled private firms to attract Saudi nationals to join their services and to secure them permanent jobs. The present study discusses how this policy has distorted the structure and function of the Saudi labour market from both the demand and supply side perspectives. Due {{to the lack of}} official data on the Saudi labour market and the restrictions by the Statistics Law in Saudi Arabia on access to any cross-sectional data, a purpose designed cross-sectional survey was conducted among a sample of six hundred Saudi and non-Saudi workers in these industries. Simple statistical analyses of the survey returns have revealed substantial differences in the pay and working conditions between Saudi and non-Saudi workers across a number of personal characteristics, such as levels of education, occupation, years of working experience and marital status. Regression analyses have further confirmed the significant differences in the effects of supply side factors on the monthly earnings on Saudi and non-Saudi workers. Using the Oaxaca-Blinder technique to measure and to decompose differences in average monthly earnings between Saudis and non-Saudis in the chemical and petrochemical industries, the study reveals that the aggregate earnings differentials between the two groups of workers is 62. 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of studies concerning <b>Saudisation</b> policy {{as a solution}} to decrease the unemployment of nationals and reduce the reliance on expatriate. However, this study looks at <b>Saudisation</b> as a tool to empower Saudi women working in the health care sector. Saudi working women have been lacking opportunities of empowerment, due to challenges they face in their daily life that hinder the development and equality of those women. The thesis has been guided by the literature and qualitative evidence that suggests obstacles to women’s empowerment and development involve socially constructed norms, traditions, religion and culture that primarily favour men. The study, also, adopts feminist geography and gender perspective and focuses on the individual voices of women working in the health care sector. This research uses different empowerment frameworks of Kabeer, Rowland, Stromquist and Freire, which are relevant to women employment and empowerment. This research utilises feminist methodology in obtaining deep understanding of the reality and experience of women employed in the health care sector. Findings of this research reveal conditions that maintain disempowerment of women working in health care sector, as well as identifying the tools that might guarantee their empowerment. Findings also show those women necessities in the case of gender needs that revolve around their domestic and working responsibilities. This thesis provides some recommendations to government, policy makers, educational institutions and employers about how to contribute in empowering women and overcoming challenges that hinder their development and wellbeing. Ultimately, this study aimed to, first, contribute to the literature of women’s empowerment by exploring their employment in a Saudi context and second, to put the spotlight on Saudi women’s issues through development lens and enrich that field of study...|$|E

While the Saudi government has made efforts to enhance the quality of vocational education, and has an ongoing policy of <b>Saudisation</b> to try to encourage employment of Saudi workers rather than expatriates, this study presents evidence that suggests a skills gap still exists. The findings highlight a perception among private sector employers that technical education fails to offer Saudi students sufficient vocational training to teach them the level of skills and attitudes to work that the employers require.

40|$|Objective: This paper {{describes}} a study undertaken {{to examine the}} visions of nurse managers and leaders for succession planning and to examine the associated policies and practices for Saudi Arabian and expatriate nurse managers in Saudi Arabian hospitals. The factors that play a direct role in preparing future nurse managers to guide nursing services {{in the future for}} that country are explored. Design: Many definitions of succession planning can be identified in both nursing and business literature and an underlying theme is that good succession planning retains the best people for an organisation. This may seem to be stating the obvious at first glance, but the complexities for the sample and the 'social world' in this setting was such that a mixed methods approach was utilised to gain an in-depth understanding. A sequential explanatory research design was used in two phases. The first phase was a survey, which explored demographics, organisational succession planning, the importance of competencies in the development of nurse managers and the use of open-ended questions to elicit qualitative information. The focus of the second phase was qualitative and explored the themes of management styles and quality, the development of managers, organisational issues and human resource issues. At the participating hospitals, 11 nurse managers/ nurse executives took part in semi-structured interviews. Setting: The study was conducted in seven Saudi Arabian hospitals with a range of approaches to succession planning. Fundamental to the study was the ethical and professional responsibility of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the Kingdom) to provide an Islamic focus in the delivery of quality healthcare and effectively continue to implement the <b>Saudisation</b> policy for nursing. Outcome: Although effective succession planning is built on the framework of solid organisational vision and policy, this was not reflected in practice in the Saudi Arabian hospitals in this study. Conclusion: Recruitment and retention of more Saudi nurses is both desirable from a population perspective and required from the government's policy perspective on <b>Saudisation</b> of the workforce. Effective succession planning for nurse managers is one factor which may modify attrition rates and enhance recruitment; however it remains a major challenge for health services...|$|E
40|$|Saudi Arabia has {{recently}} {{embarked on an}} ambitious experiment with career guidance. The country has identified that career guidance offers a range of potential cultural, educational and economic benefits. These include supporting the <b>Saudisation</b> of the workforce, {{the development of the}} vocational education system and the engagement of the Saudi ‘youth bulge’ in the labour market and wider society. However, the country has a weak tradition of career guidance and a need to develop new policies and systems rapidly. The Saudi Ministry of Labour has driven the development of the country’s new career guidance system and has sought to learn from global best practice. However, Saudi Arabia offers a very different context from those where career guidance has flourished. Particularly distinctive features of Saudi society include its limited civil society, the central role that religion plays, the place of women, the role of oil within the economy and the high level of migrant workers in the labour market. Taken together these issues offer challenges of culture, theory, policy and practice. Negotiating these challenges and building an organic body of theory and practice will be critical to the success or otherwise of the Saudi experiment with career guidance...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The Royal Monarchy in Saudi Arabia {{decreed that}} {{all sectors of}} the {{workforce}} {{would be subject to}} a policy of “Saudisation” to reduce the reliance on the expatriate workforce and to reduce the unemployment rate of Saudi nationals (Al-Mahmoud et al., 2012). Methodology. A cross-sectional design was chosen to investigate the research questions. The population of this study comprised Saudi Registered Nurses working in MOH hospitals in Riyadh which is the main health care provider in Saudi Arabia (Aboul-Enein, 2002; MOH, 2009). Results and Findings. A total number of 1, 198 questionnaires were distributed and 61. 2 % (n= 741) were returned. The findings of the study showed that the questionnaires were collected from an equal portion of the study locale and that a sample of 741 is enough to create a strong conclusion and answer the problem set in this study and all the questions in the study have been provided with answers with enough data and literatures to supports its findings. Conclusion and Recommendations. The results indicate that an increase in the recruitment of Saudi males may simply reflect cultural issues such as gender specific facilities and the <b>Saudisation</b> program’s nondiscriminatory approach to employment of both genders into nursing...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the current practice, vision and strategies in succession planning for Saudi and expatriate nurse managers in Saudi Arabian hospitals. It investigates the factors that play a direct role in preparing future nurse managers to guide nursing services {{in the future for}} that country. The study framework was optimum human resource management, {{in the context of a}} worldwide shortage of working nurses and qualified and experienced nurse managers. Nursing profession shortages are a worldwide phenomenon. In addition, front-line and middle management positions experience proportional vacancies which as a consequence, have been filled with unprepared and/or unskilled nurses. The study was set within a background policy of <b>Saudisation</b> which was introduced in 1990 and aims to prioritise Saudi citizens for employment. Employers must meet certain criteria regarding the percentage of Saudis employed. Mixed methods were utilised using sequential explanatory research design in two phases. The first phase was introduced as a survey which was distributed to 449 with return of 55 %, n = 245 to front-line and middle nursing managers working in different managerial positions at seven hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The second phase introduced semi-structured interviews of 11 nurse managers and nurse executives at the participating hospitals. The study findings reveal succession planning in Saudi Arabia requires special skills and commitment by managers. Saudi nurses as nurse managers were under-represented (4. 45 %), compared to expatriate managers in this research. Saudi nurses are both desirable from a population needs perspective and required from the government policy perspective on <b>Saudisation</b> of the workforce. Expatriate managers occupy most of the managerial positions. As a consequence, they are considered a vital part in implementing succession planning with shared participation of health organisation executives. The quantitative analysis demonstrated that there was only a slightly positive attitude to management and to the implementation of succession planning. This was, however, negated by the comments in the qualitative interviews as there was reported to be inadequate succession planning in their organisation, competencies and education. In order to deal with this dichotomy the minor themes were combined to form major themes. The key factors identified as essential components in nursing management succession planning were: management quality and style, vision and planning in manager’s qualification, education, career development and mentorship, human resource development and recruitment and retention. The unique aspects of the Saudi population demonstrate the need for early succession planning in order to direct an appropriate number of the younger generation into the health workforce and particularly into health service management. There may still be a labour shortage if the rapid growing young Saudi population are not guided, directed and developed effectively. Succession planning in nursing management is not only the responsibility of government agencies but also the policy makers, nurse executives and everyone who has authority to make a positive change in the nursing profession...|$|E
40|$|A thesis submitted…Debates on {{flexible}} employment and labour persist in most Western market economies, while being largely absent regarding Saudi Arabia. Increasing unemployment among qualified Saudi citizens remains a major concern, particularly for females, despite a government policy of <b>Saudisation.</b> Notwithstanding incentives for prioritising Saudi citizens, foreign nationals dominate private sector employment. Few empirical studies consider the factors impacting employment of educated Saudi women: further, there are hardly any robust frameworks which offer policy makers, employers, and those championing {{the employment of}} this group a clear set of plausible guidelines bearing in mind the socioeconomic context of Saudi Arabia. The research aims, first and foremost, to examine how far "labour flexibility" in Saudi Arabia offers solutions to unemployment among educated Saudi females, exploring interalia the main institutions and regulatory framework of the Saudi labour market, {{and the effectiveness of}} these in managing the relationship between employers and employees. It also examines the major labour market and employment policy concerns of government, employers and employees, considering {{flexible employment}} forms in Saudi Arabia, and in what context employers and employees do or would consider flexible employment. Following on from this, the second aim is to develop a conceptual framework on key factors impacting the participation of educated Saudi females in the Saudi labour market. The framework that emerges from these analyses also provides some guidance for graduate women who seek labour market entry and participation. iii The study employed quantitative and qualitative methodologies, with targeted participants, returning 1347 usable questionnaires (41...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the high}} youth {{population}} and {{unemployment rate in}} the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the government implemented policies to ensure that school leavers and graduates have the competencies necessary to replace the large expatriate workforce in the country. However, this policy has yet to create an impact on smaller firms, which are generally family-owned and lack the knowledge and resources for employee’s needs. As in most emerging economies, small to medium enterprises (SMEs) form {{the bulk of the}} private sector in KSA, and the skilled workforce and quality management continues to constrain Saudi’s capacity to generate growth and jobs. In addition, Saudi’s private sector training has been characterised as inadequate, erratic, and expensive. This nexus between management apathy and ineffective training has led to the devaluation of training, further exacerbating the skills shortage in the country’s workforce. There is growing research interest in the twin policies of <b>Saudisation</b> and Nitaqat to replace high levels of foreign labour with qualified Saudis, especially in regards to improving the unskilled labour force for the SME. Whilst research concerning effective training of firms’ employees is available, there are no studies documenting Saudi SME employers’ involvement in training decisions. This research seeks to understand the factors that senior executives and owners consider in training and investigates the relationships between nature of training, management involvement, management motivation, training outcome, and firm performance in the Saudi context. This leads to the gap in the research considering how SME employers can influence their employees receiving effective training that would lead to improved firm performance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Saudi Arabia {{has always}} been {{dependent}} on non-Saudi nurses. However, the recruitment of these nurses has been challenged by {{the consequences of the}} first Gulf War of 1991 and the political unrest in the Middle East ever since. Moreover, the annual supply of Saudi nursing graduates has been insufficient in meeting the demands of the expanding healthcare services. Indeed, Saudi nurses make less than 30 % of the total nursing workforce Kingdom wide. The Saudi literature links the shortage in Saudi nurses to socio-cultural factors found to influence the prevailing negative images and perceived low status of nursing. Hence, I have developed a personal interest to explore the impact of prevalent images and perceived status of nursing on the Saudi nurses’ perceptions of nursing as an occupational choice. The reviewed literature guided the development of a framework for my study using six concepts. Aim: To gain an understanding of the social, cultural, economic and political influences on Saudi nurses’ perceptions of nursing and their impact on recruitment of nursing students and retention of graduates. Method: Sixty eight semi-structured interviews were conducted in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia with a sample of student nurses (n = 38), staff nurses (n = 21) and senior nurses (n = 9) from government and private sectors. A purposive sampling approach increased the likelihood that the variability within nursing was represented in the data. A focus on the inclusion of Saudi male nurses is unusual; it allowed this study to explore gender issues in more depth. The interview guides covered selected concepts derived from the literature. These include: nursing images; status of nursing; perceptions of nursing as an occupational choice; nursing education; gendered-nature of nursing and nursing support systems. Interviews were conducted and transcribed in Arabic and participants were interviewed once. A socio-demographic checklist was filled {{at the end of each}} interview. Findings: Findings were presented using three explanatory themes. First, perceptions of nursing suggesting that, against a background of negative gender-related perceptions of nursing, there is an increasing recognition of nursing as a secure occupational choice in a shifting labour market. Second, challenges facing professionalism suggesting that participants acknowledged the importance of achieving a recognised professional status for nursing. Third, dealing with personal struggle suggesting that participants have been experiencing a personal struggle as they were learning to cope with the prevalent negative perceptions of nursing at social and professional levels. Conclusions: Findings from the study provide evidence of a personal struggle female and male participants have been experiencing in their attempts to transcend through shifting gender, social, cultural, economic and global boundaries. A struggle they had to deal with in order to achieve social and professional recognition. Overlooking causes of struggle might risk Saudi nurses’ recruitment into and retention within nursing. A new model for the <b>Saudisation</b> of nursing workforce has been proposed. Policy makers are requested to divert their strategies from focusing only on graduates from the nursing programmes to targeting Saudi school children. They are expected to design and implement <b>Saudisation</b> strategies that aim at changing the prevailing gender-related perceptions of nursing as an occupation among prospect candidates; and building on the nurses’ efforts to achieve professional recognition and integrate success in their career with their personal life...|$|E
40|$|From the {{oil boom}} in the 1970 s up to present, Saudi Arabia, a leading oil {{producing}} country in the Middle East, has been encountering a serious shortage of skilled and qualified Saudi labour force, especially the private sector. Both the <b>Saudisation</b> policy and the current Ninth Five-Year Development Plan have addressed an urgent need to provide Saudi nationals with as many employment opportunities as possible to replace expatriate workers. To achieve this goal, the Saudi government has made great efforts to {{enhance the quality of}} education, as the key to a nation's future economic prosperity depends on the quality of its education and training. However, the current industrial education is still seriously blamed by private sector employers for failing to offer Saudi students of industrial education sufficient vocational skills training courses to obtain the kind of skills, knowledge, attitudes towards work at their request. In light of this serious vocational education issue, the purpose of this research was to investigate this skills gap between industrial education output and Saudi labour requirements in private manufacturing industries (excluding oil refining and petrochemicals), a sector that has been a major contributor to GDP growth since the late 1990 s. A survey method was adopted to conduct this research by applying two research instruments: a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The aim of this survey research is to explore the perceptions of the manufacturing skills training offered in Saudi industrial education from the perspectives of three groups of stakeholders: managers in private manufacturing industries, trainers of industrial education and trainees of industrial education. The survey results revealed that a skills gap exists between the labour demand for qualified Saudi manpower and the current industrial education output and that there were social, cultural and economic factors leading to such a gap. This gap is the result of three factors-work ethics, specialised knowledge and generic skills, which {{play a key role in}} private manufacturing employers’ decisions to employ Saudi workers. In order to solve this educational problem, based on the comments by the three groups of stakeholders, this research suggests a model, namely, knowledge-based industrial education, to modify the current industrial education curriculum in order that the output of Saudi industrial education may be improved to fill this skills gap in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the issues faced by Saudi nurses in Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, only 20 per cent of nurses are Saudi citizens. Nursing is able to attract but not retain nurses and the level of {{education}} is not meeting world standards. The impact on the population is that foreigners who do not understand the Saudi culture are providing care, which, although technically adequate, is not able to meet all needs. Adding to the problem is the fact that nurses have little control over their practice or education and are currently powerless to make changes. Until now, there has been minimal research exploring the experience of being a Saudi nurse. To address this gap, this research has begun to uncover the experiences of Saudi Nurses and explore their needs, based on their perceptions of themselves and their understanding of their development and practice as professional nurses. Using a Husserlian philosophy and following the framework of van Manen (1990), a hermeneutic phenomenological approach was applied. A semi-structured interview was used to collect data from 17 Saudi nurses who each had at least five years’ nursing experience. These nurses were from the Eastern, Northern, Central and Western regions and included five male and 12 female nurses. The participants’ experiences highlighted that Saudi nurses have many significant problems. Two major classifications emerged from the participant’s perceptions: sociocultural factors and organisational paradoxes. Sociocultural factors relate to external pressures that Saudi nurses face, while organisational paradoxes relate to problems regarding the internal structure of nursing organisations. The participants’ perceptions of themselves as nurses included not only views about education, nursing practice and the management of nursing organisations, but also involved their views on the behaviour of society towards the nursing profession. Findings from this research reveal a sociocultural paradigm that still culturally segregates being a nurse from being a Muslim. In general, social support and organisational commitment is lacking in nursing. The commitment of nursing organisations towards nursing education, practice and management is perceived by the nurses interviewed as not reflecting the cultural values and principles of Islam, because the intentional aspect of Islamic law is ignored. This affects the working conditions of nurses and the status of being a nurse. As a result, Saudi nurses, instead of experiencing nursing as a rewarding career characterised by the caring ideals of Islam, are unsatisfied in their profession. The perceived needs of Saudi nurses are extensive and their lived experiences reveal disempowerment and neglect. The result is that Saudi nurses are leaving their profession at a time when <b>Saudisation</b> is pushing for a greater percentage of Saudi citizens in nursing. The findings of this study, and an examination of related research, point to strategies and recommendations to facilitate the development of nursing practice, management and education in Saudi Arabia, so that the perceived critical condition of Saudi nursing can be turned around...|$|E
40|$|Saudi Arabia has {{undergone}} rapid {{social and economic}} change in recent years. As {{one of the largest}} employers in the country, these changes have {{had a significant impact on}} the healthcare sector, in particular on the nursing workforce. In the past, Saudi Arabia relied almost exclusively upon expatriate nurses to meet the healthcare needs of its growing population. However, an increase in the Saudi population, high levels of Saudi unemployment, and a desire to redress the country’s reliance on an expatriate workforce, led the Saudi government to implement a <b>Saudisation</b> program, an initiative to recruit, train and employ Saudi nationals throughout the workforce. As a result, approximately 50 % of nurses are now of Saudi nationality. This research is a mixed methods study. A quantitative study was undertaken to gain a description of the Saudi nursing workforce in Riyadh city; in particular their motivations, views of the profession and future plans. The initial aim of the quantitative study was to ascertain why high numbers of Saudi males were entering the nursing workforce in Saudi Arabia; however, female nurses were also surveyed in order to understand if there was a relationship between gender and motivations to undertake nursing, views of the profession and future plans. In this component of the study, a self-administered survey was distributed to all Saudi nurses working as registered nurses in Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals in Riyadh. The results indicated that the Saudi Arabia nurses surveyed were young and inexperienced with a mean age of 27 years and with 80 % having less than five years’ experience in the nursing field. Other important issues emerged in this study, such as the nurses’ desire for educational and professional development; poor working conditions in the sector; the low social status of the profession; difficulties associated with working in a mixed-gender environment; and cultural and communication problems. Significantly, just below half of all respondents intended leaving the profession. These results informed the second, qualitative component of this study which sought to explore in more depth, some of the findings which emerged from the initial component of the study. The second study aimed to explore the lived experience of newly gradated Saudi Nurses. Twelve newly graduate nurses who had been working in Ministry of Health Hospitals in Riyadh five years or less were interviewed. In-depth interviews in the Arabic language were performed with the nurses, who had been working in the profession for five years or less. Themes were identified from the data using van Manen’s hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Six major themes emerged from analysis of the data. Firstly, nurses felt unprepared for nursing. They felt they lacked the educational and training support they required, had little knowledge of the profession before joining, and had rarely chosen the profession themselves. Secondly, nurses in the study felt they were not readily included in nursing teams and were marginalised and discriminated against by management and expatriate nurses. In addition, Saudi nurses suffered from the poor social status associated with the profession and were subject to criticism and poor treatment by family, other health professionals and society at large. Despite this, nurses in general had a positive attitude to their profession. Saudi nurses indicated that they believed Saudi nurses were vital to the profession; both male and female nurses considered male nurses of central importance to the profession to ensure that the cultural and religious needs of Saudi patients were met. Finally, Saudi nurses showed an awareness of social changes occurring in nursing and in society in general and expressed a desire to be part of this change. This study offers important insights into a segment of the Saudi nursing workforce, which has not been the subject of intensive study. This new, emerging nursing workforce is making a mark on the Saudi healthcare sector. In order to prevent attrition in the nursing field, Saudi nurses need to be provided with appropriate education, training, respect and working conditions. This study offers important recommendations and insights for the future of Saudi nursing. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Nursing, 201...|$|E
