50|$|Many soles are {{important}} food species: the common sole, <b>Solea</b> <b>solea,</b> is popular in northern Europe and the Mediterranean.|$|R
5000|$|The true soles, Soleidae, {{including}} {{the common or}} Dover sole, <b>Solea</b> <b>solea.</b> These are the only fishes called soles in Europe.|$|R

50|$|Other {{anatomical}} {{differences between}} the species are {{the position of the}} migratory eye, the shape of the urohyal and the number of vertebrae; Dicologlossa cuneata has 43-45 vertebrae, compared to 49-52 for <b>Solea</b> <b>solea.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the surface {{architecture of the}} asymmetrical buccal cavity of <b>Solea</b> <b>solea</b> which are {{considered one of the}} most important predators in benthic communities. Methods: Adult <b>Solea</b> <b>solea</b> were obtained from Mediterranean Sea near Damietta. The heads were removed and processed for scanning electron microscopy. Its buccal cavity is asymmetrical and divided into roof and floor and the tongue for histological studies. Results: The buccal cavity roof is formed from upper jaw, velum and the palate. The upper jaw has several wing like processes with teeth arranged in several rows which may help in cutting and pushing the food to the entrance of the digestive canal while the floor is formed from the lower jaw and the tongue. The tongue is divided into apex, body and root. There is a gradual decrease of goblet cells in the tongue from anterior to posterior. These goblet cells function in protection of the epithelium. Conclusions: Teeth in the floor of the buccal cavity and taste buds can be considered adaptive changes of the oral cavity related to the feeding habits and was a source to identify new and better methods of nutrition in aquaculture of <b>Solea</b> <b>solea...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} <b>Solea</b> aegyptiaca was {{considered}} a junior synonym of <b>Solea</b> vulgaris, itself a junior synonym of <b>Solea</b> <b>solea,</b> the common sole. However recent molecular {{studies have demonstrated that}} it is a separate species with molecular and diagnostic, if overlapping, morphological differences between the species.|$|R
50|$|The true sole, <b>Solea</b> <b>solea,</b> is {{sufficiently}} broadly distributed {{that it is}} not considered a threatened species; however, overfishing in Europe has produced severely diminished populations, with declining catches in many regions. For example, the western English Channel and Irish Sea sole fisheries face potential collapse according to data in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.|$|R
50|$|Entobdella <b>soleae</b> is a monogenean (Platyhelminth) skin {{parasite}} of {{the common}} sole, <b>Solea</b> <b>solea,</b> an important food fish. Typically 2-6 parasites are found on wild sole, but in intensive fish farms this can rise to 200-300 parasites per fish, causing skin inflammation and sometimes death of the sole. E. <b>soleae</b> can live up to c.120 days in seawater.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} my PhD course regards {{two aspects of}} fish {{products}} quality and characterization. The first one deals with {{the evaluation of the}} effects of natural antioxidants (ellagic acid and L-ascorbic acid) in enhancing fresh sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> shelf life. Quality assurance in the fish sector involves monitoring and documenting defined quality criteria as required by regulations (European Community, 1996), product specifications and consumer demands. Fresh fish products are commonly sold at storage temperature. However, many undesirable changes can occur in the products during storage, due to microbial growth and fish spoilage, affording evident economic loss. From this point of view it is important to develop systems which help to prolong fish shelf life. In this perspective, we have studied the effects of ellagic acid (EA) and L-ascorbic acid (LAA) / sodium ascorbate (SA), either alone or in combination, on the microbiological quality of fresh finfish <b>Solea</b> <b>solea</b> during storage at 0 °C.

40|$|Organic and {{inorganic}} pollution can impact organisms {{directly and}} affect condition, {{growth and survival}} of juvenile fish which use estuaries as nurseries, and thereby affect marine adult populations quantitatively and qualitatively. Trace element contamination (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) in juveniles of commercial fish <b>Solea</b> <b>solea,</b> <b>Solea</b> senegalensis, Platichthys flesus, Diplodus vulgaris and Dicentrarchus labrax collected in putative nurseries of the main Portuguese estuaries (with diverse intensities and sources of anthropogenic pressures) was determined via atomic absorption spectrometry. Contamination was significantly different among species. Similar levels of contamination were found among estuaries, except for D. vulgaris. Cu and Zn concentrations ranged from 1. 0 to 2. 1 and 14 to 59 μg g- 1 muscle dry weight respectively; while Cd and Pb concentrations were very low. The results indicate that juvenile migration to off-shore habitats is associated with low export of contamination, and no particular estuary increases the potential contamination of adult stocks. This knowledge is {{of the utmost importance}} in view of the ecological and economical value of these species and their use of estuarine areas as nurseries...|$|R

40|$|Overlapping {{external}} morphometric characters easily confound the flatfishes <b>Solea</b> aegyptiaca and <b>Solea</b> <b>solea</b> (Soleidae) {{in areas}} of the Mediterranean Sea where both species live in sympatry. This leads to uncertainties in the fisheries and marketing of the species, in addition to misinterpretations in biogeography and conservation studies. This paper describes a simple restriction fragment length-based diagnostic test that differentiates S. <b>solea</b> from S. aegyptiaca, as well as from other species of the Soleidae family. Furthermore, the two species living in sympatry in the Gulf of Kavala (North Aegean Sea, Greece) present significant qualitative differences in muscle fatty acid composition, a property that {{can also be used to}} distinguish the two cryptic species...|$|R
40|$|Dover sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> is an obligate ectotherm with {{a natural}} thermal habitat ranging from {{approximately}} 5 to 27 °C. Thermal optima for growth lie {{in the range of}} 20 to 25 °C. More precise information on thermal optima for growth is needed for cost-effective Dover sole aquaculture. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the optimal growth temperature of juvenile Dover sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> and in addition to test the hypothesis that the final preferendum equals the optimal growth temperature. Temperature preference was measured in a circular preference chamber for Dover sole acclimated to 18, 22 and 28 °C. Optimal growth temperature was measured by rearing Dover sole at 19, 22, 25 and 28 °C. The optimal growth temperature resulting from this growth experiment was 22. 7 °C for Dover sole with a size between 30 to 50 g. The temperature preferred by juvenile Dover sole increases with acclimation temperature and exceeds the optimal temperature for growth. A final preferendum could not be detected. Although a confounding effect of behavioural fever on temperature preference could not be entirely excluded, thermal preference and thermal optima for physiological processes seem to be unrelated in Dover sol...|$|R
50|$|Hediste diversicolor is {{widespread}} and common and is eaten by {{many species of}} birds and fish. It is the main food item for the pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), the grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola), the curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea), the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica) and the curlew (Numenius arquata). Several flatfish which live on intertidal mudflats feed on the ragworm. These include the common dab (Limanda limanda), the common sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea),</b> the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) and the European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa).|$|R
50|$|Sole is a fish {{belonging}} to several families. Generally speaking, they {{are members of}} the family Soleidae, but, outside Europe, the name sole is also applied to various other similar flatfish, especially other members of the sole suborder Soleoidei as well as members of the flounder family.

40|$|Several {{commercial}} marine {{fish stocks}} {{show signs of}} collapse due to the synergy between climate change and adverse human impacts, such as habitat degradation and overfishing. Besides the reduction in abundance of the exploited species, intense fishing activities have an array of additional ecological impacts. Fisheries may cause irreversible evolutionary changes in life history traits and the genetic structure of populations. One of the species for which such phenotypic-genetic changes are likely to occur is common sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea).</b> This project aims at studying the connectivity and demographic stability of sole populations in the North Sea and adjacent waters before and after heavy (beam trawl) fishing. First, we will characterize the spatial and temporal connectivity of the different life stages of <b>Solea</b> <b>solea.</b> Are the spawning populations of <b>Solea</b> <b>solea</b> separated {{in time and space}} or are they well mixed? Do adult fish spawn near the nursery ground where they grew up? Do they return to the same spawning ground year after year? Through the combined analysis of otolith microchemistry and neutral genetic markers, we will answer these questions and investigate the extent to which spawning grounds, nursery areas and feeding grounds are linked. The level of gene flow between different populations will be estimated and adult fish from the feeding grounds will be assigned to their nursery origin. As such, we will evaluate the relative importance of different North Sea nurseries to adult populations. Secondly, we will analyze the long-term demographic stability of the sole population in the North Sea. Using DNA extracted from historical otolith collections (1960 ’s- 1990 ’s), we will investigate possible fluctuations in genetic variability through time, in relation to fishery pressure and methods. The evolution of the effective number of breeding fish will be followed through time, providing a good indicator for the ‘genetic health status’ of the North Sea stock(s). Results will improve our understanding of the population genetic structure and the connectivity of spawning grounds, nurseries and feeding grounds of common sole. This knowledge is relevant for fisheries management, in order to identify appropriate management units and to evaluate the benefits of marine protected areas...|$|R

40|$|Fish {{authentication}} is a {{major concern}} not only for the prevention of commercial fraud, but also for the assessment of safety risks deriving from the undeclared introduction of potentially dangerous toxic or allergenic substances or environmentally damaging fish where endangered species are involved. Moreover, food authentication might affect the diet of certain groups of consumers, such as followers of religious practices. Considering the authentication of fish products {{is one of the key}} issues in food safety, quality and sustainability, the aim of this work was to investigate the prevalence of mislabelling in sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea),</b> plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and hake (Merluccius merluccius) fillets from markets and supermarkets located in Apulia (Southern Italy) using DNA barcoding. The results of the molecular investigations reveal that 42 / 98 (42. 8 %) fillet samples were not correctly labelled. In particular, 12 / 27 (44. 4 %) fillets of sole (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> were identified as belonging to <b>Solea</b> senegalensis. In addition, 13 / 28 (46. 4 %) plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) samples were identified as Pangasius hypophtalmus. All Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) samples were correctly labelled. Post-sequencing data analysis revealed that 17 / 30 (56. 6 %) hake fillets (Merluccius merluccius) were not correctly labelled, of which 8 / 30 samples identified as Merluccius hubbsi, 5 / 30 samples as Merluccius products and 4 / 30 as Merluccius capensis.

40|$|Statistical {{models are}} key for {{estimating}} fish distributions based on environmental variables, and validation is generally advocated as indispensable but seldom applied. Generalized Linear Models {{were applied to}} distributions of juvenile <b>Solea</b> <b>solea,</b> <b>Solea</b> senegalensis, Platichthys flesus and Dicentrarchus labrax in response to environmental variables throughout Portuguese estuaries. Species-specific Delta models with two sub-models were used: Binomial (presence/absence); Gamma (density when present). Models were fitted and tested on separate data sets to estimate the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Temperature, salinity and mud content in sediment were included in most models for presence/absence; salinity and depth in most models for density (when present). In Binomial models (presence/absence), goodness-of-fit, accuracy and robustness varied concurrently among species, and fair to high accuracy and robustness were attained for all species, in models with poor to high goodness-of-fit. But in Gamma models (density when present), goodness-of-fit was not indicative of accuracy and robustness. Only for Platichthys flesus were Gamma and also coupled Delta models (density) accurate and robust, despite some moderate bias and inconsistency in predicted density. The accuracy and robustness of final density estimations were defined by the accuracy and robustness of the estimations of presence/absence and density (when present) provided by the sub-models. The mismatches between goodness-of-fit, accuracy and robustness of positive density models, {{as well as the}} difference in performance of presence/absence and density models demonstrated the importance of validation procedures in the evaluation of the value of habitat suitability models as predictive tools.
