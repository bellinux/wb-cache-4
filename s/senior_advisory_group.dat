The Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) has the responsibility in Tennessee to provide the technological vision and leadership required for long-term growth and prosperity for the state in the global marketplace. Through the sponsorship of new and innovative programs in assisting existing industry, fostering endeavors in research and development, and aggressive pursuit of federally-sponsored development programs, ECD seeks to advance the State`s competitive position, enhance the State`s ability to foster new business growth and meet the economic and security needs of the State`s citizens.

5000|$|While {{efforts to}} ensure the {{short-term}} stabilisation of conflicts through humanitarian operations and peacekeeping are often successful, the long-term establishment of sustainable peace remains a challenge. The <b>Senior</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> explains that “as communities emerge from conflict, they often face a critical shortage of capacities needed to secure a sustainable peace — the core capacities to run a government, to re-establish institutions of justice, to reintegrate demobilizing fighters, to revitalize the economy, to restore basic health and education, and many more.” Despite {{the best efforts of}} international actors, attempts to build a lasting peace are challenged by the lack of knowledge and skills on critical areas of peacebuilding in the societies affected by violence. In this regard, the <b>Senior</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> explains that “the international community has had less success in supporting and enabling the national capacities that are essential or an enduring peace.” It further contends that the United Nations’ inability to “transfer skills and knowledge to national actors…has increased the risk of relapse into conflict.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} characteristics of non-mandated standing <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in all 501 school districts in Pennsylvania from the perspective of each group‘s administrator or leader. For the {{purpose of this}} study, <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in school districts mandated by federal and state laws were excluded. ^ Given this large participant population, online research instruments were used. A survey was initially emailed to all school districts superintendents. A follow up questionnaire was then sent to the contact person for the <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> if the superintendent indicated utilization. An interview was then conducted with the <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> contact persons for each school district. ^ The results of this study were organized into three main categories: reasons for creating <b>advisory</b> <b>groups,</b> outcomes of the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups,</b> and best practices of <b>advisory</b> <b>groups.</b> The data in each category were coded and three themes emerged in each category. The themes for <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> include creation for a specific goal, creation for a specific problem, or creation for a means of communication. The themes for outcomes of the <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> were attainment of a goal, resolution of a problem, and dissemination of information about the district into the community. Finally, the themes for best practices of <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> included selecting suitable <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> members, setting guidelines for meetings, and promoting attendance at meetings. Participants offered advice to school districts contemplating starting an <b>advisory</b> <b>group,</b> as well as tips for success. Some of these tips were scheduling meetings at times convenient for most participants, opening the group to diverse members including those who have opposition to an issue, and establishing rules and procedures for how the group operates. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} {{perceptions of}} family health service authorities and medical audit <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> of <b>advisory</b> groups' involvement in clinical audit and wider quality issues; {{communication with the}} authorities; and manager satisfaction. DESIGN [...] National postal questionnaire survey in 1994. SETTING [...] All family health services authority districts in England and Wales. SUBJECTS [...] Chief executives or other responsible authority officers and <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> chairpersons in each district. MAIN MEASURES [...] Priorities of <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> and authority for audit; involvement of <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> in wider quality issues; communication of information to, and contacts with, the authority and its involvement in planning the future work of the advisory group; and authorities' satisfaction. RESULTS [...] Both groups' views about audit were similar and broadly consistent with current policy. <b>Advisory</b> <b>group</b> involvement in wider quality issues was extensive, {{and the majority of}} both groups thought this appropriate. Much of the information about their activities collected by <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> was not passed on to the authority. The most frequent contact between the two <b>groups</b> was the <b>advisory</b> <b>group's</b> annual report, but formal personal contact was the most valued. Most authority respondents thought their views had been recognised in the <b>advisory</b> <b>group's</b> planning of future work; only a small minority were not satisfied with their <b>advisory</b> <b>groups.</b> Dissatisfied respondents received less information from their <b>advisory</b> <b>groups,</b> had less contact with them, and thought they had less input into their plans. There was some evidence that <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> in the "dissatisfied districts" were less involved in clinical audit and with their authorities in wider quality issues. CONCLUSIONS [...] Most <b>advisory</b> <b>groups</b> are developing their activities in clinical audit and have expanded their scope of work. The quality and availability of information about progress with audit is a cause for concern to both groups...|$|R
