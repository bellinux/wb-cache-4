40|$|The S 66 {{benchmark}} for noncovalent interactions has been re-evaluated using explicitly correlated methods with basis sets near the one-particle basis set limit. It is found that post-MP 2 "high-level corrections" are treated adequately well {{using a combination}} of CCSD(F 12 *) with (aug-) cc-pVTZ-F 12 basis sets on the one hand, and (T) extrapolated from conventional CCSD(T) /heavy-aug-cc-pV{D,T}Z on the other hand. Implications for earlier benchmarks on the larger S 66 x 8 problem set in particular, and for accurate calculations on noncovalent interactions in general, are discussed. At a slight cost in accuracy, (T) can be considerably accelerated by using sano-V{D,T}Z+ basis sets, while half-counterpoise CCSD(F 12 *) (T) /cc-pVDZ-F 12 offers the best compromise between accuracy and computational cost.

50|$|G. U. Pope, {{upon hearing}} of these plans, offered {{to give his}} {{collection}} of material for an exhaustive lexicon of the Tamil language.

The Government of Madras and the University of Madras reacted positively to Pope's suggestion. However, before any concrete decision could be taken, Pope died in 1907. In 1909, his son came to Madras with his father's papers and gifted them to the Oriental Manuscripts Library, permitting the use of the material for any new Tamil dictionary. In 1910, J. <b>S.</b> <b>Chandler</b> of the American Mission, then residing in Kodaikanal, forwarded a proposal to the Madras government on the new Tamil dictionary project.|$|R
