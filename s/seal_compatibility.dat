50|$|MIL-PRF-2105E this {{specification}} {{released in}} 1995 combines the performance requirements of its predecessor (MIL-L-2105D) and API MT-1. MIL-PRF-2105E maintains all existing chemical/physical requirements, stationary axle test requirements, field test requirements and data {{review by the}} Lubricants Review Institute that were required under MIL-L-2105D. It also adds the stringent oil <b>seal</b> <b>compatibility</b> and thermal durability test requirements under API MT-1. MIL-PRF-2105E has been re-written as SAE Standard J2360.SAE J2360 standard is a new global quality standard that defines a level of performance equivalent to that defined by MIL-PRF-2105E, a U.S. military standard for approval that was not available to oil blenders {{in all parts of}} the world. It includes all of the most recent axle and transmission testing requirements identified in API GL-5, API MT-1, and MIL-PRF-2105E including the need to demonstrate proof-of-performance through rigorous field testing.|$|E
40|$|Engine oil <b>seal</b> <b>compatibility</b> tests {{according}} to VW PV 3344 standard were carried out. The visualevaluation of test-method was developed. Seven photographs were taken of crackedfluoroelastomer test-pieces and {{digital image processing}} was applied. The so called Area CoveringRatio (ACR) was calculated and its statistical properties were investigated. Based upon the resultsfour statistically different new categories of cracked test-pieces could be established by using theACR. This new evaluation method {{was found to be}} simple, quick, reliable and cheap, which resultedin better ability for differentiation among similar engine oils and additives in seal compatibilitytests. It was demonstrated by Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) that pre-ageingcaused little cracks on the surfaces of fluoroelastomer. The basic dispersants catalyzed fluorineelimination was proved by the decreasing fluorine contents, which showed good correlation to therate of the attack, i. e. to the ACR value of test-pieces...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{low-cost}} wafer level packaging technology for surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter devices which provides quasi-hermetic device <b>sealing</b> and full <b>compatibility</b> to surface mount assembly technology. The wafer level packaging concept is based on sealing each sensitive SAW structure with a LiTaO 3 cap while keeping the peripheral IO pads of the devices accessible. To enable such a process scheme LiTaO 3 posts with adhesive bonding frames were pre-processed from LiTaO 3 wafers and subsequently bonded to the SAW device wafers using thermo-compression type wafer-to-wafer bonding processes. Subsequently, the wafers with the pre-processed post structures were back-ground to separate the bonded cap structures on the device wafers. A subsequent balling of the peripheral pads with pre-formed SAC 305 solder balls finalized the wafer level processing. The process was developed using 403 MHz SAW devices for MICS (Medical Implant Communication Service) band application. Process flow for fabrication and assembly of the SAW filter CSPs with final dimensions of 1. 7 × 1. 5 × 0. 45 mm 3 {{as well as the}} measured electrical performance will be discussed in the paper. Additionally, options for process modifications regarding size and cost reduction will be presented...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} serious instability problems in hydratable shale formations, a novel electropositive wellbore stabilizer (EPWS) was prepared {{by a new}} approach. It has good colloidal stability, particle size distribution, <b>compatibility,</b> <b>sealing</b> property, and flexible adaptability. A variety of methods including measurements of particle size, Zeta potential, colloidal stability, contact angle, shale stability index, shale dispersion, shale swelling, and plugging experiments were adopted to characterize the EPWS and evaluate its anti-sloughing capacity and flexible adaptability. Results show that the EPWS has advantages over the conventional wellbore stabilizer (ZX- 3) in particle size distribution, colloidal stability, inhibition, compatibility, and flexible adaptability. The EPWS with an average particle size of 507  nm and an average Zeta potential of 54  mV could be stable for 147  days and be compatible with salt tolerant or positive charged additives, and it also exhibited preferable anti-sloughing performance to hydratable shales at 77, 100, and 120  °C, and better compatibility with sodium bentonite than ZX- 3 and KCl. The EPWS can plug micro-fractures and pores by forming a tight external mud cake and an internal sealing belt to retard pressure transmission and prevent filtrate invasion, enhancing hydrophobicity of shale surfaces by adsorption to inhibit hydration. The EPWS with flexible adaptability to temperature for inhibition and sealing capacity is available for long open-hole sections during drilling.|$|R
40|$|SpinTek Membrane Systems, Inc., the {{developer}} of a centrifugal membrane filtration technology, has engineered {{and developed a}} system for use within the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Management (EM) Program. The technology uses supported microporous membranes rotating at high rpm, under pressure, to separate suspended and colloidal solids from liquid streams, yielding a solids-free permeate stream and a highly concentrated solids stream. This is a crosscutting technology that falls under the Efficient Separations and Processing Crosscutting Program, with potential application to tank wastes, contaminated groundwater, landfill leachate, and secondary liquid waste streams from other remediation processes, including decontamination and decommissioning systems. SpinTek II High Shear Rotary Membrane Filtration System is a unique compact crossflow membrane system that has large, demonstrable advantages in performance and cost compared to currently available systems: (1) High fluid shear prevents membrane fouling even with very high solids content; hazardous and radioactive components can be concentrated to the consistency of a pasty slurry without fouling. (2) Induced turbulence and shear across the membrane increases membrane flux {{by a factor of}} ten over existing systems and allows operation on fluids not otherwise treatable. (3) Innovative ceramic membrane and mechanical <b>sealing</b> technology eliminates <b>compatibility</b> problems with aggressive DOE waste streams. (4) System design allows rapid, simple disassembly for inspection or complete decontamination. (5) Produces colloidal- and suspended-solids-free filtrate without the addition of chemicals. The first phase of this project (PRDA maturity stage 5) completed the physical scale-up of the SpinTek unit and verified successful scale-up with surrogate materials. Given successful scale-up and DOE concurrence, the second phase of this project (PRDA maturity stage 6) will provide for the installation and operation of the full-scale two-stage SpinTek unit for treatment of a DOE waste-stream at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. This technology has very broad application across the DOE system. Nineteen DOE technical needs areas (Appendix C) have been identified. Following successful full-scale demonstration for treatment of DOE wastes, this innovative technology will be rapidly deployed {{on a wide range of}} waste and process streams throughout the DOE system...|$|R
30|$|The {{preservation}} of the wellbore stability has fundamental importance during oil and gas well drilling. About 75  % of the side walls {{of oil and gas}} wellbores consist of shale and mud rocks, which are responsible for 90  % of the wellbore instability problems (Corrêa and Nascimento 2005; Jiang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Huang et al. 2007). Several types of shales with a significant amount of clay minerals are very reactive once they come into contact with water, and they can cause serious wellbore instability during drilling, like hole shrinkage and hole sloughing and caving (Hisham 2006; Wang et al. 2012 a, b; Zhang et al. 2013 a, b). Wellbore stability has been studied for a long time using mainly two quite different approaches. Some authors consider the problem exclusively {{from the point of view}} of rock mechanics and others from the point of view of chemical interactions between shales and fluids (Wu et al. 1993; Corrêa and Nascimento 2005). Based on the second approach, a variety of water-based drilling fluids and non-aqueous fluids have been applied; meanwhile, many types of wellbore stabilizers have been developed. These wellbore stabilizers have been classified into several groups, including inorganic salts, formate, polymers with special shale affinity, asphalts, sugars and sugar derivatives, glycerol, polyalcohol, and silicates (Van Oort 2003; Guo et al. 2006; Khodja et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2011; Zhong et al. 2011). Among of them, asphalts as one type of cheap and effective stabilizer can improve wellbore stabilization mainly through plugging or sealing, and they have been divided into four varieties according to modification methods: natural asphalt (no modification, mined from deposit), oxidized asphalt (oxidation by air blown to heighten softening point), sulfonated bitumen (changed into asphalt sulfonate partly to enhance water solubility), and emulsified asphalt (oil in water emulsion to improve dispersion in the drilling fluid and adsorption on the rock surface) (Sharma and Wunderlich 1987; Wang et al. 2005). All types of emulsified asphalts are mostly produced by shearing and thinning a mixture of asphalt, water, and emulsifier using an emulsion machine or a colloid mill. Ionic surfactants are often used as emulsifier, so the emulsified asphalt droplets are mostly charged and possess an electric double layer structure, according to the Stern model (Xie et al. 2005; Fan et al. 2014). Cationic emulsified asphalts have taken the place of anionic ones in drilling fluids to promote inhibition and adsorption (Shi et al. 2003; Wang and Xia 2006). In this paper, a novel cationic emulsified asphalt was investigated to overcome serious instability problems during drilling hydratable shale formations. It had good colloidal stability, particle size distribution, <b>compatibility,</b> <b>sealing</b> property, and flexible adaptability.|$|R
40|$|In 2008 Oak Ridge National Laboratory began {{a series}} of {{experiments}} to evaluate the compatibility of fueling infrastructure materials with intermediate levels of ethanol-blended gasoline. Initially, the focus was elastomers, metals, and sealants, and the test fuels were Fuel C, CE 10 a, CE 17 a and CE 25 a. The results of these studies were published in 2010. Follow-on studies were performed with an emphasis on plastic (thermoplastic and thermoset) materials used in underground storage and dispenser systems. These materials were exposed to test fuels of Fuel C and CE 25 a. Upon completion of this effort, it was felt that additional compatibility data with higher ethanol blends was needed and another round of experimentation was performed on elastomers, metals, and plastics with CE 50 a and CE 85 a test fuels. Compatibility of polymers typically relates to the solubility of the solid polymer with a solvent. It can also mean susceptibility to chemical attack, but the polymers and test fuels evaluated in this study are not considered to be chemically reactive with each other. Solubility in polymers is typically assessed by measuring the volume swell of the polymer exposed to the solvent of interest. Elastomers are a class of polymers that are predominantly used as seals, and most o-ring and <b>seal</b> manufacturers provide <b>compatibility</b> tables of their products with various solvents including ethanol, toluene, and isooctane, which are components of aggressive oxygenated gasoline as described by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J 1681. These tables include a ranking based on the level of volume swell in the elastomer associated with exposure to a particular solvent. Swell is usually accompanied by a decrease in hardness (softening) that also affects performance. For seal applications, shrinkage of the elastomer upon drying is also a critical parameter since a contraction of volume can conceivably enable leakage to occur. Shrinkage is also indicative of the removal of one or more components of the elastomers (by the solvent). This extraction of additives can negatively change the properties of the elastomer, leading to reduced performance and durability. For a seal application, some level of volume swell is acceptable, since the expansion will serve to maintain a seal. However, the acceptable level of swell is dependent on the particular application of the elastomer product. It is known that excessive swell can lead to unacceptable extrusion of the elastomer beyond the sealed interface, where it becomes susceptible to damage. Also, since high swell is indicative of high solubility, there is a heightened potential for fluid to seep through the seal and into the environment. Plastics, on the other hand, are used primarily in structural applications, such as solid components, including piping and fluid containment. Volume change, especially in a rigid system, will create internal stresses that may negatively affect performance. In order to better understand and predict the compatibility for a given polymer type and fuel composition, an analysis based on Hansen solubility theory was performed for each plastic and elastomer material. From this study, the solubility distance was calculated for each polymer material and test fuel combination. Using the calculated solubility distance, the ethanol concentration associated with peak swell and overall extent of swell can be predicted for each polymer. The bulk of the material discussion centers on the plastic materials, and their compatibility with Fuel C, CE 25 a, CE 50 a, and CE 85 a. The next section of this paper focuses on the elastomer compatibility with the higher ethanol concentrations with comparison to results obtained previously for the lower ethanol levels. The elastomers were identical to those used in the earlier study. Hansen solubility theory is also applied to the elastomers to provide added interpretation of the results. The final section summarizes the performance of the metal coupons...|$|R
