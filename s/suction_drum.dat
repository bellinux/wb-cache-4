40|$|The fibre {{properties}} of cotton, which vary widely according to genetic and environmental conditions, determine its price and textile processing performance and product quality. It is therefore {{hardly surprising that}} cotton fibre properties are routinely measured for trading and quality control purposes, {{with a great deal}} of research having been, and still being, devoted towards developing instruments which enable the various fibre properties to be measured rapidly and accurately. In many cases, it is also necessary to be able to measure {{properties of}} cotton fibres when they have already been converted into yarn and fabric form. To do so, the yarn has to be dismantled into its component fibres, preferably without significantly changing the fibre properties. This could only be done by manually untwisting the yarn and carefully extracting the fibres from the untwisted yarn, care being taken not to break or lose any fibres in the process. This is a time consuming, laborious and labour intensive process. In view of this, a „yarn dismantler‟ which could automatically, cost effectively and within acceptable time frames, dismantle a cotton yarn into its constituent fibres, without undue damage or changes to the fibres, was developed and patented. This thesis reports the results of research undertaken to further develop, evaluate and optimize the yarn dismantler into the final prototype, as well as those relating to its practical applications, including tracking changes in fibre properties during miniature and pilot scale processing, up to, and including the yarn stage. Initial research undertaken on the original bench and first prototype models indicated that, although they produced very promising results, certain improvements and modifications were necessary, if the dismantler was to perform in an efficient and operator friendly manner at the required speeds. These included changes in the axial position of the untwisting spindle and the perforated screen of the <b>suction</b> <b>drum,</b> increasing the air suction at the perforated drum, installing a new motor for the untwisting spindle drive, separating the drives to the different parts of the unit in order to control them independently, integrating a more effective steaming unit into the unit etc. It was found that the dismantling rate had to be set to equal about 95 percent of the original twist in the yarn, and that steaming of the dismantled (untwisted) yarn on the perforated drum was necessary in order to eliminate any twist liveliness (residual torque) in the dismantled yarn, and enable it to be handled and tested on the AFIS instrument. When the final prototype Yarn Dismantler was produced, incorporating all the above mentioned improvements, it functioned very well at dismantling speeds of at least 2 m/min, enabling the length of yarn required for subsequent AFIS testing to be dismantled within an acceptable time of less than 10 minutes, with excellent reproducibility and repeatability of results, also under commercial conditions. It was found that the AFIS measured length characteristics of fibres from the instrument dismantled yarns compared very well with those of fibres from manually dismantled yarns, differences in fibre length generally being less than 1 mm, and it was concluded from these and other evaluation tests, that the yarn dismantler produced fibres without any significant fibre breakage. Some limited tests, carried out on commercially produced carded and combed yarns, indicated that short fibre content and dust and trash levels, as measured by the AFIS on fibres from dismantled yarn, together with the corresponding Uster Statistics, could enable a carded cotton yarn to be distinguished from a combed cotton yarn. Statistical analysis of fibre test results obtained at the different stages during miniature and pilot plant scale processing of various cottons, clearly showed that very significant changes in fibre properties could be caused by certain of the processes. For example, significant fibre breakage occurred during the drafting on the spinning frame, prior to twist insertion. The thesis provides detailed results of changes in various fibre properties, including length, short fibre content, maturity, immature fibre content, seed coat neps and fibrous neps, which occurred from the lint to the final yarn, as well as on the relationship between the properties of the fibres from the dismantled yarn and those from the lint. The results obtained have clearly demonstrated the practical value of the yarn dismantler in enabling yarns to be automatically dismantled into their constituent fibres, which can then be tested by an instrument, such as the AFIS, and the test results related to those of the original lint fibres, thereby opening up many fields of research and practical applications, some of which are captured under „Recommended Further Work...|$|E
50|$|The Souders-Brown {{equation}} (named after Mott Souders and George Granger Brown) {{has been}} a tool for obtaining the maximum allowable vapor velocity in vapor-liquid separation vessels (variously called flash drums, knockout drums, knockout pots, compressor <b>suction</b> <b>drums</b> and compressor inlet drums). It has also been used for the same purpose in designing trayed fractionating columns, trayed absorption columns and other vapor-liquid-contacting columns.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{enclosed}} project was to design a liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal that can deliver 1050 MM SCF per day of natural gas to various consumers. [1. ] Liquefied natural gas is first imported from third world nations such as Algeria at S 4. 50 per MM Btu [20. ], stored and vaporized at the facility, and then sent out through pipelines at a pressure of 1250 psi. This was accomplished {{through the use of}} a holding and or unloading unit and a vaporization unit. The same equipment three storage tanks, two <b>suction</b> <b>drums,</b> one compressor, one packed bed condenser, and 16, 500 ft of pipes [...] are used for both the holding and unloading scenarios. One of the major issues of this terminal is the constant heat leak due to the LNG coming in and stored at a cryogenic temperature of - 256 F. All of the pipes have 6 inches of insulation to reduce the heat leak. A portion of the LNG in the storage tanks is boiled off in order to keep the rest of the LNG cold. The packed bed condenser is used to recover LNG from the boil-off gas. Afterwards, the LNG is then sent to the vaporization unit to be vaporized by warm Dynalene HC The Dynalene HC is reheated through an air heat exchanger and an ethylene glycol loop. 10 % of the imported LNG will be used for this vaporization unit. The only difference between the holding and unloading scenarios is that during unloading, part of the LNG vaporized due to heat leaks will be cooled via the desuperheater and packed bed condenser and sent back to the ship at - 252 F. In the holding scenario, more LNG will have to be circulated to keep the temperature at around - 256 F. The vaporized LNG is then sold for S 6. 50 per MM Btu [20. ]. Overall, the project is very profitable. Although the total capital investment is S 301 Million, the payback period is 6 years. The NPV is $ 1, 900 million, calculated with an IRR of 26. 95 %...|$|R
