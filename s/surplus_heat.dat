40|$|Because {{of better}} {{utilization}} {{possibilities of the}} produced heat, decentrally located {{combined heat and power}} installations achieve a higher energetic efficiency than producing heat and power separately. However, efficiency depends considerably on synchronism of heat and electricity demand. Using a combined heat and power installation to feed the supplementary lighting in greenhouses leads to great differences with regard to quantity and simultaneity of the heat production and demand. This problem can be solved by storing temporary <b>heat</b> <b>surpluses</b> in a buffer. In an experimental greenhouse, cultivated with supplementary lighted roses, research has been done to study the prospects of temporary heat storage. Storage of temporary <b>heat</b> <b>surpluses</b> from the <b>heat</b> and power installation resulted in an energy saving of 60 kWh/m 2 /yr.

5000|$|BTES (borehole {{thermal energy}} storage). BTES stores can be {{constructed}} wherever boreholes can be drilled, and are composed of one to hundreds of vertical boreholes, typically 155 mm in diameter. Systems of all sizes have been built, including many quite large. The strata can be anything from sand to crystalline hardrock, and depending on engineering factors the depth can be from 50 to 300 m. Spacings have ranged from 3 to 8 m. Thermal models {{can be used to}} predict seasonal temperature variation in the ground, including the establishment of a stable temperature regime which is achieved by matching the inputs and outputs of heat over one or more annual cycles. Warm-temperature seasonal heat stores can be created using borehole fields to store <b>surplus</b> <b>heat</b> captured in summer to actively raise the temperature of large thermal banks of soil so that heat can be extracted more easily (and more cheaply) in winter. Interseasonal Heat Transfer uses water circulating in pipes embedded in asphalt solar collectors to transfer heat to Thermal Banks created in borehole fields. A ground source heat pump is used in winter to extract the warmth from the Thermal Bank to provide space heating via underfloor heating. A high Coefficient of Performance is obtained because the heat pump starts with a warm temperature of [...] from the thermal store, instead of a cold temperature of [...] from the ground. A BTES operating at Richard Stockton College since 1995 at a peak of about [...] consists of 400 boreholes 130 m deep under a 3.5 acre parking lot. It has a heat loss of 2% over six months. [...] The upper temperature limit for a BTES store is [...] due to characteristics of the PEX pipe used for BHEs, but most do not approach that limit. Boreholes can be either grout- or water-filled depending on geological conditions, and usually have a life expectancy in excess of 100 years. Both a BTES and its associated district heating system can be expanded incrementally after operation begins, as at Neckarsulm, Germany. [...] BTES stores generally do not impair use of the land, and can exist under buildings, agricultural fields and parking lots. An example of one of the several kinds of STES illustrates well the capability of interseasonal heat storage. In Alberta, Canada, the homes of the Drake Landing Solar Community (in operation since 2007), get 97% of their year-round heat from a district heat system that is supplied by solar heat from solar-thermal panels on garage roofs. This feat - a world record - is enabled by interseasonal heat storage in a large mass of native rock that is under a central park. The thermal exchange occurs via a cluster of 144 boreholes, drilled 37 m into the earth. Each borehole is 155 mm in diameter and contains a simple heat exchanger made of small diameter plastic pipe, through which water is circulated. No heat pumps are involved.|$|E

This thesis evaluates the application of carbon capture to process industries to reduce emissions and decrease the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. The main focus is on partial carbon capture where waste <b>heat</b> or <b>heat</b> <b>surplus</b> is used to run the capture process leading to a lower capture rate but simultaneously the costs are reduced since no additional heat supply is needed. The carbon capture processes are simulated using Aspen Plus where a standard set-up is first compared to an advanced split-flow configuration regarding the energy consumption. For both process designs a sensitivity analysis is conducted focusing on different parameters to optimize the carbon capture process. For comparison two different solvents, MEA and piperazine, are used for the sensitivity analysis of these two process configuration. The optimized process design of the split-flow configuration using MEA as a solvent is used to investigate different partial capture cases. These investigated cases are applied to an existing industrial case, a pulp mill. Two stacks of the pulp mill can be used to capture CO 2 from, the recovery boiler and the lime kiln. In the recovery boiler steam is produced which is primary used to satisfy the need of the pulping process, but there is a <b>heat</b> <b>surplus</b> which can be used to produce electricity or to run the capture process. First it is investigated how much CO 2 can be captured from the two stacks by using this <b>heat</b> <b>surplus</b> instead of producing electricity. The electricity loss per unit of CO 2 captured was determined for different cases. The electricity loss is investigated for the case where CO 2 is only captured from one of the two stacks and a case where CO 2 is captured from both stacks always using only the steam available.. In cooperation with an external partner, cost estimations for different partial capture cases, applied to the pulp mill, are conducted. First full scale capture, where the capture rate is 90 %, was applied to both stacks. For the second case, the capture rate is decreased to 75 % having partial capture and the third case uses partial capture where the flue gas flow is decreased to 75 %.
