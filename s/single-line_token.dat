5000|$|In {{its heyday}} (prior {{to the early}} 1960s), the station had four {{operational}} platforms - one long main platform on the 'up' side divided into 2 sections (numbered 1 & 2, with 2 served by a dead end spur off the through line to [...] ) and an island platform on the 'down' side (numbered 3 & 4). There were also several carriage sidings at {{the east end of}} the station opposite platform 2 (as {{can be seen in the}} photo above), with a signal box at each end of the station to control the layout. The 'East' ’box was closed in 1964 and replaced by two groundframes, [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B", [...] "A" [...] being housed in a ground-level cabin, and bearing <b>single-line</b> <b>token</b> apparatus for any workings over the single tunnel line to Barry Pier but with the former 'West' ’box taking over responsibility for the passenger service to & from the station. [...] The branch from [...] was built as double track, but was singled in 1969.|$|E
