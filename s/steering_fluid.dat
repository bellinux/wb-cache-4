30|$|In {{order for}} fire {{to occur in}} a {{passenger}} vehicle there are three main elements that must be present. First are the combustible materials which include fluids such as engine fuels and oils, transmission oils, power <b>steering</b> <b>fluids,</b> brake fluids and lubricants; upholsteries; tyres; plastic materials such as in dashboards and bumpers; possibly the body work of the vehicle itself; and finally, any contents being carried in the vehicle. Second is the availability of oxygen depends on whether vehicle doors and windows are open (and/or break during the fire), the ease that air can reach other internal parts of the car plus the external ventilation if the vehicle is in an enclosure. Some of the experiments collated in this review include the difference in vehicle burning characteristics {{as a result of}} the degree of opening of the vehicle windows. The third element is the source of ignition. Common sources of ignition for vehicles are electrical faults, hot surfaces, mechanical failure and deliberate actions (Cheong et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|A {{steering}} wheel has a ring portion, spoke portions and a hub portion. The {{steering wheel}} {{is provided with}} a thermoelectric reversible heat pump to heat or cool a fluid. A closed hydraulic circuit includes a hydraulic pump {{and at least one}} duct extending along the ring portion of the <b>steering</b> wheel. The <b>fluid</b> is heated or cooled by the thermoelectric heat pump and is circulated by the hydraulic pump within the ring portion of the steering wheel to heat or cool the ring portion...|$|R
50|$|DEXRON III/Mercon - Most 1980s and 1990s GM and Ford, Mercury, Lincoln, many Asian vehicles, some Asian power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> applications, some Ford/Mazda manual transmissions. It is {{generally}} {{less expensive than}} Dexron VI/Mercon V.|$|E
50|$|Lamborghini {{recalled}} about 1,500 Gallardo Coupé and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, {{because of}} the possibility of power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> leaking and the risk of fire. The cars were built from May 2003 through April 2008.|$|E
50|$|Carl Edwards was {{the fastest}} {{in the first}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 30.832 and a speed of 175.143 mph. The session was red-flagged 39 minutes in when Ryan Preece went up in smoke and started leaking power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{penultimate}} {{round of}} pit stops began on lap 117 with Winterbottom and Lowndes pitting, followed by Whincup on lap 118 and Bright and Canto on lap 119. Michael Caruso's car {{had a major}} power <b>steering</b> leak, dropping <b>fluid</b> over the top section of the circuit. David Wall had a similar problem several laps later. Tander pitted on lap 126, leaving Ekström in the lead. Lowndes and Bright were battling for fifth position at this stage, going side by side around the final corner. Ekström pitted on lap 134, handing over to Andy Priaulx to finish the race. Winterbottom now led by just under two seconds over Whincup.|$|R
40|$|MR fluids {{are smart}} {{materials}} that {{respond to a}} magnetic field by changing their rheological properties. This change in the yield shear stress of MR fluids {{is proportional to the}} magnetic field applied. Dampers with MR fluid as the working fluid have a damping response comparable to conventional synthetic oil dampers. The smart nature of MR fluid enables real time semi-active control of damping, which makes them particularly suitable for motorcycle steering. This project involves the study of MR fluid, its application as a shock absorbing device and the total design and manufacture of an MR <b>fluid</b> <b>steering</b> damper for a motorcycle. Motorcycle steering and the causes of erratic steering motions are investigated and a comparison between a manually adjustment damper and the proposed MR damper are discussed. The design principles are discussed and applied to optimize the design of the MR valve using finite element analysis. A full chapter is dedicated to a total bottom-up design of an MR <b>fluid</b> <b>steering</b> damper, while the chapter on design covers every aspect of the design, including the concept, the selection of material and components, design embodiment, the design of structural members, and technical production drawings. The testing stage enabled the working range and functionality of the completed damper to be established and documented, and served to investigate any shortcomings in the design and lay the groundwork for further improvement in areas such as the damping force range, optimization of the MR valve, size and weight reduction, and reliability. Finally, the project was concluded on an understanding that this design {{can be used as a}} foundation for future work with the aim of a commercial damper design that is effective (as an controllable damper in semi-active suspension systems), lightweight, aesthetically appealing, reliable, and at the same time be commercially viable by having a low production cost...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial {{secretory}} cells display cell-specific {{mechanisms of}} fluid secretion and express large conductance voltage- and Ca 2 +-activated K+ (Maxi-K) channels that generate the membrane negativity for effective Cl− exit to the lumen. Rat and mouse pancreatic acinar cells had been {{thought to be}} peculiar in this sense because of the previously reported lack of Maxi-K channels. However, this view is not entirely correct as evidenced in the present paper. Searching for their presence in pancreatic acinar cells in mice from 5 to 84 weeks of age with patch-clamp current measurements, we demonstrated that the expression of Maxi-K channels is regulated in an age-associated manner after birth. The expression started at approximately 12 postnatal weeks and increased steadily up to 84 weeks. In support of this, RT-PCR could not detect mSlo mRNA, the Maxi-K gene, at either 7 or 8 weeks but could at 58 and 64 postnatal weeks. These results suggest that a key <b>steering</b> element for <b>fluid</b> secretion, the Maxi-K channel, is progressively re-organized in rodent pancreas. A pancreatic secretagogue, acetylcholine, evoked Maxi-K channel current overlapping to various degrees on the previously known current response. This suggests that the rise in internal Ca 2 + activates Maxi-K channels which reshape the mode of secretagogue-evoked current response and contribute to Cl− driving in fluid secretion in an age-associated fashion...|$|R
50|$|Royal Purple is an American {{manufacturer}} {{which produces}} lubricants for automotive, industrial, marine, motorcycle, and racing use. It is known primarily for its line of synthetic Royal Purple Motor Oil products used in gasoline and diesel engines. They also produce other fluids including gear oil, transmission fluid, power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> and industrial gear, bearing, engine, and hydraulic oil. Other products include chassis and bearing grease, lubricant aerosol, aerosol chain lubricant, and firearm lubricant.|$|E
50|$|The {{oil filler}} tube for {{the engine is}} located behind the flip-down license plate door, as is the oil {{dipstick}} and the power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir (when fitted). Most vans had a twist-on/off gas cap right on the outside just under and behind the passenger side door. A locking cap was optional. The spare tyre lies in a tray under the very front of the van (as the engine is in the back), just below the radiator.|$|E
50|$|The XT6 {{was also}} {{fitted with a}} unique Cybrid {{adaptive}} electrohydraulic steering system that changed the level of assistance based on the vehicle's speed. This system did not use a conventional belt-driven power steering pump, freeing up much-needed space in the XT6's already cramped engine bay. The Cybrid system also uses hydraulic fluid that is incompatible with conventional power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> (which is usually automatic transmission fluid). This fluid is still available directly from Subaru at a significant premium over more common types of hydraulic fluid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine requires regular maintenance to ensure its continued function. Engine oil, power <b>steering</b> and brake <b>fluid</b> are examples of engine maintenance that must be kept and checked at regular intervals. Often wear and tear over time can leave an engine totally unusable, {{in which case the}} restorer might remove the existing engine {{and replace it with a}} similar or modern engine substitute. In order to conduct an engine restoration first a technician will conduct a thorough inspection. Often pre-restored vehicle have engines that have gone without maintenance for years and therefore require engine restoration to return them to working order. The engine is removed from the car and inspected for broken and non-functional parts. Typical parts that require replacing include the pistons, spark plugs, fuel lines battery, fuses, timing belt and various gaskets. All are subject to deterioration over time. Structural components like the engine block, cam shaft and crank shaft are less likely to require repair but not uncommon. [...] Typically, after all required parts are gathered, the disassembled pieces will be cleaned, lubricated (if required), and reassembled. The engine is then replaced within the car. A mechanic will then perform a series of tests to ensure that the engine is in working, road worthy condition. [...] This is known as a pre-start engine check. First all the lines and hoses are checked for breaks and leaks. Second the radiator is topped off with water to ensure that the system is sealed off. Next the oil level is replenished. Finally the battery charge is checked and the ignition system is inspected. The engine is then ready to be started.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fail-safe}} {{cooling system}} with a dual speed electric fan was put in place, along with a coil-on-plug ignition system. Larger dual piston brake calipers {{were added to the}} front, requiring 16 inch wheels to be standard. A Watt's linkage was added to the rear suspension. Fuel lines were moved to the passenger side frame rail. A coded ignition key (known as Passive Anti-Theft System, or [...] "PATS") system was introduced and a 72 amp/hour battery replaced the previous 58. Other minor changes included a redesigned engine cover and the power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir being moved {{to the front of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|Qualifying for Race 3 {{consisted}} of a 20-minute qualifying session held on Sunday morning followed by a top ten shootout on Sunday afternoon. Only 25 cars {{took part in the}} session, with Pither's crash in Race 2 doing enough damage to rule the car out of Race 3. The qualifying session was stopped for several minutes when a power steering line on James Moffat's car broke and left power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> on the track at the final corner which needed to be cleaned up. McLaughlin was fastest, setting a time of 1:20.4055 {{at the end of the}} session. McLaughlin, Mostert, Whincup, Van Gisbergen, Fabian Coulthard, Rick Kelly, Pye, Winterbottom, Courtney and Waters progressed to the top ten shootout as a result of being the fastest ten drivers.|$|E
50|$|Some engines have an oil cooler, a {{separate}} small radiator {{to cool the}} engine oil. Cars with an automatic transmission often have extra connections to the radiator, allowing the transmission fluid to transfer its heat to the coolant in the radiator. These may be either oil-air radiators, as for a smaller version of the main radiator. More simply they may be oil-water coolers, where an oil pipe is inserted inside the water radiator. Though the water is hotter than the ambient air, its higher thermal conductivity offers comparable cooling (within limits) from a less complex and thus cheaper and more reliable oil cooler. Less commonly, power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid,</b> brake fluid, and other hydraulic fluids may be cooled by an auxiliary radiator on a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} power steering (HPS) uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine-driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric power steering (EPS) is more efficient than {{hydraulic power}} steering, since the electric power steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid.</b> In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{radiator}} transfers {{the heat}} from the fluid inside to the air outside, thereby cooling the fluid, which in turn cools the engine. Radiators are also often used to cool automatic transmission fluids, air conditioner refrigerant, intake air, and sometimes to cool motor oil or power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid.</b> Radiators are typically mounted {{in a position where they}} receive airflow from the forward movement of the vehicle, such as behind a front grill. Where engines are mid- or rear-mounted, it is common to mount the radiator behind a front grill to achieve sufficient airflow, even though this requires long coolant pipes. Alternatively, the radiator may draw air from the flow over the top of the vehicle or from a side-mounted grill. For long vehicles, such as buses, side airflow is most common for engine and transmission cooling and top airflow most common for air conditioner cooling.|$|E
50|$|Common {{types of}} leaks {{for many people}} include leaks in vehicle tires, causing air to leak out {{resulting}} in flat tires, and leaks in containers, spilling the contents. Leaks can occur or develop in {{many different kinds of}} household, building, vehicle, marine, aircraft, or industrial fluid systems, whether the fluid is a gas or liquid. Leaks in vehicle hydraulic systems such as brake or power steering lines could cause outleakage of brake or power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> resulting in failure of the brakes, power steering, or other hydraulic system. Also possible are leaks of engine coolant - particularly in the radiator and at the water pump seal, transmission fluid, motor oil, and refrigerant in the air conditioning system. Some of these vehicle fluids have different colors to help identify the type of leaking fluid. A zinc-carbon battery is an example of an easy-leaking system; the electrolytes inside the cell sometimes leak out of the cell casing and cause damage to an electronic appliance.|$|E
50|$|The {{next round}} of pit stops began on lap 34 with Ritter and Nick Percat pitting, while Luff and Owen {{followed}} on the next lap. The car of Coulthard and Youlden had a small power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> leak but the problem was mended during a pit stop. Meanwhile, Whincup continued {{to pull away from}} Richards, though Alexandre Prémat was setting the fastest lap times after taking over from Ritter. Whincup pitted on lap 46, four laps after Richards. Lap 54 saw cars coming in to complete their third pit stops, with Will Davison taking over from Owen while Luff handed over to Lowndes on lap 55. By lap 67 all of the leaders had completed three pit stops. Steven Johnson had a problem with his cool suit which had frozen while Jonathon Webb lost the driver's side window on his car. Van Gisbergen endured a problem in his pit stop which caused him to go a lap down while Mostert had a similar delay with a starter motor problem. Tony D'Alberto's car was in the garage with a rear suspension problem.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2003 model year, the Grand Marquis {{retained}} {{the version of}} the Modular V8 introduced in 2001. Single-exhaust versions produced 220 hp, while the dual-exhaust version raised output to 235 hp. During the redesign, a number of changes {{were made to the}} engine. The oil pan was enlarged 20% to six quarts and an engine knock sensor was made standard. Other changes included an intake manifold with aluminum water crossover and an electronic returnless fuel system. The new engine was distinguished by a redesigned engine cover, featuring a chrome [...] "V8" [...] emblem; the oil filler cap was moved to the passenger-side valve cover and the power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir was moved off of the engine block onto the radiator shroud.For 2006, revisions to engine tuning added 4 hp to both versions of the Modular V8, for a total of 224 and 239 hp, respectively. In 2007, the engine was given flex-fuel capability (E85). After the 2007 model year, the 239 hp version of the Grand Marquis was sold exclusively for GCC export.|$|E
30|$|Waste-lubricant oils {{includes}} crankcase (engine) oil, brake fluid, {{automatic transmission}} fluid, power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid,</b> liquid and semi-solid gear, chain, and ball bearing lubricants, and hydraulic fluid. Waste-lubricant oils {{are not considered}} hazardous waste unless it is mixed with a hazardous waste such as a chlorinated solvent. The problem of soil and groundwater pollution was widely recognized in recent years. The flushing air creates air bubbles where the oil will adhere.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{tests of}} a prototype {{fire suppression system}} installed in the engine compartment of a test vehicle. The prototype fire suppression systeni consisted of 2 Solid Propellant Gas Generators (SPGG) and two optical detectors. These components was installed {{on the hood of}} the test vehicle and powered from the battery in the test vehicle. The test vehicle was subjected to a crash test in which power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> expelled onto the exhaust manifold autoignited. In this test, the prototype fire suppression system failed to extinguish this fire. A series of four static fire tests were conducted using the crash tested vehicle. For these static fire tests, the vehicle was stationary. Two fully charged SPGG units were installed in the test vehicle before each test. The first static fire test involved manual activation of the SPGG unite without a fire underhood. This was done to evaluate the effect of the SPGG discharge on underhood components. In the subsequent three static fire tests, fires were ignited in the engine compartment using an electrical igniter or by spraying power <b>steering</b> <b>fluid</b> onto a metal block heated by electrical heaters. In these static fire tests, the prototype fire suppression system failed to extinguish the test fire in two tests and extinguished the test fire in one,test...|$|E
