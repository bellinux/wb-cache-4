25|$|In December 1937 Gustav's daughter–and Ferdinand's niece–Maria, {{married the}} young opera singer Fritz Altman. Ferdinand gave her Adele's jewelled choker, which had {{appeared}} in two of Klimt's paintings, as a wedding present. Ferdinand left Vienna for his Czechoslovakian castle in March 1938, following the Anschluss of Austria by Nazi Germany. That autumn, following the Munich Agreement, he realised he was not safe and left for Paris. In September the following year, he moved to neutral Switzerland where {{he lived in a}} hotel. In his absence the Nazi regime falsely accused him of evading taxes of 1.4million Reichsmarks. His assets were frozen and, in May 1938 a <b>seizure</b> <b>order</b> was issued that allowed the state to dispose of his property as they felt fit. His sugar factory was confiscated and turned over to the state, and went through a process of Aryanisation as Jewish shareholders and managers were replaced. His Viennese residence became an office of , the German railway company, while his castle in Czechoslovakia was taken after the German occupation as the personal residence of the Nazi general Reinhard Heydrich.|$|E
50|$|This {{incident}} {{may have}} been related to the enforcement of collection orders during the Tithe War (1831-1836). Spasmodic violence broke out around this time (particularly in Kilkenny, Wexford, and Cork) when the police entered local fairgrounds to enforce <b>seizure</b> <b>orders</b> on cattle for non-payment of tithes. Order was finally restored by rescinding <b>seizure</b> <b>orders</b> in 1836. The subsequent revision of the Tithe Act commuted the levy. The Church of Ireland was disestablished by the Gladstone government in 1869, and the tithe was abolished.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, {{the rights}} to the game reverted from the Russian state to Pajitnov himself, who {{previously}} had made very little money from the game. In 1996, The Tetris Company was founded, claiming to hold copyright registrations for Tetris products in the U.S. and taking out trademark registrations for Tetris in almost every country in the world. They have licensed the brand to a number of companies, and the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Customs have at times issued <b>seizure</b> <b>orders</b> to preclude unlicensed Tetris-like games from being imported into the U.S., though bulletins circulated by the U.S. Copyright Office state that copyright does not apply to the rules of a game.|$|R
50|$|On 9 March 2006 police, {{soldiers}} and customs officials {{from both sides}} of the Irish border launched a large dawn raid on his house and several other buildings in the border region. Three persons were arrested by the Gardaí, but were released three days after. A fleet of tankers, computers, documents, two shotguns, over 30,000 cigarettes and the equivalent of 800,000 euros in sterling bank notes, euro bank notes and cheques were seized. Four diesel laundering facilities attached to a major network of storage tanks, some of which were underground, were also found. The Irish Criminal Assets Bureau later obtained <b>seizure</b> <b>orders</b> to take possession of euro cash and cheques and sterling cash and cheques, together worth around one million Euros.|$|R
500|$|The Roosevelt {{administration}} {{felt that}} it needed to act quickly to stop the strike. War plants in Philadelphia reported debilitating absentee rates in their workforce due to the strike, which was causing significant damage to the city's war production. The military reported delays in delivery of fighter planes, radar equipment, flamethrowers and numerous other items. Rear Admiral Milo Draemel complained that the strike so significantly slowed the war production {{in the area that}} [...] "it could delay the day of victory". The strike was also negatively affecting America's image abroad, particularly in Europe, where the U.S. was fighting Nazi Germany under the slogans of freedom and racial justice. Germany, as well as Japan, were apt to use every instance of racial unrest in the U.S. for propaganda purposes. Official reaction by the White House was somewhat delayed by the President Roosevelt's absence: {{at the time he was}} on a warship on his way from Hawaii to the Aleutian islands. At 7:45p.m. on August 3, in his twenty-fifth <b>seizure</b> <b>order</b> under the SmithConnally Act, President Roosevelt authorized the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to take control of the Philadelphia Transportation Company. Major-General Philip Hayes, head of the Army's Third Service Command, was put in charge of the PTC's operations.|$|E

Such a seizure is enforced by a bailiff, usually accompanied by at least one expert. It can take place on the premises of the alleged infringer, but also at a trade fair for instance. Art.

50|$|In 1830, the new tithe-proctor of Graigue (a parish of 4,779 Catholics and 63 Protestants) {{decided to}} break with the {{tradition}} of his predecessor and to enforce <b>seizure</b> <b>orders</b> for the collection of arrears of Tithes. Tithes provided financial support of the established Anglican Church of Ireland. Some of the recalcitrant Catholics had habitually transferred ownership of their livestock to Doyle in <b>order</b> to avoid <b>seizure</b> at the town fair. The new proctor requested their priest's cooperation in handing over the assets. Doyle refused, and the proctor, aided by the Irish Constabulary, seized some of the livestock. A mass riot broke out at the fair and there were several casualties. A civil disobedience campaign followed, peppered with sporadic violence mostly at country fairs over the seizure of livestock. A period of instability that would {{become known as the}} Tithe War followed.|$|R

5000|$|Before 1824, {{prisons in}} the British penal colony of New South Wales were {{overseen by the}} Provost Marshal. This title/position was {{replaced}} by that of Sheriff when a Charter of Justice was proclaimed in 1824. In addition to detaining accused criminals awaiting trial, the sheriff executed death sentences and other sentences, controlled gaols, and handled prison movements, including the chain gangs that worked on Goat Island and in Sydney. [...] In 1867, the sheriff began {{to be replaced by}} an independent Prisons Department, led by an inspector general, which was later renamed comptroller general. Most Australian states adopted this mode of prison oversight for many years. In New South Wales, the Office of the Sheriff is part of Courts and Tribunal Services. The office has more than 400 employees at 58 sheriff's office. In addition to enforcing writs, warrants, and property <b>seizure</b> <b>orders</b> issued by New South Wales courts and tribunals, the Office of the Sheriff also provides court security and administers the state's jury service.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{clash of}} the Tithe War {{took place on}} 3 March 1831 in Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny, when a force of 120 yeomanry tried to enforce <b>seizure</b> <b>orders</b> on cattle {{belonging}} to a Roman Catholic priest. Encouraged by his bishop, he had organised people to resist tithe collection by placing their stock under his ownership prior to sale. The revolt soon spread. On 18 June 1831, in Bunclody (Newtownbarry), County Wexford, people resisting the seizure of cattle were fired upon by the Irish Constabulary, who killed twelve and wounded twenty; one yeoman was shot dead in retaliation. This massacre caused objectors to organise and use warnings such as church bells to signal the community to round up the cattle and stock. On 14 December 1831, resisters used such warnings to ambush a detachment of 40 Constabulary at Carrickshock (County Kilkenny). Twelve constables, including the Chief Constable, were killed and more wounded. (Other sources put the number of dead at eighteen.) ...|$|R

5000|$|Both {{temporary}} and permanent injunctions {{are available to}} prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.
