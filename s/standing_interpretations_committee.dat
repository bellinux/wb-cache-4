5000|$|IFRS {{began as}} an attempt to {{harmonize}} accounting across the European Union but the value of harmonization quickly made the concept attractive around the world. However, it has been debated whether or not de facto harmonization has occurred. Standards that were issued by IASC (the predecessor of IASB) are still within use today and go by the name International Accounting Standards (IAS), while standards issued by IASB are called IFRS. IAS were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). On 1 April 2001, the new International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) took over from the IASC the responsibility for setting International Accounting Standards. During its first meeting the new Board adopted existing IAS and <b>Standing</b> <b>Interpretations</b> <b>Committee</b> standards (SICs). The IASB has continued to develop standards calling the new standards [...] "International Financial Reporting Standards".|$|E

It {{made the}} points including {{that the person}} taking the oath should take it in a sincere and solemn manner with accurate, complete and solemn phrases such as [...] "uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China" [...] and [...] "bear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China" [...] {{as stated in the}} statutory oath. If oath-taker refuses to take the oath, he or she cannot retake the oath and shall be disqualified from assuming public office. It also stated that the oath administrator has the duty to confirm if the oath-taking is carried out legally and complies with this interpretation and Hong Kong law. The spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office stated that [...] "Beijing will absolutely neither permit anyone advocating secession in Hong Kong nor allow any pro-independence activists to enter a government institution." [...] Following Beijing’s decision, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said Hong Kong would enact Article 23, a controversial provision of the Basic Law relating to national security legislation. On 8 November, hundreds of lawyers joined a silent march against Beijing's interpretation of the Basic Law, claiming it harms judicial independence.|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{substance}} over form principle, transactions that in substance transfer {{the right to}} use an asset for an agreed period of time, in return for a series of payments, are accounted for as a lease transaction in terms of IAS 17 (AC 105), irrespective of the legal form of the arrangement. The International Financial Reporting <b>Interpretations</b> <b>Committee</b> and the Standards <b>Interpretation</b> <b>Committee</b> have issued two documents that provide more guidance on the application of {{the substance}} over form principle in the case of leases, namely: 1. IFRIC 4, Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, and 2. SIC 27, Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRIC 4 poses the question whether all transactions that are in substance leases are accounted for in terms of IAS 17 (completeness of lease transactions). IFRIC 4 therefore requires those who prepare financial statements to consider all supply and service agreements that are legally not leases, in order to determine whether they are in substance lease arrangements. SIC 27, on the other hand, poses the question whether all transactions that take the legal form of a lease are actually, in substance, lease transactions that should be accounted for in terms of IAS 17...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that strong {{correlations}} are observed between low frequency QPO s and the spectral power law index for a number of black hole candidate sources (BHCs), when these sources exhibit quasi-steady hard x-ray emission states. The dominant long <b>standing</b> <b>interpretation</b> of QPO's is that they are produced in and are the signature of the thermal accretion disk. Paradoxically, strong QPO's are present even in the cases where the thermal component is negligible. We present a model which identifies the origin of the QPO's and relates them directly to the properties of a compact coronal region which is bounded by the adjustment from Kepleriaa to sub-Kelperian inflow into the BH, and is primarily responsible for the observed power law spectrum. The model also predicts the relationship between high and low frequency QPO's and shows how BH's can be unique identified from observations of the soft states of NS's and BHC's...|$|R

To extend the prior research on accounting judgment and decision-making, we also examine the interactive effects of task complexity and additional guidance on the judgments of accountants. The results provide evidence that those accountants who are provided with decision aid in the form of additional guidance on IFRS make more accurate judgments than accountants who are not provided with such guidance. Furthermore, the study provides evidence that this additional guidance improves the judgments of accountants when they undertake tasks which they find complex. The results indicate that additional guidance on IFRS needs to be provided and suggests that accountants should exploit any guidance which is currently provided in IFRS and by the International Financial Reporting Standards <b>Interpretations</b> <b>Committee.</b> 26 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Priority {{inversion}} and priority inheritance protocols for bounding {{blocking time}} are well-understood topics in real-time systems research. The two {{most commonly used}} priority inheritance protocols are basic priority inheritance and priority ceiling emulation. Although both are supported in POSIX, Ada and the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ), little {{has been written about}} the consequences of using both protocols concurrently in the same program. The assumption is usually that only one is in force at any particular time. For large real-time systems, this assumption may not be valid. This paper provides motivation for why a mixture of the two can occur and illustrates that this can result in the raising of unwanted asynchronous exception. This has led the Technical <b>Interpretation</b> <b>Committee</b> for the RTSJ to propose a new version of the priority ceiling emulation protocol that will enable it to work in harmony with basic priority inheritance. The protocol is described and modelled using the UPPAAL tool, where formal properties are explored using model checking. ...|$|R

This Interpretation states that shares should be classified as financial liabilities in most cases. In Spain, the treatment that the different accounting regulations that have been current until now was completely different. Shares were considered as equity. In this sense, it’s true that this problem has been discussed during last years between spanish investigators, but the legal change is now, so the consequences will appear from now on. Because of this, we pretend to quantify, using the method case, the effect that this legal change could have in the main ratios used on the economic and financial analysis. As a conclusion, we can affirm that an important variation is observed, but the amount of it depends on the initial level of equity in the co-operative. ...|$|R

5000|$|John Calvin (Commentary on Genesis 2:8), {{following}} a different thread in Augustine (City of God, xiii.20), understood {{the tree in}} sacramental language. Given that humanity cannot exist except within a covenantal relationship with God, and all covenants use symbols to give us [...] "the attestation of his grace", he gives the tree, [...] "not because it could confer on man that life with {{which he had been}} previously endued, but in order that it might be a symbol and memorial of the life which he had received from God." [...] God often uses symbols - He doesn’t transfer his power into these outward signs, but [...] "by them He stretches out His hand to us, because, without assistance, we cannot ascend to Him." [...] Thus he intends man, as often as he eats the fruit, to remember the source of his life, and acknowledge that he lives not by his own power, but by God’s kindness. Calvin denies (contra Aquinas and without mentioning his name) that the tree served as a biological defense against physical aging. This is the <b>standing</b> <b>interpretation</b> in modern Reformed theology as well.|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} sequencing {{in clinical}} diagnostics is providing valuable genomic variant data, {{which can be}} used to support healthcare decisions. In silico tools to predict pathogenicity are crucial to assess such variants and we have evaluated a new tool, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), and its classification of gene variants in Lynch syndrome by using a set of 2210 DNA mismatch repair gene variants. These had already been classified by experts from InSiGHT's Variant <b>Interpretation</b> <b>Committee.</b> Overall, we found CADD scores do predict pathogenicity (Spearman's ρ = 0. 595, p ≪ 0. 001). However, we discovered 31 major discrepancies between the InSiGHT classification and the CADD scores; these were explained in favor of the expert classification using population allele frequencies, co-segregation analyses, disease association studies, or a second-tier test. Of 751 variants that could not be clinically classified by InSiGHT, CADD indicated that 47 variants were worth further study to confirm their putative pathogenicity. We demonstrate CADD is valuable in prioritizing variants in clinically relevant genes for further assessment by expert classification teams. This article is protected by copyright.

40|$|When {{considering}} {{the sale of}} property (real estate), two points of time become relevant, the date the sales contract is signed or alternatively the date that the contract is completed and the legal title passes to the buyer. It is likely {{at the time of}} signing the contract that all material information relating to the contract will be known, e. g. the selling price and related expenditure. Therefore, {{in the absence of any}} uncertainty, it would be possible to recognize the revenue from the disposal of the property at the time the contract is signed. Recognition of a real estate sale is however complicated when the contract to purchase the real estate is signed prior to, or during the construction of that real estate. The question is whether the contract signed still falls within the scope of IAS 18 (AC 111). To address this situation the International Financial Reporting <b>Interpretations</b> <b>Committee</b> (IFRIC) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued a draft interpretation note addressing real estate sales and when these sales fall within the scope of IAS 18 (AC 111), Revenue, or IAS 11 (AC 109), Construction Contracts.
