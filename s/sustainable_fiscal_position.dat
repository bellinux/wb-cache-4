40|$|Prudent fiscal {{management}} {{requires a}} clear delineation between the long-run and short-run behaviour of the government’s budget position. The long-run {{objective of the}} fiscal authority should be to achieve a <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>position</b> in which its budget is balanced. This requires a matching of expenditure responsibility with adequate revenue resources so that the “structural” budget position is one of balance. Long-run balanced budgets allow a separation of the fiscal authority from the monetary authority and give the monetary authority the necessary autonomy to pursue long-run price stabilization as its policy objective. Balanced budgets reduce or eliminate fiscal authority reliance on the inflation tax as a revenue source, and this in turn provides the monetary authority with the needed commitment and credibility to achieve an environment of long-run price stability. If government revenues and/or expenditures are sensitive to cyclical fluctuations in economic activity then the budget position of the fiscal authority should respond to these fluctuations in the short run. Surplus budget positions should occur in business cycle upturns and deficit budget positions should occur in business cycle downturns. These short-run cyclical movements in the fiscal authority’s budget are optimal both {{from the perspective of}} traditiona...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} suggests that the large fiscal deficits that Pakistan has experienced {{over most of the}} period since 1970 led to some crowding out of private investment, resulting in slower output growth than would otherwise have been observed. Past fiscal deficits have also resulted in a substantial accumulation of domestic and external debt. In addition, the possibilities for currency substitution that have been created by the removal of restrictions on capital flows from Pakistan, as well as on foreign currency holdings of domestic residents, may have limited the potential for collecting the inflation tax.

Building {{on the first}} Statement of 2006, we construct two main fiscal scenarios over a 40 - year horizon. The historic trends scenario allows historic and current spending and revenue settings to interact with changing demography. The sustainable debt scenario applies a fiscal constraint on non-benefit spending so that Crown net debt follows the Government’s medium-term fiscal targets. The modelling innovations introduced this time do not alter the basic structure and principles of the Long-term Fiscal Model, but instead provide insights into government spending: public sector productivity growth {{and the growth of}} the basket of services each person receives. These innovations enable us to illustrate the effects of tradeoffs between broad spending categories in a constrained fiscal environment. In the 2009 Statement, these policy changes are combined into three possible scenarios for obtaining a <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>position.</b> The paper also illustrates the sensitivity of the fiscal position to small changes in the demographic, macroeconomic and fiscal modelling assumptions.

40|$|Stage Three of the European Monetary Union (EMU) {{will start}} on January 1, 1999. The new {{currency}} area, {{for which the}} name "Euroland" has been coined, will comprise 11 countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. The project of a single currency has enhanced economic convergence among the participating countries to some degree, but differences {{with respect to the}} business cycle have remained pronounced. This can also be expected for EMU. A single monetary policy for Euroland will not affect regions uniformly, given the substantial differences between the participating countries with respect to, for example, institutional arrangements in financial markets and in labor markets, the public share in the economy or the structure of production. It is often argued that monetary policy in Europe is currently too tight; consequently, the upswing is at risk or even deflation is around the corner. This view is not supported by the facts. Various indicators suggest that monetary policy is actually quite easy. Given that European short-term interest rates are bound to converge around summer at a historically low level and key interest rates will hardly be raised substantially in the immediate future, monetary policy will remain loose for the time being. This policy increasingly bears some risk of accelerating inflation. In any event, there is no risk of outright deflation in Euroland. It is still an open question whether the European Central Bank (ECB) will use a monetary aggregate as an intermediate target (monetary targeting) or try to directly adjust monetary policy to (forecasted) inflationary developments (inflation targeting). Empirical work suggests that money demand in Euroland is sufficiently stable to pursue monetary targeting. Even if instability were to occur in the transition period and right after the introduction of the euro, this would not necessarily imply the superiority of inflation targeting because under such circumstances the reliability of inflation forecasts is reduced as well. The advantage of implementing the monetary targeting strategy that had proved to be successful in Germany would be that it allows the ECB to gain some of the Bundesbank's reputation. In 1997 public deficits in all countries of Euroland were kept within the limit of 3 percent of GDP set in the Maastricht Treaty. However, further consolidation is necessary in most countries {{in order to meet the}} obligations of the Stability and Growth Pact. Ultimately, the fiscal positions have to be sustainable in the long term. A rough calculation suggests that at present only a few of the prospective EMU countries have a <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>position.</b> In addition, fiscal policy seems to be less sustainable because in some countries one-off measures contributed significantly to the reduction of the 1997 deficits. After EMU is established, bilateral exchange rates as possible shock absorber cease to exist and other mechanisms of adjusting to a negative (external) shock are necessary in order to prevent unemployment from rising. The most important adjustment mechanism left is flexibility of wages. It would be counterproductive to increasingly negotiate wage settlements at the European level. Against the background of the rising need for differentiation, decisions that affect employment should, to the contrary, be more and more decentralized. [...] ...|$|E

Our methodology permits us to trace the endogenous relationship between fiscal multipliers and <b>fiscal</b> <b>positions</b> while maintaining enough degrees of freedom to draw sharp inferences. We report three major results. First, the fiscal multipliers depend on fiscal positions: the multipliers tend to be larger when <b>fiscal</b> <b>positions</b> are strong (i. e. when government debt and deficits are low) than weak.

40|$|Serious {{deterioration}} in government fiscal finances {{in the late}} 1990 s and early 2000 s asked for prudent fiscal management. The fiscal deterioration of 1990 s and 2000 s led to elevated levels of debt liabilities at both the national and sub-national level. Uttar Pradesh (UP) <b>fiscal</b> <b>position</b> during 1990 s and 2000 s {{was one of the}} most vulnerable. Fiscal and revenue deficit and debt levels were appallingly high creating unmanageable pressure on fiscal finances. The UP government has enacted its FRBMA in 2004 with the aim to arrest rising deficits and debt which mandated reduction in deficit and debt levels within a limit in a given time frame. The sustainability analysis has been made in the current study to capture the effect of reforms on debt position and to assess sustainability of debts in pre and post FRBMA years. Our analysis suggests improvement in all debt and deficit indicators in post 2004 - 05 years. Debt analysis also confirms <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> health (τ = - 4. 533; p< 0. 05; with constant and trend) during post-FRBMA years. The policy implication of the finding is that UP government need to stick with fiscal rules policy. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an overlapping generations {{model in which}} public spending directly contributes to grow up productivity as Barro (1990) and a government comforms the constant spending-GDP and debtspending ratio rules. We analyse policy effects on fiscal sustainability, growth rate and welfare. This paper gives some remarks as follows: First, we demonstrate that when spending-GDP ratio rises {{it may be more}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy. Second, we show analytically that if higher spending-GDP ratio is more <b>sustainable</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy, it brings higher growth rate in both short-term and long-term. Third, such policy change is Pareto improving. These remarks are not obtained in previous researches on fiscal sustainability. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{panel of}} 30 {{emerging}} market economies from 1997 to 2007, this paper investigates the determinants of country risk premiums as measured by sovereign bond spreads. Unlike previous studies, {{the results indicate that}} both fiscal and political factors matter for credit risk in emerging markets. Lower levels of political risk are associated with tighter spreads, while efforts at fiscal consolidation narrow credit spreads, especially in countries that experienced prior defaults. The composition of fiscal policy matters: spending on public investment contributes to lower spreads as long as the <b>fiscal</b> <b>position</b> remains <b>sustainable</b> and the <b>fiscal</b> deficit does not worsen...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rationale for}} a top-down approach to budget preparation and approval, and discusses some factors {{that have to be}} considered when reorienting the budget process along these lines. The paper argues that the sequence in which budgetary decisions are taken matters, and that a strong top-down approach strengthens fiscal discipline and improves policy prioritization and coordination. Top-down budgeting also alters the division of roles and responsibilities between the central budget authority and line ministries, and requires that the process of determining the total expenditure level, sectoral allocations and individual appropriations is clarified. Finally, the paper argues that strong top-down elements in the parliamentary budget voting process can be effective in addressing the risk of excessive and unsustainable amendments during budget approval.
