5|$|The Restless Spirit is a 1913 American silent short drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Allan Dwan, featuring J. Warren Kerrigan and Pauline Bush.

The Dreamer heads out into the desert and is nursed back to health by the Desert Flower. A series of illusions follows which shows the futility of conquest when he cannot conquer his own community.

25|$|In 1992, Zemeckis {{directed}} the black comedy Death Becomes Her, starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. Although his next film {{would have some}} comedic elements, it was Zemeckis's first with dramatic elements, and was also his biggest commercial success to date, Forrest Gump (1994). Starring Tom Hanks in the title role, and borrowing to some extent from Woody Allen's earlier Zelig, Forrest Gump tells the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with a low I.Q., who unwittingly participates {{in some of the}} major events of the twentieth century, falls in love, and interacts with several major historical figures in the process. The film grossed $677 million worldwide and became the top grossing U.S. film of 1994; it won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for Hanks) and Best Director (for Zemeckis). In 1997, Zemeckis directed Contact, a long-gestating project based on Carl Sagan's 1985 novel of the same name. The film centers on Eleanor Arroway, a scientist played by Jodie Foster, who believes she has made contact with extraterrestrial beings.|$|E

25|$|His first {{attempts}} at film direction had limited success, {{and he left}} Denmark {{to work in the}} French film industry. While living in France he met Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo {{and other members of the}} French artistic scene and in 1928 he made his first classic film, The Passion of Joan of Arc. Working from the transcripts of Joan's trial, he created a masterpiece of emotion that drew equally on realism and expressionism. Dreyer used private finance from Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg to make his next film as the Danish film industry was in financial ruin. Vampyr (1932) is a surreal meditation on fear. Logic gave way to mood and atmosphere in this <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> protecting two sisters from a vampire. The movie contains many indelible images, such as the hero, played by de Gunzburg (under the screen name Julian West), dreaming of his own burial and the animal blood lust on the face of one of the sisters as she suffers under the vampire's spell. The film was shot mostly silent but with sparse, cryptic dialogue in three separate versions – English, French and German.|$|E
25|$|Gerard may be {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} botany in English language, but he was not well educated, was more interested as a herbalist and barber-surgeon in the medicinal properties of the plants than botanical theory and was not notable as a botanist in terms of technical knowledge in his own time according to his critics. Amongst these was John Ray, who commented that despite the fact that the book was the standard botany text in the seventeenth century, it was the work of an ignorant man, and that lacking any foreign languages he could not have translated the work. Because it was a practical and useful book, packed with helpful drawings of plants, and because Gerard had a fluid and lively writing manner, his Herball was popular with ordinary literate people in 17th-century England. Although it was recognised amongst scholars that it was a pirated work, with many limitations, at that time there is evidence of the book still being in practical use as a medicinal herbal, even in the early 19th century. Agnes Arber recounts a <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> born in 1842 that in his childhood there was a woman who used the Herball for treating the ailments of her neighbours.|$|E
