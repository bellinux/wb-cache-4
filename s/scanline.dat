5|$|Filming, {{originally}} {{scheduled to}} begin in Los Angeles in July2008, began in Kamloops, Savona, Cache Creek and Ashcroft, British Columbia. With a Screen Actors Guild strike looming, the film's producers made a contingency plan to salvage it. Uncharted Territory, Digital Domain, Double Negative, <b>Scanline,</b> and Sony Pictures Imageworks were hired to create 2012 computer-animated visual effects.|$|E
5|$|Chris Townsend {{served as}} visual effects {{supervisor}} for the film, which featured over 2,000 visual effects shots and was worked on by 17 studios, including Weta Digital, Digital Domain, <b>Scanline</b> VFX, Trixter, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Fuel VFX, Cantina Creative, Cinesite, The Embassy Visual Effects, Lola, Capital T, Prologue and Rise FX. Townsend said that from January 2013 {{through the end}} of filming in April, the collective crew had one day of downtime, otherwise working seven days a week and 14 to 18 hours a day.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Iron Man 2 in May 2010, Favreau, who served as director, decided not to return, and in February 2011 Black was hired to write and direct the film. Black and Pearce opted to make the script more character-centric and focused on thriller elements. Throughout April and May 2012, the film's {{supporting}} cast was filled out, with Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall brought in to portray key roles. Filming began on May 23, and lasted through December 17, 2012, primarily at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Additional shooting took place at various locations around North Carolina, as well as Florida, China, and Los Angeles. The visual effects were handled by 17 companies, including <b>Scanline</b> VFX, Digital Domain, and Weta Digital. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E

If 16 <b>scanlines</b> of continuous graphical data are written to a character-block-aligned portion of the screen then they will appear as a continuous block in most modes but in the two non-continuous modes they will be displayed as two blocks of eight <b>scanlines,</b> separated in the middle by two blank <b>scanlines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Vatti {{algorithm}} involves processing both {{subject and}} clipping polygon edges {{in an orderly}} fashion, starting with the lowermost edges and working towards the top; this is conceptually similar to the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm. This sweep line approach divides the problem space by <b>scanlines,</b> imaginary horizontal lines that pass through every vertex of the participating polygons. These <b>scanlines</b> outline scanbeams - the spaces between adjacent <b>scanlines.</b> These scanbeams are processed in turn, starting with the lowest scanbeam, with the algorithm adding points of intersection within these scanbeams into the solution polygons.|$|R
5|$|Prince Caspian {{has over}} 1,500 special effects shots, more than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobes 800 effects shots, yet the film had {{less time to}} {{complete}} them. The scale of special effects led Andrew Adamson to base production in the UK, {{to take advantage of}} new tax credits. Therefore, it legally qualifies as a British film. This also meant the director only had to walk five minutes from the editing room to supervise the effects. British visual effects companies the Moving Picture Company and Framestore CFC were hired to create the visual effects alongside Weta Digital. Framestore worked on Aslan, Trufflehunter and the door in the air; <b>Scanline</b> did the River-god; Weta created the werewolf, the wild bear and Miraz's castle; MPC and Escape Studios did the main battle, the tunnel scene, the castle assault, the council scenes and all the other creatures.|$|E
25|$|Before DEFLATE is applied, {{the data}} is {{transformed}} via a prediction method: a single filter method {{is used for the}} entire image, while for each image line, a filter type is chosen to transform the data to make it more efficiently compressible. The filter type used for a <b>scanline</b> is prepended to the <b>scanline</b> to enable inline decompression.|$|E
25|$|Ray tracing is an {{extension}} of the same technique developed in <b>scanline</b> rendering and ray casting. Like those, it handles complicated objects well, and the objects may be described mathematically. Unlike <b>scanline</b> and casting, ray tracing is almost always a Monte Carlo technique, that is one based on averaging a number of randomly generated samples from a model.|$|E

25|$|A serious {{disadvantage}} of ray tracing is performance (while it can in theory be faster than traditional <b>scanline</b> rendering depending on scene complexity vs. number of pixels on-screen). <b>Scanline</b> algorithms and other algorithms use data coherence to share computations between pixels, while ray tracing normally starts the process anew, treating each eye ray separately. However, this separation offers other advantages, {{such as the}} ability to shoot more rays as needed to perform spatial anti-aliasing and improve image quality where needed.|$|E
25|$|Ray tracing is a {{technique}} for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of photorealism; usually {{higher than that of}} typical <b>scanline</b> rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{ray tracing}} {{describes}} {{a method for}} producing visual images constructed in 3D computer graphics environments, with more photorealism than either ray casting or <b>scanline</b> rendering techniques. It works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each pixel in a virtual screen, and calculating {{the color of the}} object visible through it.|$|E
50|$|The Acorn Electron version {{exploits}} {{a division}} {{in the way the}} Electron handles its display: of the seven available graphics modes, two are configured so that the final two of every ten <b>scanlines</b> are blank and are not based on the contents of RAM. If 16 <b>scanlines</b> of continuous graphical data are written to a character-block-aligned portion of the screen then they will appear as a continuous block in most modes but in the two non-continuous modes they will be displayed as two blocks of 8 <b>scanlines,</b> separated in the middle by two blank <b>scanlines.</b> In order to keep track of its position within the display, the Electron maintains an internal display address counter. The same counter is used in both the continuous and non-continuous graphics modes and switching modes mid-frame does not cause any adjustment to the counter. Firetrack switches from a non-continuous to a continuous graphics mode partway down the display. By using the palette to mask the top area of the display and taking care about when it changes mode it can shift the continuous graphics {{at the bottom of the}} display down in two pixel increments (rather than the usual eight for vertical scrolling) because the internal display counter is not incremented on blank <b>scanlines</b> during non-continuous graphics modes.|$|R

500|$|For season four, HBO added German-based Mackevision to the project. The season-four finale, [...] "The Children", won the 2014 Emmy Award for Visual Effects. Additional {{producers}} for season four included Canadian-based Rodeo FX, German-based <b>Scanline</b> VFX and U.S.-based BAKED FX. The {{muscle and}} wing {{movements of the}} adolescent dragons in seasons four and five were based largely on those of a chicken. Pixomondo retained a team of 22 to 30 people which focused on visualizing Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, with the average production time per season of 20 to 22 weeks. For the fifth season, HBO added Canadian-based Image Engine and U.S.-based Crazy Horse Effects to its list of main visual-effects producers.|$|E
500|$|Digital Domain, <b>Scanline</b> VFX and Trixter each {{worked on}} {{separate}} shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared {{some of their}} files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, Legacy Effects constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that [...] "Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put tracking markers on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height—Iron Man is 6'5". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, Canon C300s, and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character." [...] The artists studied time lapse photography of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the aurora borealis as reference for {{the effect of the}} glowing Extremis characters.|$|E

500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), <b>Scanline</b> VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{contains}} more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Weta Digital, <b>Scanline</b> VFX, Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, Luma Pictures, Cantina Creative, Trixter, Modus FX, Whiskytree, Digital Domain, The Third Floor and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements. Jeff White, ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years {{and make it a}} pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Scanline</b> VFX {{completed}} the reveal {{shots of the}} Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck {{to the point where}} it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, [...] "We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space" [...] including Loki's arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier's bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other. Method Design in Los Angeles created the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, [...] "This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of The Avengers as well as 30 credits set in-scene." ...|$|E

In contrast, regular digital television (DTV) is 480 lines (upon which NTSC is based, 480 visible <b>scanlines</b> out of 525) or 576 lines (upon which PAL/SECAM are based, 576 visible <b>scanlines</b> out of 625). However, since HD is broadcast digitally, its introduction sometimes coincides {{with the introduction of}} DTV. Additionally, current DVD quality is not high-definition, although the high-definition disc systems Blu-ray Disc and the HD DVD are.|$|R

2500|$|Ray tracing's {{popularity}} {{stems from}} its basis in a realistic simulation of lighting over other rendering methods (such as <b>scanline</b> rendering or ray casting). [...] Effects such as reflections and shadows, which {{are difficult to}} simulate using other algorithms, are a natural result of the ray tracing algorithm. The computational independence of each ray makes ray tracing amenable to parallelization.|$|E
2500|$|Visual {{effects on}} the film were {{supervised}} by visual effects supervisor Jim Rygiel, {{best known for his}} work on The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. Rygiel has stated that the effects are {{in the spirit of the}} original series, with the blessing of Toho, although the monster would be [...] "more dynamic than a guy in a big rubber suit." [...] Visual and special effects companies working on the picture include the Moving Picture Company (MPC), Double Negative, Weta Digital, Amalgamated Dynamics, ComputerCafe/CafeFX, Lidar VFX, <b>Scanline</b> VFX, Stereo D and The Third Floor. Production of the movie was completed in the last week of March 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The {{visual effects}} company <b>Scanline</b> VFX worked on Snowpiercer. The company worked {{primarily}} on the exterior shots of the film: the frozen city, the Yekaterina Bridge, the Frozen Harbour landscape in the sushi lounge, the [...] "Frozen Seven" [...] sequence, the industrial park in the shoot-out sequence, and the post crash environment/avalanche {{at the end of}} the film. Already having multiple designs, storyboards and basic concepts of the train cars, it set in motion the development of over 60 different versions of the various wagons for the train Snowpiercer. Thus, visual effects supervisor Michel Mielke said [...] " [...] we [...] a good idea of the vision of director Bong, we saw what he liked, and what did not work for the movie." ...|$|E
