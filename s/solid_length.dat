40|$|This paper {{develops}} a control and estimation {{design for the}} one-phase Stefan problem. The Stefan problem represents a liquid-solid phase transition as time evolution of a temperature profile in a liquid-solid material and its moving interface. This physical process is mathematically formulated as a diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) evolving on a time-varying spatial domain described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The state-dependency of the moving interface makes the coupled PDE-ODE system a nonlinear and challenging problem. We propose a full-state feedback control law, an observer design, and the associated output-feedback control law via the backstepping method. The designed observer allows estimation of the temperature profile based on the available measurement of <b>solid</b> phase <b>length.</b> The associated output-feedback controller ensures the global exponential stability of the estimation errors, the H 1 - norm of the distributed temperature, and the moving interface to the desired setpoint under some explicitly given restrictions on the setpoint and observer gain.

40|$|With 6 tables Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the importance of heterosis for agronomic and quality traits in shrunken (sh 2) sweet corn, assess the usefulness of combining ability to predict the value of parents and their crosses for further genetic improvement and examine whether genetic divergence can predict heterosis or F 1 performance. Ten genetically diverse shrunken (sh 2) sweet corn inbred lines were used to generate 45 F 1 s. F 1 s and parents were evaluated for agronomic and quality traits across environments. Heterosis was more important for yield-related traits than it was for ear aspects and eating quality. Heterosis for most traits was mostly dependent on dominance genetic effects of parental lines. Parents and F 1 per se performance were highly correlated with general combining ability effects and mid-parent values, respectively, for most traits. Hybrid performance for flavour and plant height was significantly but weakly related to simple sequence repeat (SSR) -based genetic distance (GD).

It {{is assumed to}} follow a power-law relation between a component of displacement discontinuity (whether tensile opening in mode I or shear slippage in modes II or III) and the reduction from peak strength of a corresponding component of stress (normal or shear stress) on the interface. That is, the stress decrease from peak strength, as the interface discontinuity develops, {{is assumed to be}} proportional to displacement-discontinuity to some exponent n> 0. The study is done in the 2 D context of plane or anti-plane strain, for an initially coherent interface which is subjected to a locally peaked "loading " stress which increases quasi-statically in time. We seek to establish the instability point, when no further quasi-static solution exists for growth of the ruptured zone along the interface, so that dynamic rupture ensues. We have previously addressed the case of linear displacement-weakening (n = 1), and proven the remarkable result that for an unbounded <b>solid,</b> the <b>length</b> of the displacement-weakening zone along the interface at instability is universal, in the sense of being independent of the detailed spatial distribution of the locally peaked loading stress.

Clay pot or porous pipe is a traditional sub-irrigation method and is ideal for many farms in the world’s dry land with small and medium sized farms and gardens and is still used limitedly in dry lands of India, Iran, Pakistan, the Middle East, and Latin-America. Clay capsule is one of porous pipes in sub irrigation that is able to release water in near root zone with self- regulative capacity. Watering occurs only in amounts that the plants actually need (this amount is equal to field capacity) and released water in near root zone without electricity or use of an automatic dispenser. Materials and Methods: A study was carried out in 2013 on the experimental field of agriculture faculty of Tarbiat Modares University, to study the effect of two irrigation types on qualitative and quantitative characters in grape production (Vitis vinifera L.). In order to provide the water requirement of grape plant were used porous clay capsules for sub irrigation with height and diameter of 12 cm and 3. 5 cm and dripper with Neta film type for drip irrigation, respectively. Porous clay capsules provided from soil science group at Tarbiat Modares University. In this research, the volume of water delivered to grape plants during entire growth period in two different irrigation methods was measured separately with water-meters installed at all laterals. The water consumption, yield production and water use efficiency were evaluated and compared in two drip and porous clay irrigation systems at veraison phonological stages.

This method can impose large effective deformations through uniform shear strain. Aluminum alloy 6061 powder is used as a test material in an effort to determine some optimal conditions for this process and its applications to powder metallurgy. Copper billets were filled with powder that was either uncompacted, precompacted 75 - 80 % of theoretical density in the billet, or precompacted into individual discs 75 - 80 % dense. Biflet geometry was also a test factor, with hole diameter being either 1 / 2 " or 3 / 4 ", and <b>solid</b> end zone <b>length</b> varying from 1 / 2 " to 1 1 / 2 ". billets are half extruded, with one half having been exposed to compaction and shear, and one half undergoing compaction only.

Maximum density achieved through compaction alone was 2. 57 g/cm 3, whereas compaction and shear produced samples with full or near-fuh density, 2. 70 g/cm 3.
