50|$|Sentech is the <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> for the South African {{broadcasting}} sector. The organisation began {{operations in}} 1992 as the <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Sentech's mandate also included {{providing services to}} M-Net, Radio 702, Radio Ciskei, Radio Transkei and the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E
50|$|The FM {{signal is}} beamed via STL from the Jacaranda Broadcast Centre in Centurion and carried on 22 {{transmitters}} broadcasting on frequencies ranging from 93.9 - 97.1 MHz. These transmitters are operated by South Africa's state-owned broadcast <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> Sentech.|$|E
50|$|Radio and TV {{broadcasting}} in Pretoria {{is supplied}} via {{a network of}} VHF/FM and UHF transmitters and repeaters {{owned and operated by}} Sentech - South Africa's state-owned broadcast <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> - from four transmitter sites in and around the city. A number of community radio stations operate transmitters from non-Sentech sites.|$|E

50|$|The {{computer}} controlled the magnetic latching relays by <b>Signal</b> <b>Distributors</b> (SD) packaged in the Universal Trunk frames, Junctor frames, or in Miscellaneous Trunk frames, {{according to which}} they were numbered as USD, JSD or MSD. SD were originally contact trees of 30-contact wire spring relays, each driven by a flipflop. Each magnetic latching relay had one transfer contact dedicated to sending a pulse back to the SD, on each operate and release. The pulser in the SD detected this pulse to determine that the action had occurred, or else alerted the maintenance software to print a FSCAN report. In later 1AESS versions SD were solid state with several SD points per circuit pack generally on the same shelf or adjacent shelf to the trunk pack.|$|R

A very high percentage of Swiss viewers receive their <b>signals</b> via cable <b>distributors.</b> By 2012 40% of cable viewers had switched to digital. Analog cable was switched off on 1 January 2017.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 August 2008, the Department of Communications {{announced}} its Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy. The policy will govern the switchover from analogue to digital transmission, and {{states that the}} Department will provide funding to the national <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> Sentech to begin the migration process according to the published timetable. The timetable is phased as follows which is a delay of 4 years from the original one proposed: ...|$|E
50|$|The Joint SADIBA/NAB Digital Radio DAB+ Trial Working group's {{application}} for a high-powered DAB+ trial licence has been approved. The trial licence was granted to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (the applicant {{on behalf of the}} NAB radio members) by the regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). The trial will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, and Sentech will be the <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> {{for the duration of the}} trial.|$|E
50|$|The first {{transmission}} took place 22 December 1961. Presently Sentech broadcasts 18 FM programs and 7 TV stations. Backup {{power to the}} tower is 1MW using two 500 kVa Volvo Generators. Towards 2001, naming rights for the tower were sold to Sentech, the TV and radio <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> in South Africa that {{is owned by the}} South African Government. Up until 1982, an observation deck affording panoramic views of the city was open to the public, but was closed due to rising fears of insurgent fighting by South African anti-Apartheid activists. The tower viewing deck has not re-opened to the public since then.|$|E
50|$|The antenna {{couplers}} {{provide the}} proper impedance for radio frequency and {{ground support equipment}} commands. The command receivers are tuned to RSS command frequencies and provide the input <b>signal</b> to the <b>distributors</b> when an RSS command is sent. The command decoders use a code plug to prevent any command signal other than the proper command signal from getting into the distributors. The distributors contain the logic to supply valid destruct commands to the RSS pyrotechnics.|$|R
50|$|Stored-program analog {{switches}} {{such as the}} 1ESS switch, {{had both}} simple wire junctors and circuit junctors. Circuit junctors were {{in the form of}} plug-in circuit boards to provide talk battery and supervision for intraoffice calls and were closely similar to intraoffice trunk packs, with two scan points and two <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> points per circuit, two circuits per plug-in pack. Wire junctors were two-wire connections between trunk nets and other trunk nets or line nets. When three-way calling was introduced, three-port conference trunks were used, which only appeared on trunk nets. All junctors appeared in subgroups of sixteen on plugs or jacks at the Junctor Grouping Frame, where as many subgroups as required were plugged into other trunk nets, line nets, or circuit junctor frames.|$|E
50|$|Supervision and trunk {{signalling}} {{were the}} responsibility of trunk circuits. The most common kinds (reverse battery one-way trunks) were in plug-in trunk packs, two trunks per pack, 128 packs per Trunk Frame (originally) on 16 shelves. Each trunk pack was originally about 3x5x8 inches (8x12x20 cm) with edge connector in the back. The later 1AESS were made with shorter wire spring relays, making them less than half as wide, with more complex leaf spring connector. Trunk Frames were in pairs, the even numbered one having the <b>Signal</b> <b>Distributor</b> to control the relays in both. Most trunks had three wire spring relays and two scan points. They could supply regular battery or reverse battery to a line, and on-hook or off-hook supervision to the distant end, or be put into a bypass state allowing all functions (usually sending and receiving address signals) to be performed by common control circuits such as digit transmitters and receivers. Slightly more complex trunks, for example those going to TSPS offices for operator control, were packaged as only one per plugin unit.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a distributed amplifier IC module and a distributed 1 : 2 <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> IC module for 40 Gbit /s optical transmission systems. These ICs {{were designed by}} the distributed circuit and inverted-microstrip-line design technique and fabricated using 0. 1 -m-gate-length GaAs MESFETs with a multilayer interconnection structure. These were mounted on a thin film multilayer substrate in a chip-size-cavity package {{by means of a}} flip-chip-bonding technique that uses transferred microsolder bumps. The amplifier module achieved a 3 -dB bandwidth of more than 50 GHz and a gain of 8 dB. The 3 -dB bandwidth of a 1 : 2 <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> module was 40 GHz and the loss was 2 dB. These modules were demonstrated at 40 Gbit/s and clear eye openings were confirmed...|$|E
40|$|DNA repair {{pathways}} enable tumour {{cells to}} survive DNA damage induced by external agents such as therapeutic treatments. Signalling cascades {{involved in these}} pathways comprise the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad 3 related (ATR) and checkpoint kinases I and 2 (Chk 1 /Chk 2), among others. ATM and ATR phosphorylate, respectively, Chk 2 and Chk 1, leading to activation of checkpoints. Chk 2 acts as a <b>signal</b> <b>distributor,</b> dispersing checkpoint signal to downstream targets such as p 53, Cdc 25 A, Cdc 25 C, BRCA 1 and E 2 F 1. A role of Chk 2 as a candidate tumour suppressor has been suggested based on both mouse genetics and somatic tumour studies. We will discuss here the possible role of this kinase in human carcinogenesis and the possibility {{to use it as}} a target to increment DNA damage in cancer cells in response to DNA-damaging therapies. Supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Pfizer. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. Sentech is {{the largest}} {{broadcasting}} <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> in Africa. The advent of Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) in South Africa has provided Sentech {{with the opportunity to}} roll out a state of the art digital terrestrial network, a first in Africa. The decision to invest in DAB and roll out the network is however fraught with possible pitfalls. Forecasting the demand for DAB as well as any pitfalls is extremely important and requires a thorough understanding of the intended technology and the implications on the broadcasting fraternity. A suitable forecasting technique has to be applied to gain as much insight into DAB's implementation. The Delphi technique is a proven method of determining the expert opinion of a number of experts without any interference between participants. The Delphi technique was used to obtain the expert opinion of six Sentech personnel members that are closely involved with DAB. This research contained in this dissertation suggests a framework for Sentech to employ to approach the investment decision in DAB in South Africa, based on the expert opinion of Sentech personnel members...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 Sentech is {{the common}} carrier <b>signal</b> <b>distributor</b> in South Africa for Television and Radio programs. This radio {{telephone}} system {{is used by the}} company as a communications link for voice and data between remote transmitter sites and the Transmitter Control Centre. The system was installed in 1986 and consists of a mixture of fixed bases and mobile units. The location of these transmitting sites is mainly on top of mountains in remote, sparsely populated areas. The use of cellular telephones for communication is impossible, as 80 % of the sites fall outside the coverage area of the cells. Telkom infrastructure in these areas is most of the time not available or consists of shared farm lines. Only in the big metropolitan centres can data lines be considered at the main sites. It is not cost effective to consider it for the small sites. When the new system was installed, it replaced a single repeater system that relayed VHF radio signals from as far as 200 Km. The new system was a major improvement over the old system. Within a year it became apparent that it did not fulfill in all the needs of the company. A telephone-patch and two-tone cell call was added to increase the functionality. Data transfer and call-out systems were added to implement the new telemetry system to the sites. When the old handhelds became unreliable and the new units only use DTMF signalling, it became apparent that the system had to be upgraded...|$|E
