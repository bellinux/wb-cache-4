5|$|As the Japanese {{extended}} their territorial holdings, shrines were constructed {{with the purpose}} of hosting Japanese kami in occupied lands. This practice began with Naminoue <b>Shrine</b> in Okinawa in 1890. Major shrines built across Asia included Karafuto <b>Shrine</b> in Sakhalin in 1910 and Chosen <b>Shrine,</b> Korea, in 1919; these shrines were designated just under Ise <b>Shrine</b> in national importance. Other shrines included Shonan <b>Shrine</b> in Singapore, San'a <b>Shrine</b> in Hainan Island (China), Okinawa <b>Shrine</b> in Shuri, Okinawa, Akatsuki <b>Shrine</b> in Saigon, and Hokoku <b>Shrine</b> in Java.|$|E

His power to curse is carried out in secret outside the Main Kataragama deviyo <b>shrine</b> at a place at the Menik Ganga, where he receives animal sacrifices. Katagama devio is also directly invoked in sorcery practices.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the top of}} {{the ravine}} from Cave 1 on the other Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a <b>shrine</b> and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central <b>shrine</b> has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga <b>shrine</b> on the island.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 8th {{century as}} {{architectural}} styles evolved, new elements were added as is evident in kasuga-zukuri (Kasuga <b>Shrine</b> and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at Enjō-ji), the flowing roof or nagare-zukuri (Shimogamo <b>Shrine),</b> hachiman-zukuri (Usa <b>Shrine)</b> and hiyoshi-zukuri (Hiyoshi Taisha). The nagare-zukuri continues to be the more popular style, followed by the kasuga-zukuri. The honden of Ujigami <b>Shrine</b> dates to this period. At {{the end of the}} Heian period torii and fences were commonly replaced with two-storied gates and grand colonnades copied from temple architecture. The influence of the residential shinden-zukuri style of palaces and mansions is apparent in shrines such as Itsukushima <b>Shrine.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1940, {{the state}} created the wartime <b>shrine</b> board, which {{expanded}} control over state shrines and expanded the state's role. Up to that point, individual priests had been {{limited in their}} political roles, delegated to certain rituals and <b>shrine</b> upkeep, and rarely encouraged Emperor worship, or other aspects of state ideology, independently. No <b>shrine</b> priest, or member of the Wartime <b>Shrine</b> board, had previously sought public office, which some scholars, such as Sakamoto, suggest is evidence of the state's use of Shinto to its own ends, rather than the Shinto priest's attempt to achieve political power.|$|E

5|$|There are {{number of}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} origin of the <b>shrine.</b> According to Heinz Bechert and Paul Younger, the mode of veneration and rituals connected with Kataragama deviyo is a survival of indigenous Vedda mode of veneration that preceded the arrival of Buddhist and Indo-Aryan cultural influences from North India in Sri Lanka in the last centuries BCE, although Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims have tried to co-opt the deity, rituals and the <b>shrine.</b> But according to S. Pathmanathan, the original Kataragama <b>shrine</b> was established as an adjunct guardian deity <b>shrine</b> to Skanda-Kumara within a Buddhist temple complex. This particular <b>shrine</b> then became idealized as the very spot where Valli met Murukan amongst local Tamils and Sinhalese, and Kataragama deviyo subsumed the identity of Skanda-Kumara and became a deity on his own right with rituals and pilgrimage. According to Pathmanathan, it happened after the 13th century CE when Murukan became popular amongst Tamils and before the 15th century CE when the poet Arunagirinathar identified the very location as a sacred spot.|$|E
