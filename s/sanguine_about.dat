5|$|On 24 June, Morris {{ordered the}} 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese {{landed in the}} Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company {{advancing}} along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move {{and most of it}} had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was <b>sanguine</b> <b>about</b> this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not so sure, and ordered Major General Arthur Allen's 7th Division to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 January, Berryman met with Allen, Jerram and Frowen at Allen's headquarters at Post 40 to discuss plans for the next day. It was agreed that Allen would advance on Bardia and cut the fortress in two, supported by Frowen's guns, every available tank, MacArthur-Onslow's Bren gun carriers and the 2/8th Infantry Battalion, which Mackay had recently allocated from reserve. Allen gave orders accordingly. During {{the afternoon}} the 6th Cavalry Regiment was pulled back to become the brigade reserve and the 2/5th Infantry Battalion relieved the 2/2nd to free it to advance the next day. That evening, Berryman {{came to the conclusion}} that unless the Italian defence collapsed soon, the 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades would become incapable of further effort and Brigadier Horace Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade would be required. Mackay was more <b>sanguine</b> <b>about</b> the situation, and reminded Berryman that his orders had been to capture Bardia with only two brigades. While they were discussing the matter, O'Connor and Harding arrived at 6th Division headquarters, and O'Connor readily agreed to the change of plan.|$|E
25|$|During the lead-up to Alberta's 1905 {{creation}} as a province, Stuart {{was initially}} {{critical of the}} terms imposed by the Liberal federal government of Wilfrid Laurier; these terms kept control of natural resources, which was held by the provincial governments of the older provinces, under federal control. Stuart was a Liberal, however, and he eventually joined his party in defending these terms. He was less <b>sanguine</b> <b>about</b> Alberta's new electoral boundaries, which disproportionately favoured the province's north, and about the Liberals' policy of fixing Calgary's rival Edmonton as the interim provincial capital, with the first legislature to make the final decision—he felt that the issue should be put to {{a vote in the}} first provincial election. He lost both of these fights, and once again loyally adhered to his party's program.|$|E
5000|$|The year 1870 {{opened with}} a step toward {{national}} sovereignty, as Carol approved {{the creation of a}} national currency, the Romanian leu. Unlike Hasdeu's liberals, Românul and Trompeta Carpaților were supporters of the measure, although Carada made <b>sanguine</b> comments <b>about</b> the [...] "feudal" [...] coinage inscription ("Lord of the Romanians") and the conspicuous absence of senators from the royal ceremony. Titus Dunka, who had settled to a quiet life in Romania, became a correspondent of both Românul and Ghimpele. D.

2500|$|By the mid-eighteenth century, {{the ruler}} of the {{recently}} established Jat kingdom of Bharatpur, Raja Surajmal, felt <b>sanguine</b> enough <b>about</b> durability to build a garden palace at nearby Dig (Deeg). Although, the palace, Gopal Bhavan, was named for Lord Krishna, its domes, arches, and garden were evocative of Mughal architecture, a reflection ultimately of how much these new rulers—aspiring dynasts all—were products of the Mughal epoch. In another nod to the Mughal legacy, in the 1750s, Surajmal removed his own Jat brethren from positions of power {{and replaced them with}} a contingent of Mughal revenue officials [...] from Delhi who proceeded to implement the Mughal scheme of collecting land-rent.|$|R

" It concludes with an analysis of recent moves by scholars to develop a framework for more systematic and balanced analysis of EFP that is less dependent on single explanations and normative assumptions. This essay begins with a brief review of policy developments which provides a sober backdrop to the theoretical problematique which follows. It ends on a more <b>sanguine</b> note <b>about</b> the potential for progress in conceptual thinking than would have been thought possible a short time ago...|$|R

[...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was saying things like, 'What are you doing here? Go home!

Jack Cowart, executive director of the Lichtenstein Foundation, contests the notion that Lichtenstein was a copyist, saying: [...] "Roy's work was a wonderment of the graphic formulae and the codification of sentiment that had been worked out by others.

A cadre of scholars has worked on conceptualizing the European Union as an international actor, but explanations are still at the pre-theoretical stage. Although theorists are developing new and reworking old explanatory concepts, these concepts are not linked in any meaningful way to an overall analytical model. The article begins on a sober note concerning {{the problems associated with}} conceptualizing European Union external identity but ends on a more <b>sanguine</b> one <b>about</b> the potential for progress not thought possible a short time ago. Scholars are developing explanatory concepts more balanced, rounded, finessed, and nuanced than those of their predecessors, and they are moving beyond establishing the existence of EFP to assessing the outcomes of EFP...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between religion and}} politics, between church and state, has been a well rehearsed issue in Muslim thought and practice, because Islam emerged fully into history as a dual tradition of church and state, and because as such Muslims have been less <b>sanguine</b> than Europeans <b>about</b> making a rigid separation between the secular and the sacred, or {{between the public and}} private domain. By virtue of such history and by reason of the subsequent Western secular expansion in the Muslim world, there is widespread reaction to the legitimacy of national secular governments among contemporary Muslims.

40|$|Who {{has power}} in the {{construction}} of economic news in the UK? Are social media reshaping how this power is enabled? We examine the public Twitter interactions between journalists, political elites, and what is arguably the UK’s most important think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), during the 2015 UK general election campaign. Combining human-coded content analysis and network analysis of Twitter discourse about the IFS during a 38 -day period, we explain how and why the authority of this think tank is being translated to social media. We develop a new, social media theory of ‘primary definers’ and show how the political authority on which such roles rest is co-constructed and propagated by professional journalists and political elites. Central to this process is a behaviour we conceptualize and measure: authority signalling. Our findings call into question some of the more <b>sanguine</b> generalizations <b>about</b> social media’s contribution to pluralist democracy. Given the dominance of public service broadcasters in the processes we identify, we argue that, despite the growth of social media, there can be surprising limits {{on the extent to which}} contemporary media systems help citizens gain information about the assumptions underlying economic policy...|$|R
40|$|When Aid to Families with Dependent Children was {{replaced}} by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a main argument for adopting a block grant rather than an entitlement was that states should have leeway {{to decide how to}} structure their welfare programs. Advocates of devolution argued that states could accomplish more with less money if they were not constrained by federal requirements. States could identify their most important problems {{and figure out how to}} mitigate them by devising solutions pertinent to their own communities and economic conditions. Devolution would thus allow states to achieve responsive government and policy innovation. Opponents were not <b>sanguine,</b> however, <b>about</b> the possibility that states would meet these expectations. Concerned about incentives for supplantation, they feared states might use federal funds to replace rather than buttress state funding for social welfare policies. Moreover, many state governments had a reputation of poorly representing disadvantaged populations, and these would most likely have little interest in searching for new ways to reduce poverty. Also, even if states wanted to pursue creative policies, few had the resources or the administrative capacity necessary for policy innovation...|$|R

2500|$|This {{rapid rise}} made Fleetwood-Smith a {{prospect}} for the Test team in 193233 when England toured {{and played the}} famous Bodyline series. However, in Ironmonger, Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, the Australian team possessed a strong spin bowling attack and Fleetwood-Smith needed to supplant one of the trio to gain selection. Although he took 50 first-class wickets for the season (at 21.90 average, including 9/36 in an innings against Tasmania), his bowling received rough treatment from Don Bradman in a match against New South Wales. In the tour match against England that followed, Wally Hammond was given specific instructions to attack the inexperienced Fleetwood-Smith and remove him from consideration for the Test matches, which he accomplished during an innings of 203. The England manager, Plum Warner, later wrote that too much attention was given to this performance and he was <b>sanguine</b> <b>about</b> Fleetwood-Smith's potential as a Test bowler.

Though {{he and his staff}} inherited two players that would play central roles on his most successful Texas teams in freshman forward and Los Angeles high school player of the year Ron Baxter and sophomore Auburn transfer Jim Krivacs, Lemons was nevertheless assuming control of a moribund program coming off of three consecutive losing seasons, the last of which featured the then-third-most defeats {{in the history of the}} program.

Despite Lemons' dejected mood following the final game of the season, a loss to Baylor in the final men's basketball game in Gregory Gymnasium, his first team had posted a four-game improvement in its season record over the 9–17 squad of the prior year, finishing 13–13 on the season.|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} half of this decade, the belief that new {{financial}} products would adequately shield investors from risk encouraged financial flows to less creditworthy households and businesses. By late 2006, U.

Then, conditions changed abruptly. In the important and usually stable market for asset-backed commercial paper, premiums on three-month paper over Treasury bills jumped from 0. 17 percentage point in February 2007 to 2. 15 points in August. Meanwhile, rising subprime mortgage defaults led investors to abandon their <b>sanguine</b> beliefs <b>about</b> the risk of many mortgage and nonmortgage products.; The backdrop for these events was a period of macroeconomic stability that fed complacency about risk.

This Article argues that the 9 / 11 Commission represents an important institutional model for encouraging or forcing the Executive Branch to disclose information about an especially significant and controversial past event or future decision. It suggests that Congress or the President consider establishing such commissions when information held by the Executive Branch can help the public to hold the state accountable for past actions or decide whether to support important, irreversible decisions the state must imminently make. The 9 / 11 Commission demonstrates that transparency can be better achieved in a time of crisis through institutional design than through constitutional common law and statute. The Article is less <b>sanguine,</b> however, <b>about</b> the 9 / 11 Commission as a model for policy formation. With limited accountability and relative independence from the political branches, an ad hoc, independent institution can make errors or misjudgments that can in turn have undue influence over the legislative process. Congress or the President should therefore limit the legal authority granted to investigative advisory commissions established during times of crisis so that political actors can fully deliberate over their prescriptions...|$|R
