In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact <b>sheets</b> <b>on</b> nuclear policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. In practice, no real changes {{since the end of the}} Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and as Cold War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force. Additionally, no changes were made to Alliance nuclear policy since the 1999 Strategic Concept.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Eline struck Madagascar, the {{government}} began distributing relief items, such as rice, tents, and <b>sheets.</b> <b>On</b> February 21, survey flights helped indicate the extent of damage across the nation. Supplies were distributed by road from Antananarivo to the worst affected areas, with helicopters dropping off aid to isolated communities. After receiving request from the Malagasy government, UNICEF flew 15 tons of supplies from Copenhagen, such as medicine, 10.5 tons of food, and equipment to help coordinate relief work. The agency also transported thousands of blankets and water purification tablets from Antananarivo. However, UNICEF faced difficulties in distributing the supplies. The government of France sent two helicopters with teams of doctors to Madagascar, and Médecins Sans Frontières sent about 35 tons of supplies, such as medicine, water purifying devices, and food. The World Food Programme flew about 400 tons of food to affected residents across the country, including 25 tons to Mahanoro. Due to the combined impacts of Eline and Gloria, {{the government}} of Madagascar requested for international assistance on March 7, which was coordinated through the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In response, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom donated £1.3 million ($1.9 million USD) to Madagascar. The Organisation of African Unity donated $200,000 to Madagascar on March 10. In addition to Cyclone Gloria striking the country in March, Cyclone Hudah hit eastern Madagascar in early April, causing additional deaths and damage.|$|E

25|$|Hemispheric {{asynchrony}} in {{ice sheet}} behavior {{has been observed}} by linking short-term spikes of methane in Greenland ice cores and Antarctic ice cores. During Dansgaard–Oeschger events, the northern hemisphere warmed considerably, dramatically increasing the release of methane from wetlands, that were otherwise tundra during glacial times. This methane quickly distributes evenly across the globe, becoming incorporated in Antarctic and Greenland ice. With this tie, paleoclimatologists {{have been able to}} say that the ice <b>sheets</b> <b>on</b> Greenland only began to warm after the Antarctic ice sheet had been warming for several thousand years.

And if I were to draw balance <b>sheets</b> <b>on</b> where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
25|$|Two former {{employees}} of Toyō Itō, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa formed a collaborative partnership in 1995 called SANAA. They {{are known for}} creating lightweight, transparent spaces that expose the fluidity and movement of their occupants. Their Dior store in Shibuya, Tōkyō, in 2001 was reminiscent of Itō's Mediatheque, with cool white acrylic <b>sheets</b> <b>on</b> the external facade that filter the light and partially reveal the store's contents. Their dynamic of fluidity is demonstrated by the Rolex Learning Centre at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, completed in 2010. This building has an undulating floor plane set under a continuous concrete shell roof that was poured in one go over two days. The plan is like a biological cell punctuated with tables and courtyards alike. In 2009 they designed the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London that comprised a reflective, floating aluminium roof supported by slender columns.|$|E
25|$|Nationally, {{chapters}} of all fraternities existing {{at the start}} of the new century were wooed into increasingly expansive building projects in the boom years leading up to the Great Depression. The economic downturn became the great leveler; chapters who had extended themselves beyond their means were felled by sharply reduced revenues and growing debt. Within Phi Sig, closely tied as it was to its graduates, alumni were called in to support weakened balance <b>sheets</b> <b>on</b> buildings the undergraduate population alone could no longer afford. In one famous but probably not unique case, chapter advisor Sam Gale went door to door in 1931, successfully seeking alumni backing against the mortgage of Minnesota's newly built Tudor masterpiece. Not only was this impulse acted on at the alumni level: The Fraternity's undergraduate delegates, moved by the plight of their brethren, had fathered a plan at the 1930 Convention that channeled 25 cents each month from each active member (about $10 per month, per man, in 2013 dollars) into a fund to assist chapters stricken by the Depression; the principal of mutual helpfulness could not have been better illustrated. Low manpower, too, had brought about fraternal belt-tightening where possible, while still investing in tactical, significant national services - training in rushing techniques, a pledge manual, better accounting systems and visits by field representatives.|$|E

500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] is a {{performance}} piece, {{inspired by the}} title sequence from David Fincher's 1995 movie Se7en.

Bayer cut the film into pieces, and soaked it in his bath, applying deliberate fingerprints and abrasions to the footage before putting it back together by hand. Vig would compliment the video for mirroring the band's sound: [...] "some of it looked beautiful, some of it looked distorted, and kinda fucked up - and it sorta described some of our music visually". Bayer later re-edited a second version of the video, with alternative footage from the original shoot for a remix version of [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] by Todd Terry.|$|E

500|$|For {{the fourth}} round Manchester City were drawn against League One Notts County at Meadow Lane. On a pitch {{described}} by the BBC as [...] "pudding-like", lower division County threatened an upset when Neal Bishop scored from a corner in the 59th minute. However, ten minutes from time Micah Richards crossed for Edin Džeko to score his first Manchester City goal, ensuring a replay at the City of Manchester Stadium. Notts County started the rematch brightly, but faded as the game progressed. The score remained 0–0 {{for most of the}} first half, but Vieira scored either side of half-time to give Manchester City a two-goal lead. From that point, the match proved less even, and Manchester City scored three more goals for a 5–0 win. From there on, City kept consecutive clean <b>sheets</b> <b>on</b> the way to winning the cup. Manchester City's fifth round match was against Aston Villa at the City of Manchester Stadium. Villa manager Gérard Houllier rested several senior players, in contrast to a near full-strength Manchester City line-up. Manchester City took the lead after less than five minutes through Yaya Touré, and further goals from Mario Balotelli and David Silva resulted in a comfortable 3–0 win.|$|E
500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad."
