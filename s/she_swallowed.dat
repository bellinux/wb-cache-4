25|$|An injured Pritilata {{was trapped}} by the British police. <b>She</b> <b>swallowed</b> cyanide to avoid getting arrested. The next day, the police found her body and {{identified}} her. On searching her dead body, the police found a few leaflets, photograph of Ramkrishna Biswas, bullets, whistle and the draft of their plan of attack. During the post-mortem {{it was found that}} the bullet injury was not very serious and that cyanide poisoning was the cause of her death.|$|E
25|$|After her husband's death, Laura Upthegrove {{lived under}} an assumed name in western Florida for a time. In {{the next two}} years, she was arrested on several {{occasions}} before eventually opening a gas station at Canal Point on Lake Okeechobee. She later {{moved in with her}} mother in Upthegrove Beach. On August 6, 1927, she died during an argument with a man trying to buy moonshine from her. In the heat of the moment, <b>she</b> <b>swallowed</b> a bottle of disinfectant and died within minutes. It is unclear whether it was an accident, as some claim she mistook it for a bottle of gin, but it was widely reported that she had committed suicide. She was 30 years old.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ancient}} past, {{there was a}} hero named Hou Yi who was {{excellent}} at archery. His wife was Chang'e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi {{did not want to}} leave Chang'e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. But Peng Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead, <b>she</b> <b>swallowed</b> it and flew into the sky. Since she loved very much her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.|$|E

2500|$|Crying {{and with}} compassion, {{she began to}} think about the {{foreskin}} of Christ, where it may be located [...] And behold, soon she felt with the greatest sweetness on her tongue a little piece of skin alike the skin in an egg, which <b>she</b> <b>swallowed.</b> After she had swallowed it, she again felt the little skin on her tongue with sweetness as before, and again <b>she</b> <b>swallowed</b> it. And this happened to her about a hundred times. And when she felt it so frequently, she was tempted to touch it with her finger. And when she wanted to do so, that little skin went down her throat on its own. And it was told to her that the foreskin was resurrected with the Lord on the day of resurrection. And so great was the sweetness of tasting that little skin that she felt in all [...] limbs and parts of the limbs a sweet transformation.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} cases where {{swallowing}} gum {{has resulted in}} complications requiring medical attention. A 1998 paper describes a four-year-old boy being referred with a two-year history of constipation. The boy {{was found to have}} [...] "always swallowed his gum after chewing five to seven pieces each day", being given the gum as a reward for good behavior, and the build-up resulted in a solid mass which could not leave the body. A 1½-year-old girl required medical attention when <b>she</b> <b>swallowed</b> her gum and four coins, which got stuck together in her esophagus. A bezoar is formed in the stomach when food or other foreign objects stick to gum and build up, causing intestinal blockage. As long as the mass of gum is small enough to pass out of the stomach, it will likely pass out of the body easily, but it is recommended that gum not be swallowed or given to young children who do not understand not to swallow it.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{already noted}} the {{importance}} of a woman's immunological tolerance to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things better when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if <b>she</b> <b>swallowed</b> her partner's semen. A team from the University of Adelaide has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in miscarriage or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as TGF-Beta. The team has found that certain men, dubbed [...] "dangerous males", are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or miscarriage. Among other things, most of the [...] "dangerous males" [...] seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce immunological tolerance in their partners.|$|E
