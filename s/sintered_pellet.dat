While the fully dense (99 %) and perfectly textured ceramics prepared by the free-edge SPS of a pellet from just-compacted powder had a ZT of 0. 17, the highest ZT of 0. 31 was obtained for the free-edge cold-pressed and annealed ceramics with modest texturing and low density (65 %), having a very low κ of 0. 47 W/mK.

40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC) in South Africa holds {{approximately}} {{three quarters of}} the world’s viable chromite ore deposits. Most chromite is used for the production of ferrochromium (FeCr), which is a relatively crude alloy. Several chromite seams exist in the BIC. The most economically viable seams are the lower group 6 (LG 6), the middle group 1 and 2 (MG 1 and 2) and the upper group 2 (UG 2) seams. The LG and MG seams are exploited specifically for their chromium content, whereas the UG 2 seam is mainly exploited for platinum group minerals (PGM). However, the upgraded UG 2 chromite in the PGM tailing is increasingly being used as a feedstock for FeCr production. Many different process variations exist for FeCr production. However, the process option applied in most green and brown field FeCr expansion projects during the last two decades in South Africa has been the oxidative sintered process (also referred to as the Outotec or Outokumpu process). Notwithstanding the common application of the oxidative sintered pelletised feed technology in the South African FeCr industry, and the increased utilisation of beneficiated UG 2 ore, a direct comparison of the physical properties of oxidative <b>sintered</b> <b>pellets</b> produced from UG 2 with the physical properties of that produced with conventional metallurgical grade chromite ore is currently lacking in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Therefore, the physical properties of oxidative <b>sintered</b> <b>pellets</b> produced from a typical beneficiated South African UG 2 ore were compared with the physical properties of that produced with conventional South African metallurgical grade chromite ore in this study. The results indicated that the case study metallurgical grade chromite ore required 13 kWh/t more energy to mill than the case study UG 2 ore prior to pelletisation, which can lead to substantial cost savings. The compressive strength of the oxidative <b>sintered</b> <b>pellets</b> of both case study ores statistically showed that oxidative <b>sintered</b> <b>pellets</b> made from UG 2 ore Abstract were the same or better than those prepared from metallurgical grade chromite ore. A comparison of the abrasion strengths of the oxidative <b>sintered</b> <b>pellets</b> of both case study ores indicated that the pellets prepared from UG 2 ore were superior compared to the metallurgical grade pellets. The reasons for the superior UG 2 pellet strength were investigated with backscatter-, secondary electron- and elemental X-ray mapping scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which indicated that differences in crystalline structures at least partially contributed to the differences observed.

40|$|The actual {{tendency}} {{all over}} the world is to manufacture fuel bundles capable to resist high burn-up. The factors affecting the burn-up increase are: the pellet-cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI), the oxidation and hydriding of the Zircaloy- 4 sheath, the increase of internal pressure, stress corrosion cracking, Zircaloy- 4 irradiation growth, fuel swelling. A way to increase fuel burn-up is to diminish the elements internal pressure by adequate UO 2 fuel pellet structure (large grain or controlled closed porosity), hi the large grain size UO 2 pellets, fission gas release rate decreases and the elements internal pressure increase slowly. Similarly, in the UO 2 <b>sintered</b> <b>pellet</b> with controlled closed porosity the fission gas accommodation is better and the elements internal pressure increases slowly.
