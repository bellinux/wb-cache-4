5000|$|Stellar {{chemistry}} {{is the study}} of the chemical composition of astronomical objects; stars in particular, hence the name stellar chemistry. The significance of stellar chemical composition is an open ended question at this point. Some research asserts that a greater abundance of certain elements (such as carbon, sodium, silicon, and magnesium) in the stellar mass are necessary for a star's inner solar system to be habitable over long periods of time. [...] The hypothesis being that the [...] "abundance of these elements make the star cooler and cause it to evolve more slowly, thereby giving planets in its habitable zone more time to develop life as we know it." [...] <b>Stellar</b> <b>abundance</b> of oxygen also appears to be critical to the length of time newly developed planets exist in a habitable zone around their host star. [...] Researchers postulate that if our own sun had a lower abundance of oxygen, the Earth would have ceased to [...] "live" [...] in a habitable zone a billion years ago, long before complex organisms had the opportunity to evolve.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical {{enrichment}} in galaxies: When new hot {{massive stars}} are born they radiate very energetic photons that ionize the remnant parent gaseous nebula {{that has not}} formed stars; this craddle of new stars and ionized gas is known as an HII region. HII regions are very important because they are very luminous, {{so they can be}} used to study the star formation in far away galaxies. Also, their emission line spectrum can be used to computed the chemical abundances of the different atomic elements, thus tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies in their most recent epochs. We have developed new tools to detect and extract the spectroscopic information from HII regions (Sánchez et al., 2012b), building the largest catalog currently available (~10.000 HII regions and aggregations). This catalog has been used to define a new oxygen abundance (the abundance of oxygen is used as a reference in HII regions) calibrator anchored with electron temperature measurements (Marino et al., 2013). From these, we explored the proposed dependence of the Mass-Metallicity relation with the star formation rate (SFR; Sánchez et al., 2013), and the local Mass-Metallicity relation (Rosales-Ortega et al. 2012). We found that all galaxies in our sample present an abundance radial gradient with a common slope (when normalized to the effective radius; Sánchez et al., 2014); this agrees with the proposed inside-out scenario for galaxy growth. This characteristic slope is independent of the properties of the galaxies, and in particular of {{the presence or absence of}} dynamical structures such as stellar bars. This result has been confirmed by the analysis of the <b>stellar</b> <b>abundance</b> gradient in the same sample (Sánchez-Blázquez et al., 2014).|$|E

[Th/Eu] abundance ratios for a sample of 20 disk dwarfs/subgiants of F 5 to G 8 spectral type with - 0. 8 <= [Fe/H] <= + 0. 3, determined in the first paper of this series, were adopted for this analysis. We developed a Galactic chemical evolution model that includes the effect of refuses, which are composed of stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) and low-mass stellar formation residues (terrestrial planets, comets, etc.), contributing to a better fit to observational constraints. Two Galactic disk ages were estimated, by comparing literature data on Th/Eu production and solar abundance ratios to the model ((8. 7 + 5. 8 - 4. 1) Gyr), and by comparing [Th/Eu] vs. [Fe/H] curves from the model to our <b>stellar</b> <b>abundance</b> ratio data ((8. 2 +/- 1. 9) Gyr), yielding the final, average value (8. 3 +/- 1. 8) Gyr.

Planets, however, are made truly habitable by both chemical and physical processes which regulate climatic and geochemical cycling between atmosphere, surface, and interior reservoirs. Despite this, "Earth-like" is often defined as a planet made of a mixture of rock and Fe that is roughly 1 Earth-density. To understand the interior of a terrestrial planet, the <b>stellar</b> <b>abundances</b> of planet-building elements (e. g. Mg, Si, and Fe) can be utilized as a proxy for the planet's composition. We explore the planetary mineralogy and structure for fictive planets around the 10 closest stars to the Sun using <b>stellar</b> <b>abundances</b> from the Hypatia Catalog. Despite our sample containing stars both sub- and super-solar in their abundances, we find that the mineralogies are very similar for all 10 planets [...] since the error or spread in the <b>stellar</b> <b>abundances</b> create significant degeneracy in the models. We show that abundance uncertainties need to be on the order of [Fe/H] < 0. 02 dex, [Si/H] < 0. 01 dex, [Al/H] < 0. 002 dex, while [Mg/H] and [Ca/H] < 0. 001 dex, in order to distinguish two unique planetary populations in our sample of 10 stars. While these precisions are high, we believe they are possible given certain abundance techniques, in addition to methodological transparency, recently demonstrated in the literature. However, without these precisions, the uncertainty in planetary structures will be so high that we will be unable to say confidently that a planet is like the Earth, or unlike anything we've ever seen.

The more massive dwarf (irregular) galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, also have an SNe Ia signature in the <b>stellar</b> <b>abundances.</b> These findings suggest that the condition of whether SNe Ia contribute to chemical evolution in dwarf galaxies is likely to depend on the mass scale of galaxies. Unusual Mg abundances in some dSph stars are also found to be the origin of the large scatter in the [Mg/Fe] ratios and responsible for a seemingly decreasing [Mg/Fe] feature with increasing [Fe/H]. In addition, the lack of massive stars in the dSph galaxies does not satisfactorily account for the low-α signature. Considering the assemblage of deficient elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Zn), all of which are synthesized in pre-SN massive stars and in SN explosions, the low-α signature appears to reflect the heavy-element yields of massive stars with smaller rotation compared to solar neighborhood stars...|$|R
