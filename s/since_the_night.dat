25|$|On {{the morning}} of 23 December, Napoleon {{personally}} observed the Russian position near {{the point where the}} Wkra emptied into the Bug-Narew. Near its mouth, the Wkra split into two branches, forming a low, swampy island. Davout's troops had occupied the island <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 20 December. Davout had three infantry divisions under Generals of Division Charles Antoine Morand, Louis Friant, and Charles-Étienne Gudin de La Sablonnière. Napoleon decided on a night attack and drafted very detailed orders. Because of the high quality of Davout's generals and officers, the emperor's orders were carefully carried out.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 3 Union Cavalry Corps {{commander}} Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton ordered two of his brigades to the left flank of the Union army. He ordered Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's Reserve Brigade of Buford's division to move north from Emmitsburg to join Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's division, moving from Two Taverns on the Baltimore Pike to the area southwest of Round Top. By this time the only brigade in Kilpatrick's division was that of Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth, Custer's brigade having been detached for service with David Gregg at East Cavalry Field. It is unclear what Pleasonton hoped to accomplish. There is no record that he performed any reconnaissance in this area. It has been speculated that Army of the Potomac commander George G. Meade was preparing for a possible counterattack to follow the repulse of Pickett's Charge, which he had anticipated <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> before.|$|E

The lobby is covered in dust and draped with cobwebs, and throughout there are other signs of the hotel's abrupt closure. Past the front desk, the main elevators are in a dilapidated state, and a sign reads [...] "Out of Order". Guests are informed by bellhops that their rooms are not ready yet, and they are then ushered into the hotel library, which houses the hotel's collection of books, antiques, an old television set, and various pieces of Twilight Zone memorabilia scattered about the room. Through the library window, guests can observe a severe thunderstorm raging outside.|$|E
2500|$|A fire (cf. Adur) is an {{effective}} weapon against the dews, and keeping a hearth fire burning is a means to protect the home. The dews are [...] "particularly attracted by the organic productions of human beings, from excretion, reproduction, sex, and death." [...] Prayer and other recitations of the liturgy, in particular the recitation of Yasht 1 (so Sad-dar 57), is effective in keeping the demons at bay. Demons are attracted by chatter at mealtimes and when silence is broken a demon {{takes the place of}} the angel at one's side. According to Shayest-ne-Shayest 9.8, eating at all after nightfall is not advisable <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> is the time of demons. In the 9th century Rivayats (65.14), the demons are described as issuing out at night to wreak mayhem, but forced back into the underworld by the divine glory (khvarenah) at sunrise.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 March, in Punjab, several {{suspected}} terrorists were arrested alongside with firearms with full ammo recovered {{in different parts}} in Lahore, Faisalabad, and Multan. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of 27 March, the army had conducted a military operation for capturing the terrorists. Al Jazeera noted that the bombing [...] "underscored" [...] both the [...] "precarious position" [...] of Pakistan's minorities {{and the fact that}} the fighters from armed groups [...] "are still capable of staging wide-scale assaults despite the months-long military offensive targeting their hideouts and safe havens in remote tribal areas". On 29 March, Pakistani authorities conducted a counter terror operation with more than 5,000 questioned, and more than 200 suspects detained. Anonymous government and security sources told Reuters that a decision has been made to launch a full-scale crackdown on Islamist militants in Punjab, which may involve the paramilitary Rangers, who have been operating in Karachi for the last two years.|$|E

However, in the season 6 finale [...] "The Bon Voyage Reaction", Lucy feels too pressured by Raj to meet his friends, and a dinner between Lucy, Raj, and Amy does not go well. Raj apologizes for his behavior and asks Lucy to come to Leonard's goodbye party before his departure for the North Sea on Professor Stephen Hawking's expedition. However, Lucy text messages him at the party saying {{she will not be}} there and does not want to see him again. [...] The next day, Penny goes to comfort a heartbroken Raj, who thinks he is completely unlovable.

2500|$|After declaring {{he would}} be [...] "popping in from time to time" [...] afterwards, Sting threw the {{microphone}} down and left the ring. Days after the infamous promo, he was booked for shows in New Japan Pro Wrestling, {{to take part in}} the Japan/U.S. Superstars Tournament, where he defeated Masahiro Chono in the first round, but was eliminated in the second round by Shiro Koshinaka. His last match of 1996 took place on September 23 at the Yokohama Arena, where he and Lex Luger teamed up to defeat Arn Anderson and Steven Regal. It would end up being his last tour of Japan. On the October 21, 1996, edition of Nitro, Sting returned for the first time <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> after Fall Brawl. In a match where the impostor Sting was wrestling Mr. JL, Sting emerged wearing a trench coat and white face paint with black marks around his eyes. He went in the ring and attacked nWo Sting (who was still imitating Sting's old mannerisms at this point) with his new finisher, the Scorpion Death Drop inverted DDT, two jumping elbow drops, a Stinger Splash and a Scorpion Deathlock while the rest of the nWo came to ringside. Rather than intervene, they simply stood by and watched. After Sting was done, Ted DiBiase and Kevin Nash came into the ring and made Sting an offer to join the nWo and get back at WCW for betraying him. Sting, after a pause, first called out the nWo Sting as a [...] "cheap imitation," [...] before telling the nWo, [...] "the real Sting may or may not be in your price range," [...] and then concluded by saying [...] "the only thing that's for sure about Sting is that nothing's for sure". [...] With that, Sting left the ring and would not speak (on mic) on WCW programming again for over a year. After this a silent, almost ghostly Sting, carrying a baseball bat as a weapon, began appearing in the rafters at WCW events and began painting his entire face with black and white corpse paint. Sting's new gimmick was inspired by the 1994 film The Crow. In retaliation, nWo Sting, who was still imitating Borden, began painting his face this way as well. While appearing on a WCW/nWo merchandise special on QVC Sports in late 1999, Borden admitted that Scott Hall had initially suggested the idea of painting his face like the character of Eric Draven from The Crow. Sting maintains aspects of his [...] "Crow" [...] persona to date, occasionally with different designs and use of color of the face paint.|$|E
