40|$|Regional Sustainability Initiatives (RSIs) {{may play}} a {{significant}} role in promoting the cooperation of different stakeholders of society towards a more sustainable future. RSIs can often deal with a number of environmental and social problems more effectively and efficiently than international, national or local activities. RSIs are getting more and more frequent in many countries and are also promoted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> European Union. An on-going research project conducted at the Corvinus University of Budapest, <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> and <b>the</b> Norwegian Financial Mechanism, aims at the characterization of such Regional Sustainability Initiatives from the point of view of corporate participation. The research examines the underlying principles of RSIs and their implementation in practice; the motivational factors of different stakeholders. The paper introduces six theories which can explain corporate participation in RSIs, the barriers to participation and the success factors. The first results of an interview based empirical survey are presented and short recommendations for policymakers are provided.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this rapid assessment were twofold. First, {{it was a}} summative assignment in that it sought to document <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> and Norway Grants' efforts to promote gender equality (GE), reduce domestic violence (DV), and reduce gender-based violence (GBV) in the seven focus countries. Second, it was formative and forward-looking. It was formative in that it aimed to generate lessons learned based on an assessment of relevant achievements; it aimed to help improve the design, planning, organisation, and implementation of future interventions. It was also forward-looking in that it provided a context-based set of ideas on how things might {{be done in the}} future; it aimed to consider current contextual changes that may not have been reflected in the earlier programme experience. The assessment addressed two aspects of gender – first, mainstreaming GE and promoting work-life balance (WLB), and second, addressing DV and GBV – in seven countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain. Not all countries reviewed have programmes addressing both aspects <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> and Norway Grants. The assessment focused on the following three lines of inquiry: 1. Relevance of the programme and projects therein. 2. Effectiveness of the programme and projects therein. 3. The bilateral dimension, focusing specifically on the execution of programme and project partnerships involving the Council of Europe (CoE) and other expert organisations (primarily based in Norway) ...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{education}} {{is expected to}} have significant influence on environmental awareness, everyday lifestyle and consumer behavior of the participants. Our paper aims to explore how content, intensity and ways of environmental education reflect in the knowledge, values, attitudes and actual behavior of university students and high school students in Hungary. The questionnaire-based survey was conducted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Department of Environmental Economics and Technology at Corvinus University of Budapest (CUB), <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> and <b>the</b> Norwegian Financial Mechanism. The results give space to a wider comparative study both among universities representing different professions and between higher education and secondary education level. Results show that higher intensity of environmental education gradually increases the environmental knowledge of involved students 9 ̆ 6 at both analyzed education levels. Environmental knowledge at secondary education level was definitely higher than expected; the results at higher education level were not surprising in this sense. Environmental awareness, however, depends rather on commitment reflected in the choice of an environmental specialization at the university level. This phenomenon is more complicated at secondary school level as there is no similar specialization there. Consumer behavior is even more complex; the impact of environmental {{education is}} only one reason behind. However, the focus of environmental education is very important in the attitudes toward reducing consumption. Respondents are classified into clusters according to their consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and attitude to consumption. Interestingly, university students reported to be significantly more conscious about the negative environmental impacts and the necessity of behavioural change than respondents from secondary schools...|$|R

40|$|The Member States of the European Communities (EC), EC, and the {{countries}} of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have concluded the Agreement on European Economic Area (EEA Agreement). When such a combined regional community is formed, while each of these constituting bodies does not cease to exist, a question arises as to what legal constraints are necessitated to avoid divergent application of law among the members. This paper analyzes this question through examination of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> institutional system <b>by</b> focusing on <b>the</b> principle of homogeneity. <b>The</b> <b>EEA</b> system can be well understood by viewing it {{from the standpoint of the}} homogeneity principle, which includes two normative requirements. Firstly, it requires the EFTA/EC and their countries secure uniform interpretation of provisions of EEA law. Secondly, it requires that the substantive outcome of the application of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Agreement is homogeneous. These requirements are embedded in <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> institutional system, which contains not only a number of provisions identical in substance to those of the EC Treaty, but also a procedure for incorporating later EC secondary legislation into the national law of EFTA countries. Regard should also be paid to the EFTA Court as its own judicial organ and the EFTA Surveillance Authority, whose task is to supervise <b>the</b> application of <b>EEA</b> law within <b>the</b> EFTA. This overview shows that <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> system is built up very similarly to the corresponding EC system, and thereby intends to manage the possibility of divergent development of law. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that the EFTA court may apply EEA law differently within the EFTA framework. The principle of homogeneity again makes up for this deficiency in the EFTA judicial system, i. e., intervention of EC Organ/Member States in the procedure, the case-law information exchange, and monitoring <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> Joint Committee. Furthermore, the EFTA Court very often refers the case of the ECJ, and even adopts precedents of constitutional relevance in order to secure homogeneous interpretation and application of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> law in so far as homogeneity is concerned. These solutions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> to <b>the</b> divergent problems functions well so far. However, this cannot be easily applicable to the integration of multiple regional communities in general. Two prerequisites of <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> system must be pointed out. Firstly, the system has been developed under strong influence of the preceding EC acquis. Secondly, it is assumed that the judicial organs play an active role in the governance of integration. Though these points need to be kept in mind, the principle of homogeneity as applied in <b>the</b> <b>EEA</b> is an appreciable legal solution to the unavoidable problems regarding integrating multiple regional communities. ...|$|R

The heterogeneous data formats and data transfer mechanisms make the data collection and integration a difficult task for <b>the</b> <b>EEA.</b> An approach is needed for facilitating the interoperable exchange of environmental data on a large scale. A core element of this approach is the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) technology of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) which allows the standardised, interoperable, vendor and domain independent exchange of sensor data. The main contribution of this article is a lightweight profile for the OGC Sensor Observation Service that ensures the necessary interoperability for seamlessly integrating the environmental data provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EEA’s</b> member states and thus forms the foundation for the developed data exchange mechanisms.
