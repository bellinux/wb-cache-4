5000|$|The {{inversion}} layer {{is crucial to}} the formation of the marine stratus that produce June Gloom. Compression and warming of air sinking out of the North Pacific High-pressure system (which is strongest during the summer) meets with the rising, cooling air from the sea surface, producing a very stable layer of air that caps the cool air from rising any further. The strength of this <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion</b> affects the strength of the marine layer, and {{how long it will take}} the clouds to dissipate. Additionally, the cool ocean water of the California Current, which flows out of the cold Gulf of Alaska, enhances the contrast between the cool air below the {{inversion layer}} and the warm air above it. A stronger inversion layer - one with a greater difference in temperature between the air above and the air below - often results in more and deeper marine layer clouds that persist longer into the day. Upwelling of colder-than-normal ocean water, associated with a La Niña, can strengthen this effect even more.|$|E

Ten-day campaigns near Antofagasta (23 S) were carried out in January 1997, July 1997, and January 1998. Significant diurnal cycles in temperature, mixing ratio, and wind from about 1000 to 4000 m above sea level were observed. This layer was decoupled from the marine boundary layer circulation below by the <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion</b> when its base was under the average height of the coastal mountain range. The solar heating cycle over the Andes and associated circulation resulted in a mean afternoon zonal divergence above the <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion</b> base of about 30 10 6 s 1, exceeding {{by a factor of}} 5 typical subtropical west coast divergences. The corresponding early morning convergence was particularly intense during the austral winter experiment.

In the present paper, an outline is given of some general features of insect stratification as revealed by the radars, followed by a description of occasions during warm nights in the summer months when intense insect layers developed.

40|$|Several {{approaches}} to parameterize the turbulent transport of momentum, heat, water vapour and cloud water {{for use in}} a general circulation model (GCM) have been tested in one-dimensional and three-dimensional model simulations. The schemes differ with respect to their closure assumptions (conventional eddy diffusivity model versus turbulent kinetic energy closure) and also regarding their treatment of cloud-turbulence interactions. The basis properties of these parameterizations are discussed first in column simulations of a stratocumulus-topped atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) under a strong <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion</b> during the KONTROL experiment in the North Sea. It is found that the K-models tend to decouple the cloud layer from the adjacent layers because the turbulent activity is calculated from local variables. The higher-order scheme performs better in this respect because internally generated turbulence can be transported up and down through the action of turbulent diffusion. Thus, the TKE-scheme provides not only a better link between the cloud and the sub-cloud layer but also between the cloud and the inversion as a result of cloud-top entrainment. In the stratocumulus case study, where the cloud is confined by a pronounced <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion,</b> increased entrainment favours cloud dilution through enhanced evaporation of cloud droplets. In the GCM study, however, additional cloud-top entrainment supports cloud formation because indirect cloud generating processes are promoted through efficient ventilation of the ABL, such as the enhanced moisture supply by surface evaporation and the increased depth of the ABL. As a result, tropical convection is more vigorous, the hydrological cycle is intensified, the whole troposphere becomes warmer and moister in general and the cloudiness in {{the upper part of the}} ABL is increased.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Marginal Ice Zone Experiment (MIZEX- 83) {{conducted in the}} Arctic {{during the summer of}} 1983 is summarized and the mesoscale features and atmospheric refraction conditions described. The three case studies examined are: warm air advection over dense pack ice causing strong elevated ducting and subrefraction, cold air advection over relatively open water causing shallow convection and normal refraction condi­tions, large scale subsidence in the western quadrants of an anticyclone leading to super-refraction and weak ducting. Developing synoptic scale cyclones adjacent to the MIZEX- 83 area often determined the airflow over the region. The observed large horizontal SST gradients were the dominant forcing mechanisms on surface layer stability. Trapping layers associated with <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversions</b> can be located on satellite imagery by assuming that stratiform clouds form immediately below the inversion. Uniform cloud and refraction layers were not common during MIZEX- 83 due to strong mesoscale variability. Factors affecting <b>inversion</b> height include <b>subsidence</b> and entrainment mixing.

Temperature observations on Mary’s Peak show abnormally warm air {{in relation to the}} surrounding areas. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the frequency and duration of these warm events around the Oregon Coast range during the cold season between November and February, determine how widespread they were, and to determine the background meteorological conditions which give rise to them. Temperature, relative humidity, height and wind were the main variables of data collected from radiosonde soundings, satellites and various weather stations. These sources showed wind directions, pressure systems, cloud formation and possible inversions which furthered the understanding of how and where the warm air formed. Analyses of the vertical structure of temperature and wind from the National Center for Atmospheric Prediction’s (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) provided high resolution depictions of what occurred during these warm periods. The anomalous warm events that were observed affecting the summit of Mary’s Peak are likely caused by strong subsidence of warming air in the centers of {{high pressure}} ridges.

40|$|The {{convergence}} of heat below <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversions</b> was estimated from radiosonde ascents on fine summer days. Sensible heat {{input from the}} ground was estimated from measurements of heat fluxes and net radiation over a wheat field. Absorption and back scattering of solar radiation by aerosol throughout the atmosphere were calculated from measurements of solar radiation at the ground. Radiation absorbed by aerosol in the thermal boundary layer heated the lower atmosphere at an average rate of 3. 3 degC day-’ (60 Wrn-’), about {{twice as fast as}} estimated for gaseous constituents. An equation is derived to show how the net effect of aerosol on the lower atmosphere depends on the reflection coefficient of the surface and on the aerodynamic and surface resistances to vapour transfer. Over the wheat, the net effect was almost zero when the crop was transpiring fast, but when the crop was mature, aerosol caused net cooling. As part of a wider attempt to identify possible causes of climatic change, attention has recently been directed to the absorption and scattering of solar radiation by aerosol, processes which modify the heat balance of the atmosphere and the radiation budget at the earth’s surface.

5000|$|CMAQ is {{an acronym}} for the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model, a {{sophisticated}} atmospheric dispersion model developed by the US EPA to address regional air pollution problems. An example of a regional air pollution problem is a multi-state area where ozone or fine particulate levels exceed the US health standards. In addition to simulating the emission, advection, diffusion, and deposition of air pollutants, CMAQ treats {{a wide array of}} chemical reactions that occur throughout the lower atmosphere. For example, ozone forms in the atmosphere when nitrogen oxides interact with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. Ammonium sulfate is formed in fine particulate matter when sulfuric acid (formed largely in cloud water) interacts with gas-phase ammonia. [...] Meteorological conditions such as <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversions,</b> decrease the amount of fresh air available for dilution of air emissions, and increase the rate of production of secondary air pollutants. CMAQ has the capability to accurately predict air pollution concentrations resulting from secondary formation.

Its particular strength is in assessing the efficacy of regional emissions control strategies in reducing regional air pollution levels.|$|R

An economically distressed area, Braddock exceeds average annual (> 15 μg/m 3) and daily (> 35 μg/m 3) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM 2. 5). Methods: A mobile air monitoring study was designed and implemented in morning and afternoon hours in the summer and winter (2010 – 2011) to explore the within-neighborhood spatial and temporal (within-day and between-day) variability in PM 2. 5 and PM 10. Results: Both pollutants displayed spatial variation between stops, and substantial temporal variation within and across study days. For summer morning sampling runs, site-specific mean PM 2. 5 ranged from 30. 0 (SD = 3. 3) to 55. 1 (SD = 13. 0) μg/m 3. Mean PM 10 ranged from 30. 4 (SD = 2. 5) to 69. 7 (SD = 51. 2) μg/m 3, respectively. During summer months, afternoon concentrations were significantly lower than morning for both PM 2. 5 and PM 10, potentially owing to morning <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversions.</b> Winter concentrations were lower than summer, on average, and showed lesser diurnal variation.

Analysis of measurements, which included tracers of biomass combustion and industrial emissions, showed that this atmosphere was highly influenced by biomass burning emissions from the South American and African continents. Marine boundary layer was generally capped off by a <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion</b> and its composition to a large degree was determined by slow entrainment from aloft. Insoluble species (such as PAN, NO, hydrocarbons, CO) were enhanced throughout the troposphere.

Ozone mixing ratios throughout he South Atlantic basin were enhanced by • 20 ppb. These enhancements were larger in the eastern South Atlantic (African emissions) compared to the western South Atlantic (South American emissions). In much of the troposphere, total reactive nitrogen (NOy) correlated well with tracers of biomass combustion (e. g., CH 3 C 1, CO).

In arid and semi-arid regions, where cloud cover is often low and precipitation is generally scarce and sporadic, the driving processes accounting for the production, loss and transport of atmospheric constituents are often distinctly different from other climates. In arid regions, the same circulation dynamics that suppress cloud formation can be responsible for creating strong <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversions,</b> which cap atmospheric mixing and trap pollutants close to the surface, often placing populated arid regions high on global rankings of air pollution concerns. In addition, low soil moisture can encourage wind-blown dust emissions, {{which can be a}} significant fraction of the total aerosol loading in both coarse and fine modes on a mass basis. Three distinct focus regions are investigated over varying time scales, using a diverse set of techniques, and with wide-ranging primary goals. 1) the Tehran metropolitan area in Iran over a ten-year period from 2000 - 2009, 2) Tucson, Arizona over 2012 - 2014 with three intensive monitoring periods during summer 2014 and winter 2015 and 3) the San Joaquin Valley in California during the NASA DISCOVER-AQ campaign during Jan-Feb 2013.

Preservation of Late Oligocene-Early Miocene marine sediments on the Rhenish Massif demonstrates that the Roer Valley Graben (RVG) was connected to the URG (Sissingh, 1998), indicating a common evolution during at least this period. A close relationship between these two grabens is also suggested by the distribution of the earthquake focal mechanisms in the northern part of the URG and the RVG which indicate a present day NE-SW extension in both areas (Plenefisch and Bonjer, 1997). Structurally, the RVRS is the southwestern part of th...|$|R
40|$|Since February 1999 {{atmospheric}} absorption spectra using {{the sun as}} the source of radiation have been recorded by a ground-based FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed) spectrometer (Bruker IFS 120 M). Besides zenith column amounts (ZCA) of trace gases like O 3, H 2 O, HDO, N 2 O, CH 4, HF, HCl, ClONO 2, NO, NO 2, and HNO 3, profiles of gases with narrow absorption lines like O 3, NO, HCl and HF can be retrieved. First results of profiles of O 3 and HCl and of columns of O 3, HCl and NO 2 are shown. O 3 profiles are compared with ozone sonde and Brewer data. Column amounts of NO 2 are compared with DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) data. 1. Measurement Site The FTIR spectrometer was installed at Izaña Observatory (IZO) in February 1999. IZO is operated by the Instituto Nacional de Meteorología (INM) of Spain. Izaña is situated at 28 ° 18 ‘N and 16 ° 29 ‘W on the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). It is mostly above a <b>subsidence</b> temperature <b>inversion</b> layer (sea cloud) due to its location {{on the top of a}} mountain plateau (2360 m a. s. l.). This provides excellent conditions for infrared measurements. A Brewer MARK-III spectrophotometer [2], which is run by the INM and a DOAS spectromete...|$|R
40|$|The {{available}} {{range resolution}} of pulsed radar wind profilers is usually limited by bandwidth restrictions. Range imaging (RIM) {{has recently been}} developed {{as a means of}} mitigating these limitations by operating the wind profilers over a small set of distinct transmitter frequencies. A constrained optimization method can then be used to generate high-resolution maps of the reflectivity field as a function of range. This paper presents a description of how the RIM technique has been recently implemented on the Platteville 915 -MHz tropospheric profiler, the first such implementation at UHF. Examples of data collected during a two-part experiment on 10 April 2001 using the Platteville 915 -MHz tropospheric profiler are presented. In the first part, an intercomparison was made involving measurements from RIM and standard radar techniques. It is shown that available frequency bandwidth can be very effectively utilized through the RIM processing. In {{the second part of the}} experiment, RIM was applied to radar observations collected with a short (0. 5 ms) transmit pulse. The resulting data include observations of a thin, persistent scattering layer attributed to a <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion</b> and billows from a Kelvin– Helmholtz instability. Estimates of the width of the layer were found to be as small as 12 m. 1...|$|E
40|$|Subsynoptic, warm core low {{pressure}} areas are frequently observed {{along the west}} coast of subtropical South America during austral winter. These so-called coastal lows (CLs) tend to develop as an upper-air, midlatitude ridge is approaching the subtropical Andes and, therefore, while pressure is increasing aloft and farther to the south. These CLs have a profound impact in the coastal weather associated with a rapid transition from clear skies and stronger than average equatorward low-level flow to overcast conditions and relaxed equatorward (or even poleward) flow. Weather conditions inland mostly reflect the associated changes in the strength and height of the base of the <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion.</b> In this work, a mesoscale simulation of a typical CL episode is performed using a numerical weather prediction model [the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM 5) ] Comparison with observations reveals that the model simulation properly captures the large-scale pattern as well as many of the mesoscale features that characterize the CL. The model results were then used to diagnose the CL. It is found that the coastal troughing is largely due to the marked adiabatic warming of the lower troposphere (including a significant strengthening of the temperature inversion). The large-scale subsidence ahead of the incoming upper-air ridge axis is enhanced as the low-level easterly flow is con...|$|E

The climate of the main Hawaiian islands is strongly influenced by persistent <b>subsidence</b> <b>inversion</b> and trade winds characteristic of the region. In the middle and upper elevations of the high volcanic peaks climate is directly affected by the presence and movement of this inversion. Five climate stations have been operating on an altitudinal transect between 950 meters and 3000 meters elevation on the leeward side of East Maui in order to measure and describe the climate zones created by the inversion layer. Hourly measurements of solar radiation, net radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind, rainfall and atmometer evaporation were made. This report documents the results of these measurements in terms of elevational, annual and diurnal patterns, as well as addressing some aspects of climate variability and the applications of this data in estimating rates of potential evapotranspiration. This report summarizes two to three years of data from these climate stations and {{can be used as a}} reference for future research on the relationship between native ecosystems and climate within the area of study.

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{extraction}} lead to compaction of the {{gas reservoir}} which is visible as subsidence on the surface. Subsidence measurements can therefore be used to better estimate reservoir parameters. Total subsidence {{is derived from the}} result of the measurement of height differences between optical benchmarks. The procedure from optical height difference measurements to absolute <b>subsidence</b> is an <b>inversion,</b> and the result is often used as an input for consequent inversions on the reservoir. We have used the difference measurements directly to invert for compaction of the Groningen gas reservoir in the Netherlands. We have used a linear inversion exercise to update an already existing reservoir compaction model of the field. This procedure yielded areas of increased and decreased levels of compaction compared to the existing compaction model in agreement with observed discrepancies in porosity and aquifer activity...|$|R
40|$|The Sydney Basin {{covers a}} large {{offshore}} area south of Newfoundland, with a well-exposed outcrop belt on Cape Breton Island. The geological {{history of the}} poorly known offshore area is interpreted using an industry seismic grid and Lithoprobe line 86 - 5, tied to outcrops and two wells. The mid-Devonian to Upper Carboniferous - Permian basin fill is 6 - 7 km thick and represents three extensional phases with intervening and succeeding compressive phases. The mid-Devonian McAdams Lake Formation was deposited in a local half-graben during early post-Acadian extension. Following deformation, a suite of Early Carboniferous extensional basins filled mainly with Horton Group conglomerates developed on northeast-trending and southeast-dipping master faults. Some faults developed along Acadian terrane boundaries. The Windsor Group extends over the master faults to onlap basement {{as a result of}} thermal sag and Visean eustatic rise. Mid-Carboniferous deformation, linked to the Alleghanian orogeny, reactivated faults and caused basin inversion and a basinwide unconformity. Upper Carboniferous to ?Permian coal measures and redbeds were subsequently deposited in a broad basin that developed over the Early Carboniferous basins. Subsidence may reflect extension on major faults in the Cabot Strait coupled with thermal sag and (or) continued sag on an underlying mid-crustal detachment. After coalification, Acadian terrane boundaries and other lineaments were reactivated during a compressive tectonic episode, probably during the Permian. The basin's polycyclic history, with repeated <b>subsidence</b> and <b>inversion</b> phases, has important implications for hydrocarbon systems...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Roer Valley Rift System (RVRS) {{is located}} between the West European rift and the North Sea rift system. During the Cenozoic, the RVRS was {{characterized}} by several periods of <b>subsidence</b> and <b>inversion,</b> which {{are linked to the}} evolution of the adjacent rift systems. Combination of subsidence analysis and results from the analysis of thickness distributions and fault systems allows the determination of the Cenozoic evolution and quantification of the subsidence. During the Early Paleocene, the RVRS was inverted (Laramide phase). The backstripping method shows that the RVRS was subsequently mainly affected by two periods of subsidence, during the Late Paleocene and the Oligocene–Quaternary time intervals, separated by an inversion phase during the Late Eocene. During the Oligocene and Miocene periods, the thickness of the sediments and the distribution of the active faults reveal a radical rotation of the direction of extension by about 70 – 80 j (counter clockwise). Integration of these results at a European scale indicates that the Late Paleocene subsidence was related to the evolution of the North Sea basins, whereas the Oligocene–Quaternary subsidence is connected to the West European rift evolution. The distribution of the inverted provinces also shows that the Early Paleocene inversion (Laramide phase) has affected the whole European crust, whereas the Late Eocene inversion was restricted to the southern North Sea basins and the Channel area. Finally, comparison of these deformations in the European crust with the evolution of the Alpine chain suggests that the formation of the Alps has controlled the evolution of the European crust {{since the beginning of the}} Cenozoic...|$|R
