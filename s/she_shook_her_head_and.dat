60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{denied the}} {{imputation}} with much disgust.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{sheltered}} the drawing-book again {{under her}} shawl.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled up}} at him. She was immensely interested.|$|E
60|$|Anderssen {{held out}} the chubby infant, but <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> violently, and {{brow and}} neck turned crimson.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{interrupting}} {{him with}} a quick little gesture.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> motioned an entreaty to him {{to leave}} her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and,</b> if pale, {{her face}} was resolute, her glance steady.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and,</b> {{though she}} had stopped, she evinced her desire to go on.|$|E
60|$|Lady Conyers {{watched her}} {{daughter}} searchingly. Then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} silent a moment; then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> lightly.|$|R
60|$|My Lady's lips move, {{but they}} utter nothing. <b>She</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{laughed a}} little mockingly, but {{made no effort}} to escape from my arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled at}} me with a courage which was the crown of her sufferings.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled a}} negative, {{as if she}} would, but that she was under a necessity.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{without looking}} at him, like an abashed child.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{smiling as}} though not ill-pleased at the compliment.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} her {{expression}} was almost hopeless. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> in {{a little}} while he fell asleep, she still holding his hand, and {{soothing}} him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> smiled but vouchsafed {{no further}} explanation, unless her {{following}} words {{can be so}} called. These were: ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> busied {{herself at}} the piano putting away the music, while the men had their drink.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's deep silence. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> very slowly.|$|R
60|$|The colour {{faded from}} her face again, and <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sadly.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} {{doubtful}} for a moment, and then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{held out}} her hand for the shot-gun. He started to hand it to her, then hesitated.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes to mine. They were curiously and wonderfully blue. Then <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> withdrew her hands, sighing.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{gazed at}} me pitifully. She was not frightened, but appalled, rather, at the human animality of it.|$|E
60|$|Again the blankness of non-comprehension. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{at him and}} smiled.|$|R
60|$|Amanda Trivett listened attentively, but, when I had finished, <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|Patsey {{had spoken}} very few words during the day. <b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{her hair}} quivered; {{the scent of}} camomile, verbena, hay was wafted; then looking at her lap, she muttered: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{her voice}} trembled; her hand {{must have done}} so too, for the light {{required}} a deal of trimming.|$|E
60|$|But {{the tears}} were {{threatening}} {{to rise in}} her eyes again, as <b>she</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> turned and went up the steps.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> emphatically, {{and said}} {{something}} that I failed to catch.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{with a look}} of inexpressible anguish, almost of reproach.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> A certain look {{of relief}} flashed across her face.|$|R
