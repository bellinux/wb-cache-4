25|$|Second, every {{situation}} presents {{large numbers of}} potential mediators, {{which means that the}} individual has to make a choice among them; either authentic choice is back in the picture, then, or else the theory leads to a regress. Third, Girard leaves no room for innovation: surely <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be the first to desire a new object, even if everyone else follows that trend-setter.|$|E
25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{application}} process attracted little comment at the time, a controversy broke {{out after the}} ICM's plans were approved. At the commission's next meeting, on June 17, 2010, more than 600 people, some wearing Christian- or patriotic-themed clothes, turned out to protest its approval of the ICM's plans. Many said they had {{become aware of the}} plans only after they had been approved. Opponents were harshly critical both of the ICM and of Islam itself. Karen Harrell, a Murfreesboro resident, said: [...] "Everybody knows they are trying to kill us. People are really concerned about this. <b>Somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> stand up and take this country back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Popplewell was criticised for the comments, {{including}} a rebuke from {{a survivor of}} the Bradford fire. Labour MP Steve Rotheram, commented: [...] "How insensitive does <b>somebody</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be to write that load of drivel?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... (In {{response}} to the question: [...] "Why should I work if I am going to just end up emptying slop jars?") [...] "That's a complaint you hear mostly from people who don't empty slop jars. This country {{has a lot of}} people who do exactly that for a living. And they do it well. It's not pleasant work, but it's a living. And it has to be done. <b>Somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go around and empty all those bed pans. And it's perfectly honorable work.

60|$|The {{silence was}} growing oppressive. <b>Somebody</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> break it soon. And as Mr. Beach was still {{confining}} {{himself to the}} language of the eyebrow and apparently intended to fight it out on that line if it took all Summer, Ashe himself broke it.|$|R

6000|$|Leland smiled. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "horse-stealing {{is getting}} to be a good deal more {{profitable}} business than liquor-running. They get horses for nothing, and they have to buy the whisky. They haven't gone very far into it yet, but it's a sure thing that they will if they find out that none of us seem to mind it. <b>Somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make a protest, and it may as well be me." ...|$|E
6000|$|No, {{they have}} no {{railroad}} accidents to speak of in France. But why? Because when one occurs, <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> hang for it! Not hang, maybe, but be punished at least with such vigor of emphasis as to make negligence a thing to be shuddered at by railroad officials for many a day thereafter. [...] "No blame attached to the officers"--that lying and disaster-breeding verdict so common to our softhearted juries is seldom rendered in France. If the trouble occurred in the conductor's department, that officer must suffer if his subordinate cannot be proven guilty; if in the engineer's department and the case be similar, the engineer must answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here anyhow," [...] I said, {{answering}} the faint amusement of his face; [...] "I've got no modesty. Everything conspires to set me up. Why should I run about like all those grubby little beasts down there, seeking nothing but mean little vanities and indulgencies--and then {{take credit for}} modesty? I KNOW I am capable. I KNOW I have imagination. Modesty! I know if I don't attempt the very biggest things in life I am a damned shirk. The very biggest! <b>Somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> attempt them.

60|$|That is what I should do.

Just so! We let this property abide by the decision, but we will try to reverse that decision. We will try to put it where Judge Douglas would not object, for he says he will obey it until it is reversed. <b>Somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> reverse that decision, since it is made, and we mean to reverse it, and we mean to do it peaceably.|$|E
6000|$|... "The British {{official}} character," [...] said Sewell drily. [...] "It wouldn't look well, you see, and {{it would}} hurt somebody's dignity {{to admit that it}} was necessary,--that is, of course, so long as we play our cards cleverly. This trouble would be regarded from the official point of view as merely a little temporary friction which could be got over if handled tactfully. Indeed, I shouldn't wonder if Esmond is quietly reprimanded for causing it; but one has to remember that if you persist in making our rulers see what they don't wish to, they're apt to display an activity that's likely to prove as unpleasant to men in our position as it is unusual. They don't want to move if they can help it, but <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> smart for it if they're forced to." ...|$|E
50|$|This film {{captured}} {{my imagination}} so much. It {{was the first}} film that I saw that {{made me realize that}} <b>somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make this stuff. <b>Somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> build those sets. <b>Somebody</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> paint those paintings. All of a sudden it became accessible. The movie was so compelling and interesting to me on so many levels. The one thing that struck me was that somebody made a movie, and that it was something that maybe, possibly, I could do.|$|E
5000|$|After we had {{finished}} arguing with Board of Trade, Courtland Elliot, the president, made his annual report. In it, he suggested the road should be named the Gardiner Expressway.
