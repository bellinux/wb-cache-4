The industrial components are modular and capable of taking decentralized decisions in real time.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new method to learn time based rules from telecom <b>system</b> <b>alarm</b> data for {{prediction}} {{of the classes}} of alarms. A time based rule associates an alarm class with the S-tartTime attribute and other attributes of alarms. The rules are evaluated with {{the coverage of the}} rules in the training data set. Given a new alarm generated at a particular time, its alarm class can be predicted with a set of time based rules. We present a new algorithm that extracts time based rules from alarm data through an ant colony optimization (ACO) process. Given an alarm training data, a search space is formulated as a square matrix indexed by distinctive attribute values. The pheromone at the search space is computed from the training data and a time based rule is discovered from the pheromone distribution. The pheromone distribution is updated after a time based rule is extracted and the search for a new rule starts. A rule pruning process is used to remove redundant rules and increase the prediction accuracy of the final rule set. We experimented the new method on Nokia Simmons (NSN) and Ericsson data sets and compared the results of the new method and the TimeSeluth system. The comparison demonstrated that the new method outperformed TimeSeluth in prediction accuracy...|$|E

40|$|A Similarity Ratio Analysis (SRA) {{method is}} {{proposed}} for early-stage Fault Detection (FD) in plasma etching processes using real-time Optical Emission Spectrometer (OES) data as input. The SRA method {{can help to}} realise a highly precise control system by detecting abnormal etch-rate faults in real-time during an etching process. The method processes spectrum scans at successive time points and uses a windowing mechanism over the time series to alleviate problems with timing uncertainties due to process shift from one process run to another. A SRA library is first built to capture features of a healthy etching process. By comparing with the SRA library, a Similarity Ratio (SR) statistic is then calculated for each spectrum scan as the monitored process progresses. A fault detection mechanism, named 3 -Warning- 1 -Alarm (3 W 1 A), takes the SR values as inputs and triggers a <b>system</b> <b>alarm</b> when certain conditions are satisfied. This design reduces the chance of false alarm, and provides a reliable fault reporting service. The SRA method is demonstrated on a real semiconductor manufacturing dataset. The effectiveness of SRA-based fault detection is evaluated using a time-series SR test and also using a post-process SR test. The time-series SR provides an early-stage fault detection service, so less energy and materials will be wasted by faulty processing. The post-process SR provides a fault detection service with higher reliability than the time-series SR, but with fault testing conducted only after each process run completes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the routine setting performance of a guideline for phenotypic detection of extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae, recommending ESBL confirmation with Etest or combination disc for isolates with a positive ESBL screen test (i. e. cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime MIC > 1 mg/L or an automated system ESBL warning). Twenty laboratories submitted 443 Enterobacteriaceae with a positive ESBL screen test and their confirmation test result (74 % Escherichia coli, 12 % Enterobacter cloacae, 8 % Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 % Proteus mirabilis, 2 % Klebsiella oxytoca). Presence of ESBL genes was used as reference test. Accuracy of local phenotypic ESBL detection was 88 %. The positive predictive value (PPV) of local screen tests was 70 %, and differed per method (Vitek- 2 : 69 %, Phoenix: 68 %, disc diffusion: 92 %), and species (95 % K. pneumoniae- 27 % K. oxytoca). A low PPV (3 %) was observed for isolates with automated <b>system</b> <b>alarm</b> but third-generation cephalosporin MICs < 2 mg/L. Local ESBL confirmation had a PPV and negative predictive value (NPV) of 93 % and 90 %, respectively. Compared with centrally performed confirmation tests, 7 % of local tests were misinterpreted. Combination disc was more specific than Etest (91 % versus 61 %). Confirmation tests were not reliable for P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca (PPV 33 % and 38 %, respectively, although NPVs were 100 %). In conclusion, performance of Etests could be enhanced by education of technicians to improve their interpretation, by genotypic ESBL confirmation of P. mirabilis and K. oxytoca isolates with positive phenotypic ESBL confirmation, and by interpreting isolates with a positive ESBL alarm but an MIC < 2 mg/L for cefotaxime and ceftazidime as ESBL-negative...|$|E

The device is an electronic breathing apparatus control system, incorporating {{state of the art}} data radio technology; and including a pressure gauge, temperature monitor, low air warning <b>system,</b> <b>alarm,</b> and signalling device. It was the world’s first fully automatic control system of its kind, offering a level of monitoring and protection previously unavailable.
