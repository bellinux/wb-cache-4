The agency said that, unlike heavier crude oil, the marine engine oil should evaporate or disperse naturally.|$|E
5000|$|Vermilion has one {{important}} defect; it {{is liable to}} darken, or develop a purplish-gray <b>surface</b> <b>sheen.</b> Cennino Cennini wrote, [...] "Bear in mind...that {{it is not in}} its character to be exposed to air but it is more resistant on panel than on walls since, when it is used and laid on a wall, over a period of time, standing in the air, it turns black" [...] The darkness is not a result of the vermilion itself, which is very stable, but is caused by impurities and adulteration of the pigment. Newer research indicates that chlorine ions and light may aid in decomposing vermilion into elemental mercury, which is black in finely dispersed form.|$|E

50|$|The {{weather is}} {{pleasant}} {{in the months}} of May and August, when the lake offers water skiing sport, which is now becoming an increasingly popular activity in many rivers and lakes in India. Jammu & Kashmir Tourism Department (JKTD) provides essential water skiing equipment and trained instructors to adventure seekers. The lake’s <b>surface</b> <b>sheen</b> and its long length and width attract tourists to water skiing sport. However, the noise and turbulences of waterskiing boats will totally change the environment of this last quiet lake and could risk to take away one of its main attractions: Peace. There is still a discussion going {{on whether or not}} a more environmentally sensitive form of sustainable tourism would be more appropriate for this special lake - to not turn it into a second Dal Lake.|$|E
50|$|Specular {{illumination}} {{documents the}} <b>surface</b> <b>sheen</b> of an object. With paintings, {{it is used}} to highlight areas of abnormality. While raking illumination will produce a record of these abnormalities with greater clarity, specular illumination is less dependent on the orientation of the light. There are two basic set ups for specular illumination - axial and oblique. An axial setup requires the camera and the light source {{to be on the same}} axis. The camera is parallel to the surface of the object, and the light source is next to the camera. An oblique setup requires the camera and the light source to be on opposite sides of the subject, but each are at the same angle relative to the object. Specular light can allow conservators to see tool marks on wooden objects, or indentations that seemed invisible.|$|E

For all the poppy <b>surface</b> <b>sheen,</b> this is a song with surprisingly hefty balls, possessed of a pounding momentum that recalls 'Viva La Vida." [...] Josh Eells said, in his review of the album for Rolling Stone, that [...] "Princess of China is a ballad about loss and regret, co-starring Rihanna.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} use of laser {{engraving}} and aluminum foil laminating as an embellishing process to denim fabric. Laser technique is being applied in the textile and fashion industries {{because it is an}} ideal surface treatment for design application without usage of chemicals and water. This paper will explore a design method that combines laser engraving technology and metallic foil laminating for a <b>sheening</b> <b>surface</b> effect. Before the application of laser engraving, the aluminum foil is laminated on denim fabric with laminating adhesive. Then, the laminated denim fabric is engraved by the laser with a different DPI (dots per inch) as well as the pixel time (microsecond, μs). The performance of the laser engraved foil laminated denim fabric is investigated, including physical and mechanical properties. The study demonstrates an embellishment application in denim fabric, which developed metallic appearance with patterns on denim fabric combing the aluminum foil laminating and the laser engraving techniques. It carries out new possibilities for textile and fashion designs and reveals the future potential for green textile products.

40|$|In {{the context}} of this study, “untreated ” wood signifies the absence of {{coatings}} such as paint, wax, varnish or any other protective coating {{on the surface of the}} wood. Two main factors are considered to evaluate cleaning methods for this application. First, there is potential for the wood to become physically abraded or burnished during the cleaning process. If the wood becomes burnished as a result of the mechanical action of cleaning, a change in the overall <b>surface</b> gloss, or <b>sheen,</b> may occur. Second, there is potential for cleaning product residue to be left embedded in the wood grain or surface cracks. This residue could potentially cause direct discoloration due to its presence, or stain and discolor the object as the trapped material ages and deteriorates over time. These two factors are evalu-ated using three analytical methods: spectrophotometry, visual microscopy and ultraviolet fluorescence. The study also involved the participation of eight conservators from the Museum of Modern Art. Each conservator cleaned samples of untreated Douglas fir ply-wood using the same dry cleaning techniques and materials. A baseline was created to eliminate the subjective and variable force that is applied during the cleaning process by individual conservators. This parameter was essential to define in order to make the results of this study useable...|$|R

5000|$|The album {{has been}} {{met with a}} {{generally}} mixed reception from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who reviewed the album for Allmusic.com, gave the album a negative review, stating that [...] "Miranda winds up buried underneath the weight of production on Sparks Fly — it often comes across like a cross of Miley Cyrus and Kesha’s full-frontal assault." [...] Erlewine also stated that [...] "Sparks Fly is bedecked in modern electronic rhythms and icy hooks, yet the glassy <b>surface</b> <b>sheen</b> {{flies in the face}} of the natural charm Cosgrove displays on iCarly and its accompanying soundtrack." [...] However, Jeff Giles of Popdose gave the album a more positive review, stating [...] "...Sparks Fly is a perfectly bite-sized chunk of perfectly bite-sized pop - In other words, songs about boys and girls, written by men and women, and performed by some of the sharpest studio vets in the business." [...] Greg Victor of Parcbench also gave the album, as well as Cosgrove herself, a positive review, stating [...] "It is brilliantly produced and won’t let you down if you are looking for some fun, new, uncomplicated music." [...] He also commented on Cosgrove as an artist, saying [...] "She is a fresh voice that stands out in an over-crowded field of pop princesses." [...] The review ended with Victor awarding the album three out of four stars. Sparklingstar.net also gave the album a positive review, and stated that [...] "Sparks Fly has that classic pop album sound and songs, if you are a fan of Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears you will be fan of Miranda, one thing I must say is that her voice sounds great throughout the entire CD, and she took it to find songs that fit her voice." ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{examination}} {{and treatment of}} the Worcester ArtMuseum’s Reclining Nude, c. 1925, oil on canvas, by theDutch-born Fauve artist Kees Van Dongen (1877 - 1968) indicatethat the artist used unorthodox materials and techniques,including selective varnishing to adjust color saturationand <b>surface</b> <b>sheen.</b> Examination also revealed resinlikebeads exuded from unvarnished passages of paint consideredartist-applied retouches. ATR-FTIR micro-spectroscopyof the exudate suggests the presence of gum arabicand sucrose, two common components in watercolorformulations. In order to verify the presence of gum arabicin the exudate, a newly developed ELISA protocol wasused, which confirmed the presence of gum arabic. Thismay indicate that the artist modified his oil paint withgouache or watercolor, ultimately resulting in phase separationand subsequent beading up of water-soluble componentsfrom within the paint’s predominantly oil component. The identification of water-soluble materials within an otherwisenon-water-soluble paint surface proved critical informulating an appropriate cleaning approach.

5000|$|Reception by the car-buying {{public and}} {{automotive}} magazines was mixed. Although the early vehicles had impressive waiting lists of anxious consumers, the MSRP sticker price of $25,000 ($68,000 in 2015 dollars) was cost-prohibitive {{for the majority}} of the market — especially for what many considered to be an under-powered and impractical plaything. [...] "It's not a barn burner," [...] observed Road & Track, [...] "(with) a 0-60 mph time of 10.5 seconds. Frankly, that's not quick for a sports/GT car in this price category." [...] The stainless steel body panels were an attractive design concept and impervious to corrosion, but in practice the <b>sheen</b> <b>surface</b> tended to show fingerprints. It also meant that the car could not be easily painted; every factory original DeLorean looked virtually identical. Some dealerships painted their cars on delivery to help make theirs more distinctive. DMC was testing the use of translucent paint to help provide different color options on the cars while also allowing the stainless steel grain to show through, but no cars were sold with factory painted body panels. The only factory option initially available was an automatic transmission. A grey interior was offered later in 1981 as an alternative to the standard black interior. Several accessories including pinstriping and luggage racks helped provide further individuality.|$|R
40|$|Jennifer Jae GutierrezInkjet {{prints are}} a new medium {{in the field of}} art {{conservation}} in relation to other art forms. In order to establish why inkjet prints should be cared for, familiarity with the history and current uses of inkjet prints is necessary. An understanding of the materials which create inkjet prints is essential in determining protocol for their care and treatment. Inkjet prints may be damaged by a variety of sources, and the longevity of inkjet prints may vary based upon which combination of materials has been chosen. Establishing protocol for surface cleaning inkjet prints is a need within the field of art conservation, and was determined to be the goal of this project. The materials tested are widely used to create fine-art inkjet prints. The Epson Stylus Pro 4800 printer was chosen for this reason, and because it employs the K 3 Ultrachrome ink set, which is pigment based. Two different microporous inkjet papers, Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster and Ilford Galerie Gold Fibre Silk, were tested. A digital file, or ???target,??? was designed using well-known color space values, and used to create twelve sample prints. Preliminary quantitative measurements of changes in color were made, as well as qualitative analysis of <b>surface</b> <b>sheen</b> and dye migration. This analysis was repeated after testing. The cleaning solutions tested were deionized water, a water and ethanol solution, and a PhotoFlo and water solution. These materials were chosen because they are common cleaning agents which are likely {{to be found in the}} labs of most photograph conservators. Two cleaning techniques were tested; application with a cotton swab and full immersion. Results suggest that two of the cleaning materials used may be acceptable for future treatment of inkjet prints. Ethanol and water was determined to be inappropriate for cleaning the inkjet materials tested in this study, and immersion was determined to be inappropriate for prints created on Ilford Galerie Gold Fibre Silk. Cleaning with cotton swabs produced noticeable changes in <b>surface</b> <b>sheen</b> in paper white areas, but this technique may be acceptable for image areas. Further research of alternative cleaning methods and materials is suggested to yield conclusive results. Alumni Relations at the University of Delaware and Undergraduate Research Program.
