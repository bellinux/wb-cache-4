25|$|Inayat Khan insisted adamantly {{that she}} wanted to go and was {{competent}} for the work. Her only concern, she said, was her family, and Vera sensed immediately that this was, as she had suspected, where the problem lay. Inayat Khan had found saying goodbye to her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, she said. As Vera had advised her, she had told her mother only half the truth: she had <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1929, {{the lovers}} {{returned}} to New York where Josephine <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to return to}} Boston and her husband. Crosby's friend Hart Crane threw a party that evening to celebrate his completion {{after seven years of}} his poem, The Bridge. The Black Sun Press was scheduled to publish it the next week, and he wanted to bid Crosby and Caresse bon voyage, since they were due to sail back to France the next week. Among the guests present were Margaret Robson, Malcolm Cowley, Walker Evans, E. E. Cummings, and William Carlos Williams. The party went on until nearly dawn. Crosby and Caresse made plans to see Crane again before they left for Europe on December 10 to attend the popular Broadway play Berkeley Square.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, right then and there... She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to be a movie}} star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E

50|$|Jin-soo {{put on her}} husband's coat, {{and asked}} him to dine with her for lunch that day. Her husband refuted and decided to hold it on another day. Jin-soo {{arranged}} it at his company, and <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> for a holiday. Jin-soo offered to shorten the holiday after he <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> only <b>going</b> on a holiday.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that, II believe I cannot say," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on, but stopped. Then she added, {{almost as}} if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> saying it to herself, [...] "Still, it was an {{improvement}} on yours!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... etc. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to be the}} [...] "Wicked Witch of the West" [...] in [...] "What Can I Wear For Halloween" [...] but {{she went}} as a girly rabbit instead of a witch. She had purple-rimmed-glasses with orange flowers on it on [...] "I Really Absolutely Must Have Glasses" [...] Sometimes she is seen with Evie.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, {{after the}} police {{investigation}} concluded, Lieberman filed a court petition in New York County Surrogate's Court, which handles probate matters, {{to have his}} wife declared {{a victim of the}} attacks regardless of what the police had said. New York state law requires [...] "clear and convincing" [...] evidence of a possible victim's exposure to any lethal peril in order for any presumption of death and subsequent legal provisions, including benefits from the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, to apply. He believed that his wife's profession would have led her to rush to the nearby World Trade Center, if she was in the vicinity, and offer aid to victims. Her mother further testified to their online chat, in which she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to check out Windows on the World and possibly do some shopping at the Trade Center's mall. The author of the police report testified that he believed Philip probably died in the attacks.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I see her now and then. Only {{the other}} day I met her in a store. Daren, she's getting some sense. She has a better {{position}} now. And <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> with any fellow but Harry." ...|$|R
50|$|While on the show, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> {{to medical}} school {{if she did not}} win the competition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> home?" [...] said Mrs. Banks’s brother-in-law, in an awful voice, {{as the old}} lady sank back in her chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Into a convent!" [...] Newman {{repeated}} the words with the deepest dismay; {{it was as}} if she had <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> into an hospital. [...] "Into a convent--YOU!" ...|$|E
60|$|After dinner Mrs. Yoop {{took a big}} fiddle from a big {{cupboard}} {{and played}} such loud and dreadful music that her prisoners were all thankful when at last she stopped and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to bed.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in Kazan <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to start studying international relations at Beijing University in September. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> glad China was moving away from its one-child policy, {{she would have liked}} to have had a brother or sister, and she knew of women who had been forced to have abortions.|$|R
60|$|Upon this, Mrs. Ellison <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to {{give her}} a good scolding for her nonsense, and pulled her down and kissed her, and <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> had not done anything, and was, nevertheless, consoled at her resolve to expiate her offence by {{respecting}} thenceforward Mr. Arbuton's foibles and prejudices.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't say any more, Mr. Jolliffe, don't!' <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> choking. 'You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to marry}} Joanna next month, {{and it is}} wrong to--to--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{birds that}} {{happened}} to be hanging round. And the scenery, and {{all that sort of}} thing. And she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to London, and asked me to look her up if I was ever there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was at {{her usual}} place at the top {{roulette}} table, but she gave it up just as I passed, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to walk about," [...] the young man replied. [...] "I don't think she has left yet." ...|$|E

6000|$|When Bartley's article came out, {{she read}} {{it with a}} fond admiration which all her praises seemed to leave unsaid.

[...] "What <b>are</b> you <b>going</b> to write the next thing?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> away and--on Christmas Eve we met {{there in}} the Dead Church.

50|$|Explaining {{her move}} in her statement, the 27-year-old said the larger scale of work, {{managerial}} duties and budgets involved {{will be her}} “training for the challenges of public service”.

6000|$|... "She doesn't {{know any}} more about art," [...] said Alma, [...] "than--nothing at all. But she's jolly and good-hearted. She praised {{everything}} that was bad in my sketches, and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to take lessons herself.

60|$|Aunt Jennie felt {{a little}} worried--as much as she could feel worried over anything--and she tried her best to dissuade Kate, {{although}} she plainly {{did not have much}} hope of doing so, having had enough experience with her determined daughter to realize that when Kate <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do a thing she did it. It was rather funny to listen to the ensuing dialogue.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} this, Amy gave her good words, and {{concealed}} her resentment {{as much as}} she could; and when she talked of going to her lodging, Amy smiled and said nothing, but called for a pair of oars to go to Greenwich; and asked her, seeing she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to her lodging, to go along with her, for she was going home, and was all alone.|$|E

60|$|In {{that book}} {{which she and}} her simple old friend had read so much together, she had seen and taken to her young heart the image of one who loved the little child; and, as she gazed and mused, He had ceased to be an image {{and a picture of}} the distant past, and come to be a living, all-surrounding reality. His love enfolded her childish heart with more than mortal tenderness; and it was to Him, she <b>said,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> and to his home.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Henry had {{a little}} table at the window, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> busy at her work. There was a basket {{on the floor by}} her side. Malleville was sitting upon the step.
