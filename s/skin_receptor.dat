These cells were easily distinguished from other epithelial cell types, including melanocytes and Langerhans cells and had all the morphologic features of Merkel cells and their so-called neurite complexes, including the characteristic cytoplasmic secretory granules (60 nm in diameter).

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we propose an MR (magnetic resonance) {{compatible}} electrocutaneous stimulator able to inject an electric current, variable in amplitude and frequency, into the fingertips in order to elicit tactile <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> (mechanoreceptors). The desired goal is to evoke specific tactile sensations selectively stimulating <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> {{by means of an}} electric current in place of mechanical stimuli. The field of application ranges from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tactile studies to augmented reality technology. The device here proposed is designed using safety criteria in order to comply with the threshold of voltage and current permitted by regulations. Moreover, MR safety and compatibility criteria were considered in order to perform experiments inside the MR scanner during an fMRI acquisition for functional brain activation analysis. Psychophysical laboratory tests are performed in order to define the different evoked tactile sensation. After verifying the device MR safety and compatibility on a phantom, a test on a human subject during fMRI acquisition is performed to visualize the brain areas activated by the simulated tactile sensation...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} the number and distribution of substance P binding sites in the <b>skin.</b> <b>Receptor</b> autoradiography was employed to detect and quantitate substance P receptors in normal as well as psoriatic skin. Substance P binding sites were distributed in the epidermis and dermis both in normal and psoriatic skin. In the dermis, the highest densities of SP binding sites were found in the areas corresponding to the dermal papillae and the adnexal structures. Quantitative analysis revealed that saturable binding was obtained both in the epidermis and in the labeled dermal areas. Rosenthal plot values were consistent with a single population of binding sites. No difference in the binding measurements was observed between normal and psoriatic skin.

40|$|A {{subgroup}} of the TNF receptor family, composed of Edar, Troy and Xedar, are {{implicated in the}} development of ectodermal appendages, such as hair follicles, teeth and sweat glands. We have isolated chicken orthologues of these three receptors and analysed their roles in early feather development. Conservation of protein sequences between mammalian and avian proteins is variable, with avian Edar showing the greatest degree of sequence identity. cXedar differs from its mammalian orthologue in that it contains an intracellular death domain. All three receptors are expressed during early feather morphogenesis and dominant negative forms of each receptor impair the epithelial contribution to feather bud morphogenesis, while the dermal contribution appears unaffected. Hyperactivation of each receptor leads to more widespread assumption of placode fate, though in different regions of the <b>skin.</b> <b>Receptor</b> signaling converges on NF-κB, and inhibiting this transcription factor alters feather bud number and size in a stage-specific manner.

40|$|Background: Nonpainful tactile and {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} large myelinated fibers reduces spontaneous pain and the amplitude of laser-evoked potentials (LEPs), which represent the most reliable technique to assess the nociceptive pathway function. Focal mechanical vibration stimulates the Aβ afferents selectively; thus, it is conceivable its action on nociceptive pathways. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of vibratory stimuli, activating either both muscle and <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> or cutaneous afferents only on the LEPs and subjective laser-pain rating. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were studied. The subjects were evaluated in two different sessions to test muscle and <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> or cutaneous afferents only. In each session, LEPs were recorded to stimulation of the dorsal hand skin in radial and ulnar territory bilaterally, while the vibratory stimulus was delivered on the radial territory of the right forearm. Results: The results showed a substantial stability of the potential N 1 and N 2 /P 2 after the two protocols, with a declining trend from the initial to the last test of the same session, probably due to habituation. Accordingly, the laser-pain perception did not change during the experimental setting.

40|$|Risk {{assessment}} of dermal exposure to chemicals requires percutaneous absorption data {{to link the}} external exposure to the systemic uptake. The most reliable data on percutaneous absorption are obtained from in-vivo human volunteer studies. In addition to ethical constrains, the conduct of these studies is not feasible for {{the large number of}} industrial chemicals in use today. Therefore, there is an increasing need for alternative methods to determine percutaneous absorption such as in-vitro assays and methods performed in vivo in experimental animals. In this article, recent comparative in-vitro and in-vivo studies on percutaneous absorption have been addressed with emphasis on the factors that may affect the predictive value of the in-vitro models. Furthermore, the use of animal models, in particular the rat skin, in prediction of percutaneous absorption in the human skin has been reviewed. In-vitro assays showed to be largely influenced by the experimental circumstances, such as type and thickness of the <b>skin,</b> <b>receptor</b> fluid, {{and the way in which}} percutaneous absorption is calculated. Rat skin showed consistently to be more permeable than human skin. However, the difference between human and rat skin does not show a consistent pattern between chemicals hampering prediction of human percutaneous absorption. To increase predictive value of in-vitro and animal models, the influence of experimental factors on the percutaneous absorption should be systematically investigated by comparison with human in-vivo data, resulting in more prescriptive guideline...|$|E
40|$|To {{document}} {{the activity of}} cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin of the foot sole, tungsten microelectrodes were inserted through the popliteal fossa and into the tibial nerve of thirteen healthy human subjects. A total of 104 cutaneous mechanoreceptors were identified in the glabrous skin of the foot. This sample consisted of 15 slow adapting type I (14 %), 16 slow adapting type II (15 %), 59 fast adapting type I (57 %), and 14 fast adapting type II units (14 %). The location of the receptors and {{the outline of the}} receptive fields were determined by using nylon monofilaments perpendicularly applied against the surface of the skin. This revealed that the receptors were widely distributed without an accumulation of receptors in the toes. There were also larger receptive fields predominantly isolated on the plantar surface of the metatarsal-tarsal region of the foot sole. Furthermore, with the foot in an unloaded position, there was no background discharge activity in any of the cutaneous receptors in the absence of intentionally applied stimulation. These findings suggest that <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> in the foot sole behave differently from those receptors found on the glabrous skin of the hand.

40|$|Our {{thesis is}} that {{proprioception}} {{is not a}} sixth sense distinct from the sense of touch, but {{a part of that}} tactile (or haptic) sense. The tactile sense is defined as the sense whose direct intentional objects are macroscopic mechanical properties. We first argue (against D. Armstrong, 1962; B. O'Shaughnessy 1989, 1995, 1998 and M. Martin, 1992, 1993, 1995) that the two following claims are incompatible : (i) proprioception is a sense distinct from touch; (ii) touch is a bipolar modality, that intrinsically has both a subjective-bodily pole and objective pole. We then argue that the bipolarity of touch should be preferred over the introduction of a sui generis sense of the body. We try to revive Aristotle suggestion according to which the body is the tactile medium (like the air for sight). Since this medium is constantly changing its shape, we need some specific channel of information about its state : proprioception, functionally defined, is that part of touch which informs us about the state of this changing tactile medium. Though muscular and articular receptors are usually dedicated to inform us about the mechanical properties of the tactile media, and the <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> about the mechanical properties of the tactile objects, this is not essentially so. In weighting or wielding experiments we access the weight of external objects even when skin sensitivity is absent; in prosthetic touch, the <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> play the role usually assigned to muscle and articular receptors, namely to inform us about the mechanical state of the tactile medium. So proprioception, anatomically defined, can play both the role of informing us about the tactile medium, or about the tactile objects. That other sensory modalities also rely on proprioceptive information should be understood in terms of cross-modal dependencies: of sight, hearing, smell, taste [...] . on touch...|$|R

40|$|The {{shape of}} objects cannot only be {{recognized}} by vision, but also by touch. Vision has the advantage that shapes {{can be seen at}} a distance, but touch has the advantage that during exploration many additional object properties become available, such as temperature (Jones, 2009), texture (Bensmaia, 2009), and weight (Jones, 1986). Moreover, also the invisible backside of the objects can provide shape information (Newell et al., 2001). In active touch, both the cuteanous sense (input from <b>skin</b> <b>receptors)</b> and the kinesthetic sense (input from receptors located in muscles, tendons, and joints) play a role. For such active tactual perception, the term “haptic perception” is used (Loomis and Lederman, 1986). Typical exploratory movements to determine shape by touch are “enclosure” for global shape and size, and “contour following” for exact shape (Lederman and Klatzky, 1987; Klatzky and Reed, 2009).

Furthermore, Mg+ 2 depresses synaptic transmission in medium receptors, and has little effect on transmission in large receptors.

This study was aimed to investigate in rats whether the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (TMnu), which provides proprioceptive feedback for chewing muscles, may be also involved in whisker pad proprioception.

This double-labeling technique was used to assess the co-innervation of both structures by the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (TMnu). In a separate group of anesthetized animals, the spontaneous electrical activities of TMnu neurons were analyzed by extracellular recordings during spontaneous movements of the macrovibrissae.

40|$|Locomotion is an {{integral}} part of a whole range of animal behaviours. The basic rhythm for lo-comotion in vertebrates has been shown to arise from local networks residing in the spinal cord and these networks are known as central pattern generators (CPGs). However, during the loco-motion, these centres are constantly interacting with the sensory feedback signals coming from muscles, joints and peripheral <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> in order to adapt the stepping or swimming to vary-ing environmental conditions. Conceptual models of vertebrate locomotion have been constructed using mathematical models of locomotor subsystems based on the neurophysiological evidence obtained primarily in the cat and the salamander, an amphibian with a sprawling posture. Such models provide opportunity for studying the key elements in the transition from aquatic to ter-restrial locomotion. Several aspects of locomotor control using the cat or the salamander as an animal model have been investigated employing computer simulations and here we use the same approach to address a number of questions or/and hypotheses related to rhythmic locomotion in quadrupeds.

40|$|This book {{chapter is}} in closed access. The ability to {{perceive}} skin wetness {{represents one of}} the numerous somatosensory features of the skin. Although the ability to sense skin wetness and humidity is critical for behavioral and autonomic adaptations, humans are not provided with specific <b>skin</b> <b>receptors</b> for sensing wetness. Hence, the ability to sense skin wetness has been suggested to rely on a complex multisensory integration of thermal (i. e., heat transfer) and tactile (i. e., mechanical pressure and skin friction) inputs generated by the interaction between skin, moisture, and (if donned) clothing. Recent evidence has confirmed this hypothesis, and the first neurophysiological model of human skin wetness perception, which helps explain how humans sense cold, neutral, and warm wetness on their skin, has been recently developed. This chapter presents the state of the current knowledge about the neurophysiological and psychophysical bases of humans’ ability to perceive skin wetness, along with an overview of the most recent methods used to assess this sensory feature of the human skin. Also, a practical outline of a typical experimental protocol, as used in the assessment of skin wetness perception, is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} whether dynamic position sense at the ankle [...] or sense of position and velocity during movement [...] shows a similar decline {{as a result}} of aging as previously described for static position sense and movement detection threshold. Additionally, the involvement of muscle spindle afferents in the possible age-related decline was studied. To assess dynamic position sense, blindfolded subjects had to open the hand briskly when the right ankle was rotating passively through a prescribed target angle. To assess the involvement of muscle spindles, the effect of tibialis anterior vibration was studied. The results showed that aging lead to a significant increase in deviation from the target angle at hand opening as well as in variability of performance. Vibration resulted in larger undershoot errors in the elderly compared to the young adults, suggesting that the age-related decline in performance on the dynamic position sense task is not (solely) due to muscle spindle function changes. Alternatively, this degeneration might be due to altered input from other sources of proprioceptive input, such as <b>skin</b> <b>receptors.</b> The elderly subjects did show a beneficial effect of practice with the task, which may provide solid fundaments for rehabilitation. status: publishe...|$|R
