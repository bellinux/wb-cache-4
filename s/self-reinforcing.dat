5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a <b>self-reinforcing</b> and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a <b>self-reinforcing</b> feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E

40|$|<b>Self-reinforced</b> {{polypropylene}} is a {{very tough}} material. It is even thought that its impact resistance increases with decreasing temperature. This was investigated by examining the constituent tapes and matrix. Tensile tests on both drawn polypropylene tapes and <b>self-reinforced</b> polypropylene were similar: the stiffness increased and the failure strain slightly decreased at low temperatures. The matrix, however, embrittled below room temperature due to the glass transition. In contrast with literature data on Izod impact resistance, the penetration impact resistance did not increase at low temperatures. At lower temperatures, the damaged area after non-penetration impact was significantly reduced. This {{was caused by a}} change in the damage mode from tape–matrix debonding to matrix cracking, as the matrix went through its glass transition.

Therefore, the influence of compaction temperature, dwell time and the application of interleaved films on the tensile and impact properties was assessed.
