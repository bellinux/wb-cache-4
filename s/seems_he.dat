5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> is expecting every piece of evidence they have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Sir James, Mac Fhirbhisigh may have {{travelled}} to Gort, seeking patronage from Diarmuid Ó Seachnasaigh (Sir Dermot O Shaughnessey), as indicated by a poem he apparently composed in 1667. It is thought that also in this year or shortly after he obtained {{a copy of the}} important early Irish law tract, Senchas Már. It <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> also travelled to Larne in County Antrim, seeking patronage from Randall MacDonnell, Marquess of Antrim. Here it <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> left or sold about twelve or more manuscripts to a local bard, Eoin Ó Gnímh.|$|E

25|$|Mars Rigonemetis ("King of the Sacred Grove"). A {{dedication}} to Rigonemetis and the numen (spirit) of the Emperor inscribed {{on a stone}} was discovered at Nettleham (Lincolnshire) in 1961. Rigonemetis is only known from this site, and it <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> {{may have been a}} god belonging to the tribe of the Corieltauvi.|$|E
25|$|The {{story was}} even told that Titus was {{reclining}} next to Britannicus, {{the night he}} was murdered, and sipped of the poison that was handed to him.

25|$|From 1814, Keats had two bequests, held {{in trust}} for him until his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his {{grandfather}} John Jennings (about £50,000 in today's money) and {{a portion of his}} mother's legacy, £8000 (about £500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children. It <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware. William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> did not. The money would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.|$|E

Mansa Abubakari's mother was Namandjé, the third wife of Maghan Kon Fatta. Prior to becoming mansa, Abubakari {{had been one of}} his brother's generals and later his kankoro-sigui. Little else is known about the reign of Abubakari I, but it <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was successful in stopping the hemorrhaging of wealth in the empire.|$|E
25|$|During {{his office}} as vicarius Africae he {{received}} a law against Donatism; however it <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> somehow sided with the Donatists, if in 405 Augustine of Hippo misbelieved him a Donatist. In this office he, together with Decimius Hilarianus Hesperius, {{was in charge of}} the investigations around a scandal involving the city of Leptis Magna, but his conclusions, included into a report, had the citizens cleared of the charges and not guilty; afterwards the citizens of Leptis Magna erected him a statue.|$|E

After October 1041, Guaimar ceases {{to appear in the}} acts of Gaeta and it <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was {{replaced}} by a popular usurper related to the old dynasty, Leo. By December 1042, however, Gaeta was in the hands of Rainulf, holding it from Guaimar.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Sasha Sokolov:It <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was only really {{appreciated}} by professionals. Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally. I can {{understand the value of}} his texts, but I don't understand how they were made.|$|E
25|$|Captain 1st rank Rudolph Nikitovich Yurasov (17.04.1932, as per {{another source}} in 1935 {{approximately}} - late 1985) was the Deputy {{head of the}} Department of Administrative organs of the CPSU Central Committee. He {{was in charge of}} the defense complex, particularly the Navy. He know about some plans of Yuriy Andropov, KGB and Intelligence activity of the Soviet Union. <b>Seems,</b> <b>he</b> was close to Andropov. In late 1985 he was found dead in his office, which was locked from the inside. The cause of death has not been established.|$|E

25|$|Evans {{was educated}} at Cheltenham College, Rugby School and Exeter College, Oxford, {{from where he}} {{graduated}} with a third in Classical Moderations and it <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> devoted {{most of his time}} to games. He made his first-class debut for Oxford University against MCC at Magdalen College in 1863 and was awarded his blue that year, top-scoring with 25 in Oxford' first innings at Lord's. He won blues in the subsequent two seasons and in the match against Cambridge in 1865 he made his highest first-class score of 43. In that season he was also selected for the Gentlemen versus Players in {{what turned out to be}} his final first-class appearance and he returned his best bowling figures of 5-32.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1256 (probably in December), a {{group of}} boyars, who had decided to kill Tsar Michael and replace him with his first cousin, Koloman, {{attacked}} the former, who died soon afterwards from his wounds. To further his claims, Koloman II forcibly married Michael’s widow, the daughter of Rostislav, {{but he could not}} consolidate power and was killed almost immediately. To protect his daughter, Rostislav now, early in 1257, invaded Bulgaria; it <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was using her as an excuse to acquire the Bulgarian throne for himself. Rostislav appeared at the gates of Tărnovo and recovered his daughter; though it is sometimes stated that he briefly obtained Tărnovo, but it seems that he probably never actually gained possession of the city.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 1856, Murphy {{attached}} to the 17th Lancers, who were now en route from the Crimea, via Ismid in Turkey, to help contain {{the early stages of}} the Indian Mutiny. It <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> intended to catch up with his regiment in India. Something must have affected this plan, since on 18 October 1856, he joined the 2nd Battalion Military Train (later the Royal Army Service Corps and nowadays the Royal Logistic Corps) instead. In March 1857, Murphy left the Curragh Camp and boarded the steamer Calypso at Dublin bound for Woolwich. On 28 April, he embarked for Hong Kong. On reaching Indonesia, the battalion was diverted to Calcutta on news of the Indian Mutiny. They arrived in Calcutta on 27 August, and after a series of moves were deployed to relieve Lucknow. The battalion was subsumed into the Azimghur Field Force on 29 March 1858.|$|E

25|$|From 1491 to 1518, Kynaston {{supposedly}} lived a {{life that}} would match the fictional character Robin Hood. It <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> {{had a reputation for}} robbing from the rich, and giving to the poor. In return, the locals protected him, and gave him and his horse ('Beelzebub') food. One time, in an attempt to capture Kynaston, the local sheriff removed several planks from Montford Bridge, to keep him from crossing the River Severn, but his horse managed to leap and safely clear the distance. It is also said that he was a regular patron at the Old Three Pigeons tavern at Nesscliffe in Shropshire, and his original seat is still there. He may have been pardoned by Henry VII in 1493, but some accounts state that in 1513, Humphrey provided 100 men to aid Henry VIII in France, and in return received a royal pardon 3 to 5 years later.|$|E
25|$|The reports {{created a}} sensation. Oliver was not slow to try adrenal {{extracts}} in patients, orally again and rather indiscriminately, from Addison's disease, hypotension (″loss of vasomotor tone″), Diabetes mellitus and Diabetes insipidus to Graves' disease (″exophthalmic goitre″). It <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> adhered to contemporary ideas of organotherapy, believing that powerful substances existed in tissues {{and ought to}} be discovered for medicinal use. In fact he immediately went on to extract the pituitary gland and, again with Schäfer, discovered vasopressin. In 1903 adrenaline, meanwhile purified, was first used in asthma. The use was based, not on the bronchodilator effect, which was discovered later, but on the vasoconstrictor effect, which was hoped to alleviate the “turgidity of the bronchial mucosa” – presumably vascular congestion and edema. Also as of 1903, adrenaline was added to local anesthetic solutions. The surgeon Heinrich Braun in Leipzig showed that it prolonged the anesthesia at the injection site and simultaneously reduced ″systemic″ effects elsewhere in the body.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus applied his {{knowledge}} of spherical angles {{to the problem of}} denoting locations on the Earth's surface. Before him a grid system had been used by Dicaearchus of Messana, but Hipparchus was the first to apply mathematical rigor to the determination of the latitude and longitude of places on the Earth. Hipparchus wrote a critique in three books on the work of the geographer Eratosthenes of Cyrene (3rd century), called Pròs tèn 'Eratosthénous geografían ("Against the Geography of Eratosthenes"). It is known to us from Strabo of Amaseia, who in his turn criticised Hipparchus in his own Geografia. Hipparchus apparently made many detailed corrections to the locations and distances mentioned by Eratosthenes. It <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> did not introduce many improvements in methods, but he did propose a means to determine the geographical longitudes of different cities at lunar eclipses (Strabo Geografia 1 January 2012). A lunar eclipse is visible simultaneously on half of the Earth, and the difference in longitude between places can be computed from the difference in local time when the eclipse is observed. His approach would give accurate results if it were correctly carried out but the limitations of timekeeping accuracy in his era made this method impractical.|$|E
