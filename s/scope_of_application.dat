25|$|The <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> for DC {{capacitors}} {{is similarly}} diverse. Smoothing capacitors {{are used to}} reduce the AC component of fluctuating DC voltage (such as in power supplies for radio and television transmitters), and for high voltage testing equipment, DC controllers, measurement and control technology and cascaded circuits for generation of high DC voltage. Supporting capacitors, DC-filter or buffer circuit capacitors are used for energy storage in intermediate DC circuits, such as in frequency converters for poly-phase drives, and transistor and thyristor power converters. They {{must be able to}} absorb and release very high currents within short periods, the peak values of currents being substantially greater than the RMS values.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePolylactide (PLA) is a {{bio-based}} and compostable aliphatic polyester {{that has}} gained widespread interest {{during the last}} decades due to its promising technical substitution potential. Its good mechanical properties comparable to some mainstream petroleum based thermoplastics are however counterbalanced by its inherent brittleness that limits its <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications.</b> Toughening <b>of</b> PLA by blending with a rubber phase is the most used solution to reduce its brittleness because of economical and practical advantages that offers this modification pathway. In this study, we investigated by melt-blending, {{the use of a}} thermoplastic elastomer poly(ester-amide) (PEA), synthesized from fatty acid-based precursors, as an impact modifier of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA). This PEA demonstrated an effective rubber-toughening of PLLA.
