Research was carried out on two previously prepared commercial parsnip samples, both fresh and cooked for 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. Hardness was measured using a TA. XTPlus Texture Analyzer, equipped with different fixtures and load cells. Penetration test was performed on the parsnip discs, while the instrument was equipped with a 5 kg load cell and a 2 mm diameter stainless steel flat cylinder probe. <b>Shearing</b> <b>test</b> was conducted on the whole parsnip roots with a 30 kg load cell and Warner-Bratzler (WB) flat knife blade.

40|$|Shear {{strength}} of soil {{is characterized by}} cohesion, {{angle of internal friction}} and dilatation. The first two parameters mentioned primarily define the soil's ability to resist shear stress underspecified load. These parameters can be determined by tests conducted either in the laboratory or the field for use in design of geotechnical structures. Some of the tests in the laboratory to determine the shear {{strength of}} soil, include triaxial, ring shear, torsional shear, direct shear and direct simple <b>shear.</b> Direct <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> is the most widely used geotechnical shear device due to its simplicity, however, the test suffers from stress inhomogeneity. Direct simple shear apparatus was developed because of the shortcomings in the direct <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> In these two <b>tests,</b> different <b>shearing</b> conditions are applied to soil samples. For the direct <b>shear</b> <b>test,</b> <b>shearing</b> occurs at a predetermined center of the specimen which may not be the weakest plane of the soil while indirect simple shear, the entire specimen distorts without the formation of single shearing surface. The mode of shearing established in the direct simple shear device is similar to that which occurs around the shaft of a pile. In contrast to the extensive geotechnical application of direct <b>shear</b> <b>test,</b> limited information exists on direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> This thesis endeavours to establish {{the relationship between the two}} tests by undertaking extensive testing to obtain a better understanding of direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> as used for testing local soils and to determine a correlation with the results from direct <b>shear</b> <b>tests.</b> A series of <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> were undertaken on Klipheuwel sand, Kaolin clay and composite of the sand and clay using universal shear device. The soils were mixed with water in percentages of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %, and the composite with clay percentages of 10, 25, 50 and 75 %, to investigate the impact of water and clay on the shear parameters determined from the two tests. The results showed that direct <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> gives higher <b>shear</b> strength when compared to direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> under the same soil condition. The addition of water, and clay, generally reduced the internal friction angle of sand for both tests. Furthermore, increase in cohesion was observed with the addition of water to Kaolin clay for the direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> and the reverse was true in the direct <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> The correlation factors developed in this study for the direct simple <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> could be used to refine the results from the direct <b>shear</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

Even at fast displacement rates, constant volume conditions are not achieved in the direct shear device because of changes in specimen height that are large relative to allowable ASTM thresholds for constant volume simple <b>shear</b> <b>testing.</b> However, undrained strengths established by constant volume simple <b>shear</b> <b>testing</b> at slow strain rates are well approximated by direct <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> conducted at fast shear displacement rates (time to failure < t 50 / 8, where t 50 =time to 50 % consolidation in a conventional oedometer test).
