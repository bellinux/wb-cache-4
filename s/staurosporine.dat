50|$|<b>Staurosporine</b> is the {{precursor}} {{of the novel}} protein kinase inhibitor midostaurin (PKC412). Besides midostaurin, <b>staurosporine</b> is also used as a starting material in the commercial synthesis of K252c (also called <b>staurosporine</b> aglycone). In the natural biosynthetic pathway, K252c is a precursor of <b>staurosporine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The main {{biological}} activity of <b>staurosporine</b> is the inhibition of protein kinases through {{the prevention of}} ATP binding to the kinase. This is achieved through the stronger affinity of <b>staurosporine</b> to the ATP-binding site on the kinase. <b>Staurosporine</b> is a prototypical ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor in that it binds to many kinases with high affinity, though with little selectivity. Structural analysis of kinase pockets demonstrated that main chain atoms which are conserved in their relative positions to <b>staurosporine</b> contributes to <b>staurosporine</b> promiscuity. This lack of specificity has precluded its clinical use, but has made it a valuable research tool. In research, <b>staurosporine</b> is used to induce apoptosis. The mechanism of how it mediates this is not well understood. It {{has been found that}} one way in which <b>staurosporine</b> induces apoptosis is by activating caspase-3.At lower concentration, depending on the cell type, <b>staurosporine</b> induces specific cell cycle effects arresting cells in G1 or G2 phases of the cycle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Staurosporine</b> is an indolocarbazole. It {{belongs to}} the most {{frequently}} isolated group of indolocarbazoles: Indolo(2,3-a)carbazoles. Of these, <b>Staurosporine</b> falls within the most common subgroup, called Indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles. These fall into two classes - halogenated (chlorinated) and non-halogenated. Halogenated indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles have a fully oxidized C-7 carbon with only one indole nitrogen containing a Î²-glycosidic bond, while non-halogenated indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles have both indole nitrogens glycosylated, and a fully reduced C-7 carbon. <b>Staurosporine</b> is in the non-halogenated class.|$|E

50|$|This is {{followed}} by a nucleophilic attack between the indole nitrogens resulting in cyclization and then decarboxylation assisted by StaC exclusively forming <b>staurosporine</b> aglycone or K252c. Glucose is transformed to NTP-L-ristoamine by StaA/B/E/J/I/K which is then added on to the <b>staurosporine</b> aglycone at 1 indole N by StaG. The StaN enzyme reorients the sugar by attaching it to the 2nd indole nitrogen into an unfavored conformation to form intermediated O-demethyl-N-demethyl-staurosporine. Lastly, O-methylation of the 4'amine by StaMA and N-methylation of the 3'-hydroxy by StaMB leads to the formation of <b>staurosporine.</b>|$|E

50|$|When {{encapsulated}} in liposome nanoparticle, <b>staurosporine</b> {{is shown}} to suppress tumors in vivo in a mouse model without the toxic side effects which have prohibited its use as an anti-cancer drug with high apoptotic activity. Researchers in UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center develop a platform technology of high drug-loading efficiency by manipulating the pH environment of the cells. When injected into the mouse glioblastoma model, <b>staurosporine</b> is found to accumulate primarily in the tumor via fluorescence confirmation, and the mice did not suffer weight loss compared to the control mice administered with the free compound, an indicator of reduced toxicity.|$|E

In addition, ANT4 overexpression has been observed to protect cancer cells from induced apoptosis by anti-cancer drugs such as lonidamine and <b>staurosporine.</b>|$|E
50|$|K252a is an {{alkaloid}} {{isolated from}} Nocardiopisis bacteria. This <b>staurosporine</b> analog {{is a highly}} potent cell permeable inhibitor of CaM kinase and phosphorylase kinase (IC50 = 1.8 and 1.7 nmol/L, respectively).

50|$|Squamous {{metaplasia}} {{of breast}} epithelia {{is known to}} be more prevalent in postmenopausal women (where it does not cause any problems at all). <b>Staurosporine,</b> a nonspecific protein kinase C inhibitor can induce squamous metaplasia in breast tissue while other known PKC inhibitors did not show this effect. cAMP stimulation can also induce squamous metaplasia.|$|E
50|$|Rebeccamycin (NSC 655649) is a weak topoisomerase I {{inhibitor}} {{isolated from}} Streptomyces sp. It is structurally similar to <b>staurosporine,</b> {{but does not}} show any inhibitory activity against protein kinases. It shows significant antitumor properties in vitro (IC50=480nM against mouse B16 melanoma cells and IC50=500nM against P388 leukemia cells). It is an antineoplastic antibiotic and an intercalating agent.|$|E
5000|$|Lestaurtinib (rINN, codenamed CEP-701) is a {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor structurally related to <b>staurosporine.</b> This semisynthetic derivative of the indolocarbazole K252a was investigated by Cephalon {{as a treatment}} for various types of cancer.

50|$|Less commonly, streptomycetes produce {{compounds}} used {{in other}} medical treatments: migrastatin (from S. platensis) and bleomycin (from S. verticillus) are antineoplastic (anticancer) drugs; boromycin (from S. antibioticus) exhibits antiviral activity against the HIV-1 strain of HIV, as well as antibacterial activity. <b>Staurosporine</b> (from S. staurosporeus) also has a range of activities from antifungal to antineoplastic (via the inhibition of protein kinases).|$|E
50|$|Stauprimide is a semi-synthetic analog of the <b>staurosporine</b> {{family of}} indolocarbazoles. Stauprimide was first {{published}} in 1994 as part of an extensive structure-activity investigation to improve the selective inhibition of protein kinase C as a potential antitumor agent. More recently, stauprimide has been shown to increase the efficiency of the directed differentiation of mouse and human embryonic stem cells in synergy with defined extracellular signaling cues. Stauprimide interacts with NME2 (PUF) transcription factor to down-regulate c-Myc expression, leading to differentiation of stem cells.|$|E
5000|$|Balanol {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent, {{naturally}} occurring inhibitors of protein kinases PKC and PKA. Balanol was originally discovered to inhibit PKC and many of its isoforms in humans (Î±, Î²-Î, Î²-ÎÎ, Î³, Î´, Îµ, Î·), with an inhibition profile similar to that of <b>staurosporine.</b> [...] Balanol prevents functioning by binding competitively to the catalytic domain of PKC and PKA with an affinity (Ki â¥ 4nM) three orders of magnitude greater than for ATP. Without ATP bound, these kinases are unable to catalyze the transfer of the Î³-phosphate from ATP to the kinaseâs target substrate, and thus function is hindered.|$|E
50|$|The first {{isolated}} ICZ, dubbed <b>staurosporine</b> (STA) was in 1977 from {{a culture}} of Streptomyces staurosporeus found in a soil sample from Iwate Prefecture, Japan. The proper stereochemistry was not proven until 1994. Over {{the course of the}} next decade, further study of the compound showed some fungi inhibition, hypotensive activity, and most importantly, a broad protein kinase inhibitor. The next landmark discovery came with the detection of rebeccamycin (REB) in a sample of Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes, again in soil, but this time in a sample from Panama. REB was found to act against leukemia and melanoma in mice, and also against human adenocarcinoma cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>staurosporine</b> {{starts with}} the amino acid L-tryptophan in its zwitterionic form. Tryptophan is converted to an imine by enzyme StaO which is an L-amino acid oxidase (that may be FAD dependent). The imine is acted upon by StaD to form an uncharacterized intermediate proposed to be the dimerization product between 2 imine molecules. Chromopyrrolic acid is the molecule formed from this intermediate after the loss of VioE (used in the biosynthesis of violacein - a natural product formed from a branch point in this pathway that also diverges to form rebeccamycin. An aryl aryl coupling thought to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme to form an aromatic ring system occurs.|$|E
50|$|Hsp70 member proteins, {{including}} Hsp72, inhibit apoptosis {{by acting}} on the caspase-dependent pathway and against apoptosis-inducing agents such as tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNFÎ±), <b>staurosporine,</b> and doxorubicin. This role leads to its involvement in many pathological processes, such as oncogenesis, neurodegeneration, and senescence. In particular, overexpression of HSP72 {{has been linked to}} the development some cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancers, colon cancers, breast cancers, and lung cancers, which led to its use as a prognostic marker for these cancers. Elevated Hsp70 levels in tumor cells may increase malignancy and resistance to therapy by complexing, and hence, stabilizing, oncofetal proteins and products and transporting them into intracellular sites, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation. As a result, tumor vaccine strategies for Hsp70s have been highly successful in animal models and progressed to clinical trials. Alternatively, overexpression of Hsp70 can mitigate the effects of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimerâs disease, Parkinsonâs disease (PD), Huntingtonâs disease, and spinocerebellar ataxias, and aging and cell senescence, as observed in centenarians subjected to heat shock challenge. HSPA1L may fight against PD by co-regulating the translocation of parkin to damaged mitochondria, thus facilitating their removal.|$|E
5000|$|Cancer {{cell lines}} with {{downregulation}} of Sulf1 were investigated {{in the same}} fashion as ovarian cancer. Nine of 11 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines displayed either absent or severely reduced levels of Sulf1 mRNA. Less than half of HCC tumor samples showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and DNA methylation inhibition treatment of Sulf1 absent HCC cell lines reactivated the expression of Sulf1, indicating hypermethylation may be partly responsible for its downregulation. [...] As in ovarian cancer, loss of Sulf1 largely contributed to decreased HPSG sulfation in HCC. In addition, Sulf1 expression is required to suppress sustained activation of ERK1/2 and c-met by the heparin binding growth factors (HB-GF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), thereby decreasing cell proliferation. [...] In extension, Sulf1 mediated HCC cell apoptotic sensitivity to cisplatin and <b>staurosporine.</b> [...] As a review, HGF, or scatter factor, activates its receptor c-Met which activates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and PI3K signaling that are ultimately responsible for expression of proangiogenic factors, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). [...] The HGF/c-Met axis mediates the invasive growth phenotype necessary for metastasis through coordination of cell motility and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM).|$|E

In particular, Hsc70 plays a protective role in the aforementioned diseases, as well as in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Its protective role was further highlighted in a study that identified HSPA8 alongside other HSP70 proteins in a core sub-network of the wider chaperome interactome that functions as a proteostasis safeguard and that is repressed in aging brains and in the brains of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease patients.|$|E
