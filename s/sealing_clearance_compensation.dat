40|$|Wear {{and failure}} of {{mechanical}} seals may be critical in certain application {{and should be}} avoided. Large relative misalignment between the seal faces {{is the most likely}} cause for intermittent contact and the increased friction that eventually brings failure. Adjustment of <b>seal</b> <b>clearance</b> is probably the most readily implemented method of reducing the relative misalignment and the elimination of seal face contact during its operation. This method is demonstrated {{with the aid of a}} noncontacting flexibly mounted rotor (FMR) mechanical face seal test rig employing a cascade control scheme. Eddy current proximity probes measure the <b>seal</b> <b>clearance</b> directly. The inner loop controls the clearance, maintaining a desired gap through adjusting the air pressure in the rotor chamber of the seal. When contact is detected the outer loop adjusts the clearance set point according to variance differences in the probes signals. These differences in variance have been found to be a reliable quantitative indication for such contacts. They are complimentary to other more qualitative phenomenological indications, and provide the controlled variable data for the outer loop. Experiments are conducted to test and verify this active control scheme and strategy. Analysis and results both show that contrary to intuition for the seal under investigation reducing <b>seal</b> <b>clearance</b> can eliminate contact and the outer cascade loop indeed drives the control toward this solution. 1...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{evaluation}} under simulated engine conditions {{revealed that}} conventional mainshaft seals have disadvantages of high gas leakage rates and wear. An advanced seal concept, the self-acting face seal, {{has a much}} lower gas leakage rate and greater pressure and speed capability. In endurance tests (150 hr) to 43 200 rpm the self-acting seal wear was not measurable, indicating noncontact sealing operation was maintained even at this high rotative speed. A review of published data revealed that the leakage through gas path seals has {{a significant effect on}} TSFC, stall margin and engine maintenance. Reducing leakages by reducing <b>seal</b> <b>clearances</b> results in rubbing contact, and then the seal thermal response and wear determines the final <b>seal</b> <b>clearances.</b> The control of clearances requires a material with the proper combination of rub tolerance (abradability) and erosion resistance.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{superior}} performance and stable leakage characteristics, brush seal {{is one of}} the emerging seals to be used in oil and oil mist applications in aero-engines and turbines. The viscous medium between the high speed rotor surface and bearing surfaces formed by brush seal bristles generates a hydrodynamic lifting force that determines <b>seal</b> <b>clearance</b> and leakage rate in oil sealing applications.

40|$|Annular seals are devices, {{which are}} used in turboMachinery systems to reduce the flow leakage, and to provide better dynamic {{stability}} to the system. Leakage flow can strongly affect cooling quality, heating balance, and efficiency of a turboMachinery system. Due {{to the fact that}} annular seals can significantly reduce the flow leakage, and provide the most cost-effective way of enhancing the aerodynamic efficiency, understanding of the flow characteristics through the annular seal configurations is an important subject. Seals are classified in two main groups, which are contacting, and non-contacting seals. Straight annular and convergent seal configurations are characterized as non-contacting seals, and they are widely used in rotating turbocMachinery systems. The flow kinetic energy obtained from the flow pressure is dissipated by the effects of shear stresses along the free shear layers. In addition, viscosity of the flow has an impact on the dissipation rate of the flow kinetic energy. In this research, the leakage characteristics of the straight annular, and convergent seal configurations under specified working conditions are compared to each other. This study aims to investigate which seal configuration exhibits better leakage characteristics with respect to the different <b>seal</b> <b>clearances,</b> shaft speeds, surface roughness heights, and pressure ratios. Commercial code ANSYS Fluent is used to perform the flow simulations for the straight annular and convergent seal configurations. Effects of the <b>seal</b> <b>clearances,</b> shaft speeds, pressure ratios, and surface roughness heights on the leakage rate are analyzed. It was observed that the <b>seal</b> <b>clearance</b> has {{a significant impact on the}} flow leakage, and clearance control is an important subject in seal technology.

40|$|Turbine {{shaft seals}} are {{vulnerable}} to rubs caused by thermal distortion, mis-alignment and rotor dynamic vibration that are often not well understood. When seals rub as a machine is brought up to operating conditions performance is compromised due to increased seal leakage. Much effort has been extended {{in recent years to}} develop seals that mitigate those losses. This paper presents a seal design with segmented film riding runners capable of non-contacting seal operation during rotor transients. Operating differential seal pressure displaces seal leaves and attached runners toward the rotor surface until balanced by hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lift. Sufficient radial range of operation is provided to follow the rotor seal surface during transients while maintaining a small <b>seal</b> <b>clearance.</b> <b>Seal</b> design features and function will be described and illustrated along with analysis of forces and motions for a sample application.

40|$|Fluid-induced forces {{acting on}} a {{rotating}} impeller are known to cause rotor-dynamic problems in turbomachines. The forces generated by leakage flow along the front shroud surface of a centrifugal turbomachine impeller {{play an important role}} among these fluid-induced forces. The present research was aimed {{to gain a better understanding}} of these shroud forces. An experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to simulate the impeller shroud leakage flow. Hydrodynamic forces and steady and unsteady pressure distributions on the rotating shroud were measured as functions of eccentricity, width of shroud <b>clearance,</b> face <b>seal</b> <b>clearance</b> and shaft rotating speed. The forces measured from the dynamometer and manometers agreed well. The hydrodynamic force matrices were found skew-symmetric and statically unstable. This is qualitatively similar to the result of previous hydrodynamic volute force measurements. Nondimensionalized normal and tangential forces decrease slightly as Reynolds number increases. As the width of the shroud clearance decreases and/or the eccentricity increases, the hydrodynamic forces increase nonlinearly. There was some evidence found that increased front <b>seal</b> <b>clearance</b> could reduce the radial shroud forces and the relative magnitude of the destabilizing tangential force. Subharmonic pressure fluctuations were also observed which may adversely affect the behavior of the rotor system...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in brush seal {{gas turbine engine}} applications show the promise that carefully designed bristle packs can also function as oil and oil mist seals. Because brush seals are primarily contact seals, oil temperature rise and coking become major concerns in addition to leakage performance. Although individual bristles form very small bearing surfaces, hydrodynamic forces generated by viscous sealing medium combined with high surface speeds may easily lift the compliant bristle pack off the shaft surface. Amount of lift affects <b>seal</b> operating <b>clearance,</b> which - in return - determines oil temperature rise and leakage rate. Balancing these two conflicting performance criteria depends on good understanding of the bristle hydrodynamic lift.

Leakage resistance measurements were conducted on stepped labyrinth seals using a 4 - 1 scale, two-dimensional, non-rotating test apparatus, with water as the working fluid.
