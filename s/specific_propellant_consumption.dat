40|$|A {{cryogenic}} H 2 -O 2 {{auxiliary power}} unit (APU) was developed and successfully demonstrated. It has potential application as a minimum weight alternate to the space shuttle baseline APU because of its (1) low <b>specific</b> <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> and (2) heat sink capabilities that {{reduce the amount of}} expendable evaporants. A reference system was designed with the necessary heat exchangers, combustor, turbine-gearbox, valves, and electronic controls to provide 400 shp to two aircraft hydraulic pumps. Development testing was carried out first on the combustor and control valves. This was followed by development of the control subsystem including the controller, the hydrogen and oxygen control valves, the combustor, and a turbine simulator. The complete APU system was hot tested for 10 hr with ambient and cryogenic propellants. Demonstrated at 95 percent of design power was 2. 25 lb/hp-hr. At 10 percent design power, <b>specific</b> <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> was 4 lb/hp-hr with space simulated exhaust and 5. 2 lb/hp-hr with ambient exhaust. A 10 percent <b>specific</b> <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> improvement is possible with some seal modifications.

40|$|Under an EOARD contract, the DLR has {{conducted}} {{a series of}} comparative impulse measurements for two different lightcraft configurations with the same nozzle exit diameter of 10 cm: The German design (GL) is of the more conventional parabolical bell shape with a plasma breakdown region at the focal point of a parabola. The second lightcraft was supplied by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and was designated as model 200 - 3 / 4. The experiments utilized the DLR multi-gas laser, running in CO(2) with a laser wavelength of 10. 6 m. It was the goal of this investigation to extend previous atmospheric impulse measurements to a vacuum environment and to measure <b>specific</b> <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> of the solid propellant Delrin {{in order to determine the}} exhaust velocity and the specific impulse for both lightcrafts as a function of the laser pulse energy at various pressures. ...|$|E

40|$|The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (or VASIMR) {{experiment}} for {{rocket propulsion}} seeks to accomplish plasma generation and heating {{by means of}} plasma waves. This {{would be a huge}} advantage in comparison to other, traditional, plasma rockets- which usually use electrode based generation and heating- as no electrode erosion problems would occur. Because the specific impulse of VASIMR can be modulated at constant thrust, it can be seen as working in a way not dissimilar to the transmission of an ordinary car. When travelling at a “high gear ” (high <b>specific</b> impulse), the <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> will be low, while “low gear” (low specific impulse) would lead to a higher <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption.</b> The creation of an effective plasma based rocket system is important for future exploration of space, because this transmission like property gives the vessel the possibility of shorter transit times as well as higher payload capability, since travelling at high specific impulse would lead to a need for less space for propellant storage. Based on previous experimental data, gained from studies on the engine prototype at NASA in Houston, Texas, USA during the month of May, in 2005, it was the goal of this master thesis to, among other things, analyse the Poynting flux after the main stages of the rocket have been passed. This could yield possible information about the energy transferred into ion motion, as opposed to energy carried by the EM-waves. It is discovered in this thesis, that possible capacitive pickup could have distorted the measurements {{to the point that they}} are no longer trustworthy, possibly due to the high amounts of power utilized in the VASIMR experiment. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract - A {{tethered}} satellite system is {{proposed for the}} collection of a dust sample from the Martian atmosphere. In a previous paper, under the assumption of a circular orbit, a system had been designed by trading off the lowest reachable altitude versus the <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> necessary to maintain a constant altitude orbit. Because of the dust density and distribution during a Martian storm, significant improvements in the mission scenario are achieved in the present paper by considering an elliptic orbit with dramatic reduction of <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> with respect to our previous results. The system design is optimized in terms of tether diameter and orbital parameters with a simplex optimization algorithm that considers the <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> as the cost function and the maximum in-plane libration and the tether tensile safety factor as constraints. The simulations of the system dynamics include an active feedback tether control for stabilizing the tether libration, which, for an elliptic orbit with low periapsis, can be significant.

An innovative and powerful {{solution to this problem}} for formations separated in along-track direction is presented using the Delayed Target Tracking method. The method avoids <b>propellant</b> <b>consumptions</b> associated to the compensation of differential perturbations arising from the complex Earth's gravity field by a guidance and control law that minimizes the separation of the chaser at any time with the target at the same time but delayed by a constant time offset. This offset is equivalent to an along-track separation and assures that, when formulated in an Earth-fixed frame, the chaser exactly follows the target's orbit, thus experiences identical accelerations, alleviating the need for any <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption.</b> The governing equations are presented along with an algorithm for implementation. The concept of Delayed Target Tracking is proven analytically, and demonstrated numerically in an open-loop configuration and in a closed-loop control scenario. The validity of the method has been analyzed including a demonstration of its applicability to eccentric orbits and perturbations other than from Earth's gravity alone...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{space station}} orbit design mission is {{characterized}} by a long-duration and multi-step decision process. First, the long-duration design process is divided into multiple planning periods, each of which consists of five basic flight segments. Second, each planning period is modeled as a multi-step decision process, and the orbital altitude strategies of different flight segments have interaction effects on each other. Third, a dynamic programming method is used to optimize the total <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> of a planning period while considering interaction effects. The step cost of each decision segment is the propellant for orbital-decay maintenance or lifting altitude, and is calculated by approximate analytical equations and combining a shooting iteration method.

40|$|In this paper, {{displaced}} geostationary orbits using hybrid low-thrust propulsion, {{a complementary}} combination of Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) and solar sailing, are investigated {{to increase the}} capacity of the geostationary ring that is starting to become congested. The SEP <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> is minimized in order to maximize the mission lifetime by deriving semi-analytical formulae for the optimal steering laws for the SEP and solar sail accelerations. By considering the spacecraft mass budget, the performance is also expressed in terms of payload mass capacity. The analyses are performed both for the use of pure SEP and hybrid low-thrust propulsion to allow for a comparison. It is found that hybrid low-thrust control outperforms the pure SEP case both in terms of payload mass capacity and mission lifetime for all displacements considered. Hybrid low-thrust propulsion enables payloads of 255 – 487 kg to be maintained in a 35 km displaced orbit for 10 – 15 years. Adding the influence of the J 2 and J 2, 2 terms of the Earth's gravity field has a small effect on this lifetime, which becomes almost negligible for small values of the sail lightness number. Finally, two SEP transfers that allow for an improvement in the performance of hybrid low-thrust control are optimized for the <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> by solving the accompanying optimal control problem using a direct pseudospectral method. The first type of transfer enables a transit between orbits displaced above and below the equatorial plane, while the second type of transfer enables customized service for which a spacecraft is transferred to a Keplerian parking orbit when geostationary coverage is not needed. While the latter requires a modest propellant budget, the first type of transfer comes at the cost of an almost negligible SEP <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption...</b>|$|R

To achieve an efficient system design, the rendezvous manoeuvre has been partitioned into three main phases based on the range of operation, plus a collision-avoidance manoeuvre to be used in event of a fault. Each has its own associated MPC controller. Linear time-varying models are used to enable trajectory predictions in elliptical orbits, whilst a variable prediction horizon is used to achieve finite-time completion of manoeuvres, and a 1 -norm cost on velocity change minimises <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption.</b> Constraints are imposed to ensure that trajectories do not collide with the target. A key feature of the design is the implementation of non-convex constraints as switched convex constraints, enabling the use of convex linear and quadratic programming.

AIAA 2004 - 5346, Providence, Rhode Island, Aug. 16 - 19, 2004 Spacecraft guidance and control (G & C) problems are uniquely different from similar problems arising in other control systems because {{the amount of}} fuel consumed by a proposed G and C algorithm dictates its engineering feasibility. Despite this stringent requirement, it has become quite prevalent, particularly in the recent formation keeping literature, to recast space G & C problems {{in terms of a}} quadratic cost or ignore <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> altogether. In this paper, we show that the proper cost functions to use are lp-variants of the L 1 -norm of the control and not the popular quadratic forms. The penalty for not using the L 1 -norm is significantly more <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> and undesirable continuous thrusting. An illustrative double-integrator problem is used to demonstrate that the fuel penalty incurred for using quadratic costs is at least 18 percent and could be as high as fifty percent.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for the preliminary design of Low-Thrust (LT), many-revolution transfers. The main feature of the novel approach is a considerable reduction in the control parameters and a consequent gain in computational speed. Each spiral is built by using a predefined pattern for thrust direction and switching structure. The pattern is then optimised to minimise <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> and transfer time. The variation of the orbital elements due to the propulsive thrust is computed analytically from a first-order solution of the perturbed Keplerian motion. The proposed approach allows for a realistic estimation of ΔV cost and time of flight required to transfer a spacecraft between two arbitrary orbits. Eccentricity and plane changes are both taken into account. The novel approach is applied here {{to the design of}} missions for the removal of space debris by means of an Ion Beam Shepherd (IBS) Spacecraft. In particular, two slightly different variants of the proposed low-thrust control model are used for the two main phases of the debris removal mission, i. e. the rendezvous with the target object and its removal. Thanks to their relatively low computational cost they can be included in a multiobjective optimisation problem in which the sequence and timing of the removal of five hypothetical pieces of debris are optimised in order to minimise both <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> and mission duration...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown the {{feasibility}} of an Earth pole-sitter mission, where a spacecraft follows the Earth’s polar axis to have a continuous, hemispherical view {{of one of the}} Earth’s Poles. However, due to the tilt of the polar axis, the North and South Poles are alternately situated in darkness for long periods dur-ing the year. This significantly constrains observations and decreases mission scientific return. This paper therefore investigates transfers between north and south pole-sitter orbits {{before the start of the}} Arctic and Antarctic winters to maximize scientific return by observing the polar regions only when lit. Clearly, such a transfer can also be employed for the sole purpose of visiting both the North and South Poles with one single spacecraft during one single mission. To enable such a novel transfer, two types of propulsion are proposed, including so-lar electric propulsion (SEP) and a hybridization of SEP with solar sailing. A di-rect optimization method based on pseudospectral transcription is used to find both transfers that minimize the SEP <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> and transfers that trade-off SEP <b>propellant</b> <b>consumption</b> and observation time of the Poles. Also, a feedback control is developed to account for non-ideal properties of the solar sail. It is shown that, for all cases considered, hybrid low-thrust propulsion out-performs the pure SEP case, while enabling a transfer that would not be feasible with current solar sail technology...|$|R
