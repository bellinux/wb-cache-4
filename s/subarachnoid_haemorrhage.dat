40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose is}} to {{highlight}} the usefulness of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of cerebral aneurysms. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> were subjected to CT angiography and in those cases where this test did not reveal the aneurysm or did not supply sufficient information relating to it, subsequently a digital subtraction angiography was also performed. Each aneurysm-positive CTA was re-processed using the 3 -D techniques, with the neuro-radiologist and the neuro-surgeon working in close co-operation. RESULTS: In 27 cases the CTA diagnosed an aneurysm, and in the 4 cases where no vascular malformations were revealed, also the traditional angiography did not show any pathology. In 17 out of 18 cases operated on in order to clip the aneurysm, the CTA supplied all the information needed for the surgery and it was possibile to reconstruct images {{similar to those of}} the surgical field. This led to improvement in the programming of the surgical intervention; in 1 case only was it also necessary to perform the DSA before the operation. CONCLUSIONS: CT angiography, because it is non-invasive, easy to perform, diagnostically reliable, and because the 3 -D re-constructions offer the chance to create images of the possible operating field, is the first-choice test to be adopted in the treatment of <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>haemorrhages,</b> even though in some cases the use of the traditional angiography is still necessary and should be carried out whenever the CTA does not reveal vascular malformation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Access to neurosurgical {{facilities}} remains {{limited in}} resource-restricted medical environments worldwide, including Africa. Many hospitals refer patients to off-site facilities if they require intervention. Unnecessary referrals, however, can {{be detrimental to}} the patient and/or costly to the healthcare system itself. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the frequency and associated intracranial pathology of patients who did and did not receive active neurosurgical intervention after having presented to an academic emergency centre at a hospital without on-site neurosurgical capabilities. Methods: A one-year, retrospective record review of all patients who presented with potential neurosurgical pathology to a tertiary academic emergency centre in Johannesburg, South Africa was conducted. Results: A total of 983 patients received a computed tomography brain scan for suspected neurosurgical pathology. There were 395 positive scans; 67. 8 % with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 32. 3 % non-traumatic brain injury (non-TBI). Only 14. 4 % of patients received neurosurgical intervention, mostly non-TBI-related. The main intervention was a craniotomy for both TBI and non-TBI patients. The main TBI haemorrhages that received an intervention were subdural (SDH) (16. 5 %) and extradural (10. 4 %) haemorrhages. More than half the patients with non-TBI SDHs as well as those with aneurysms and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> received an intervention. Discussion: Based on this study’s findings, in a resource-restricted setting, the patients who should receive preference for neurosurgical referral and intervention are (1) those with intracranial haemorrhages (2) those with non-traumatic SDH more than traumatic SDH and (3) those patients with non-traumatic <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> caused by aneurysms...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the complications in two forms of angiogram-negative spontaneous SAH: pretruncal (PNSAH) and nonpretruncal (NPNSAH). Methods. The study group involved 18 patients with PNSAH and 16 patients with NPNSAH. CT scan was done within 72 hours from bleeding. All patients underwent four-vessel cerebral angiography. Repeat angiography was performed in five PNSAH and all NPNSAH patients. Results. Twenty-nine patients were in grade I or II of the Hunt-Hess Scale (17 PNSAH and 12 NPNSAH). There was one case of rebleeding (NPNSAH patient), 10 cases of transient acute hydrocephalus (4 PNSAH and 6 NPNSAH).

The range-gated Doppler flowmeter with an adjustable range-gated time system and a double transducer probe {{was used to determine}} diameter, blood velocity, and blood flow of the common carotid artery. Values were, respectively, 5. 9 ± 1. 1 mm, 13. 8 ± 6. 1 cm • sec" 1 and 387 ± 183 cm 3 • min- 1. Mean cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements were simultaneously made by l 33 Xenon intra-arterial method, with a value of 22. 28 ± 5. 96 ml •min"l # 100 g. High correlation coefficient was found between CCBF and mean rCBF(r = 0. 73, p < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> (SAH) linked to rupture of an aneurysm is 6 {{out of a}} population of 100, 000 [Na 05]. Prevalence of intracranial aneurysms {{is estimated to be}} at least 1. 0 % of the total population [Br 05]. The prognosis of an SAH due to a ruptured aneurysm is poor, about 50 % of the patients die immediately [Ki 97]. Aneurysm diameter {{is directly related to the}} risk of rupture, the age of the patient correlates inversely; a long-term study found a relative risk for rupture of 1. 11 per mm in diameter of the unruptured aneurysm [Ju 00]. Therapeutic options are surgical aneurysm clipping and endovascular coiling [Ma 03], [Ki 05].

40|$|OBJECT: The {{cellular}} {{events leading}} to cerebral vasospasm after <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> (SAH) involve {{a number of}} members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. However, whereas calcium is thought to play a number of major roles in the pathophysiology of SAH, a number of PKCs function independently of calcium. We recently emphasized the potential role of the calcium-binding S 100 proteins in a 'double haemorrhage' rat model of SAH-induced vasospasm. A number of S 100 proteins are known to interfere directly with PKC, or indirectly with PKC substrates. We therefore investigated whether specific S 100 proteins and PKCs are co-expressed/co-located in a rat model of SAH-induced vasospasm. METHODS AND RESULTS: SAH-induced vasospasm in rats (by means of a double cisternal injection of autologous blood from a rat femoral artery) distinctly modified the expression levels of calcium-dependent PKC-alpha and PKC-beta and calcium-independent PKC-eta and PKC-zeta in endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. The RNA levels of these four PKC isotypes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The present study reveals that, in endothelial cells, the S 100 B expression/location correlate well with those of PKC-eta, and those of S 100 A 1 with PKC-beta. In smooth-muscle cells S 100 A 2 expression/location correlate with those of PKC-eta, and those of S 100 B with PKC-zeta. CONCLUSION: The present data argue in favour of a joint action of the S 100 protein network and the PKC signalling pathway during cerebral vasospasm. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} the sites, mechanisms, and clinical significance of injuries {{to the eyes}} and brains of children with non-accidental injuries in relation to differing levels of trauma. METHODS: A forensic pathological study of injuries {{in the eyes and}} brains of 23 consecutive children dying of non-accidental injuries over a 4 year period (1988 - 92) under the jurisdiction of Yorkshire and Humberside coroners. RESULTS: Sixteen children died from cerebral injuries and seven died from non-cerebral causes. There were high incidences of retinal detachment (63 %) and subhyaloid (75 %), intraretinal (75 %), and perineural (68 %) haemorrhages in CNS deaths. Local subhyaloid haemorrhages and retinal detachment were more common at the periphery and optic disc than at the equator. There was a strong correlation between CNS and eye trauma scores in all 23 children (r = 0. 7551, p < 0. 0001). Ranking of injuries by severity suggests progressively more trauma required for (a) subdural haemorrhage, (b) subhyaloid, intraretinal, perineural haemorrhages, and (c) retinal detachment. At highest trauma levels choroidal and vitreous haemorrhages were associated with additional cerebral lacerations, intracerebral and <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>haemorrhages.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In non-accidental (and probably accidental) infantile head injury the earliest eye injuries (coinciding with subdural haemorrhage) could be missed if indirect ophthalmoscopy is not performed. Retinal detachment and multiple (particularly choroidal/vitreous) haemorrhages may indicate additional cerebral lacerations and/or intracerebral haemorrhage.

Since up to 15 % of the SAHs are not caused by an IA, we have analysed anticipation, sex ratio and mode of inheritance only in families with patients with a proven IA in two consecutive generations. A total of 10 families were studied in which at least two persons in consecutive generations were affected by SAH, a symptomatic IA (SIA) or a presymptomatic IA (PIA). We also analysed published data from families with a proven IA in two consecutive generations on age of SIA onset and sex ratios among affected family members (both SIA and PIA).

40|$|The intraluminal {{filament}} {{model of}} middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in {{mice and rats}} {{has been plagued by}} inconsistency, owing in part to the multitude of variables requiring control. In this study we investigated the impact of several major variables on survival rate, lesion volume, neurological scores, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and body weight including filament width, time after reperfusion, occlusion time and the choice of surgical method. Using the Koizumi method, we found ischemic injury can be detected as early as 30 min after reperfusion, to a degree that is not statistically different from 24 h post-perfusion, using 2, 3, 5 -Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. We also found a distinct increase in total lesion volume with increasing occlusion time, with 30 - 45 min a critical time for the development of large, reproducible lesions. Furthermore, although we found no significant difference in total lesion volume generated by the Koizumi and Longa methods of MCAO, nor were survival rates appreciably different between the two at 4 h after reperfusion, the Longa method produces significantly greater reperfusion. Finally, we found no statistical evidence to support the exclusion of data from animals experiencing a CBF reduction of < 70 % in the MCA territory following MCAO, using laser-Doppler flowmetry. Instead we suggest the main usefulness of laser-Doppler flowmetry is for guiding filament placement and the identification of <b>subarachnoid</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> and premature reperfusion.
