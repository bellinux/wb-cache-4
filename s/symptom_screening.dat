40|$|Rationale: Isoniazid {{preventive}} therapy {{is effective in}} {{reducing the risk of}} tuberculosis (TB) in persons living with HIV (PLWH); however, screening must exclude TB disease before initiating therapy. <b>Symptom</b> <b>screening</b> alone may be insufficient to exclude TB disease in PLWH because some PLWH with TB disease have no symptoms. The addition of chest radiography (CXR) may improve disease detection. Objectives: The objective of the present analysis was to compare the costs and effects of the addition of CXR to the <b>symptom</b> <b>screening</b> process against the costs and effects of <b>symptom</b> <b>screening</b> alone. Methods: Using data from Botswana, a decision analytic model was used to compare a "Symptomonly'' policy against a "Symptom+CXR'' policy. The outcomes of interest were cost, death, and isoniazid-and multidrug-resistant TB in a hypothetical cohort of 10, 000 PLWH. Measurements and Main Results: The Symptom+CXR policy prevented 16 isoniazid-and 0. 3 multidrug-resistant TB cases; however, because of attrition from the screening process, there were 98 excess cases of TB, 15 excess deaths, and an additional cost of U. S. $ 127, 100. The Symptom+CXR policy reduced deaths only if attrition was close to zero; however, to eliminate attrition the cost would be U. S. $ 2. 8 million per death averted. These findings did not change in best-and worst-case scenario analyses. Conclusions: In Botswana, a policy with <b>symptom</b> <b>screening</b> only preceding isoniazid-{{preventive therapy}} initiation prevents more TB and TB-related deaths, and uses fewer resources, than a policy that uses both CXR and <b>symptom</b> <b>screening...</b>|$|E

During the first 6 months, 26, 515 visits occurred among 12, 078 adults. The proportion of adults aware of their HIV status was 43. 7 % {{at the start of the}} first visit, increased to 84. 6 % at the end of the first visit, and to 90 % at end of any visit during the first 6 months. During these 6 months, 1042 clients were newly diagnosed with HIV. HIV prevalence was 22. 9 % among those newly tested, and 58. 9 % among all adult clinic clients. High coverage of systematic HCT was sustained across all 18 months. Coverage of systematic HIV-stratified TB <b>symptom</b> <b>screening</b> during first 6 -months was also high (89. 6 %) but only 35. 0 % of those symptomatic were screened by sputum.

40|$|The new WHO 2011 {{guidelines}} on TB screening among HIV-infected individuals recommend screening using four TB symptoms (current cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats). This study aimed {{to assess the}} performance of WHO 2011 TB <b>symptom</b> <b>screening</b> algorithm for diagnosing pulmonary TB in HIV patients and identify possible risk factors for TB. Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2012 to November 2012. A total of 250 HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 18 years visiting the University of Gondar Hospital, ART clinic, were enrolled. Information about WHO TB clinical symptoms and other known risk factors for TB was collected using structured questionnaire. Spot-morning-spot sputum samples were collected and direct AFB microscopy, sputum culture, and RD 9 molecular typing were performed. Statistical data analysis was performed using SPSS Version 20. 0 software. Of 250 study participants, fever was reported in 169 (67. 6 %), whereas cough and night sweats were reported in 167 (66. 8 %) and 152 (60. 8 %), respectively. A total of 11 (4. 4 %) TB cases were identified. Of these, 82 % (9 / 11) TB patients reported cough, so that the negative predictive value was 98 %. In addition, 66 % (158 / 239) TB negative patients reported cough, so that positive predictive value of cough was 5 %. According to the new WHOTB <b>symptom</b> <b>screening</b> algorithm, out of 250 HIV-infected persons, 83 % (5 / 6) have been investigated by TB <b>symptom</b> <b>screening</b> and AFB smear microscopy.

40|$|Background: Symptom-based {{tuberculosis}} screening identifies {{less than}} one-third of eligible HIV-infected patients as candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). We evaluated whether testing for C-reactive protein (CRP) improves patient selection for IPT. Methods: We measured CRP levels (normal > 10 mg/L) using a point-of-care (POC) assay on stored serum samples from HIVinfected Ugandan adults initiating antiretroviral therapy. We assessed diagnostic accuracy in reference to baseline tuberculosis status adjudicated by an expert committee and calculated net reclassification improvement to quantify the incremental discriminatory benefit of POC-CRP in determining IPT eligibility compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) <b>symptom</b> <b>screen.</b> Results: Of 201 patients (median CD 4 cell count, 137 cells/mL; interquartile range, 83 - 206), 5 (2. 5 %) had tuberculosis. Compared to the WHO <b>symptom</b> <b>screen,</b> POC-CRP had similar sensitivity (100 % vs. 80 %, P = 0. 30) but greater specificity (21 % vs. 87 %, P > 0. 0001) for tuberculosis. If based on the WHO <b>symptom</b> <b>screen,</b> no patients with tuberculosis but only 42 of 196 patients without tuberculosis {{would have been considered}} IPT eligible. If POC-CRP were used instead, 1 patient with tuberculosis (reclassification of cases, 220 %; P = 0. 32) and 129 patients without tuberculosis (reclassification of noncases, + 66 %; P > 0. 001) would have been reclassified as IPT eligible, a net reclassification improvement of 46 % (P = 0. 03). In addition, POC-CRP testing would have reduced the proportion of patients without active tuberculosis requiring confirmatory tuberculosis testing (87 % vs. 21 %, P > 0. 0001). Conclusions: POC-CRP testing increased more than 4 -fold the proportion of HIV-infected adults immediately identified as IPT eligible and decreased the proportion of patients requiring referral for further tuberculosis diagnostic testing. POC-CRP testing could substantially improve implementation of tuberculosis screening guidelines. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

OBJECTIVE:: We aimed to develop and evaluate a simple <b>symptom</b> <b>screen</b> using da ta obtained from {{a representative sample of}} community-dwelling older adults. METHODS:: Psychometric analyses were conducted on 10 self-reported dichotomous symptom indicators collected during in-person interviews from a sample of 1000 community-dwelling older adults. Symptoms included shortness of breath, feeling tired or fatigued, problems with balance or dizziness, perceived weakness in legs, constipation, daily pain, stiffness, poor appetite, anxiety, and anhedonia. RESULTS:: Over one third of the individuals (37. 4 %) had 5 or more concurrent symptoms. Stiffness and feeling tired were the most common symptoms. Confirmatory factor analyses were performed on the 10 symptoms for single factor and bifactor (physical and affective) models of symptom reporting. Goodness-of-fit indices indicated better fit for the bifactor model (χdf= 10 = 89. 6; P < 0. 001), but the practical significance of the improvement in fit was negligible. Differential item functioning analyses showed some differences of relatively high magnitude in location parameters by race; however, because the differential item functioning was in different directions, the impact on the overall measure was most likely lessened.

Four patient-report survey items explored how often patients were specifically asked by clinical staff at the treatment centre about their (i) emotional distress (anxiety, distress and depression), (ii) pain, (iii) fatigue and (iv) other physical symptoms (e. g. nausea and constipation). Asking at {{less than half of}} all appointments was classified as infrequent screening. Results: No significant associations were found between treatment centre and <b>symptom</b> <b>screening</b> for emotional distress (p = 0. 65), pain (p = 0. 21), fatigue (p = 0. 95) and other physical symptoms (p = 0. 40).

Evidence-based guidelines for tuberculosis screening are available, but literature assessing their implementation {{and the quality of}} clinical practice is scarce. Objectives: To assess tuberculosis screening practices and the effectiveness of audit and performance feedback to improve quality of tuberculosis screening at HIV care clinics in Ghana. Design: Healthcare providers at 10 large HIV care clinics prospectively registered patient consultations during May and October 2014, before and after a performance feedback intervention in August 2014. The outcomes of interest were overall tuberculosis suspicion rate during consultations and provider adherence to the International Standards for Tuberculosis Care and the World Health Organizations’ guidelines for symptom-based tuberculosis screening among PLHIV. Results: Twenty-one healthcare providers registered a total of 2, 666 consultations; 1, 368 consultations before and 1, 298 consultations after the feedback intervention. Tuberculosis suspicion rate during consultation increased from 12. 6 to 20. 9 % after feedback (odds ratio, OR 1. 83; 95 % confidence interval, CI: 1. 09 – 3. 09). Before feedback, sputum smear microscopy was requested for 58. 7 % of patients with suspected tuberculosis, for 47. 2 % of patients with cough ≥ 2 weeks, and for 27. 5 % of patients with a positive World Health Organization (WHO) <b>symptom</b> <b>screen</b> (any of current cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats). After feedback, patients with a positive WHO <b>symptom</b> <b>screen</b> {{were more likely to be}} suspected of tuberculosis (OR 2. 21; 95 % CI: 1. 19 – 4. 09) and referred for microscopy (OR 2. 71; 95 % CI: 1. 25 – 5. 86). Conclusions: A simple prospective audit tool identified flaws in clinical practices for tuberculosis {{screening of}} PLHIV. There was no systematic identification of people with suspected active tuberculosis. We found low initial tuberculosis suspicion rate compounded by low referral rates of relevant patients for sputum smear microscopy. Adherence to recommended standards and guidelines for tuberculosis screening improved after performance feedback...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Standards of {{care and}} {{treatment}} of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) vary. Non-drug ‎psychosocial intervention therapy is recommended for women {{with any kind of}} ‎discomfort or distress caused by PMS. The current study examined the effectiveness of ‎group cognitive-behavioral therapy on the symptoms of PMS at a girls’ dormitory of ‎North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences. Method: In this quasi-experimental study, 32 female students with PMS who were majoring in ‎nursing and midwifery and residing in the dormitory were selected using the ‎convenience sampling method and were assigned to experimental and control groups. ‎The Standardized Premenstrual <b>Symptoms</b> <b>Screening</b> Tool was used as the research ‎tool. Eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral group therapy were held for the students Results: There was a significant difference in psychological symptoms before and after ‎cognitive-behavioral therapy (p= 0. 012). Furthermore, cognitive-behavioral therapy was ‎effective on social interferences caused by PMS symptoms (p= 0. 012). ‎ Conclusion : Group cognitive-behavioral therapy effectively alleviates PMS symptoms in female ‎college students. ‎</p...|$|R
40|$|Infertility and {{perinatal}} loss are common, {{and associated}} with lower quality of life, marital discord, complicated grief, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Young women, who lack social supports, have experienced recurrent pregnancy loss or a history of trauma and / or preexisting psychiatric illness are at {{a higher risk of}} experiencing psychiatric illnesses or symptoms after a perinatal loss or during infertility. It is especially important to detect, assess, and treat depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric symptoms because infertility or perinatal loss may be caused or perpetuated by such <b>symptoms.</b> <b>Screening,</b> psychoeducation, provision of resources and referrals, and an opportunity to discuss their loss and plan for future pregnancies can facilitate addressing mental health concerns that arise. Women at risk of or who are currently experiencing psychiatric symptoms should receive a comprehensive treatment plan that includes the following: (1) proactive clinical monitoring, (2) evidence-based approaches to psychotherapy, and (3) discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives of medication treatment during preconception and pregnancy...|$|R
