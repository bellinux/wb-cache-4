500|$|John de Lancie {{deliberately}} {{missed his}} first audition for Q {{as he was}} appearing as a lead in a play at the time. A second audition was arranged during lunchtime {{so that he could}} attend. He later said that after he auditioned, [...] "a big guy walked out, put his hands on my <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You make my words sound better than they are.' I said, 'Well, you must be the writer.' And he said, 'I'm Gene Roddenberry.' I had absolutely no idea who that was." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Jiang Biao Zhuan gave a {{slightly}} different account of the meeting between Lu Su and Lü Meng. Lu Su placed his hand on Lü Meng's <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I heard you were previously a mere warrior. But now, you've taken up scholarly pursuits and you're no longer that Meng under Wu." [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] He then presented three strategies to Lu Su on how to counter Guan Yu. Lu Su respected Lü Meng so he kept the strategies to himself and did not reveal them.|$|E
2500|$|According to Feigl (as {{reported}} by Monk), upon attending {{a conference in}} Vienna by [...] mathematician Brouwer, Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the [...] possibility of a [...] "return to Philosophy". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes {{wrote in a letter}} to his wife: [...] "Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train." [...] Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the Tractatus as his thesis. It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it." [...] Moore wrote in the examiner's report: [...] "I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree." [...] Wittgenstein was appointed as a lecturer and was made a fellow of Trinity College.|$|E
60|$|But Godwin only shrugged: his <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing, <b>and</b> the Master went on, {{taking no}} heed.|$|R
6000|$|Eva laughed, but Alice shrugged her <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> tranquilly, [...] "I don't mind. She wouldn't {{expect much}} wisdom from school-girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Crystal, smiling, quite kindly and {{a little}} abstractedly at his {{impulsive}} earnestness, gently removed his hands from her <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> calmly: ...|$|R
2500|$|In 210, after Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu (who died {{of illness}} earlier that year) as the {{frontline}} commander of Sun Quan's forces, he passed by Lü Meng's garrison {{on his way}} to Lukou (陸口; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). Lu Su had all along regarded Lü Meng with contempt, but someone told him, [...] "General Lü's fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon." [...] Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng's camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, [...] "You've received an important appointment and you're going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?" [...] Lu Su lackadaisically replied, [...] "I'll adapt to the situation when the time comes." [...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to Lü Meng, placed his hand on his <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Lü Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here." [...] He also visited Lü Meng's mother and left after befriending Lü Meng.|$|E
60|$|Alan clapped my <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> I was a brave lad {{and wanted}} {{nothing but a}} sleep.|$|E
60|$|Coulthurst {{touched his}} <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} in his ear, but the young man moved away from him impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Delville {{looked at}} the bed for an instant, took Mrs. Bent by the <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> quietly, 'Get me some caustic. Be quick.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Don Miguel, much {{astonished}} at this unexpected outburst of passion, {{gazed at her}} with a sneer, then he shrugged his <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> coldly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Delville {{looked at}} the bed for an instant, took Mrs. Bent by the <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> quietly, [...] "Get me some caustic. Be quick." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then having {{concluded}} his applause, Mr. Dolphin {{gave his}} secretary {{a slap on}} the <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "By Jove, Billy, she'll do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Harrison {{probably}} guessed {{what was}} passing in my mind, for {{he placed a}} kindly hand upon my <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with a smile:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Father John took Feemy's arm on his, {{and telling}} the people {{to go back to}} their dancing, laid his hand on Thady's <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|And little Dolly shrugged her <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with {{a pretty}} pettishness, [...] "Now, Father, you're not to tease! You know I don't want to be bride's-maid to anybody!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Evidently {{she had no}} {{intention}} of satisfying the girl's obvious curiosity, for she suddenly rose from her chair, gathered her lace shawl round her <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> with abrupt transition: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, he {{was very}} good about it. He laughed, I remember, <b>and</b> shrugged his <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> there was no use denying {{anything}} to a woman, for she would have her way." ...|$|R
6000|$|Van Helsing {{came and}} laid {{his hand on}} Arthur's <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to him, [...] "And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly Forsyth {{laid his}} hand on the other's <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> impressively: [...] "Ruby Brand, it's my belief that that girl is rather fond of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The moment I got {{a chance}} I slipped aside privately and touched an ancient common looking man on the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in an insinuating, {{confidential}} way: ...|$|E
6000|$|Bernardo {{shrugged his}} <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Romola, wilt thou see if my servant is without? I {{ordered him to}} wait for me here." [...] Then, when Romola was at a {{sufficient}} distance, he leaned forward <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to Bardo in a low, emphatic tone-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Apparently, {{however, the}} admonitions of Master Hymn-of-Praise made but a scanty {{impression}} on the young girl's mind, for she regarded him {{with a mixture of}} amusement and contempt as she shrugged her plump <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> with sudden irrelevance: ...|$|R
6000|$|His Eminence threw a {{quick look}} at the young man, a look half of pity, half of contempt. For a moment it seemed as if an angry retort hovered upon his lips. But he merely shrugged his <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> blandly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He half hesitated, and then, as if scorning an equivocation, made a hasty gesture {{over her}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> bluntly, [...] "No, I {{came over the}} cliff." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Mell {{still looked}} at him, and still patted me kindly on the <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to himself, in a whisper, if I heard right: 'Yes, I thought so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently a Numidian soldier {{standing}} behind Malchus touched {{him on the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in a whisper: [...] "There they are!" [...] pointing {{at the same time}} across the plain.|$|E
6000|$|Dermot {{shrugged his}} <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "How {{is one to}} help oneself if one has been born some two {{thousand}} years too late, or not in the new half-baked hemisphere where demigods still walk the earth in their simplicity?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{would have}} {{followed}} them, guessing {{that they had}} some good reason for this sudden departure. But Higgs refused to come, and Orme, in whom his foolish taunt seemed still to rankle, only shrugged his <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|R
6000|$|This time too, {{after that}} instant's hesitation, the reserve which {{every now and}} then seemed entirely to detach the Duke of Wessex from his surroundings, quickly {{disappeared}} again. The pleasant smile returned to the proud lips, he shrugged his <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> simply-- ...|$|R
60|$|Uncle John {{was delighted}} with the big fellow with the small voice. Even the major clapped Bul Run on the <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> the {{sentiment}} did him credit, however big the mortgage might be.|$|E
6000|$|The Tuscarora, {{fastening}} {{his dark}} basilisk-like {{eyes on the}} soldier, gazed a moment, as if to read his soul; then he jerked a thumb backward, over his own <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with a grave smile-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Our eyes met, but I {{could not}} stand his inquiring glance and looked down. He came to me, and sitting {{on the arm of}} my chair, {{put his hand on my}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> affectionately,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Charlie {{saw that}} it would be useless to try and alter the man's decision, {{especially}} as he knew so little of the language. He therefore shrugged his <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that he was ready to go with them, if it must be so.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't stand this," [...] muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped {{his way to}} the piano, laid a kind hand {{on either}} of the broad <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> as gently as a woman, [...] "I know, my boy, I know." ...|$|R
60|$|Towards the end Anthony grew worse with {{a dreadful}} swiftness. He {{was to have}} gone abroad as usual that winter, but {{when the time came}} his state was such that the doctors shrugged their <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that he might as well stop at home in comfort.|$|R
