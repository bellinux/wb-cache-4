5|$|USB, {{short for}} Universal <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus,</b> is an {{industry}} standard that defines cables, connectors and communications protocols for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and devices.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, USB-IF {{submitted}} USB3.1, USB Power Delivery 2.0 and USB Type-C specifications to the IEC (TC 100– Audio, {{video and}} multimedia systems and equipment) {{for inclusion in}} the international standard IEC 62680 Universal <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> interfaces for data and power, which is currently based on USB 2.0.|$|E
5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (FireWire) technology, which {{was designed as a}} high-bandwidth <b>serial</b> <b>bus</b> that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} ISO standard {{formal description}} technique E-LOTOS {{is used to}} describe a leader election protocol (that of the IEEE 1394 <b>serial</b> multimedia <b>bus),</b> allowing illustration of the new aspects of the language, particularly time and parallelism. Keywords: E-LOTOS (Enhancements to LOTOS), IEEE 1394, Protocols, Leader Election Algorithm, Formal Methods. 1 Introduction The proposed ISO standard formal description technique E-LOTOS is used to give a timed description of the leader election protocol of the IEEE 1394 <b>serial</b> multimedia <b>bus,</b> demonstrating {{the capabilities of the}} new language for describing communications protocols. The 1394 (FireWire) <b>serial</b> multimedia <b>bus</b> is an IEEE standard for multimedia communications. It connects together a collection of systems and devices in order to carry all forms of digitized video and audio quickly, reliably, and inexpensively. Its architecture is scalable, and it is "hot-pluggable", so a designer or user can add or subtract systems an [...] ...|$|R
5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} <b>serial</b> <b>bus</b> that {{is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E
5|$|The Micro plug {{design is}} rated {{for at least}} 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles, {{which is more than}} the Mini plug design. The Micro {{connector}} is also designed to reduce the mechanical wear on the device; instead the easier-to-replace cable is designed to bear the mechanical wear of connection and disconnection. The Universal <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB receptacles (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs), and Micro-B plugs and receptacles, along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E
5|$|USB is a <b>serial</b> <b>bus,</b> using four {{shielded}} wires for the USB2.0 variant: two {{for power}} (VBUS and GND), and two for differential data signals (labelled as D+ and D− in pinouts). Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted (NRZI) encoding scheme {{is used for}} transferring data, with a sync field to synchronize the host and receiver clocks. D+ and D− signals are transmitted on a differential pair, providing half-duplex data transfers for USB2.0. Mini and micro connectors have their GND connections moved from pin #4 to pin #5, while their pin #4 serves as an ID pin for the On-The-Go host/client identification.|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the design}} issues that arose during the {{development}} of the EUVE science payload and solutions to the problems involved are examined. In particular, attention is given to the use of parallel and <b>serial</b> <b>busses,</b> the selection of the the ROM approach for software storage and execution, implementation of memory error detection and correction, and the selection of command structures. The early design decisions paid off in the timely delivery of the scientific payload and in the successful completion of the survey phase of the EUVE science mission...|$|R

5|$|Thunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, {{and a high}} {{definition}} FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models. The Thunderbolt <b>serial</b> <b>bus</b> platform can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbit/s, which is up to {{twice as fast as}} the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800. Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes SPI {{is called}} a {{four-wire}} <b>serial</b> <b>bus,</b> contrasting with three-, two-, and one-wire serial buses. The SPI may be accurately described as a synchronous serial interface, but it {{is different from the}} Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) protocol, which is also a four-wire synchronous serial communication protocol. SSI Protocol employs differential signaling and provides only a single simplex communication channel.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} fears that Intel, which {{took part in}} the {{development}} and implementation of the USB, would force Apple to drop all development and support of its FireWire <b>serial</b> <b>bus</b> on all Intel Macs. This did not occur, as FireWire ports continued to be included on all Macs, except certain notebook configurations beginning with the MacBook Air in 2008, until being replaced by the faster Thunderbolt port.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was {{responsible}} {{for many of the}} hardware innovations for the PC, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, and Universal <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video, but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial (United States v. Microsoft Corp.).|$|E
25|$|A kernel must {{maintain}} {{a list of}} available devices. This list may be known in advance (e.g. on an embedded system where the kernel will be rewritten if the available hardware changes), configured by the user (typical on older PCs and on systems that are not designed for personal use) or detected by the operating system at run time (normally called plug and play). In a plug and play system, a device manager first performs a scan on different hardware buses, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) or Universal <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> (USB), to detect installed devices, then searches for the appropriate drivers.|$|E

FUNi is based on an embedded processing system on a PCI card. Custom network hardware assembled from a commercial IEEE 1394 chip set provides FUNi with access to the IEEE 1394 network. In message passing, FUNi's embedded processor serves as a network coprocessor and manages an user-accessible message-passing interface in the host memory.
