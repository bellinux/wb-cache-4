5000|$|Stags wallow and dig their antlers in urine <b>soaked</b> <b>soil</b> {{and then}} rub against tree trunks. Sambar {{are capable of}} {{remarkable}} bipedalism for a deer species, and stags will stand and mark tree branches above them with their antlers. A stag will also mark himself by spraying urine on his own face with a highly mobile penis. Despite their lack of antlers, female sambar readily defend their young from most predators, something that is relatively unusual among deer. When confronted by pack-hunting dholes or domestic dogs, a sambar lowers its head with an erect mane and lash at the dogs. Sambars prefer to attack predators in shallow water. Several sambars may form a defensive formation, touching rumps and vocalising loudly at the dogs. When sensing danger, a sambar stamps its feet and makes a ringing call known as [...] "pooking" [...] or [...] "belling".|$|E
40|$|Objective of this {{dissertation}} was {{to study}} possibilities of detection of subsurface drainage systems by unmanned aerial vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles, "drones", served to military {{purpose in the}} past. Nowadays these unmanned aerial vehicles helps to map drainage on fields because {{it is hard to}} get draining plans today and a big part do not match with the actual implementation of drainage systems. We can also add that nobody cares about drainage today. Drainage drains of <b>soaked</b> <b>soil</b> and improve its harvest. Drainage facilitates transport of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) to watercourses. Fields changes over time to parcels. There is description of sorting and functionality of drainage systems as well as description of malfunctions and used material in theoretical part. There is also description of unmanned aerial vehicles and a method of detection of subsurface drainage systems. Besides there is detailed description of the locality, function of drainage system and evaluation. There is description of indication of drainage on specialized aerial photography. Indications are compared with period plans. Methods of highlighting indications are applied and evaluated by programs Agisoft PhotoScan Professional and Arc GIS 10. 1.

Based on these results, bacterial strain was chosen for further studies. In order to optimize growth condition of bacterial strain in complex medium, the growing condition i. e., nitrogen source, pH, temperature, aeration rate were optimized. The optimum growth of bacterial strain was at the present (7 g L - 1 urea, 30 °, 120 rpm, pH 6. 5).

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) in {{agricultural}} soil negatively affects crops yield and compromises food safety. Remediation of polluted soil {{is necessary for}} the re-establishment of sustainable agriculture and to prevent hazards to human health and environmental pollution. Phytoremediation is a promising technology for decontamination of polluted soil. The present study investigated the effect of molybdenum (Mo) (0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0  ppm) on endogenous production of total phenolics and free proline, plant biomass and photosynthetic pigments in Ricinus communis plants grown in Cd (25, 50 and 100  ppm) contaminated soils and the potential for Cd phytoextraction. Mo was applied via seed <b>soaking,</b> <b>soil</b> addition and foliar spray. Foliar sprays significantly increased plant biomass, Cd accumulation and bioconcentration. Phenolic concentrations showed significantly positive correlations with Cd accumulation in roots (R 2  =  0. 793, 0. 807 and 0. 739) and leaves (R 2  =  0. 707, 721 and 0. 866). Similarly, proline was significantly positively correlated with Cd accumulation in roots (R 2  =  0. 668, 0. 694 and 0. 673) and leaves (R 2  =  0. 831, 0. 964 and 0. 930).

40|$|This NebGuide {{illustrates}} {{the influence of}} soil texture, topography and irrigation system characteristics on potential runoff. When water is applied to a field through a sprinkler irrigation system, it should <b>soak</b> into the <b>soil</b> where it lands rather than drain to a low spot or off the field altogether. Runoff causes non-uniformity of water application, poor irrigation efficiency and possible leaching of chemicals to the groundwater. Some systems like LEPA (Low Energy Precision Application) are designed so water does not immediately <b>soak</b> into the <b>soil.</b> However, proper LEPA designs also call for tillage practices that hold the water on the soil surface where it lands until it has time to infiltrate into the soil. Sprinkler systems should be designed for zero runoff so no water leaves the point of application...|$|R

5000|$|Urine patches in cattle {{pastures}} generate large {{concentrations of}} the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide through nitrification and denitrification processes in urine-contaminated soils. Over the past few decades, the cattle population has increased more rapidly than the human population. Between the years 2000 and 2050, the cattle population {{is expected to increase}} from 1.5 billion to 2.6 billion. When large populations of cattle are packed into pastures, excessive amounts of urine <b>soak</b> into <b>soils.</b> This increases the rate at which nitrification and denitrification occur and produce nitrous oxide. Currently, nitrous oxide is one of the single most important ozone-depleting emissions and is expected to remain the largest throughout the 21st century.|$|R

40|$|Ten {{isolates}} of Fusarium spp {{were isolated}} from pepper plants collected from different locations in New Valley Governorate, Egypt. Fusarium solani isolate FP 2 and F. oxysporum isolate FP 4 were highly pathogenic isolates {{but the other}} isolates moderate or less pathogenic to pepper plants (cv. Anaheim-M). The four antioxidant compounds (coumaric acid, citric acid, propylgalate and salicylic acid each at 100 and 200 ppm) were evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo agonist to Fusarium pathogenic isolates caused root rot and wilt diseases in pepper plants. All tested antioxidant compounds reduced damping-off, root rot/wilt and area under root rot/wilt progress curve when used as seed soaking, seedling <b>soaking,</b> and <b>soil</b> drench especially at 200 ppm under greenhouse and field conditions compared with untreated plants. All chemicals increased fresh and dry weight of seedling grown in soil drenching or seed treatment with any antioxidants. At the same time, all tested chemicals significantly increase plant growth parameters i. e plant length, plant branching, and total yield per plant in case of seedling <b>soaking</b> or <b>soil</b> drench. In general, propylgalate at 200 ppm was more efficient in reducing infection with damping-off, root rot and wilt diseases as well as increasing the seedling fresh weight, dry weight, plant length, plant branching, number of pod plant- 1 and pod yield plant- 1. On the other hand, all tested antioxidants had less or no effect on mycelial dry weight and mycelial leaner growth. On the contrary, all chemicals much reduced spore formation in both Fusarium species at 100 or 200 ppm and the inhibitory effect of antioxidants increased with increasing their concentrations...|$|R

40|$|The Moon {{apparently}} formed without appreciable {{water or}} other relatively volatile materials. Interior concentrations {{of water or}} other volatile substances appear to be extremely low. On Earth, water {{is important to the}} genesis of nearly all types of ores. Thus, some have reasoned that only abundant elements would occur in ore concentrations. The definition and recognition of ores on the Moon challenge the imaginations and the terrestrial perceptions of ore bodies. Lunar ores included solar-wind <b>soaked</b> <b>soils,</b> which contain abundant but dilute H, C, N, and noble gases (including He- 3). Oxygen must be mined; soils contain approximately 45 percent (wt). Mainstream processes of rock formation concentrated Si, Mg, Al, Fe, and Ca, and possibly Ti and Cr. The highland surface contains approximately 70 percent (wt) feldspar (mainly CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8), which can be separated from some highland soils. Small fragments of dunite were collected; dunite may occur in walls and central peaks of some craters. Theoretical extensions of observations of lunar samples suggest that the Moon may have produced ores of trace elements. Some small fragments have trace-element concentrations 10 (exp 4) times higher than the lunar average, indicating that effective geochemical separations occurred; processes included fractional crystallization, silicate immiscibility, vaporization and condensation, and sulfide metamorphism. Operations of these processes acting on indigenous materials and on meteoritic material in the regolith could have produced ores. Infalling carbonaceous meteorites and comets have added water and hydrocarbons that may have been cold-trapped. Vesicles in basalts, pyroclastic beads, and reported transient events suggest gag emission from the lunar interior; such gas might concentrate and transport rare elements. Large impacts may disperse ores or produce them through deposition of heat at depth and by vaporization and subsequent condensation. The main problem in assessing lunar resources is the ignorance about the largely unexplored Moon...|$|R

40|$|Ralstonia solanacearum, a soilborne plant {{pathogen}} of considerable economic importance, invades host plant roots from the soil. Qualitative and quantitative chemotaxis assays revealed that this bacterium is specifically attracted to diverse amino acids and organic acids, {{and especially to}} root exudates from the host plant tomato. Exudates from rice, a nonhost plant, were less attractive. Eight different strains from this heterogeneous species complex varied significantly in their attraction to a panel of carbohydrate stimuli, raising the possibility that chemotactic responses may be differentially selected traits that confer adaptation to various hosts or ecological conditions. Previous studies found that an aflagellate mutant lacking swimming motility is significantly reduced in virulence, but the role of directed motility mediated by the chemotaxis system was not known. Two site-directed R. solanacearum mutants lacking either CheA or CheW, which are core chemotaxis signal transduction proteins, were completely nonchemotactic but retained normal swimming motility. In biologically realistic <b>soil</b> <b>soak</b> virulence assays on tomato plants, both nonchemotactic mutants had significantly reduced virulence indistinguishable {{from that of a}} nonmotile mutant, demonstrating that directed motility, not simply random motion, is required for full virulence. In contrast, nontactic strains were as virulent as the wild-type strain was when bacteria were introduced directly into the plant stem through a cut petiole, indicating that taxis makes its contribution to virulence {{in the early stages of}} host invasion and colonization. When inoculated individually by <b>soaking</b> the <b>soil,</b> both nontactic mutants reached the same population sizes as the wild type did in the stems of tomato plants just beginning to wilt. However, when tomato plants were coinoculated with a 1 : 1 mixture of a nontactic mutant and its wild-type parent, the wild-type strain outcompeted both nontactic mutants by 100 -fold.
