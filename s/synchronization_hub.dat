Recently, excessive local neuronal activity {{has been shown to}} increase amyloid deposition. In this study we use a computational model to test the hypothesis that hub regions possess the highest level of activity and that hub vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease is due to this feature. Cortical brain regions were modeled as neural masses, each describing the average activity (spike density and spectral power) {{of a large number of}} interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The large-scale network consisted of 78 neural masses, connected according to a human DTI-based cortical topology. Spike density and spectral power were positively correlated with structural and functional node degrees, confirming the high activity of hub regions, also offering a possible explanation for high resting state Default Mode Network activity. ‘Activity dependent degeneration ’ (ADD) was simulated by lowering synaptic strength as a function of the spike density of the main excitatory neurons, and compared to random degeneration. Resulting structural and functional network changes were assessed with graph theoretical analysis. Effects of ADD included oscillatory slowing, loss of spectral power and long-range <b>synchronization,</b> <b>hub</b> vulnerability, and disrupted functional network topology. Observed transient increases in spike density and functional connectivity match reports in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, and may not be compensatory but pathological.

Parallel multiunit recordings from V 1 in anesthetized cat {{were collected}} during the presentation of randomÂ sequences of drifting sinusoidal gratings at 12 fixed orientations while gamma oscillations were present. In agreement with the seminal work [1], most units were orientation selective to varying degrees and synchronization was evident in spike trainÂ crosscorrelograms computed between units with similar preferred orientations, particularly during theÂ presentation of optimal stimuli. Interestingly, a subset of units, which we refer to as <b>synchronization</b> <b>hubs,</b> wereÂ additionally found to synchronize with units having differing preferred orientations which was consistentÂ with a previous study [2]. Moreover, oscillatory patterning in spike train autocorrelograms was alsoÂ found to be strongest in units denoted as <b>synchronization</b> <b>hubs,</b> and <b>synchronization</b> <b>hubs</b> also tended to have narrower tuning curves relative to other units. We used simplified computational models of small networks of V 1 neurons to demonstrate that neurons subject to a sufficiently strong level of inhibitory input can function as <b>synchronization</b> <b>hubs.</b> Neurons were endowedÂ either with integrate-and-fire or conductance-based dynamics and each neuron received a combinationÂ of excitatory (AMPA) synaptic inputs that were Poisson-distributed and inhibitory (GABA) inputs thatÂ were coherent at a gamma-frequency range. If the strength of rhythmic inhibition was increased for aÂ subset of neurons in the network, and excitation was increased simultaneously to maintain a fixed firingÂ rate, then these neurons produced stronger oscillatory patterning in their discharge probabilities. TheÂ oscillations in turn synchronized these neurons with other neurons in the network. Importantly, theÂ strength of synchronization increased with neurons of differing orientation preferences even though noÂ direct synaptic coupling existed between the hubs and the other neurons. Enhanced levels of inhibition account {{for the emergence of}} <b>synchronization</b> <b>hubs</b> in the following way:Â Inhibitory inputs exhibiting a gamma rhythm determine a time window within which a cell is likely toÂ discharge. Increased levels of inhibition narrow down this window further simultaneously leading to (i) Â even stronger oscillatory patterning of the neuron's activity and (ii) enhanced synchronization withÂ other neurons. This enables synchronization even between cells with differing orientation preferences. Â Additionally, the same increased levels of inhibition may be responsible for the narrow tuning curves ofÂ hub neurons. In conclusion, <b>synchronization</b> <b>hubs</b> may be the cells that interact most strongly with theÂ network of inhibitory interneurons during gamma oscillations in primary visual cortex...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{recently}} described technique for manipulating the clustering coefficient {{of a network}} without changing its degree distribution, we {{examine the effect of}} clustering on the synchronization of phase oscillators on networks with Poisson and scale-free degree distributions. For both types of network, increased clustering hinders global synchronization as the network splits into dynamical clusters that oscillate at different frequencies. Surprisingly, in scale-free networks, clustering promotes the synchronization of the most connected nodes (hubs) even though it inhibits global synchronization. As a result, scale-free networks show an additional, advanced transition instead of a single synchronization threshold. This cluster-enhanced <b>synchronization</b> of <b>hubs</b> may be relevant to the brain with its scale-free and highly clustered structure. Comment: Submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} network technologies and topologies are currently being evaluated {{as part of the}} Whitney Project. This paper reports on the implementation and performance of a Fast Ethernet network configured in a 4 x 4 2 D torus topology in a testbed cluster of "commodity" Pentium Pro PCs. Several benchmarks were used for performance evaluation: an MPI point to point message passing benchmark, an MPI collective communication benchmark, and the NAS Parallel Benchmarks version 2. 2 (NPB 2). Our results show that for point to point communication on an unloaded network, the hub and 1 hop routes on the torus have about the same bandwidth and latency. However, the bandwidth decreases and the latency increases on the torus for each additional route hop. Collective communication benchmarks show that the torus provides roughly four times more aggregate bandwidth and eight times faster MPI barrier <b>synchronizations</b> than a <b>hub</b> based network for 16 processor systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{issues related to the}} {{delivery}} of multimedia streams on local area networks. Multimedia integrates voice and video along with text and images into existing systems. Local area networks were designed to handle regular data traffic which are bursty in nature and for which variable delay is acceptable. Multimedia traffic, on the other hand, requires constant delay in addition to fast (or real time) delivery. Multimedia traffic also requires large amount of bandwidth compared to regular traffic. Since local area networks are widely in use, their modification to integrate multimedia streams is very important. In our work we consider some possible solutions to the problems associated with multimedia on local area networks as well as studying the performance aspects of these solutions. Key words: Multimedia, local area networks, <b>synchronization,</b> priority, switching <b>hubs.</b> 1 Introduction Multimedia is a media that integrates the transmission of voice and video alo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{synchronization}} in {{the context}} of network traffic on a $ 2 -d$ communication network with local clustering and geographic separations. The network consists of nodes and randomly distributed hubs where the top five hubs ranked according to their coefficient of betweenness centrality (CBC) are connected by random assortative and gradient mechanisms. For multiple message traffic, messages can trap at the high CBC hubs, and congestion can build up on the network with long queues at the congested hubs. The queue lengths are seen to synchronize in the congested phase. Both complete and phase synchronization is seen, between pairs of hubs. In the decongested phase, the pairs start clearing, and synchronization is lost. A cascading master-slave relation is seen between the hubs, with the slower hubs (which are slow to decongest) driving the faster ones. These are usually the hubs of high CBC. Similar results are seen for traffic of constant density. Total <b>synchronization</b> between the <b>hubs</b> of high CBC is also seen in the congested regime. Similar behavior is seen for traffic on a network constructed using the Waxman random topology generator. We also demonstrate the existence of phase synchronization in real Internet traffic data.

40|$|Abstract Background Biological {{networks}}, such as protein-protein interactions, metabolic, signalling, transcription-regulatory {{networks and}} neural synapses, are representations of large-scale dynamic systems. The {{relationship between the}} network structure and functions {{remains one of the}} central problems in current multidisciplinary research. Significant progress has been made toward understanding the implication of topological features for the network dynamics and functions, especially in biological networks. Given observations of a network system's behaviours or measurements of its functional dynamics, what can we conclude of the details of physical connectivity of the underlying structure? Results We modelled the network system by employing a scale-free network of coupled phase oscillators. Pairwise phase coherence (PPC) was calculated for all the pairs of oscillators to present functional dynamics induced by the system. At the regime of global incoherence, we observed a Significant pairwise synchronization only between two nodes that are physically connected. Right after the onset of global synchronization, disconnected nodes begin to oscillate in a correlated fashion and the PPC of two nodes, either connected or disconnected, depends on their degrees. Based on the observation of PPCs, we built a weighted network of synchronization (WNS), an all-to-all functionally connected network where each link is weighted by the PPC of two oscillators at the ends of the link. In the regime of strong coupling, we observed a Significant similarity in the organization of WNSs induced by systems sharing the same substrate network but different configurations of initial phases and intrinsic frequencies of oscillators. We reconstruct physical network from the WNS by choosing the links whose weights are higher than a given threshold. We observed an optimal reconstruction just before the onset of global synchronization. Finally, we correlated the topology of the background network to the observed change of the functional activities in the system. Conclusions The results presented in this study indicate a strong relationship between the structure and dynamics of complex network systems. As coupling strength increases, <b>synchronization</b> emerges among <b>hub</b> nodes and recruits small-degree nodes. The results show that the onset of global synchronization in the system hinders the reconstruction of an underlying complex structure. Our analysis helps to clarify how the synchronization is achieved in systems of different network topologies. </p...|$|R
