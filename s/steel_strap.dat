40|$|Fact sheet {{written for}} the Inventions and Innovation Program about a new method for making <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and strip from rod stock {{produced}} from scrap steel. There is a large movement in the American steel industry to utilize more recycled steel. Recycled steel melted in the electric arc furnaces of mini-mills is being used {{as the source of}} raw materials for an increasing number of products, largely due to its lower price. However, conventional processes for producing <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and cold-rolled strip steel restrict manufacturers from using more than 50 % recycled steel. In addition, <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and cold-rolled strip steel traditionally require many production steps. They are produced from primary steel that has been cast into slab, heated, rolled to achieve the desired thickness, and slit to the desired width. The slitting process produces microcracks {{along the edge of the}} strapping or strip, which reduce tensile strength. A new continuous process produces <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and 1 / 2 inch to 6 inch strip steel from the rod and strip stock made from scrap steel in mini-mills. The new process creates <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and strip with improved strength and quality due to the absence of microcracks caused by the conventional slitting process. The finished product is cheaper because of the lower cost associated with using rod ad lower conversion costs. In addition, the higher tensile strength of the product allows for thinner strapping. The process represents a new approach to producing any <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> used for bundling and packaging items for storage or transport. In addition, this innovative new process can be used to produce cold-rolled strip steel, a basic raw material for automobile parts, hardware, office equipment, and many other products...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} high {{strength}} concrete (HSC) has become increasingly popular {{in the construction of}} buildings and infra-structures. The utilization of HSC has been spurred on by the superior mechanical properties of the material and its cost-effectiveness. However, HSC tends to be more brittle or less tough than normal strength concrete. Therefore, external confinements are used to overcome and enhance the concrete characteristics. This study investigates the effectiveness of using <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> in increasing the strength and ductility of HSC. Its also investigate the effects of using <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> with different ultimate tensile strength and placed with different spacings. All the cylinders were tested under axial compression load to study their stress-axial strain and stress-lateral strain characteristics upon loading. Mode of failure of the cylinders has been observed. The results indicated that the confined cylinders have higher ultimate load-capacity and ductility compared to the unconfined cylinders. It also shows that higher strength of <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> will increase the strength and ductility of confined {{high strength}} concrete. Further work needs to be carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of using low-cost <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> as alternative to more costly confining materials such as Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) ...|$|R

50|$|Duct connections: {{section to}} section.Ducts are shipped from {{fabricating}} facility to job sits on trucks, by rail, or on barges in lengths accommodating {{the mode of}} transport, often in 20 foot sections. These sections are connected with flanges, or weld straps. Flanges are provided at expansion joints, or to join low stress duct sections. Flanges {{may be difficult to}} design for the duct plate forces. Also flange gaskets add flexibility to the flanges that makes their ability to carry forces problematic. therefore weld straps (a short <b>steel</b> <b>strap)</b> are commonly used for higher stress duct plate connections.|$|E
50|$|One {{common design}} of {{laminated}} core {{is made from}} interleaved stacks of E-shaped steel sheets capped with I-shaped pieces, leading to its name of 'E-I transformer'. Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a <b>steel</b> <b>strap.</b> They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of repair works for damaged concrete, an {{accurate}} and representative stress-strain model is of important. The stress-strain model for damaged high strength concrete (HSC) repaired with post-tensioning <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> confinement yet available, although the confining method has been proven {{to be effective in}} improving the performance of non-damaged HSC. A series of experimental test was carried out to investigate the stress-strain relationships of such concrete. A total of 24 HSC cylinders were compressed until certain damaged levels, then repaired by using <b>steel</b> <b>straps.</b> Two important parameters have been identified to have significant effects on the stress-strain relationship of such repaired concrete, namely the confining volumetric ratio and damaged levels. These parameters were incorporated into the development of stressstrain model, which later was shown to correlate well with the experimental results. This paper also has evidenced that existing stressstrain models of damaged concrete are not suitable to be directly applied to {{the design of}} repair works using post-tensioning <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> confinement that produce external lateral stress on damaged columns before subsequent loading applied...|$|R

50|$|Oriented or tensilized {{polyester}} and nylon are {{the strongest}} plastic strapping products {{and are used}} as {{a viable alternative to}} <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> in some industries. Polyester provides excellent retained tension on rigid loads. Its excellent recovery properties help a load absorb impact without strap breakage.|$|R
5000|$|Steel is {{the oldest}} and highest tensile {{strength}} strapping. It is available {{in a variety of}} widths and thicknesses as well as variations in the grade of steel. Steel is used for heavy duty holding where high strength and minimal stretch are desired. Surface finishes for <b>steel</b> <b>strap</b> include: paint, paint and wax, bluing or zinc and wax. The wax is used to better transmit the tension around the bundle and for use with certain types of tensioners. Common applications include steel coils, bundles of metal, baling wire, bricks and pavers, and roll end-binding. Steel Strapping is sold by weight rather than length, due to the natural expansion and contraction of steel in the manufacturing process. A 3/4 x [...]020 Steel Strapping Coil yields approximately 19.6 feet per pound.|$|E
50|$|After {{the strap}} is tensioned, the strap is often sealed to itself. <b>Steel</b> <b>strap</b> is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and crimp, seal-less joint, or via welding. Seals come in various shapes {{depending}} on the application; some can be put on after the strap is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, the seal and strap are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a single notch joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a double notch joint. Crimp joints also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping. Seal-less joints are created by forming interlocking keys {{into the middle of}} the strap.|$|E
50|$|The joint is {{the weakest}} {{part of the}} system, {{therefore}} the type of joining method used is very important if strength is an issue. The strength of a joint {{is defined as the}} force required to break the strap in uniaxial tension. This is then compared to the uniaxial strength of the strap and recorded as the percent difference (e.g., a sample of <b>steel</b> <b>strap</b> may have a 5000 lb break strength and the seal may fail at 3000 lb, so the seal is said to have a 60% strength). Hot knife welds have a minimum break strength of 55%. Friction welds have a minimum break strength of 65%. Well set up strapping machines or friction weld tools will aim for around 80% of break strength. Metal clips/seals are surprisingly low with circa 100 - 120 kg slip resistance.|$|E
