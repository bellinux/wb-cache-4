5000|$|The first 250 Panthers were {{powered by}} a Maybach HL 210 P30 engine, V-12 petrol engine, which {{delivered}} 650 metric hp at 3,000 rpm and had three simple air filters.

To save aluminium, the light alloy block used in the HL 210 {{was replaced by a}} cast iron block. Two multistage [...] "cyclone" [...] air filters were used to improve dust removal. Due to the use of low <b>grade</b> <b>petrol,</b> the engine power output was reduced.

5000|$|... Iran has 3,200 gas {{stations}} for 15 million automobiles. Demand {{is supported by}} the fixing of fuel prices well below market levels. There are two pricing schemes for petrol, one subsidized the other not. Each month, qualified vehicle owners are allocated a specific number of subsidized liters of petrol (taxi's have a significantly higher allocation). The cost of regular unsubsidized petrol in Iran is IR7,000/liter (approximately 37 US cents/liter) and premium <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> IR8,000/liter, whereas the subsidized equivalents go for IR4,000/liter and IR5,000/liter, respectively. The nation's abundant oil reserves have enabled the government to keep prices low (Iran is the second-largest exporter in OPEC). However, low prices have encouraged wasteful consumption and the smuggling of petrol into neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some 1.8 billion liters of oil products worth 10 trillion rials ($1 billion) are smuggled out of Iran per annum.|$|R

5000|$|LPG is {{prepared}} by refining petroleum or [...] "wet" [...] natural gas, and {{is almost entirely}} derived from fossil fuel sources, being manufactured during the refining of petroleum (crude oil), or extracted from petroleum or natural gas streams as they emerge from the ground. It was first produced in 1910 by Dr. Walter Snelling, and the first commercial products appeared in 1912. It currently provides about 3% of all energy consumed, and burns relatively cleanly with no soot and very few sulfur emissions. As it is a gas, it does not pose ground or water pollution hazards, but it can cause air pollution. LPG has a typical specific calorific value of 46.1 MJ/kg compared with 42.5 MJ/kg for fuel oil and 43.5 MJ/kg for premium <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline). However, its energy density per volume unit of 26 MJ/L is lower than either that of petrol or fuel oil, as its relative density is lower (about 0.5-0.58 kg/L, compared to 0.71-0.77 kg/L for gasoline).|$|R

5000|$|During the {{two decades}} that {{followed}} the Second World War, the available fuels in Europe had featured progressively higher octane ratings, and compression ratios of European cars had increased correspondingly. However, the cheaper (so called yellow <b>grade)</b> <b>petrol</b> widely distributed in Brazil in 1976 had an octane rating of just 73, so for Brazil {{it was necessary to}} use a relatively low compression ratio of 7.2 to 1. In order to provide adequate power with the lower compression ratio, a larger engine was needed, and the Fiat 147 was launched with a [...] unit with a five-bearing crankshaft in place of the , three-bearing engine that then was still standard in the 127s from Turin. Press reports of the time reported that the larger engine produced a much smoother and quieter drive as well as enhanced torque. [...] The [...] engine, along with some of the revised bodyshell elements of the 147 (most notably the rear three-quarter panels) were later introduced on the Series 2 version of the 127 itself, when it was released in Europe a year later.|$|R
