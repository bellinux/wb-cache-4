5|$|Antoine Gardano {{became the}} primary Italian {{publisher}} for Arcadelt, although the competing Venetian publishing house of Scotto brought {{out one of}} his madrigal books as well. Arcadelt's Il bianco e dolce cigno opened one of Gardano's books; as the piece had already achieved immense fame, it was the main selling point. In Paris, some of Arcadelt's chansons appeared as early as 1540 in the publications of Pierre Attaingnant and Jacques Moderne, <b>so</b> <b>must</b> have been written in Italy. After Arcadelt returned to France, his chansons, masses, and motets appeared in the editions of the printing firm of Le Roy and Ballard throughout the 1550s and 1560s, while his music was still being printed in distant Venice.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and <b>so</b> <b>must</b> be developed as part of an integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E

Holding both a 4 and an 8, it cannot hold a 3, <b>so</b> it <b>must</b> hold a 7. But now the hand includes a 7-8 fifteen, {{which is a}} contradiction.|$|R

5|$|When a {{squadron}} wishes {{to create a}} cadet band, the decision to do <b>so</b> <b>must</b> be made {{in consultation with the}} sponsoring committee responsible for provision and maintenance of musical instruments. The cadet music program recognizes two types of bands: military bands and pipe bands. Military bands' instrumentation includes woodwinds, brass, and/or percussion, while pipe bands' instrumentation includes pipes and drums. The Regional Support Cadet Unit should provide instruments on loan to their squadrons to maximize the use of the instruments held by the region and CSTCs and to better support squadron training. The music proficiency levels are recognized on the cadet uniform using a system of badges based on the music training programs; the military band badge represents a lyre, while the pipe band badge represents either a pipe or a drum, depending on the instrument played.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and <b>so</b> <b>must</b> have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E

25|$|The {{unsaturated}} zone {{can play an}} important role in retarding (and in some cases eliminating) pathogens and <b>so</b> <b>must</b> be considered when assessing aquifer vulnerability.

25|$|An ED {{requires}} different {{equipment and}} different approaches {{than most other}} hospital divisions.

25|$|Doors: The doors themselves, at first, were {{essentially}} the same.

The Boston cars did not have this feature and <b>so</b> <b>must</b> be boarded from street-level. These doors proved troublesome and the MBTA eventually replaced them with bi-folding doors, further distinguishing them from Muni's.|$|E

25|$|A primary {{motivation}} for paraconsistent logic is {{the conviction that}} {{it ought to be}} possible to reason with inconsistent information in a controlled and discriminating way.

Paraconsistent logic makes it possible to distinguish between inconsistent theories and to reason with them.|$|E

However, scientists have not found a way to carry out such a reaction.|$|E
