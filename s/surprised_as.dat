Harvey Dent reads a note from Batman, {{promising}} that he will defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again.

5|$|In Guatemala City, Guatemalan trafficker Efrain Ortiz {{is shown}} being arrested, {{and the film}} {{indicates}} that he was later given a prison sentence of 95 years. Ortiz had two sons he had been using for waste collection and five daughters he had been committing incest with. Bilheimer accompanies IJM representatives Pablo Villeda, Amy Roth, and Gary Haugen as they and the local police arrest Ortiz; he is charged with exploitation of children and violence against women.

5|$|North American forecasters, however <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> they were, {{considered}} this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence. Since Catarina {{had a clear}} eyewall structure bounded by deep convective, dense central overcast, well-defined spiral outer bands and outflow structure, warm water temperatures of 79°F (26°C), little shear, a warm core low, overall tropical characteristics, and occurred in March (equivalent to September in the Northern Hemisphere, the peak of hurricane season), it {{was considered to be}} a hurricane by the National Hurricane Center in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E
5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is <b>surprised,</b> <b>as</b> he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to blow up the entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish fleet arrived off Roatán at 6am on March 13, {{and after}} its {{defenders}} fired several ineffectual cannon shots, the Santa Maltilda {{and the other}} ships anchored out of range. At 8am Gálvez sent his second-in-command on the 'Santa Matilda' Enrique MacDonell, who spoke English, in to request the surrender of the island's defenders. The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options, which Gálvez granted. After that time had elapsed MacDonell came back with word that the defenders refused to surrender and were prepared to stand their ground 'to the death'. The Spanish were not <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> their sailors had noticed the English appeared to be preparing defenses during grace period. An Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so Gálvez then held council of his eleven officers, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Sing {{engineers}} his and Bones {{escape from}} confinement, and Sum is impressed, offering them {{membership in the}} Gang if they can kill a person. Sing and Bone attempt to kill the Landlady, but their plan backfires, and Sing barely escapes from the Landlady's wrath. Seeking safety in a traffic pulpit, Sing is <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> his body rapidly heals from the injuries sustained in the escape, the pain causing him to strike {{the sides of the}} pulpit with extreme force, covering the surface in indentations. Later, he attempts to mug an ice cream vendor, who {{turns out to be the}} mute girl; she offers him a lollipop but he knocks it away, humiliated at himself. After sending Bone away, blaming his failure on Bone, Sing is bought before Sum. Sum wants Sing to use his escape skills to free a legendary fighter, the Beast, from a mental asylum to use against Pig Sty Alley, offering Sing membership in the Gang for doing so. Upon being released, the Beast appears to be a middle-aged, slovenly, and flippant man, but is quickly shown to be a formidable and ruthless fighter.|$|E

25|$|Brandy Station was {{the largest}} {{predominantly}} cavalry fight of the war, and the largest to take place on American soil. It was a tactical draw, although Pleasonton withdrew before finding the location of Lee's infantry nearby and Stuart claimed a victory, attempting to disguise the embarrassment of a cavalry force being <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> it was by Pleasonton. The battle established the emerging reputation of the Union cavalry as a peer of the Confederate mounted arm.|$|E

25|$|He {{was indicted}} on three counts: (1) {{conspiracy}} to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity; (2) planning, initiating, and waging wars of aggression; and (3) crimes against the laws of war. Raeder was found guilty on all the counts, and therefore sentenced to life imprisonment. He was <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> he had expected to be sentenced to death. Whilst in prison, Raeder was the constant companion of Dönitz, with whom he continued his feud. There were several campaigns to free Raeder, by his wife and German veterans. Due to ill health, Raeder was released on 26 September 1955.|$|E
25|$|He began 1949-50 {{by scoring}} 111 in a drawn match against Hutt Valley, {{reaching}} his century in 50 minutes and hitting 12 fours and eight sixes. In Waikato's next match, a two-day fixture against the touring Australians, he scored 102 in 157 minutes (12 fours and three sixes) {{out of a}} team total of 157; the next best score was 15. Given that he was 33 and had not played a first-class match for 12 years, his selection for the only match between New Zealand and the Australians three weeks later was unexpected. Even the Australians were <b>surprised,</b> <b>as</b> they had not taken the Waikato match very seriously. He made 0 and 12, bowled by Jack Iverson each time, and New Zealand narrowly avoided an innings defeat. He played a few more matches for Waikato in 1950-51 and 1951-52.|$|E
25|$|Following the win, it {{was soon}} {{announced}} that Darchinyan would take part in Showtime's four man bantamweight tournament, along with Joseph Agbeko, Abner Mares and IBF bantamweight champion Yonnhy Pérez. Vic lost in the semi-finals against México's Mares via controversial split decision. Darchinyan dominated Mares in {{first half of the}} fight. Mares was knocked down once in the second round and was docked a point in the fourth round for low blows. Mares had been throwing dirty punches the entire fight, however, and continued to do so, being warned 16 more times after the point deduction. The referee continued to {{turn a blind eye to}} Mares' low blows and, as a result, Mares started winning rounds. Darchinyan was knocked down once in the seventh round out of pain from low blows. When the win was announced for Mares, the audience seemed <b>surprised,</b> <b>as</b> many felt Darchinyan had won this fight.|$|E

25|$|Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle's I Cavalry Corps led Marmont's advance. After obtaining local guides, {{the column}} left {{the main road}} at Jonchery-sur-Vesle and {{followed}} a route through Sapicourt to Rosnay. At Rosnay, they surprised several squadrons of Prussian cavalry which fled in a panic. One battalion of the 3rd Pommeranian Landwehr Regiment was at Rosny while a second battalion was at Muizon on the Vesle. The 5th Kurmärk Landwehr had one battalion at Gueux and a second one at Thillois. The battalion in Rosnay fellback fighting to Gueux and finally to Ormes. While defending themselves in the Ormes cemetery, the Prussians were overwhelmed by Pierre Pelleport's infantry brigade; many surrendered while others were cut down by the 10th Hussars and the 1st Gardes d'Honneur from Cyrille Simon Picquet's cavalry brigade. While he was inspecting a camp at Gueux, Jagow was surprised by French cavalry and galloped away on an unsaddled horse. <b>Surprised</b> <b>as</b> they cooked supper, many of the Prussians at Muizon and Thillois left their shoes and coats behind in their flight.|$|E
25|$|On October 23 the {{day after}} the Spanish had ordered a dispersal, leading {{elements}} of the English fleet had started to return to Falmouth, Plymouth and Dartmouth but amazingly had completely missed the retreating Spanish fleet. At one point both fleets English and Spanish were on converging lines with one another. Essex on arrival soon learned from Mountjoy of the situation and both were <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> each other as to how the English fleet had missed the Spanish. Essex immediately wrote letter to letter to parliament and the Queen in order to salvage the situation. Initially he was invested by the Queen with full powers sent down to him; the channel squadron was ordered to join his flag. The government soon after were impressed by his actions and understandings of the intentions of the Spanish fleet; the capture of Falmouth or Milford Haven or the interception of the English fleet from the Azores. However soon after in one spirited letter by the Queen he was given a back hand by her for his failings in the Azores and the addition of England having been left unguarded. Essex immediately went to Court to explain his actions but was to be met by an icy disapproval from the Queen after which he went home to Wanstead to nurse his misery. Howard of Effingham in Essex's absence were given the command of the fleet to make sure the threat was alleviated.|$|E
500|$|Steven Moffat {{confirmed}} that the cliffhanger, the return of Moriarty, had been planned {{as far back as}} series two, when he discussed the plan for Moriarty's character with actor Andrew Scott. However, he joked that he was as <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> the viewers to see Moriarty return, noting {{that it is impossible to}} fake shooting oneself in the head. Scott appeared in a short post-credits scene talking to the camera, both firsts for the show. Moffat has commented that viewers will have to wait [...] "years" [...] to see the resolution of the cliffhanger.|$|E

Stanley Parkes (Lennon's cousin) was on the ladder fixing the plaque {{to the wall and}} said, [...] "I think I can see Ingrid" [...] Baird and her sister were <b>surprised,</b> <b>as</b> it meant that Parkes had seen Ingrid before, even though Baird and Jackie never had. When all three finally {{met for the first time}} Baird was shocked that Ingrid did not look anything like the Stanley family, as she had [...] "pale blue eyes and fair hair".|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{was known}} for his quick wit and a good sense of humor. On hearing of his {{nomination}} as vice president, he announced that he was not <b>surprised,</b> <b>as</b> [...] "Indiana is the mother of Vice Presidents; home of more second-class men than any other state". One of his favorite jokes, which he delivered in a speech {{on the eve of his}} departure for Washington D.C. to become vice president, recounted a story of a man with two sons. One of the sons went to sea and drowned and the other was elected vice president; neither son was ever heard from again. On his election as vice president, he sent Woodrow Wilson a book, inscribed [...] "From your only Vice".|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as <b>surprised</b> <b>as</b> anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E
