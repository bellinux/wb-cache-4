40|$|Utah 2 Ì† 7 s timber {{production}} in 1992 was 13. 3 million cubic feet (63. 7 million board feet, <b>Scribner</b> <b>rule),</b> up 9 percent from 1974. Sawlog production was 10. 2 million cubic feet (52. 5 million board feet). House log volume was 1. 6 million cubic feet (8. 2 million board feet). Lodgepole pine comprised 48 percent, Uintah County 29 percent, and National Forest lands 78 {{percent of the}} harvest. Mill residue volume was 7 million cubic feet, 82 percent of which was used, most for fencing, firewood, animal bedding, or industrial plant fuel...|$|E
40|$|Published April 2012. Please {{look for}} {{up-to-date}} {{information in the}} OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] woodland owner must take certain steps to produce and sell logs for maximum revenue. This publication includes best practices for obtaining bids, selecting a buyer, and writing purchase orders; using the <b>Scribner</b> log <b>rule,</b> making decisions about bucking, selecting log lengths and diameters, and bucking to remove defects; and comparing markets...|$|R
40|$|Two {{intermediate}} cuttings {{were made}} in a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) stand on the Wilark forest management research area in northwestern Oregon. Age of trees in the stand varied from 47 to 62 years at the first cutting. Crawler tractors were used in both extractions. In the first cutting, the time required for log production was 6. 21 man-hours for a thousand board feet <b>Scribner</b> log <b>rule</b> at the mill site on the area. An additional 1. 01 man-hours a thousand board feet was accounted for in delays not associated with productive time. A total of 19, 702 feet of road was constructed. Construction time for 100 feet of road ranged from 1. 55 man-hours for skid roads to 9. 39 manhours for main road. Road construction increased total time for log production by 0. 92 man-hour for a thousand board feet in the first cutting. The time required for log production in the second cutting was 3. 78 man-hours for a thousand board feet, and delays amounted to 0. 43 man-hour a thousand. A separate time study was made to {{determine the influence of}} delays present in the actual extractions on the cost of log production. Frequently ignored factors that appeared to affect economic outcome were favorable weather, efficient technique in extraction, and skilled labor...|$|R
5000|$|The log scaler is an {{occupation}} in the timber industry. The Log Scaler measures the cut trees {{to determine the}} scale (volume) and quality (grade) of the wood {{to be used for}} manufacturing. When logs are sold, {{in order to determine the}} basis for a sale price in a standard way, the logs are [...] "scaled" [...] which means they are measured, identified as to species, and deductions for defects assigned to produce a net volume of merchantable wood. There are several different scales or rules that are used to determine the volume of wood. <b>Scribner</b> Decimal C <b>rule</b> is based on diagrams of circles that show the amount of boards that will be utilized from diameters of logs. Cubic rule, often called Metric in Canada, determines the cubic volume of the log material. The logs are recorded as gross scale (actual log measurements, length and diameter) and net scale (volume after deductions for defects are taken out). This occupation is usually performed by a third party organization qualified to [...] "scale" [...] government timber. Since internal defects are determined by external indications, scaling is not an exact science and is subject to interpretation of log scaling rules. The log scaler is subject to random [...] "check scales" [...] in which another scaler rescales exactly the same logs and the results are compared. The log scaler must be within + or - 1% of the gross scale and + or - 2% of the net scale to keep their certification to scale. The scale is used for payment, quality control and inventory purposes.|$|R
