5|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the construction of}} taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face <b>social</b> <b>discrimination,</b> such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum makers have used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.|$|E
5|$|In 1510, a Portuguese fleet under Afonso de Albuquerque, sent by King Manuel I of Portugal, wrested {{the region}} of Goa from Sultan Yusuf Adil Shah of Bijapur. In 1534, the Diocese of Goa was established. Soon missionaries were sent to Goa, which led to {{conversion}} of a sizeable population to Roman Catholicism. The bulk of Christian settlers came in three major migration waves towards South Canara. These migrations occurred in periods of great unrest: the Goa Inquisition occurred from 1560 onwards; the Portuguese–Adil Shahi wars were between 1570–79; and the Portuguese–Maratha wars occurred between 1667–83 and 1737–40. Other factors that led to mass migrations were disease epidemics, famines, natural calamities, overpopulation, poor living conditions, heavy tax burdens, and <b>social</b> <b>discrimination</b> by the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|Social reforms {{aimed at}} {{removing}} {{practices such as}} sati and <b>social</b> <b>discrimination</b> based upon untouchability, as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes, swept across India and influenced Mysore territory. In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight. Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women was encouraged, and in 1923, some women were granted the permission to exercise their franchise in elections. There were, however, uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the Kodagu uprising in 1835 (after the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the Kanara uprising of 1837. The era of printing heralded by Christian missionaries, notably Hermann Mögling, resulted in the founding of printing presses across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books (such as the Pampa Bharata and the Jaimini Bharata), a Kannada-language Bible, a bilingual dictionary and a Kannada newspaper called Kannada Samachara {{began in the early}} 19th century. Aluru Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of Kannadigas in his book Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1926–27, with other {{candidates}} unavailable, Gilligan was chosen to captain an MCC team which toured India; the side was not fully representative and did not play Test matches. In first-class games, he scored three fifties and, bowling infrequently, took ten wickets on the tour. The team, the first to tour India under the colours of the MCC, was very successful. Gilligan left most of the day-to-day organisation to his vice-captain, Raleigh Chichester-Constable, and did not take his speech-making duties particularly seriously. He nevertheless had several issues to deal with. One of his players, Jack Parsons, refused for religious reasons to play in any matches in which play took place on a Sunday; Gilligan threatened to send him home {{but in the end}} he agreed to play on condition that he could leave early on a Sunday to attend religious services. Parsons was also openly critical of racial and <b>social</b> <b>discrimination</b> that he saw. Gilligan intervened at one point when his team's professionals were excluded from some invitations in Calcutta and told their hosts that no-one would attend the functions if the professionals were not included. Both the sporting and social programmes for the tour were demanding, and Gilligan wanted to attend most functions for fear of offending the European or Indian hosts. The members of the team were left exhausted, necessitating the use of reinforcements to their number, including the occasional use of English cricketers who were coaching in India, and on several occasions, the Maharajah of Patiala, {{who was a member of}} the MCC and entitled to play.|$|E

40|$|Female Belding's ground {{squirrels}} (Spermophilus beldingi), {{that had}} been reared apart from each other, were observed in paired-encounter tests to determine whether exposure to nestmates' phenotypes during development had influenced their subsequent <b>social</b> <b>discriminations.</b> As a result of cross-fostering, test partners were (1) either unfamiliar sisters (reared apart) or unfamiliar, unrelated females, and were (2) either reared with each other's siblings (indirectly exposed to each other) or were not reared with each other's siblings (not indirectly exposed to each other). Regardless of relatedness, females that were indirectly exposed to each other were significantly less agonistic during tests than females not indirectly exposed to each other. This suggests that females learned something from their nestmates' phenotypes and later recalled what they had learned in order to distinguish between their nestmates' unfamiliar kin and non-kin. Furthermore, sisters that were indirectly exposed to each other were less agonistic than nonsisters that were indirectly exposed to each other. This was true even when the only kin phenotypes females had experienced during rearing were their own, which suggests that females may have compared unfamiliar phenotypes with their own, {{as well as those}} of their nestmates. Thus, the phenotypes that females encountered during rearing, both their nestmates' and their own, influenced their later <b>social</b> <b>discriminations,</b> probably by phenotype matching. Under this recognition mechanism, an individual forms a hypothetical `kin template' based on its own or its familiar relatives' phenotypes, and later compares the phenotypes of other conspecifics with the learned template...|$|R
40|$|Law {{is often}} the source of <b>social</b> <b>discriminations,</b> but, at the same time, it can be thekey to delete these <b>social</b> <b>discriminations.</b> The authors try to give an example of thisphenomenon, by {{analyzing}} {{the impact of the}} Italian citizenship’s rules over the descendantsof the Italian citizens emigrated abroad and, especially, in South America. Indeed, according to the former Italian law, only fathers could transmit iure sanguinisthe citizenship to their children: moreover, women automatically lost theItalian citizenship if they get a foreign citizenship by concluding a marriage witha foreign husband. These rules hardly discriminate the Italian women emigrated abroad and, especially,their descendants who were prevented to get the Italian’s citizenship. These discriminatory rules were finally deleted by the Italian Constitutional Courtin the Seventies and in the Eighties: however, the effects of those rules still persisted,since the decision of the Constitutional Court could not overcome the temporal limit of the entry into force of the Constitution (01. 01. 1948) and, therefore, could not“cover” the discriminatory facts occurred before that date. Finally in 2009, the Italian Supreme Court, by extending the effects ratione temporisof the decisions of the Constitutional Court, “reopened the doors” of the Italiancitizenship to a huge number of Italian citizenship born from Italian women beforethe 01. 01. 1948. Therefore, the authors focus on the social impact of this decision for all the potentialItalian citizens living in South America and try to assess its juridical effects overthe Italian law...|$|R

40|$|The authors used {{laboratory}} rats (Rattus norvegicus) {{of known}} relatedness and contrasting familiarity {{to assess the}} potential effect of preexperimental social experience on subsequent social recognition. The authors used the habituation-discrimination technique, which assumes that multiple exposures to a social stimulus (e. g., soiled bedding) ensure a subject discriminates between the habituation stimulus and a novel stimulus when both are introduced simultaneously. The authors observed a strong discrimination if the subjects had different amounts of preexperimental experience with the donors of the 2 stimuli but a weak discrimination if the subjects had either equal amounts of preexperimental experience or no experience with the stimuli. Preexperimental social experience does, therefore, appear to influence decision making in subsequent <b>social</b> <b>discriminations.</b> Implications for recognition and memory research are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The Ainu have {{historically}} suffered from economic and <b>social</b> <b>discrimination</b> throughout Japan {{that continues to}} this day. The Japanese Government {{as well as people}} since contact with the Ainu, have in large part regarded them as a dirty, backwards and a primitive people. The majority of Ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the Meiji Restoration, which saw the introduction of Hokkaido into the Japanese Empire and the privatization of traditional Ainu lands. The Japanese government during the 19th and 20th centuries denied the rights of the Ainu to their traditional cultural practices, most notably the right to speak their language, as well as their right to hunt and gather. These policies were designed to fully integrate the Ainu into Japanese society with the cost of erasing Ainu culture and identity. The Ainu's position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger Japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the Japanese government that can still be felt today. This discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the Ainu have manifested in the Ainu's lower levels of education, income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically Japanese counterparts. The Ainu community in Hokkaido in 1993 received welfare payments at a 2.3 times higher rate, had a 8.9% lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a 15.7% lower enrollment into college from high school than that of Hokkaido as a whole. The Japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the Ainu's standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap. The Japanese government will provide ¥7 million beginning in 2015, to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter.|$|E
