25|$|A {{variety of}} issues degrade the quality of HPIV results. The first class of issues {{involves}} the reconstruction itself. In holography, the object wave of a particle is typically assumed to be spherical; however, due to Mie scattering theory, this wave is a complex shape which can distort the reconstructed particle. Another issue {{is the presence of}} substantial <b>speckle</b> <b>noise</b> which lowers the overall signal-to-noise ratio of particle images. This effect is of greater concern for in-line holographic systems because the reference beam is propagated through the volume along with the scattered object beam. Noise can also be introduced through impurities in the scattering medium, such as temperature variations and window blemishes. Because holography requires coherent imaging, these effects are much more severe than traditional imaging conditions. The combination of these factors increases the complexity of the correlation process. In particular, the <b>speckle</b> <b>noise</b> in an HPIV recording often prevents traditional image-based correlation methods from being used. Instead, single particle identification and correlation are implemented, which set limits on particle number density. A more comprehensive outline of these error sources is given in Meng et al.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of CSLDV is the additional laser <b>speckle</b> <b>noise</b> that occurs if the laser spot scans the structure too quickly. <b>Speckle</b> <b>noise</b> {{is caused by}} micro-scale irregularities in the surface that change the intensity pattern of the laser light received by the LDV as it scans the surface. Similar problems arise when applying LDV to rotating shafts, crankshafts for example. <b>Speckle</b> <b>noise</b> is difficult to predict, depending on {{the properties of the}} surface, the geometry of the structure and position of the LDV, so {{further research is needed to}} establish the limits of CSLDV.|$|E

These <b>speckle</b> <b>noises</b> significantly reduce {{the clarity of the}} image and as a result, cause great difficulties in ultrasound diagnosis. To solve this problem, this paper presents a new de-noising method for medical ultrasonic image based on ROF model and adaptive wavelet threshold de-noising method. In addition to inhibiting the <b>speckle</b> <b>noises</b> in the medical ultrasonic image, this method can retain and even enhance the image detail information as much as possible. Literature Identification Code: A CLC: TP 391. 41 Medical ultrasonic imaging is widely used in medical diagnosis because it is economical, simultaneous, zero-traumatic and convenient.

Meanwhile, it can cut down the cost of the setup since LED is cheaper than laser. In this paper, an in-line digital holography setup was designed with LED, and the holograms were reconstructed by four-step phase shifting method. Comparing with the phase image obtained by the laser-based setup, results show that the phase image of USAF test target possesses lower <b>speckle</b> <b>noises</b> with the help of LED. Finally, we reconstruct a series of intensity images with different depths of a coin, and these images are fused to get a synthesized image with more information...|$|R

Subsequently, the firing matrix of the denoised spectrogram, specifying what time a neuron first fires, is calculated {{by using the}} threshold decaying PCNN through iterations, and then the target neuron is detected as a <b>speckle</b> or <b>noise</b> if it fires but more than 50 % of the neurons in the linking window do not fire [13], indicating that {{the intensity of the}} target neuron is sharply variant compared to other neurons in the linking window. Finally, spectrograms are improved by iteratively suppressing the <b>speckles</b> or <b>noise</b> through a median filter [13], while the signal neurons are kept unmodified. Experiment results show that the proposed method can effectively conserve fine detail information, such as edges while removing <b>speckles</b> and <b>noise.</b> Furthermore, the iteration continues until the firing matrix of the threshold decaying PCNN is unchanged any further. Therefore, the iteration time can be adaptively determined.|$|R

For example, while DLP typically has slightly lower resolution than their LCoS counterparts due to the tiny mirrors used in DLP technology, 3-LED DLP projectors are generally regarded as having a higher contrast, better efficiency and lower power consumption as opposed color-sequential LCoS units and better color quality than white LED LCoS units.
