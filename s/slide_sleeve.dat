40|$|AbstractMulti-stage SRV {{fracturing}} in horizontal wells is a {{new technology}} developed {{at home and abroad}} in recent years to effectively develop shale gas or low-permeability reservoirs, {{but on the other hand}} makes the mechanical environment of fracturing strings more complicated at the same time. In view of this, based on the loading features of tubing strings during the multi-stage fracturing of a horizontal well, mechanical models were established for three working cases of multiple packer setting, open differential-pressure <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and open ball-injection <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve</b> under a hold-down packer. Moreover, mathematical models were respectively built for the above three cases. According to the Lame formula and Von Mises stress calculation formula for the thick-walled cylinder in the theory of elastic mechanics, a mathematical model was also established to calculate the equivalent stress for tubing string safety evaluation when the fracturing string was under the combined action of inner pressure, external squeezing force and axial stress, and another mathematical model was built for the mechanical strength and safety evaluation of multi-stage fracturing strings. In addition, a practical software was developed for the mechanical safety evaluation of horizontal well multi-stage fracturing strings according to the mathematical model developed for the mechanical calculation of the multi-packer string in horizontal wells. The research results were applied and verified in a gas well of Tahe Oilfield in the Tarim Basin with excellent effects, providing a theoretical basis and a simple and reliable technical means for optimal design and safety evaluation of safe operational parameters of multi-stage fracturing strings in horizontal wells...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of consumption and emissions {{is a key}} fac- tor in modern vehicle design. The overall vehicle efficiency is pursued in several ways, including the {{reduction of}} consumption of the auxiliary devices (e. g. water pumps, oil pumps, vacuum pumps etc.). In this paper, using two different smart materials (i. e. magnetorheological fluids and shape memory alloys) a de- vice aimed at disengaging the vacuum pump was developed. The conceived device is composed of a magnetorheological (MR) clutch excited by permanent magnets coaxially manufac- tured with a <b>sliding</b> spline <b>sleeve</b> moved by shape memory alloys (SMA) springs. In the MR clutch, the magnet can move under {{the effect of a}} passive pneumatic system. The magnetic field in the fluid varies with the magnets displacement and as a result two steady positions are possible: the engaged clutch (ON) and the disengaged clutch (OFF). The torque in the ON configuration is high enough to drive the vacuum pump during normal operating conditions, whereas the low torque value in the OFF condition guarantees power saving up to 150 W. In particular operating conditions (i. e. at low environmen- tal temperatures) the torque necessary to start the vacuum pump may exceed the maximum transmissible torque of the MR clutch. For this reason a <b>sliding</b> spline <b>sleeve,</b> actuated by two SMA springs which counteract the force of two traditional springs was developed. A dummy plain <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve</b> with SMA and con- ventional springs was numerically developed and tested. The fairly good agreement of the results confirmed the feasibility of the combined SMA/MR device...|$|R

30|$|At this point, it is {{important}} to distinguish “autonomous” FCDs from “active” FCDs; autonomous FCDs exhibit the control over unwanted fluids passively and without operator intervention relying on properties intrinsic to the fluid or fluid regime to trigger changing behavior. By contrast, active FCDs (such as intelligent control valves and FCDs with <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeves.),</b> require oversight by operators and direct intervention in order for there to be a change in performance behavior. Three commercial FCD geometries exhibit autonomous behavior: fluidic diodes, rate-controlled production valves, and hybrid FCDs. However, the manner by which each provides autonomy varies wildly from manufacturer to manufacturer and introduce new operational advantages and risks depending on the mechanism of action.|$|R
50|$|It {{is usually}} run {{in close to}} the bottom end of the {{production}} tubing and set at a point above the top perforations or sand screens. In wells with multiple reservoir zones, packers are used to isolate the perforations for each zone. In these situations, a <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{would be used to}} select which zone to produce. Packers may also be used to protect the casing from pressure and produced fluids, isolate sections of corroded casing, casing leaks or squeezed perforations, and isolate or temporarily abandon producing zones. In water-flooding developments in which water is injected into the reservoir, packers are used in injection wells to isolate the zones into which the water must be injected.|$|R
50|$|The {{point of}} {{communication}} was traditionally a device called a <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve,</b> or <b>sliding</b> side door, {{which is a}} hydraulically operated device, built into the production tubing. During normal operation, it would remain closed sealing off the tubing and the annulus, but for events such as this, it would be opened to allow {{the free flow of}} fluids between the two regions. These components have fallen out of favour as they were prone to leaking. Instead, it is now more common to punch a hole in the tubing for circulation kills. Although this permanently damages the tubing, given that most planned well kills are for workovers, this is not an issue, since the tubing is being pulled for replacement anyway.|$|R

50|$|In 2014 {{a concept}} of hybrid scale has been introduced, the elastically {{deformable}} arm scale, which is a combination between a spring scale and a beam balance, exploiting simultaneously both principles of equilibrium and deformation. In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical beam balance (for example a steelyard) are replaced with a flexible elastic rod in an inclined frictionless <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The rod can reach a unique free of sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because configurational forces develop at the two edges of the sleeve {{as a consequence of}} both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear kinematics of the elastic rod. This weight measuring device can also work without a counterweight.|$|R
5000|$|Setting {{tools are}} used to set {{downhole}} completion elements such as production packers or bridge plugs. Setting tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow burning explosive charge to drive a hydraulic piston assembly. The assembly {{is attached to the}} plug or packer by means of a setting mandrel and a <b>sliding</b> <b>sleeve,</b> which when [...] "stroked" [...] by the piston assembly, effectively squeezes the elastomer elements of the packing element, deforming it sufficiently to wedge it into place in the tubing or casing string. Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.|$|R

Bifurcation and stability analysis of this simple elastic system shows a variety of unexpected behaviours: (i.) an increase of buckling load at decreasing of elastic stiffness; (ii.) {{a finite number of}} buckling loads for a system with infinite degrees of freedom (leading to a non-standard Sturm-Liouville problem); (iii.) more than one bifurcation loads associated to each bifurcation mode; (iv.) a restabilization of the straight configuration after the second bifurcation load associated to the first instability mode; (v.) the presence of an Eshelby-like (or configurational) force, deeply influencing stability. Only the first of these behaviours was previously known, the second and third ones disprove common beliefs, the fourth highlights a sort of ‘island of instability’, and the last one shows surprising phenomena and effects on stability...|$|R
