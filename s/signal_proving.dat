40|$|Abstract Dynamic mode {{decomposition}} (DMD) is a pow-erful {{and increasingly}} popular tool for performing spectral analysis of fluid flows. However, it requires data that satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion. In many fluid flow experiments, such data {{are impossible to}} capture. We pro-pose a new approach that combines ideas from DMD and compressed sensing. Given a vector-valued signal, we take measurements randomly in time (at a sub-Nyquist rate) and project the data onto a low-dimensional subspace. We then use compressed sensing to identify the dominant frequencies in the signal and their corresponding modes. We demon-strate this method using two examples, analyzing both an artificially constructed test dataset and particle image ve-locimetry data collected from the flow past a cylinder. In each case, our method correctly identifies the characteris-tic frequencies and oscillatory modes dominating the <b>signal,</b> <b>proving</b> the proposed method to be a capable tool for spec-tral analysis using sub-Nyquist-rate sampling...|$|E

40|$|A major UK initiative, {{entitled}} ‘Mapping the Underworld’ aims {{to develop}} and prove the efficacy of a multi-sensor device for accurate remote buried utility service detection, location and, where possible, identification. One of the technologies to be incorporated in the device is low-frequency vibro-acoustics; the application of this technology for detecting buried infrastructure, in particular pipes, is currently being investigated. Here, a shear wave ground vibration technique for detecting buried pipes is described. For this technique, shear waves are generated at the ground surface, and the resulting ground surface vibrations measured. Time-extended signals are employed to generate the illuminating wave. Generalized cross-correlation functions between the measured ground velocities and a reference measurement adjacent to the excitation are calculated and summed using a stacking method to generate a cross-sectional image of the ground. To mitigate the effects of other potential sources of vibration in the vicinity, the excitation signal {{can be used as}} an additional reference when calculating the cross-correlation functions. Measurements have been made at two live test sites to detect a range of buried pipes.
