5000|$|An open-faced, or LÃ©pine, watch, is one {{in which}} the case lacks a metal cover to protect the crystal. It is typical for an open-faced watch to have the pendant located at 12:00 and the sub-second dial located at 6:00. Occasionally, a watch {{movement}} intended for a hunting case (with the winding stem at 3:00 and <b>sub</b> second <b>dial</b> at 6:00) will have an open-faced case. Such watch is known as a [...] "sidewinder." [...] Alternatively, such a watch movement may be fitted with a so-called conversion dial, which relocates the winding stem to 12:00 and the sub-second dial to 3:00. After 1908, watches approved for railroad service were required to be cased in open-faced cases with the winding stem at 12:00.|$|R
