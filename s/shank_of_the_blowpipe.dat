50|$|Blowpipes are straight, tube-like tools {{primarily}} used {{to direct}} oxygen to boost a wooden fire. Blowpipes {{have been in}} use for hundreds of years, but were first documented by John Griffin in his 1827 book A Practical Treatise on <b>the</b> Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blowpipe.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe</b> {{is first}} preheated; then dipped in the molten {{glass in the}} furnace. The molten glass is [...] "gathered" [...] onto <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe</b> in much <b>the</b> same way that viscous honey is picked up on a honey dipper. This glass is then rolled on the marver, which was {{traditionally}} a flat slab of marble, but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of steel. This process, called marvering, forms a cool skin on <b>the</b> exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass {{is attached to a}} stainless steel or iron rod called a punty [...] for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe</b> to provide an opening and/or to finalize the top.|$|R
25|$|Mold-blowing was an {{alternative}} glassblowing method that came after <b>the</b> invention <b>of</b> free-blowing, during <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st century AD. A glob of molten glass {{is placed on}} <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe,</b> and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mold. In that way, the shape and <b>the</b> texture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bubble <b>of</b> glass {{is determined by the}} design on <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mold rather than <b>the</b> skill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glassworker.|$|R

50|$|A key {{development}} {{of his time}} at the Surrey Institute was use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxy-hydrogen <b>blowpipe,</b> normally credited to Robert Hare in which an intensely hot flame was created by burning a jet of oxygen and hydrogen together; <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe</b> was <b>the</b> underpinning <b>of</b> limelight; Gurney its first exponent.|$|R
50|$|If {{a stream}} or jet of air is {{directed}} through a flame, fuel air mixing is enhanced and the jet exiting the flame is intensely hot. Jewelers and glassblowers engaged in lampwork have used <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe</b> since ancient times, with the blast being {{powered by the}} user's lungs. For small work, mouth-blown blowpipes may be used with candle flames or alcohol lamps. Starting in <b>the</b> 1800s, <b>blowpipes</b> have been powered by mechanisms, initially bladders and bellows, but now blowers, compressors and compressed gas cylinders are commonplace. While blowing air is effective, blowing oxygen produces higher temperatures, {{and it is also}} practical to invert <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gasses and blow fuel through air. Contemporary blowtorches and oxy-fuel welding and cutting torches can be considered to be modern developments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{outstanding}} example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free-blowing {{technique is}} the Portland Vase, {{which is a}} cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment {{was carried out by}} Gudenrath and Whitehouse with <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> re-creating <b>the</b> Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vase was gathered on <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe</b> and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{mathematical}} model for human gait has been constructed as a double compound pendulum representing the thigh and <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leg. A Lagrangian formulation establishes the motion which {{is governed by}} a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations in the two angular variables. Using the Quasilinear technique, a method for determining the joint torques from observed data is presented...|$|R
2500|$|This method held a {{pre-eminent}} {{position in}} glassforming ever since its introduction in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st century BC {{until the late}} 19th century, and is still widely used nowadays as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> free-blowing involves <b>the</b> blowing <b>of</b> short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a '"gather" [...] which has been spooled at one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blowpipe.</b> This has <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> forming an elastic skin on <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> heat from <b>the</b> furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.|$|R
50|$|Hershel <b>Shanks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Biblical Archaeology Society {{decided that}} <b>the</b> reconstructions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead Sea Scrolls {{should be made}} {{available}} to scholars, so in 1992 he published the two-volume A Facsimile Edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead Sea Scrolls which included, without permission, material on the Halakhic Letter (4QMMT) that Qimron had been working on for some eleven years. Qimron had even given the document its title.|$|R
25|$|Two {{styles of}} auger bit are {{commonly}} used in hand braces: the Jennings or Jennings-pattern bit has a self-feeding screw tip, two spurs and two radial cutting edges. This bit has a double flute starting from the cutting edges, and extending several inches up <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bit, for waste removal. This pattern of bit was developed by Russell Jennings in the mid-19th century.|$|R
40|$|A few rivets of {{specification}} NAS 1919 M 05 S 08 in the {{as supplied}} condition were analyzed to identify <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> defect(s) {{present on the}} surface. Examination revealed large number <b>of</b> pits on <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rivets. Semiquantitative analysis showed that these pits contain deleterious corrodants such as chlorine in large quantity. In view of this, {{it is recommended that}} this batch of rivets may be rejected...|$|R
40|$|Vibration <b>of</b> Tool <b>Shank</b> <b>of</b> {{a cutting}} tool has large {{influence}} on tolerances and surface finish of products. Frequency and amplitude of vibrations depend on <b>the</b> overhang <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting tool. In turning operations, when the tool overhang is about 2 times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tool height, <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibration is almost zero and dimensional tolerances and surface finish <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product becomes high. In this paper, the above statement is verified firstly by using a finite element analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting tool with ANSYS software package and secondly, with experimental verification with a piezoelectric sensor...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the bearing}} joint, the bolt itself limits lateral {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elements by <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bolt bearing upon <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{holes in the}} clamped elements. [...] Such joints require less clamping force, because a high level <b>of</b> friction between <b>the</b> clamped surfaces is not required. The clearance between the bolt and the holes means that some lateral movement may occur before the bolt bears against <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holes.|$|R
50|$|Gas {{checks are}} most {{commonly}} found in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a thin cup or disc made of a ductile metal. Copper, Zinc, Aluminum, and alloys such as brass have been used. A bullet designed to accept a gas check has a rebated base shank which permits attachment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> check without altering <b>the</b> maximum diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bullet. The shallow cup-shaped check is mechanically attached to <b>the</b> reduced <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bullet by swaging.|$|R
40|$|A {{drill bit}} loader is {{described}} for loading a tapered <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> a drill bit into a similarly tapered recess in <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a drill spindle. The spindle has a transverse slot at <b>the</b> inner end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recess. <b>The</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tapered <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drill bit has a transverse tang adapted {{to engage in}} the slot so that the drill bit will be rotated by the spindle. The loader is in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a cylinder adapted to receive the drill bit with <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> projecting out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder. Retainer pins prevent rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drill bit in the cylinder. The spindle is lowered to extend <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drill bit into the recess in the spindle and the spindle is rotated to align the slot in the spindle with the tang on the shank. A spring unit in the cylinder is compressed by the drill bit during its entry into <b>the</b> recess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spindle and resiliently drives the tang into the slot in the spindle when the tang and slot are aligned. In typical remote drilling operations, whether in hot cells or water pits, drill bits have been held using a collet or end mill type holder with set screws. In either case, to load or change a drill bit required the use master-slave manipulators to position the bits and tighten the collet or set screws. This requirement eliminated many otherwise useful work areas because they were not equipped with slaves, particularly in water pits...|$|R
40|$|A failed bolt from Air Turbine Starter (ATS) was {{forwarded}} to the laboratory for analysis to ascertain <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> failure. Analysis {{showed that the}} ATS bolt had fractured at the shank region by stress corrosion cracking. Semiquantitative chemical analysis carried out on the bolt surface indicated presence of substantial quantity of sodium and chlorine. <b>The</b> source <b>of</b> these corrosive elements could {{be traced to the}} etchant that was used to engrave the identification number on <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bolts...|$|R
2500|$|Even when {{designed}} as a bearing joint, the surface friction between the clamped elements may be sufficient to resist movement for some time, especially when the building may not yet be fully loaded - thus it operates initially as a friction joint. [...] When the lateral force becomes sufficient to overcome this friction, the clamped elements move until <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holes bear against <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bolt. [...] This movement - [...] "slip into bearing" [...] - usually starts and stops very suddenly, often releasing elastic energy in the associated elements, resulting in a loud - but harmless - bang.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{establish}} a method of estimating, in real time, the machining error caused by vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting point <b>of</b> an end mill. The vibration displacement at <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end mill and the dynamic cutting force were measured during cutting tests while spindle speed was increased from medium to high. It was found that the vibration displacement at the cutting point at the moment when <b>the</b> radial direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting edge is normal to the feed direction showed a good agreement with <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machined surface at a spindle speed of 4500 rpm or less...|$|R

40|$|Western bean cutworm (WBC) is a corn pest {{that has}} {{expanded}} its range across Iowa and toward East Coast states. Before corn tassels, newly emerged WBC larvae move to the whorl and feed on the flag leaf. Once tasseling begins, they move to the green silks.

40|$|Ankle-foot orthoses are {{prescribed}} {{for a variety}} of reasons, but chief among them is <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> un desirable positions <b>of</b> deformities, <b>the</b> most common being equino-varus. Gravity alone will cause the ankle-foot complex to adopt the equino varus position, but spasticity or contracture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triceps surae can only complicate the situation. A conventional metal ankle-foot orthosis, with either a single or double uprights, can be effective in combating this deforming position, but success de pends on proper construction and application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthosis.

40|$|We {{present the}} shear joint using {{half-moon}} shaped bearing bolt {{as an effective}} fastener between high-strength steel members. Experimental {{studies were carried out}} to clarify the maximum strength and <b>the</b> elastic stiffness <b>of</b> beam flange joint. Also, materially and geometrically non-linear finite element analyses were carried out to show <b>the</b> mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joint with half-moon shaped bearing bolts. This paper shows the concept and capabilities of presented bolts. Obtained result was summarized as follows. <b>The</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> half-moon-shaped bolt has enough ultimate strength. Slip back phenomena, in which the diagonal cut face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> slips out <b>of</b> its normal position, doesn’t occur during elastic cyclic loading. The half moon bolts always penetrate the connected steel plate so as to fill up a hole. Hence, the present beam joint maintains constant stiffness during elastic cyclic loading...|$|R
50|$|Bristle blasting, is a {{mechanical}} abrasion cleaning {{process that is}} performed on metallic surfaces by a brush-like rotary power tool. <b>The</b> tool consists <b>of</b> sharpened, high-carbon steel wire bristle tips that are designed with a forward-angle bend, i.e., <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wire is bent in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> tool rotation. During operation, the rotating bristle tips are brought into {{direct contact with the}} metallic surface, whereby the bristle tips strike the surface with kinetic energy that is equivalent to processes that use grit blast media. This repeated contact of sharp bristle tips with the target surface results in localized impact, rebound, and <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> craters, thereby simultaneously cleaning and coarsening the surface, while exposing a contamination-free base metal.|$|R
40|$|A failure {{analysis}} was performed to establish <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> a 2014 -T 6 aluminum compressor rotor blade failure in a large NASA-Ames wind tunnel. Metallurgical {{failure analysis}} by light photography, fractographic SEM examinations, and fatigue experiments showed that a 0. 13 -mm-deep scratch in <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blade had acted as an initiation site for a fatigue crack, which subsequently grew by Stage II fatigue before occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final fracture by unstable crack growth. Studies of modal deformation plots and blade FEM analysis indicated that Mode- 3 was the most likely mode responsible for the resonance condition which produced the vibration loading that effected crack growth.

40|$|Preliminary {{estimates}} are presented of vibratory loads and stresses in hingeless and teetering rotors {{for the proposed}} NSF-NASA Mod- 0 wind power system. Preliminary blade design utilizes a tapered tubular aluminum spar which supports nonstructural aluminum ribs and skin and is joined to the rotor hub by a steel shank tube. Stresses in <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blade are calculated for static, rated, and overload operating conditions. Blade vibrations were limited to the fundamental flapping modes, which were elastic cantilever bending for hingeless rotor blades and rigid-body rotation for teetering rotor blades. The MOSTAB-C computer code was used to calculate aerodynamic and mechanical loads. The teetering rotor has substantial advantages over the hingeless rotor with respect to shank stresses, fatigue life, and tower loading. The hingeless rotor analyzed {{does not appear to}} be structurally stable during overloads...|$|R
