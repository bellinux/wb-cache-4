40|$|Several axi-symmetric {{surfaces}} or revolution {{are introduced}} as possible cowlings to {{be attached to}} an existing <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy</b> to create a streamlined buoy shape that minimizes the drag force and reduces vortex shedding whilst the buoy remains stable and self-aligning in tidal flows. Analysis of the proposed shapes is carried out by CFD software and a proposed shape is found that reduces the drag force to 25 % of that of the original <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy.</b> As well, analysis of data from an axi-symmetric airship Akron is performed to investigate lift, drag, pitching moment, pressure distributions and centers of effort of surfaces of revolution as functions of angle of attack.

40|$|The {{horizontal}} and vertical motions of a <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy,</b> ex-cited by synthetic ocean waves within a wave flume, is numeri-cally and experimentally investigated. First, fluid motion in the wave tank is described using Airy’s theory, and the forces on the buoy are determined using a modified form of Morison’s equa-tion. The system is then studied statically {{in order to determine}} the effects of varying system parameters. Numerical simulations then use the governing equations to compare predicted motions with experimentally observed behavior...|$|E
50|$|The marked {{course is}} {{typically}} straight, and 2000 meters in length. The buoy system usually consists of six adjacent 13.5 meter-wide lanes, outlined by 7 lines of small, <b>spherical</b> <b>buoys</b> placed 10 or 15 meters apart. The buoys are red {{for the first}} and last 100 meters, the rest being white. The six lanes are used for racing, and there may also be a separate lane for boats moving {{from the end of the}} course to the start line (the up channel). Some courses have as many as eight racing lanes. Distances along the course are often marked at intervals, usually every 250 metres, with prominent numbered signs on the shoreline.|$|R
5000|$|SVP project drifter {{deployments}} {{began in}} 1979; the design continued to develop until reaching {{its current form}} in 1992. Each drifter consists of a <b>spherical</b> surface <b>buoy</b> tethered to a weighted nylon drogue that allows it to track the horizontal motion of water {{at a depth of}} 15 meters. If the drogue breaks off, the wind pushes the surface buoy through the water, creating erroneous current observations. [...] A tether strain gauge has been added to monitor tension of the buoy-drogue connection to resolve this issue. The original drifters are heavy, bulky (40 cm diameter), and expensive relative to the newer [...] "mini" [...] drifters that are smaller, (30.5 cm diameter) cheaper, and lighter because the hull contains fewer batteries. [...] The surface float contains alkaline batteries, a satellite transmitter, a thermistor for sub-skin sea surface temperature, and sometimes other instruments that measure pressure, wind speed and direction, or salinity.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{modeling}} and simulation of a hinged 5 body wave energy converter (WEC), including verification by comparison with experimental results. The WEC consists of a shallow draft cylindrical center floater hinged to 4 semisubmerged <b>spherical</b> <b>buoys.</b> One important design feature is that the hinges are submerged such that the buoys will move in a diagonal-like mode of motion. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the linear theory of power absorption by oscillating bodies is reviewed, having particular emphasis on multi-degree-offreedom systems and optimization of power take-off parameters bounded by motion amplitude constraints (and a few other constraints). The major part of the thesis deals with time domain analysis and address some modeling challenges associated with the hinged 5 -body WEC and similar WECs. These modeling challenges are associated with: • Strongly frequency dependent added mass and damping and a long hydrodynamic “memory”, representing a challenge when a time domain representation of the radiation forces are sought in the form of a state space model. • Complex equations of motion accounting for rigid hinge constraints. • Large angular motion, particularly in the hinges, giving rise to inertia force nonlinearities. • Large amplitude motion giving rise to greatly varying wetted body surface, making the validity of linear hydrodynamic theory questionable. The first challenge is addressed by introducing a new frequency domain identification technique, originally developed for complex electrical networks, which (to the author’s knowledge) have not been used on hydrodynamic radiation forces before. Assessment and enforcement of the physical property of passivity of the obtained state space models (related to the stability of the equations of motion) will also be addressed. We show that the method is capable of obtaining passive and accurate state space radiation models for the hinged 5 - body WEC and an even more challenging system consisting of 17 equidistant circular cylinders. Equations of motion (EOM) for the hinged 5 -body WEC are developed assuming rigid hinge constraints and by using a minimal number of generalized coordinates. Large angular motions are accounted for. We show that by describing the velocities of all bodies in the body fixed frame of the center floater, the EOM simplify significantly. The large angular motion yields inertia force nonlinearities manifested as a hinge angle dependent mass matrix and a Coriolis-Centrifugal force term. However, a numerical study of the hinged 5 -body WEC in a typical operating condition shows that a linearized EOM, assuming small angles, will suffice when the aim is to predict the mean power absorption. Still, the inertia force nonlinearities yields nonlinear behavior and affects the largest maxima and minima significantly, especially in the pitch mode of the center floater. The most important type of nonlinearity is associated with the greatly varying submergence of the bodies, especially for the buoys. In the numerical model, this nonlinearity is accounted for in a simplified manner by including nonlinear Froude-Krylov and restoring forces, while still relying on linear radiation and diffraction forces. The aim of the experiments conducted as part of the thesis work was to verify the numerical model. In addition, different numerical models based on different physical assumptions have been compared. The experiments included five sea states corresponding to typical operating conditions. The overprediction of mean absorbed power by the simulation model in these sea states is between - 15 % (underprediction) and 18 %. When the Froude-Krylov and restoring forces are linearized in the traditional manner, the overprediction range from 60 %, in a sea state producing large amplitude motion, down to 15 %, occurring for a milder sea state. The experiments revealed that mean and low frequency motions of the same order of magnitude as the wave frequency motions are present in all modes of motion except for the collective heave mode. The nonlinear simulation model captures this effect with reasonable accuracy. One interesting finding is that the mean and low frequency surge motion is well captured without inclusion of the explicit second order wave forces traditionally used to analyze slow drift motions.

40|$|AUV在长时间作业过程中需要浮出水面进行GPS定位，既浪费时间又浪费能源，因此仿照潜艇上的拖曳天线的形式，在AUV上采用了形状简单的GPS天线球，这种天线球的拖曳运动特性是本文的主要研究内容。本文分析了这种天线球在静水环境下的拖曳运动情况，建立了拖曳系统的数学模型。其中对于缆绳采用了Ablow提出的有限差分模型，对于自由表面上的天线球，采用水动力系数法进行分析，对耦合的系统采用前向差分法进行求解。在此基础上编制程序进行仿真。为了验证仿真结果，在拖曳水池进行了拖曳试验。在试验中通过改变拖曳速度和缆绳长度，得到了一系列的张力数据和天线球姿态。对试验数据和计算结果的比较表明，上面的数学模型在速度小于 2 节时能够模拟真实情况，反之则会出现较大的误差。经过查找，本文排除了试验误差和计算参数选取不当这两个可能的原因，最终认定是天线球的模型不够完善，因为它在自由表面上受到了兴波阻力的作用。本文也对有限差分程序的结果和叶果洛夫给出的缆绳数据进行了比较，比较表明基于本文编写的缆绳分析程序是可靠的。在此基础上，本文把拖曳试验测量到的张力作为边界条件对实际工程进行了分析计算，指出目前缆绳长度 14 米的情况不能满足期望的 10 米拖曳深度；若要拖曳深度达到 10 米，需要加大天线球的浮力并增加缆绳长度，本文也给出了这种情况下的几组参数的具体值。In long time’s {{navigation}} AUV need get {{its position}} {{and going out}} of water to receive a GPS signal is a good ideal, but this process need more time and more power. To solve this problem, our AUV uses a spherical towed buoy with GPS antenna in it, {{and this kind of}} towing style is usually used in submarine. This paper mainly analyzes the motion of the towed <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy.</b> The motion of the <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy</b> towed by AUV is supposed in still water, and this paper builds a mathematical model to describe the towed system which uses Ablow’s finite difference method to calculate cable, and supposes that there is a drag coefficient on <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy</b> when it is towed at the free surface. Then a numerical program is written to solve the equations in the model. A towed experiment is done to verify mathematical model by changing cable length and towing speed with a fixed depth of 3. 5 m, and a series of tension data are measured and buoy pictures are recorded. Comparison with simulation results shows that the model is right when towing speed is lower than 2 knots, but a big error in other cases. This paper then analyzes from experimental errors, cable calculation parameters, and boundary condition, finally believes that wave resistance force at the free surface causes the big error. This paper also compares the result of the cable calculation program with Yegorov‘s cable data. The comparison shows that the program is reliable. Using the data measured in the experiment as boundary condition, we recalculate the cable in our engineer where the cable length is 14 m, and expected depth is 10 m. The results show that the buoy buoyancy and cable length is not enough for 10 m’s towing depth and the paper gives a group of values to correct these parameters...|$|E
30|$|From {{the finite}} element {{analysis}} results and for the sizing WEC components and load level applied {{it can be concluded}} that: (1) for the advanced position of the hydraulic cylinder piston rod two critical sections are observed—piston rod and supporting cables, while for the retracted position the highest concentrations are in the supporting cables; (2) the <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy</b> with radius of 100  mm leads to the lowest values of stresses and displacements when compared with the tulip geometry; (3) cylindrical geometry leads to a chaotic scenario due to an extremely high level of stresses and displacements; (4) the partially submerged condition corresponds to the critical buoy position since highest maximum stresses and displacements are reached and (5) the increase in the buoy dimensions leads to plastic deformation of WEC components for the material properties, sizing and load level used in this study.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} analysis of several buoy geometries that may be applied to a near-shore floating point-absorber wave energy converter. After the characterisation of the device, a numerical model and a simulator in the time domain were developed and the structural performance of the wave energy converter evaluated for three different buoy geometries. The influence of the buoy dimensions, different submerged conditions and position of hydraulic cylinder piston rod, on the structural performance of the wave energy converter is also analysed. The numerical study was conducted using a commercial finite element code. This software needs, among other parameters, {{the magnitude of the}} forces acting upon each buoy. A dynamic model was, therefore, developed assuming that the buoy heave motion is excited by the sea waves. The finite element analysis revealed that a load with a higher magnitude than those computed from the simulator was required. It was shown that, even considering the partially submerged condition, the <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy</b> geometry leads to best structural behaviour.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{dynamics}} of a floating body with characteristics comparable to a point absorber wave energy converter with different mooring systems, in geometrical configuration or in the materials. To this purpose, the dynamics of a moored buoy is investigated. The point absorber is modeled as a <b>spherical</b> <b>buoy</b> in plane two-dimensional motion, and it is studied under the action of irregular unidirectional wind-generated waves, moored to the seabed by means of one, two or three mooring lines. Two different sets of moorings are considered, and typical wires and chains used in offshore technology are considered, leading to a total of 6 case studies. A quasi-static approach is used for modeling the restoring forces needed to keep buoy into station, using an innovative iterative procedure able to predict for each time instant and for each cable the lay down length of the cable, being each mooring line allowed to be taut or slack. Approaches in the time and frequency domains are used to obtain the system responses in intermediate waters, where these facilities are usually installed. Results for all case studies are compared both in terms of statistics of response and tensions on the top of the cable...|$|E
