40|$|International audienceWe {{measure the}} laser-induced damage {{threshold}} (LIDT) fluence under <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> at the <b>surface</b> of Sapphire samples prepared following {{the standards of}} two methods yielding to different surface finish and used in optical and laser industry. We use AFM microscopy to measure the roughness parameter Ra and power spectral density (PSD) of the sample surface. We show {{that the quality of}} surface topography resulting from surface preparation affects the damage threshold of Sapphire crystals exposed to femtosecond, picosecond, and nanosecond laser conditions at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. We observe a higher resistance to laser damage or macroscopic modification when the surface finish presents a smooth and regular topography. We indeed measure a 1. 4 to 2 times increase of the LIDT fluence in femtosecond and picosecond regimes and up to 5 times with nanosecond pulses. Using simple damage model and PSD data, we correlate the LIDT reduction of Sapphire samples of lower quality of surface finish with the high-frequency tail component of their PSD distribution corresponding to striations of the width of a fraction of the laser wavelength. This study emphasizes the importance of detailed assessment of surface topography for laser damage evaluation and understanding and for indicating directions of improvement...|$|R

40|$|In <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> echo train imaging all {{the data}} {{required}} for a two dimensional image is acquired {{from a series of}} echoes generated following a single RF excitation pulse. Spatial resolution is limited because all samples must be acquired before the signal decays. In this paper we show theoretically that more echoes and hence better spatial resolution can be obtained with <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> GRASE imaging than with either echo planar imaging or <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> RARE imaging. This conclusion holds for both conventional imaging hardware and specialized gradient hardware designed for EPI.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of surface laser damage performed on a nonlinear optical crystal, urea L-malic acid, using 7  ns laser pulses at 10  Hz repetition rate from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at wavelengths of 532 and 1064  nm is reported. The <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> and multiple <b>shot</b> <b>surface</b> laser damage threshold values are determined to be 26. 64 ± 0. 19 and 20. 60 ± 0. 36  GW[*]cm− 2 at 1064  nm and 18. 44 ± 0. 31 and 7. 52 ± 0. 22  GW[*]cm− 2 at 532  nm laser radiation, respectively. The laser damage anisotropy {{is consistent with the}} Vickers mechanical hardness measurement performed along three crystallographic directions. The Knoop polar plot also reflects the damage morphology. Our investigation reveals a direct correlation between the laser damage profile and hardness anisotropy. Thermal breakdown of the crystal is identified as the possible mechanism of laser induced surface damage...|$|R

40|$|Spectral and {{temporal}} {{characteristics of a}} subpicosecond KrF excimer laser are determined {{with the use of}} a one meter spectrometer, a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> intensity autocorrelator, and a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> phase sensitive autocorrelator. Spectral analysis is shown to be a simple and sensitive method for aligning the laser system. Experimental results and model calculations show that the center of the laser spectrum is influenced by self phase modulation. Near the edge of the amplifier gain bandwidth, the spectrum is also influenced by the vibrational levels of the KrF upper state. To support the spectral analysis, temporal measurements are performed with <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> autocorrelators. Using a <b>single</b> <b>shot</b> autocorrelator based on three photon fluorescence of XeF, the pulse width was measure at 477 fs.
