40|$|AbstractGlobally, {{there is}} growing demand for {{increased}} agricultural outputs. At the same time, the agricultural industry is expected to meet increasingly stringent environmental targets. Thus, there is an urgent pressure on the soil resource to deliver multiple functions simultaneously. The Functional Land Management framework (Schulte et al., 2014) is a conceptual tool designed to support policy making to manage <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> to meet these multiple demands. This paper provides a first example of a practical application of the Functional Land Management concept relevant to policy stakeholders. In this study we examine the trade-offs, between the <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> ‘primary productivity’ and ‘carbon cycling and storage’, {{in response to the}} intervention of land drainage systems applied to ‘imperfectly’ and ‘poorly’ draining managed grasslands in Ireland. These trade-offs are explored {{as a function of the}} nominal price of ‘Certified Emission Reductions’ or ‘carbon credits’. Also, these trade-offs are characterised spatially using ArcGIS to account for spatial variability in the supply of <b>soil</b> <b>functions.</b> To manage <b>soil</b> <b>functions,</b> it is essential to understand how individual <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> are prioritised by those that are responsible for the supply of <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> – generally farmers and foresters, and those who frame demand for <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> – policy makers. Here, in relation to these two <b>soil</b> <b>functions,</b> a gap exists in relation to this prioritisation between these two stakeholder groups. Currently, the prioritisation and incentivisation of these competing <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> is primarily a function of CO 2 price. At current CO 2 prices, the agronomic benefits outweigh the monetised environmental costs. The value of CO 2 loss would only exceed productivity gains at either higher CO 2 prices or at a reduced discount period rate. Finally, this study shows large geographic variation in the environmental cost: agronomic benefit ratio. Therein, the Functional Land Management framework can support the development of policies that are more tailored to contrasting biophysical environments and are therefore more effective than ‘blanket approaches’ allowing more specific and effective prioritisation of contrasting <b>soil</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R
50|$|The soil {{is home to}} a large {{proportion}} of the world's biodiversity. The links between soil organisms and soil functions are observed to be incredibly complex. The interconnectedness and complexity of this soil ‘food web’ means any appraisal of <b>soil</b> <b>function</b> must necessarily take into account interactions with the living communities that exist within the soil. We know that soil organisms break down organic matter, making nutrients available for uptake by plants and other organisms. The nutrients stored in the bodies of soil organisms prevent nutrient loss by leaching. Microbial exudates act to maintain soil structure, and earthworms are important in bioturbation. However, we find that we don't understand critical aspects about how these populations function and interact. The discovery of glomalin in 1995 indicates that we lack the knowledge to correctly answer some of the most basic questions about the biogeochemical cycle in soils. There is much work ahead to gain a better understanding of the ecological role of soil biological components in the biosphere.|$|E

30|$|In this study, an {{assessment}} of <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> in relation to ecosystem services was carried out for a continental-scale overview of the EU.

30|$|The {{capacity}} of soil to perform {{any of the}} seven identified functions and to support their associated ecosystem services depends on its physical, biological, and chemical attributes (i.e., “internal” characteristics), while {{the realization of the}} performance is conditioned by natural (e.g., slope steepness) and/or anthropogenic factors (“external” controls). In order to provide quantitative figures on the levels of <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> which are valid in the spatial context of the diverse biophysical regions of the European Union, evaluation of <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> has to be extended and combined with landform and climatic information. As soil quality—the {{capacity of}} soil to perform its functions—is a time-dependent dynamic phenomenon (Karlen et al. 2001; Larson and Pierce 1991), detecting temporal changes in <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> capacities is only possible if soil attributes are monitored. Since a comprehensive soil monitoring network and derived spatial database are lacking in Europe, the ambition to provide dynamic information on <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> is unrealistic.

The main {{objective of the}} SNOWMAN-MCA project (2009 - 2013) was to demonstrate the use of multi-criteria analysis (MCA) in evaluating land management and soil remediation alternatives to access their overall impact on sustainability, with focus on soil functions and soil services. Soil functions are critical for ecosystem survival and for ecosystems’ provision of services to humans, and maintained <b>soil</b> <b>function</b> is a key parameter in sustainable development. The SNOWMAN-MCA project was based on studies of three representative polluted sites in Sweden and Austria, and included a range of conventional and innovative remediation scenarios. Key results of the SNOWMAN-MCA project include: • A suggested hierarchy between soil functions, soil processes, soil services and ecosystem services, resulting {{in a set of}} <b>soil</b> <b>function</b> related ecological, socio-cultural and economic criteria and sub-criteria to be used in MCA. • A suggested minimum data set (MDS) of soil quality indicators for <b>soil</b> <b>function</b> evaluation, and a software tool (SF Box) for calculating changes in soil quality based on the proposed MDS. • A suggested structured and transparent approach for incorporating <b>soil</b> <b>function</b> and soil use aspects into sustainability appraisal of remediation alternatives using MCA. Using input from research carried out in tandem with the SNOWMAN-MCA project, the impact of remediation in the ecological, socio-cultural and economic domain was further assessed, including suggested criteria for the socio-cultural domain and research on how uncertainty may be addressed in MCA. Based on this research and on previous efforts (Rosén et al., 2009), an MCA software tool (SCORE) was developed, and used for evaluating the sustainability of suggested remedial actions at the studied sites. The results from the SCORE tool are in this report presented together with the results of the SNOWMAN-MCA project, demonstrating a holistic approach to sustainable remediation...|$|E

To encourage winegrowers and stakeholders to be reflective and adapt their vineyard practices, we evaluated the effects of three soil management practices (inter row plant cover duration, weeding and fertilization strategies) on <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> in 146 commercial plots distributed in Southern France, by a complementary set of biological and physico-chemical indicators. We used the concept of soil dynamic quality to evaluate some soil management practices on <b>soil</b> <b>functioning.</b> The influence of inherent soil properties derived from pedogenesis on soil dynamic indicator response was accounted for by considering the response of soil indicators for three soil groups differing in their stoniness and Ca carbonate content. The three soil management practices systematically influenced some nematode-based indicators, whereas other indicators were ascribable to a specific soil type or practice. We demonstrated that the potential of soil management practices to enhance <b>soil</b> <b>functioning</b> is restricted by soil type.

This is recognized in the proposed EU Soil Framework Directive from 2006, which lists seven important soil functions and services {{to be considered in}} a soil management practice. Emerging regulatory requirements demand a holistic view on soil evaluation in remediation projects. This paper presents a multi-scale, structured and transparent approach for incorporating the <b>soil</b> <b>function</b> concept into sustainability appraisal of remediation alternatives using a set of ecological, socio-cultural and economic criteria. The basis for the presented approach is a conceptualization of the linkages between soil functions and ecosystem services connected to with the sustainability paradigm. The approach suggests using (1) soil quality indicators (i. e. physical, chemical and biological soil properties) for exploring the performance of soil functions at the site level, and (2) soil service indicators (i. e. value-related measurements) for evaluating the performance of services resulting from soil functions across all levels of the spatial scale. The suggested approach is demonstrated by application in a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework for sustainability appraisals of remediation alternatives. Further, the possibilities of using soil quality indicators for <b>soil</b> <b>function</b> evaluation are explored by reviewing existing literature on potential negative and positive effects of remediation technologies on the functionality of the treated soil.

The focus of our current assessment has been on these seven major <b>soil</b> <b>functions,</b> which reflects our current scientific and policy perspectives towards Europe’s soil resources (CEC 2006). Although the criticism may be valid that a scientific evaluation of <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> as defined by a policy document is biased by current policy-driven perception, rather than being based purely on theoretical grounds (with possible windows towards applicability), it is generally accepted (FAO 1976) that, in addition to studying soils’ natural phenomena, soil resources should also be evaluated from socioeconomic viewpoints. This viewpoint is also an aim of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA; Reid et al. 2005), the first comprehensive attempt to characterize the complex interactions between the various functions of ecosystems {{from the viewpoint of}} their services to humans.

One {{of the greatest challenges}} of the 21 st century is to identify key risks to soil, and to design mitigation strategies to manage these risks and to enhance <b>soil</b> <b>functions</b> that can last into the future.

Computational simulation of biophysical processes provides a quantitative method of integration for the range of theory and observations that are required to quantify the linkages between changes in soil structure and <b>soil</b> <b>functions.</b> Key results demonstrate that changes in soil structure can be quantified through the inputs of organic carbon and nitrogen from plant productivity and microbial activity, coupled with particle aggregation dynamics and organic matter mineralization. Simulation results show that soil structure is highly dynamic and is sensitive to organic matter production and mineralisation rates as influenced by vegetation, tillage and organic carbon amendments. These results point to a step-change in the capability to design soil management and land use through computational simulation. This approach of “sustainability by design” describes the mechanistic process linkages that exist between the above-ground inputs to the CZ and the internal processes that produce <b>soil</b> <b>functions.</b> This approach provides a rational, scientific approach to selecting points of intervention with the CZ in order to design methods to mitigate soil threats and to enhance and sustain vital <b>soil</b> <b>functions.</b> Furthermore, this approach provides a successful pilot study to the use of international networks of CZOs as a planetary-scale laboratory to test the response of CZ process rates along gradients of global environmental change – and to test adaptation strategies to manage the risks arising from the CZ impacts.
