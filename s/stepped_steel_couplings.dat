5000|$|The {{shafts of}} the woods were made of {{different}} types of wood before being replaced by hickory {{in the middle of the}} 19th century [...] The varieties of woods included ash, purpleheart, orangewood, and blue-mahoo. Despite the strength of hickory, the long-nose club of the mid nineteenth century was still prone to breaking at the top of the back swing. The club heads were often made from woods including apple, pear, dogwood, and beech in the early times until persimmon became the main material. Golf clubs have been improved and the shafts are now made of steel, titanium, other types of metals or carbon fiber. The shaft is a tapered steel tube or a series of <b>stepped</b> <b>steel</b> tubes in telescopic fashion. This has improved the accuracy of golfers. The grips of the clubs are made from leather or rubber.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{business}} side, the Opera underwent tremendous change under Steel's tenure, which both balanced {{the budget and}} extended {{the life of the}} Company. These changes led directly to the Opera's first balanced budgets in an over a decade and a sold-out 2011-2012 season. Some of the <b>steps</b> <b>Steel</b> took in his efforts to save the Company aroused controversy, including a contentious, but ultimately successful, contract negotiation with the labor unions representing the orchestra and the singers, and the departure of the Opera from Lincoln Center out of financial necessity. While the Company had {{for more than a decade}} discussed publicly the idea of leaving Lincoln Center, the Company's ultimate departure, driven by the financial reality that the Opera would otherwise have to close, was met alternately with praise and scepticism. [...] Notwithstanding artistic successes, record fundraising, and dramatic changes to the Company's business model, the Opera ultimately succumbed to bankruptcy.|$|R

50|$|The fourth {{match was}} the Last Man Standing match between John Cena and Umaga for the WWE Championship. Umaga {{dominated}} Cena, gaining the advantage by using powerful moves, and attacking Cena's bandaged ribs. Cena tried {{to fight back}} using the <b>steel</b> <b>steps,</b> but Umaga quickly recovered, and continued the beat down. Cena managed to hit a low blow and delivered a bulldog onto the <b>steel</b> <b>steps,</b> a spin-out powerbomb onto the <b>steel</b> <b>steps,</b> and the Five Knuckle Shuffle all onto Umaga. Umaga regained control when Cena attempted an FU onto the steps, and collapsed, hitting {{his head on the}} steps. Cena avoided a running headbutt drop, and hit Umaga {{in the head with a}} television monitor. Umaga stood but missed a running splash through a broadcast table. Umaga got up again as his manager, Armando Alejandro Estrada, detached one of the turnbuckles for Umaga to use. Cena avoided the attack, executed an FU, and choked Umaga using the loose ring rope. Umaga failed to answer the referee's count of ten, and Cena retained the title.|$|R

2500|$|The fourth match saw John Cena {{defend the}} WWE United States Championship against Rusev in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match At {{one point during}} the match, the fight spilled into the crowd, {{as well as the}} {{production}} area. Rusev eventually applied the Accolade on Cena. Cena did not quit, but passed out. Referee Mike Chioda informed Rusev that the match can only end when someone quits, so unlike a submission match, this one continued. <b>Steel</b> <b>steps,</b> a <b>steel</b> barricade, Cena tackling Rusev through the barricade, Cena using a laptop as a weapon and Rusev using the pyro table for an explosion all came into play during the match. In the end, Cena ended up using the ring ropes for extra torque on the STF he applied on Rusev. Lana then claimed that Rusev was saying [...] "I Quit" [...] in Bulgarian. As Lana was Rusev's manager, the referee obliged and Cena retained the title.|$|R

JBL hit Undertaker with the <b>steel</b> <b>steps</b> and {{tried to put the}} Undertaker in the hearse but the Undertaker fought back. JBL executed a diving shoulder block but The Undertaker applied a triangle choke hold on JBL, leading JBL to submit to no effect. The Undertaker backdropped out of a piledriver attempt on the <b>steel</b> <b>steps</b> and executed a Tombstone Piledriver on the <b>steel</b> <b>steps,</b> causing JBL to bleed. The Undertaker chokeslammed JBL through a broadcast table. The Undertaker carried JBL to the hearse but Jon Heidenreich came out of the hearse and covered his mouth with a soaked rag filled with chloroform. Heidenreich placed the Undertaker into the hearse and drove off. Inside the hearse, The [...] Undertaker jumped out and attacked Heidenreich. JBL executed a Clothesline from Hell and helped Heidenreich place the Undertaker back into the hearse. Backstage, Paul Heyman drove the hearse to the parking lot, where Heidenreich drove a car into it, causing an inexplicable explosion, meaning JBL retained the title.|$|R

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Construction Department of the Dutch Ministry of Public Works (RWS), {{simulations}} were carried out to evaluate the functioning of the half <b>steel</b> <b>STEP</b> barrier. This barrier must satisfy the H 2 level in the NEN-EN 1317 - 1 and NEN-EN 1317 - 2 standard. The tests required by this standard are TB 11 and TB 51. The TB 11 test employs a light passenger car with a mass of 900 kg. The TB 51 test uses a 13, 000 kg bus. Four simulations were carried out on the half <b>steel</b> <b>STEP</b> barrier with 2, 000 mm and 1, 333 mm spacings between the uprights. The tests using the light passenger car were acceptable. The exit angles remained within the permitted values, namely 3 degrees. The Acceleration Severity Index (ASI) values were slightly above level B, that is to say 1. 44 as against 1. 4. The simulations with the bus were highly satisfactory. The exit angles remained small. The barriers remained intact, and stood up to the collisions well. The half <b>steel</b> <b>STEP</b> barrier, with HEB 100 profile uprights and 2, 000 mm and 1, 333 mm spacings in between, consequently satisfy the `higher containment level' H 2, provided that the struts are mounted in the same place as the uprights...|$|R
40|$|An aim of {{collision}} trials {{on actual}} scale is {{to assess whether}} the developed anchored <b>steel</b> <b>STEP</b> barrier meets the `higher containment level' H 2. The trials required for assessment are TB 11 and TB 51. TB 11 is a test using a light passenger car with a mass of 900 kg. TB 51 is a test using a bus with a mass of 13, 000 kg. Both collision trials were conducted on the <b>steel</b> <b>STEP</b> barrier. The collision with the passenger car is stable. Hardly any rolling movement is observed. The angle of exit also remains within the accepted NEN-EN standard at 9 degrees. At a calculated value of 1. 36, the Acceleration Severity Index (ASI) value for the passenger car satisfies Level B of the NEN-EN standard (ASI lower {{than or equal to}} 1. 4). The collision with the bus also proceeds satisfactorily, with a small angle of exit of maximally 2 degrees. The barrier is not ruptured, nor do pieces break off. The maximal angle of roll is greatest during the `rear end' effect: about 25 degrees. It is concluded that the <b>steel</b> <b>STEP</b> barrier, with each element anchored to the road surface, meets the `higher containment level' H 2. The required `working width level W' is W 2 (lower than or equal to 0. 8 meter). See also C 4507 (IRRD 878828) ...|$|R

2500|$|The seventh {{match was}} a No Holds Barred match between John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) and Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL {{attacked}} Batista during his entrance, and they fought on the entrance ramp and at ringside, using several weapons. Batista performed a spear to JBL through the security wall. JBL shoved Batista into the ringpost {{and continued to}} beat down Batista after a short-arm clothesline. He then whipped and choked Batista with a leather belt. Batista fought back with a belly to back suplex and whipped JBL with the belt. JBL fought back, performing a Clothesline from Hell for a near-fall and bringing the <b>steel</b> <b>steps</b> into the ring.

50|$|A Mexican Death match {{followed}} between WCW's Hugh Morrus and Big Bubba Rogers. Nick Patrick favored Bubba {{throughout the}} match, {{allowing him to}} take full advantage of the stipulations of the match, while threatened to disqualify Morrus if he tried to do so, allowing Bubba to use <b>steel</b> <b>steps</b> and a <b>steel</b> chain to gain advantage. Morrus grabbed away the chain and hit Bubba with it and then delivered a No Laughing Matter to Bubba. Patrick gave a very slow 10 count, which allowed Bubba to regain his senses and survive the count. The two men fought into the ring and then the action spilled to the outside, where Morrus missed a No Laughing Matter and Bubba ran him down with a motorcycle. Bubba returned to the ring while Morrus failed to beat the referee's 10 count. This gave nWo, the lead with two wins.|$|R
