This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> 1946, and finally the northern <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.|$|E

5|$|Coloured {{seats and}} a police room {{were added to the}} Kemlyn Road <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> 1987. After the Hillsborough {{disaster}} in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.|$|E
