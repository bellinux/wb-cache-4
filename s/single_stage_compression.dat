40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{model of}} a thermally driven adsorption refrigeration system with activated carbon as the adsorbent and 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134 a) as the refrigerant was developed. The <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compression</b> system has an ensemble of four adsorbers packed with Maxsorb II specimen of activated carbon that provide a near continuous flow which caters to a cooling load of up to 5 W in the 5 - 18 degrees C region. The objective was to utilise the low grade thermal energy to drive a refrigeration system {{that can be used}} to cool some critical electronic components. The laboratory model was tested for it performance at various cooling loads with the heat source temperature from 73 to 93 degrees C. The pressure transients during heating and cooling phases were traced. The cyclic steady state and transient performance data are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{numerical}} and experimental comparative study of the whole refriger-ating cycles in general, and the hermetic reciprocating compressors in particular, between an R 134 a conventional refrigerating cycle and a carbon dioxide trans-critical refrigerating system. The comparative case presented has been specially designed for small cooling capacities and an evaporation temperature around 0 oC. A detailed numerical simulation model for hermetic recip-rocating compressors performance {{has been used to}} numerically compare both a conventional R 134 a hermetic compressor and a ¯rst carbon dioxide compressor prototype. The conventional compressor has been experimentally tested in a calorimeter setup, while the CO 2 compres-sor has been validated in a speci¯c experimental unit specially designed and built to analyze high pressure <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> vapour <b>compression</b> trans-critical refrigerating equipments. In order to validate this laboratory setup, a detailed numerical simulation of the thermal and °uid-dynamic behaviour of <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> vapour <b>compression</b> refrigerating unit has been developed and used.

They may be used with liquids or gases, but the construction details will {{vary depending on the}} fluid.A gas booster is similar to a gas compressor, but generally a simpler mechanism which often has only a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> of <b>compression,</b> and is used to increase pressure of a gas already above ambient pressure. Two-stage boosters are also made. Boosters may be used for increasing gas pressure, transferring high pressure gas, charging gas cylinders and scavenging.|$|R
40|$|Despite of the {{excellent}} {{efficiency of the}} CO 2 transcritical cycle in heat pump mode, there is a loss of efficiency in refrigeration mode compared with the subcritical vapor compression cycle with HFC refrigerants. This reason has lead several researches to propose {{ways to improve the}} transcritical cycle performance using CO 2 as refrigerant in refrigeration mode, mainly associated to cycle configurations changes. In this paper, a comparative study and energetic simulation of most common configurations for transcritical <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> cycle using CO 2 as refrigerant has been carried out. In order to make the comparison, a cycle components modelization has been proposed and the simulation results are used to find the optimum configuration for a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> vapor <b>compression</b> transcritical system...|$|R
40|$|Data {{hiding in}} a cover image {{can be used to}} protect a {{confidential}} message before being transmitted on the Internet. The stego image can be transmitted in either raw or compressed format. The two major concerns about data hiding are hiding capacity and the stego image quality. Higher capacity allows the transmission of more confidential data. A good stego image quality means that it should be visually undistorted and similar to the original cover image to avoid arousing unwanted attention. In this paper, a data hiding strategy is proposed based on two stage vector quantisation (VQ) coding. Data are hidden in both the first <b>stage</b> VQ <b>compression</b> indices and the second <b>stage</b> VQ <b>compression</b> indices. The stego image is transmitted in its VQ compressed format. Experimental results showed that the proposed method resulted in very high data hiding capacity and fairly high stego image quality in comparison to the <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> VQ <b>compression</b> based data hiding strategy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cascade {{refrigeration}} systems employ {{series of}} <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> vapor <b>compression</b> units which are thermally coupled with evaporator/condenser cascades. Different refrigerants {{are used in}} each of the circuit depending on the optimum characteristics shown by the refrigerant for a particular application. In the present research study, a steady state thermodynamic model is developed which simulates the working of an actual cascade system. The model provides COP and all other system parameters e. g. total compressor work, temperature, pressure, enthalpy and entropy at different state points. The working fluid in low temperature circuit (LTC) is CO 2 (R 744) while Ammonia (R 717), Propane (R 290), Propylene (R 1270), R 404 A and R 12 are the refrigerants in high temperature circuit (HTC). The performance curves of Ammonia, Propane, Propylene, and R 404 A are compared with R 12 to find its nearest substitute. Results show that Ammonia is the best substitute of R 12.

40|$|Vapor {{recompression}} of {{distillation columns}} overheads, followed by subsequent condensation in the reboiler results in substantial operating cost savings compared to conventional steam driv;n reboiler systems. The use of high performance heat exchangers and distillation trays permits additional energy savings by lower reboiler temperature dif ferences, and reduced reflux requirements for a fixed column height, due to closer tray spacings. This paper surveys the heat pump systems cur rently in operation using high performance UCC MD trays and High Flux tubing.

40|$|Recently, {{repetitive}} {{pulsed power}} generators using magnetic pulse compression (MPC) and semiconductor switches have been developed. A repetitive short-pulsed generator for an ozonizer was studied and developed. In this work, the short-pulsed generator {{consists of a}} controller, a command charger, a high-speed thyristor, a MPC and a Blumlein line. The controller and the command charger are {{able to control the}} charging voltage to the MPC and the pulse repetition rate. The high-speed thyristor, which was improved in switching speed for the pulsed power applications, generated the primary pulse. The MPC has <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> pulse <b>compression</b> circuit using a pulse transformer and a saturable transformer. The saturable transformer has two functions, a step-up transformer and a magnetic switch. The Blumlein line is the final stage of the short-pulsed generator. The Blumlein line is three-coaxial geometry, which has an external electrode diameter of 110 mm, a middle electrode diameter of 20 mm, an internal electrode diameter of 4 mm, and a length of 500 mm. The short-pulsed generator which has an output voltage of about 65 kV, pulse repetition rate of 150 pulses per second (pps) and a pulse duration of less than 10 ns was used to generate ozone. The results of ozone production using the short-pulsed generator and a simple coaxial electrodes are reported. The attained concentration of ozone was 18 g/m 3...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis is}} presented {{for the two}} <b>stage</b> thermal <b>compression</b> process for an adsorption refrigeration cycle with HFC- 134 a as the working fluid and activated carbon as the adsorbent. Three specimens of varying achievable packing densities were evaluated. The influence of evaporating, condensing/adsorption and desorption temperatures was assessed through three performance indicators, namely,the uptake efficiency, the coefficient of performance and the exergetic efficiency. Conditions under which a two <b>stage</b> thermal <b>compression</b> process performs better than the <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> unit are identified. It is concluded that two <b>stage</b> thermal <b>compression</b> will be a viable proposition when the heat source temperature is low or when adsorption characteristics are weak or when adequate packing densities are difficult to realize.

50|$|One of {{the most}} unusual {{features}} of this military engine is the <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> fan; most trainer and combat engines have multi-staged fans, <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> fans normally being the preserve of civil and military transport turbofans. Ivchenko Lotarev chose a very low specific thrust (net thrust/airflow) cycle for the DV-2, so a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> fan is sufficient to develop the desired fan pressure ratio. Even so, the pressure ratio produced is somewhat higher than that normally developed by a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> fan.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of specific power requirements and the membrane {{area on the}} CO 2 recovery ratio and the CO 2 concentration is investigated for CO 2 membrane separation from a pressurized gas stream. Three different membrane configurations of a simple <b>single</b> <b>stage,</b> a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> with permeate recycle, and an ideal two-cascade are considered. A feed gas containing 40 % H 2 and 60 % CO 2 and having a total pressure of 2. 5 MPa is used. In the cases of a simple <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> and a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> with permeate recycle, a higher CO 2 recovery ratio leads to a larger membrane area and higher energy consumption for the gas recycle. In addition, a higher CO 2 concentration needs a larger membrane area and considerable power. An ideal two-cascade reduces the compressor power requirement as compared to a <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> with permeate recycle; however, it increases the membrane area. A lower CO 2 concentration in the recovered CO 2 stream implies a smaller membrane area and lower power requirement in the CO 2 capture from the pressurized gas stream...|$|R
