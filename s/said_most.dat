5|$|In late November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights to 14Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Pelli Chesi Choodu, to release digitally re-mastered versions in colour. The remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar {{was released in}} January 2010 and performed well in theatres, but Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films, including Pelli Chesi Choodu; the company <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of the producers who sold {{the rights of the}} negatives to television channels lost control over them. Goldstone added that there were many legal issues over ownership and copyright whenever other producers tried to do something on their own.|$|E

25|$|In July 2013, MSU {{announced}} that research funding fell $18.6 million to just $93.7 {{million for the}} 2012-2013 school year. President Cruzado initially <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of the drop was attributable to the expenditure of the one-time $14.9 million NIH grant that helped renovate Cooley Lab. She later said the drop {{was due to the}} federal budgtary sequester.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of resistance {{is higher in}} those patients who relapse and every effort {{must be made to}} obtain a specimen that can be cultured for sensitivities. That <b>said,</b> <b>most</b> patients who relapse do so with a fully sensitive strain and it is possible that these patients have not relapsed, but have instead been re-infected; these patients can be re-treated with the same regimen as before (no drugs need {{to be added to the}} regimen and the duration need not be any longer).|$|E
25|$|Stone {{and bone}} needles found in ancient tombs led Joseph Needham to {{speculate}} that acupuncture might {{have been carried out}} in the Shang dynasty. This being <b>said,</b> <b>most</b> historians now make a distinction between medical lancing (or bloodletting) and acupuncture in the narrower sense of using metal needles to treat illnesses by stimulating specific points along circulation channels ("meridians") in accordance with theories related to the circulation of Qi. The earliest evidence for acupuncture in this sense dates to the second or first century BCE.|$|E

During her disappearance, Khan said he saw her at Islamabad airport in April 2003 as she disembarked from a flight with their son; he said he helped Inter-Services Intelligence {{identify}} her. He said he again saw her two years later, in a Karachi traffic jam. Khan, who unsuccessfully sought custody of his son Ahmed and <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of the claims of Siddiqui's family in the Pakistani media relating to her and their children were one-sided and mostly false.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s New York State Police responded {{many times to}} the village, which has a {{generally}} low crime rate otherwise, when self-described dissidents reported harassment such as broken windows and graffiti of Hebrew profanity on their property. In one incident, troopers rode a school bus undercover to catch teenage boys stoning it; the boys later stoned a backup police cruiser when it arrived. One of Weider's nephews was among those arrested. He admitted {{that some of the}} village's young men took it upon themselves to act violently against dissidents because they could not bear to hear the grand rebbe criticized, although he <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of them were provoked to do so by dissidents.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{however, the}} {{potential}} for a violation of one's privacy is typically out of their hands after purchasing from an online “e-tailer” or store. One of the most common forms in which hackers receive private information from online “e-tailers” actually comes from an attack placed upon the site’s servers responsible for maintaining information about previous transactions. For as experts explain, these “e-tailers” are not doing nearly enough to maintain or improve their security measures. Even those sites that clearly present a privacy or security policy can be subject to hackers’ havoc as most policies only rely upon encryption technology which only apply to the actual transfer of a customer’s data. However, with this being <b>said,</b> <b>most</b> “e-tailers” have been making improvements, going as far as covering some of the credit card fees if the information’s abuse can be tracked back to the site’s servers.|$|E

500|$|Cheap at Half the Price {{differed}} from Frith's previous experimental albums {{in that it}} featured {{a collection of short}} songs and instrumentals in a [...] "tongue-in-cheek pop vein". He also played a [...] "cheap" [...] Casio-101 on all the tracks and sang for the first time. AllMusic described Frith's singing on the album as [...] "strange high-pitched", and the songs as [...] "pop-like ditties" [...] with a [...] "simple and repetitive" [...] structure. Leonardo Digital Reviews <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of the tracks had a [...] "happy-go-lucky" [...] feel to them.|$|E
500|$|Chandler {{published}} his autobiography, Heroes, Plain Folks, and Skunks, in 1989. In {{an interview with}} The Kentucky Kernel, the University of Kentucky's student newspaper, Chandler was asked about his controversial comments the previous year, which were addressed in the book. Chandler reportedly told the paper [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of the Zimbabweans were niggers and they are niggers." [...] The comment sparked fresh protests and calls for Chandler's resignation. In response to the controversy, Chandler's personal assistant said [...] "He used the word again in explaining {{that it was not}} intended by him to be a racial slur", and called the Kernel's story [...] "a complete and total distortion." ...|$|E
500|$|Life Is Strange was Dontnod Entertainment's second {{title with}} a female protagonist. Dontnod {{published}} a developer diary that <b>said</b> <b>most</b> prospective publishers were unwilling to publish a game unless it had a male protagonist. Most publishers had the same objection to Dontnod's first project, Remember Me. Dontnod CEO Oskar Guilbert also challenged the idea at the start. Square Enix was the only publisher with no intention to change the female protagonist. Dontnod co-founder Jean-Maxime Moris said gender equality in video games was [...] "a great debate to have", but [...] "we're not pretending {{to address the issue}} or use the issue to stand out from the rest".|$|E

500|$|Filming took {{around six}} weeks, {{relatively}} short for a thriller; Weisz <b>said</b> <b>most</b> take {{about three months}} to complete. Producers used hand-held cameras and had a lower budget than usual for the genre. Kondracki said filming in Eastern Europe was crucial, [...] "In a story such as this, it's more about what you don't see, {{so you need to}} create that world." [...] The Carpathian Mountains in Romania served as the backdrop for the war-ravaged Sarajevo of the late 1990s. Scenes set in UN buildings were filmed in Toronto. Most outdoor scenes are set at night; daytime shots often appear bleak, gray and overcast. This, coupled with a grainy texture, helped create a documentary feel.|$|E
500|$|Neil Gaiman {{had written}} an episode, {{but it was}} pushed to the next series due to budget {{constraints}} and was replaced with [...] "The Lodger" [...] instead. [...] "The Lodger" [...] was adapted from a comic strip {{of the same name}} writer Gareth Roberts had done for Doctor Who Magazine, although he <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of it started [...] "from scratch" [...] The story was inspired by wishing to see the Doctor in normal, every-day human circumstances, as well as Roberts' enjoyment of stories set on Earth rather than in space. Roberts was interested in doing a television version of the story, but he never mentioned it. However, Moffat was a fan of the comic story and immediately asked to adapt it into an episode when he became showrunner.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Sons of Soul were {{described}} by Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson as often quirky, while Elysa Gardner from Vibe {{said they were}} flirtatious and tender, particularly on ballads such as [...] "Slow Wine" [...] and [...] "(Lay Your Head on My) Pillow"; she felt the group's songwriting throughout the album possessed a [...] "reverent" [...] ethos. Raphael Wiggins was credited {{with the majority of}} the songwriting. Laura Zucker of The Sacramento Bee <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of the album was written [...] "solidly in the R tradition of sweet talking and romancing." [...] Unlike most contemporary R and hip hop music at the time, the album's lyrics lacked profane language, with the exception of [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend", which featured the chorus [...] "I couldn't believe it / They tried to tell me my ex-girlfriend is a !" ...|$|E

500|$|Nordby <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of the {{attention}} was devoted to Jennifer's face and that [...] "very quickly in combination" [...] with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain {{like the rest of}} us. And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{considered}} the compilation to be [...] "an {{almost unheard of}} opportunity to take something you had already released and make it better". Senior designer Mike Wikan <b>said</b> <b>most</b> of the content additions were subtle changes, such as streamlining the engines for steady framerates and shorter loading times, and higher resolution textures. Prime had the addition of light bloom, and Echoes had difficulty tweaks to make it [...] "more accessible {{to those who were}} really intimidated early on". For Corruption, the code was examined to find ways to make it run faster and better than in the original Wii release. Besides the changes, the particle and water ripple effects found in the original versions of Prime were reduced, while the word [...] "damn" [...] uttered by the character Admiral Dane in Corruptions original release was also replaced with [...] "no".|$|E
500|$|Financial writer Roger Nusbaum {{said the}} episode {{was not only}} [...] "humorous" [...] but {{provided}} a decent analysis of the recession. He particularly praised Randy's inclusion of margaritas with the barest of necessities; Nusbaum <b>said</b> <b>most</b> people tend to take on absurd expenses that they fail to realize are unnecessary, even as they discuss {{the plight of the}} economy. Brad Trechak of TV Squad called [...] "Margaritaville" [...] a highlight of the season. Mike Fahey of Kotaku said the episode had [...] "a clever little plot". Zac Bissonnette of BloggingStocks said of the episode, [...] "It isn't quite as trenchant as some of the other Wall Street satire that's been making the rounds, but it's definitely worth watching." [...] Carlos Delgado of If magazine said the episode included many excellent moments, including the headless chicken method of making economic decisions, but otherwise felt [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was not as strong as previous episodes like [...] "The Ring". Delgado said, [...] "Maybe I'm too depressed about the current economic situation, who knows, but although 'Margaritaville' was well written and poignant, I wasn't bursting out in laughter every two minutes." ...|$|E
