40|$|The {{advantage}} of project-based, collaborative assignments {{has been demonstrated}} to foster greater depth of learning in traditional classroom settings. However, there are numerous challenges that are inherent within this pedagogy, especially in promoting computer supported collaborative learning. Although lots of computer systems and tools are compatible to support project-based learning (PBL) in a computer <b>supported</b> <b>environment,</b> an integrated computer supported system which provides infrastructure for PBL is still lacking. This paper brings forward the initiative to coalesce and strengthen a set of coherent foundations for generating integrated computer <b>supported</b> <b>environment</b> for PBL by introducing the initiation phase. Understanding the initiation phase activities and their characteristics in computer <b>supported</b> <b>environment</b> is a definite step towards generating an integrated computer <b>supported</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|R

The reason of the differences is that the venture capital <b>supporting</b> <b>environments</b> such as economy, culture, laws and regulations are different in various countries.   The objective of this research is to study the venture capital <b>supporting</b> <b>environments</b> in China and analyze the role of government on how to improve these <b>supporting</b> <b>environments.</b> After research questions are decided, the author analyzes and combines the selected previous researches in different countries in order to build a more systematic, scientific and complete theoretical framework to conduct the case study in China.   In the case study, all seven venture capital <b>supporting</b> <b>environments</b> in China are studied. By analyzing the facts, the author finds out that some environments such as laws and policies and financial environment have developed rapidly in past years and become more and more adapt to the {{development of}} venture capital. However, some other environments, especially the culture environment have negative effects on venture capital and can not be easily changed within a short period of time. Based on these findings, the author tries to find out some possible actions that the government can do to reduce these limitations and improve the venture capital <b>supporting</b> <b>environments.</b>     Key words: venture capital; supporting environment; venture business; venture capitalist...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} data {{warehousing}} {{dates back to}} the late 1980s when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the [...] "business data warehouse". In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to decision <b>support</b> <b>environments.</b> The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision <b>support</b> <b>environments.</b> In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision <b>support</b> <b>environments</b> to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as legacy systems), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from [...] "data marts" [...] that were tailored for ready access by users.|$|R
