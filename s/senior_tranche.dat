5000|$|A {{synthetic}} CDO tranche may {{be either}} funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could {{have to pay}} {{up to a certain}} amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the CDO's reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contract) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below LIBOR. The return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a <b>senior</b> <b>tranche</b> receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio's losses reach the <b>senior</b> <b>tranche.</b> Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO's tranches can be precisely structured.|$|E

5000|$|Synthetic CDOs do not own {{cash assets}} like bonds or loans. Instead, {{synthetic}} CDOs gain credit {{exposure to a}} portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets {{through the use of}} credit default swaps, a derivatives instrument. (Under such a swap, the credit protection seller, the CDO, receives periodic cash payments, called premiums, in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other credit event.) Like a cash CDO, the risk of loss on the CDO's portfolio is divided into tranches.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for pricing {{structured}} CAT bonds based on utility indifference pricing. The CAT bond considered here is issued in two distinct notes called tranches, specifically senior and junior tranches {{each with its own}} payment schedule. Our contributions to the literature of CAT bond pricing are two-fold. First, we apply indifference pricing to structured CAT bonds. We find a price for the <b>senior</b> <b>tranche</b> as a relative indifference price, that is, relative to the price of the junior tranche. Alternatively, one could take the approach that the <b>senior</b> <b>tranche</b> is priced first and the price of the junior tranche is relative to that. Second, instead of simply supposing that the "not-issue-a-CAT-bond" strategy of the reinsurer is to do nothing, we suppose that the reinsurer reduces its risk by reinsuring proportionally less claims. We assume that the reinsurance claims follow a (Poisson) jump-diffusion process. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{determine}} optimal security {{design and}} retention of asset-backed securities by a privately informed issuer with positive NPV uses for immediate cash. In canonical models, investors revert to prior beliefs if issuers pool at zero-retentions (originate-to-distribute), and separating equilibria are welfare-dominated since separation entails signaling via asset-retention and underinvestment. However, we show speculative markets arise {{if and only if}} issuers pool, creating previously overlooked costs. Pooling induces socially costly information acquisition by speculators. Further, in pooling equilibria, issuers never sell safe claims, leaving uninformed investors exposed to adverse selection and distorting risk sharing. In such equilibria, issuers retain zero interest in the asset, and speculator effort is maximized by splitting cash flow into a risky <b>senior</b> ("debt") <b>tranche</b> and residual junior ("equity") claim. Optimal leverage trades off per-unit speculator gains against endogenous declines in uninformed debt trading. Issuer incentives to implement the pooling equilibrium, with distorted risk sharing, are strong precisely when efficient risk sharing, achieved through separation, has high social value. In such cases, a tax on issuer proceeds can raise welfare by encouraging issuer retentions. Taxation dominates mandatory skin-in-the-game as a policy response, since the latter creates gratuitous underinvestment. issuer; pooling; security design; separating; speculator; type...|$|R
40|$|This paper does a {{valuation}} {{analysis of}} senior-subordinated structure tranches backed by non-agency mortgages. The valuation is done using Monte Carlo simulation and employs the CIR interest rate process {{in conjunction with}} an empirical model estimated for non-agency mortgage prepayments and defaults. The sensitivity {{of the value of}} tranches to a number of variables are analyzed. We find that the interest rate process parameters significantly affect prepayments and defaults but not the relative value of the <b>senior</b> <b>tranche.</b> It is found that with the shifting of prepayments, the senior trances does not dominated all the junior tranches at all interest rates. The shifting of prepayments has the unintended effect of providing stability to the junior tranches by making their cashflows less sensitive to prepayments. Our main conclusion is that while the shifting of prepayments increases protection from default to the <b>senior</b> <b>tranche</b> for a given level of subordination, it has the unwanted effect of lowering its value through increased contraction risk. The value loss should be taken into account in determining the optimum level of subordination. ...|$|E

40|$|The EU Commission proposes {{establishing}} Sovereign-Backed Securities (SBSs) as a {{class of}} safe assets for the euro area. SBSs are generated by an issuing agency that would purchase a large diversified portfolio of national sovereign bonds, and finance the purchases by issuing (at least) two types of structured bonds: a risk-free <b>senior</b> SBSs <b>tranche</b> and a risky junior SBSs tranche. Overall, we recognise that the SBSs concept has the theoretical potential to improve financial stability and financial integration in the euro area, provided it is built on a sound framework that overcomes several potential technical and political problems. However, SBSs could pose the risk of eventually leading to unconditional debt mutualisation in times of severe crisis. With regard to technical problems, {{it is not clear}} whether the SBSs concept represents a viable business model for a private entity, and whether senior and junior SBSs would find sufficient demand, particularly in times of crisis. If the market for the junior tranche broke down, the whole concept would collapse. In such instances, the political risk could arise that rescue measures are taken that, in contrast to existing rescue mechanisms (ESM and OMT), are not subject to sufficient controls by Member States, solvency tests and reform requirements (conditionality). Another political risk relates to the introduction of the SBSs concept, which is regarded here as one part of a political compromise. We foresee the danger that the second part - de-privileging national sovereign bonds in banking regulation to sever the sovereign-banking nexus - may not be followed through, due to political resistance and to sequencing problems with introducing SBSs. Other political problems concern possible market distortions even in non-crisis times (particularly in primary markets), and the potential irreversibility of the concept. [ [...] . ...|$|R

In this paper, we explain one of the most well-known models for rating CDOs, the so-called binomial expansion technique (BET). Comparing this approach with an alternative methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation, we then highlight the potential importance of correlation assumptions for the ratings of senior CDO tranches and explore what differences in methodologies across rating agencies may mean for <b>senior</b> <b>tranche</b> rating outcomes.

This result applies to a wide range of latent factor models. We then suggest introducing stochastic recovery rates in such a way that the conditional on the factor expected loss (or equivalently the large portfolio approximation) is the same as in the recovery markdown case.
