50|$|Radial shaft seals, {{also known}} as lip seals, are used to seal rotary elements, such as a shaft or {{rotating}} bore. Common examples include strut seals, hydraulic pump seals, axle seals, power steering seals, and valve stem seals. Early radial shaft seals utilized rawhide as the sealing element, and many elastomeric seal companies today once were tanneries. The advent of modern elastomers replaced rawhide, industry also added a garter spring which helps the <b>sealing</b> <b>lip</b> compensate for lip wear and elastomer material changes.|$|E
50|$|The seal {{construction}} {{will consist}} of a sprung main <b>sealing</b> <b>lip</b> which has a point contact with the shaft. The point contact is formed by two angles, with the air side angle usually less than the oil side angle. Depending on the seal type these two angles are varied to create a pressure distribution at the seal contact point which has a steeper slope on the oil side of the seal. The shallower the slope on the oil side of the seal the wetter the seal will run. The spring is positioned such that axially the centerline of the spring is biased to the air side of the lip contact point.|$|E

There are two major types of seals presently being used and they are <b>lip</b> type <b>seals</b> and mechanical type <b>seals.</b> <b>Lip</b> type <b>seals</b> can be divided in conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> and hydrodynamic <b>lip</b> <b>seals.</b> Conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> {{can be used for}} slow-speed, low-pressure, low-temperature <b>sealing.</b> Hydrodynamic <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> although they are as pressure and temperature limited as conventional <b>lip</b> <b>seals,</b> can operate at a higher speed. Mechanical types seals are comprised of face seals and circumferential seals. Face seals are capable of high speed, high pressure, and high temperature.

The objective function in optimizing process was obtained from results of the mud slurry test, which is one of many tests for evaluating performance of wheel bearing. After the mud slurry test for the four models which have the similar cross-sectional shape, we measured the wear area of the <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> and the moisture content in grease. The objective function has been chosen by comparing the results of mud slurry test and characteristics of <b>seal</b> <b>lip,</b> such as contact force, contact area, contact pressure, and interference.

40|$|Purpose: We {{have been}} using myofunctional therapy in {{orthodontic}} treatment to improve orofacial disorders. Our previous study showed that lip training increased orbicularis oris muscle strength and endurance. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effectiveness of hypoxic lip training for improving lip incompetence. Subjects and methods: Twenty healthy subjects (10 males and 10 females, 23. 6 +/- 2. 3 years old) with lip incompetence participated in this study. We recorded the <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratio calculated by using the formula "(lip-sealingtime/totalrecorded time) x 100 " during relaxation (listening to soothing music) and during concentration (performing a mathematical calculation). Then the subjects performed a standardized hypoxic lip training (5 repetitive contractions with 80 % of maximum tensile strength of the orbicularis oris muscle) with a traction plate. Training was repeated daily for 4 weeks. To estimate training effects, the <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratios during relaxation and concentration were recorded before training (T 1), at 2 weeks (T 2) and 4 weeks (T 3) after the start of training, and at 4 weeks (T 4) and 8 weeks (T 5) after the end of training. Results: The <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratios in both the relaxation and concentration conditions significantly (p < 0. 003 after Bonferroni correction) increased during the training period. Although the <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratios slightly decreased during the post-training period, they were not significantly different from those at T 3. Conclusions: Hypoxic lip training increases the <b>sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratio and is thus effective for improving <b>lip</b> incompetence. <b>Sealed</b> <b>lip</b> ratios were maintained after 8 weeks of training.

40|$|The film {{formation}} in <b>lip</b> <b>seals,</b> {{due to the}} non-Newtonian rheology of the lubricant, has been a topic of speculation.

40|$|In general, most {{analyses}} of radial <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> behavior assume a statie deformation {{state in the}} <b>seal</b> <b>lip.</b> Nevertheless, a dynamic excitation of the <b>seal</b> <b>lip</b> always occurs in practice, due to unroundness of the shaft or motions of the shaft center. In this first part of a two part paper the influence of dynamic excitation on the occurrence of clearances in a dry seal-shaft contact is studied, taking into account viscoelasticity and inertia of the seal material. The {{ultimate goal is to}} determine whether viscoelastic seal behavior can result in a continuous fluid film or not. First, attention is paid to the mechanical behavior of synthetic rubber under an oscillating load. The seal elastomer shows a glass transition, resulting in a strong increase in stiffness with frequency. Next, a FEM analysis of the seal-shaft contact under dynamic conditions is presented. The Steady-state response of the seal is represented by a transfer function approach. It is shown that clearances develop due to viscous and inertial seal material behavior.

40|$|Reducing {{friction}} and thereby saving energy is {{of special interest}} for several industries like automotive, wind energy and any other section using elastomeric components, for example sealing rings. Unpredictable, deficient lubrication can occur and damage the sealing. Applying a plasma polymeric coating on elastomers the friction can be reduced. Four elastomer types (acrylic rubber, fluoric rubber and two different nitrile butadiene rubbers) were investigated each with and without plasma polymeric coating. The experiments were performed on coated and uncoated flat elastomer plates and the friction reduction was measured using a Uni-Kurzfassungversal Material Tester (UMT 3) system with oscillating Pin-on-plate contact geometry. The face of a cylindric wheel bearing with 6 mm in diameter was used as counterpart. The contact geometry was chosen due to the differentiability of lubricants in oscillating tests {{as well as the}} 104 times bigger contact area compared with the <b>sealing</b> <b>lip</b> of a radial shaft sealing. The tribological tests were done under ambient conditions with a velocity of 200 mm/s and a stroke length of 11 mm. The used normal force of 10. 6 N represents an initial contact pressure of 0. 5 MPa. The tests were performed using different small amounts of fully formulated gear oil down to avoiding lubricants to demonstrate the effect of lubrication deficiency. The coated elastomers showed a reduced friction compared to the uncoated ones. Ifa coating was applied to the elastomers the measurements without any lubrication showed the lowest friction. Friction coefficients down to 0. 17 were achieved. Compared to 0. 48 for the dry measurement with uncoated substrate, a friction reduction of 65 % was reached. This demonstrates emergency running properties for plasmapolymeric coated components. For the lubricated measurements differences between the different lubrications appeared. The plasmapolymeric coating and therewith the friction reduction is available at low costs using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique (PECVD). With PECVD it is easily possible to apply coatings on complex 3 D-geometrieslike sealing rings. The process was already scaled up for radial shaft sealings to enable series production...|$|E
40|$|The {{conceptual}} design and preliminary engineering calculations {{have been completed}} for a two cassette cryostat. This report summarizes the design. A cryocooler is permanently mounted {{in the center of}} a stainless steel, 0. 75 inch thick top lid. The cryocooler sits upon a spacer which raises the cooling stage elevations to favorably match the cassette heat intercept elevations. The top lid (32. 0 -inch outside diameter) mates to a 24 -inch pipe size flange with o-ring. The 24 -inch pipe size vacuum vessel with end plate has a minimum internal depth of 16 -inch to give adequate clearance for the depth of the cryocooler and multilayer insulation blankets. Support stand legs elevate the container to a convenient height and allow for placement of the AFE power supply underneath. Two cassette slots are located on either side of the cryocooler. The slots are positioned parallel to each other, 10. 5 -inch center to center (6 standard cassette slot widths) so that the standard 8 slot AFE backplane can be used. The slot opening through the lid is approximately 1. 422 -inch x 16. 782 -inch. A 0. 016 -inch thick titanium (Ti- 6 AI- 4 V) envelope with <b>sealing</b> <b>lip</b> is inserted through lid and defines the gas helium boundary that the VLPC cassette resides. The internal dimensions of the titanium envelope are 1. 390 -inch x 16. 75 -inch x 10. 531 -inch deep. When the cassette is inserted the clearances will be 0. 015 -inch on the long side, 0. 063 -inch on the short side, and 0. 032 -inch at the bottom. The cassette gasket seals against the top lip of the titanium envelope. A soft gasket or thin vacuum sealant tape seals the underside of the titanium envelope to the top surface of the lid. A clamping hold down bar may be necessary to make this vacuum seal. Gas helium for the cassette space is supplied through a fitting and port that is added to the cassette bulkhead assembly. This is the only modification necessary the standard D-Zero cassette. Evacuation and backfilling and then stagnant positive pressure are achieved through this one port. After the titanium envelope/pocket and cassette are mounted to the top lid, the lid is raised so that assembly work can be accomplished below. Three pneumatic cylinders mounted to the lid are pressurized (with air or the gas helium source) to raise the lid. Safety linkages are installed to prevent accidental lowering of the lid while work is being performed. Honeycomb sandwich panels are attached to the titanium envelope to support the thin envelope against the pressure differential. A thin thermoplastic mesh placed between the honeycomb panel and titanium envelope helps to insulate the panel so it is not a significant parallel heat path down the wall. There are two panel sets for each cassette. One for the area above the upper intercept and one set for the area below. It is reasonable that a 0. 40 -inch thick panel will suffice. A high conductance thermal link is made between the first stage of the cryocooler and the uppermost intercept location. This is solid OFHC copper part with a short section of flexible copper braid that connects to bars that clamp solidly to the long sides of the cassette envelope. Apiezon 'N' grease is used at assembly to enhance heat transfer at the clamp bar to titanium envelope interface. A second high conductance thermal connection is made between the second stage of the cryocooler and the bottom of the cassette envelope. The link is mostly solid OFHC copper along with a short flexible braid section in between. The two piece clamping bar encases the bottom 1. 75 -inch of the cassette. Thermal grease is used at the interface...|$|E
