5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} a scene of trucks pulling away from a large, brick building. Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and sitting down in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the five women standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers with curiosity. For the song's refrain, Oh Land rides an all-terrain vehicle, before the video concludes with {{a large group of}} children joining the women for a final dance.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E

25|$|Kelly Bundy (Christina Applegate)—the Bundys' firstborn; a stereotypical dumb blonde who {{is often}} derided as {{promiscuous}} and dates men who get under Al's skin {{to the point}} of him physically assaulting them. Her stupidity manifests in many ways, from forgetting ideas on the spot to mispronouncing or misspelling simple words. Like her mother, she is quick to steal Al's money for expensive things. Her favorite hobby is belittling her lonely and sexless brother, though <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> for him against anyone outside the family.|$|E

She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Aspects of [...] "The Big Bang" [...] were {{outlined}} by lead writer {{and executive producer}} Steven Moffat as he planned the arc of the series. Moffat stated he left room to improvise on the story and {{was pleased with the}} result, describing it as [...] "mad" [...] and [...] "amazing". Moffat stated that the title [...] "The Big Bang" [...] is his favourite dirty Doctor Who joke as it is a reference to the fact that Amy and Rory conceive their child on the TARDIS that night, as revealed in the next series in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". Gillan described Rory's vigil for Amy as the [...] "ultimate romantic gesture" [...] which showed how much he loved Amy, and was where Amy realised how much she loved him. Moffat thought that standing guard for two thousand years would make up for shooting her. Moffat had always intended for Amy and Rory to get married [...] "from the off". Moffat described the conclusion as the story of how Amy has been changed by the Doctor and the Doctor's success at restoring her spirit to the girl he first met, believing that a man could drop out of the sky and [...] "fix everything". However, he did not return for her as he had promised and she grew believing that he was a liar and could not be trusted; Amy returns to her original belief when <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> at her wedding and proclaims that the Doctor is real and that he will arrive. Though the episode {{is the end of the}} series, Moffat left questions to be answered in the next series, including the mystery of River Song's identity and the [...] "Silence" [...] which appeared to cause the TARDIS to blow up.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Will Be" [...] {{was shot in}} New York City on 18 December 2008, and {{features}} Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford {{as one of the}} characters. A reporter for People explained how the inclusion of Crawford in the video came to fruition, writing that [...] "Chace went to London a couple months ago for meetings and to promote Gossip Girl. He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [...] hit it off and talk {{every once in a while}} and have become fast friends. A couple weeks ago Leona called Chace and asked if he would be in her next video. He obviously said yes." [...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as <b>she</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up,</b> he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had finger marks on my arm when I left {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen standing in the middle of a cemetery, walking around and staring at the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the house to see her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to wake him up but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks through the window and notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E
500|$|The {{video of}} [...] "Jealous" [...] was {{considered}} to be a sequel to the one for the previous clip on the album, [...] "Partition". It opens with Beyoncé watching a man while he is sitting on a table in front of her, reading a newspaper. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> and the scene transitions to the singer walking down the stairs in a mansion, wearing a gown. It continues with Beyoncé, sitting alone at an arranged table for dinner, waiting for her love interest to come home. As she waits for him, at one point she angrily sweeps the crystal, dinnerware and candles from the table with her hands as he does not show up. Afterwards, she dresses in a red leather trench coat with a gold choker and goes outside to look for her man. She is seen on a street surrounded by various fans taking pictures of her. The scenes also transition to the singer being at a party in a bar, chatting with people, holding a drink in her hands and straddling a pinball machine. As the song nears its end, sped-up scenes of a car driving on different streets follows. During the end, Beyoncé runs to a man who is seen only from the back, dressed in a hooded coat. She embraces him with teary eyes, sighing with relief. Throughout the video, close-up shots of the singer are also featured, showing her expressions. Beyoncé is seen wearing a high-waist corset and a cropped lace top designed by Ulyana Sergeenko with her look being complete with an earring. She also wears a studded plate cuff, a chain, and a gold bracelet from jewelry by Eddie Borgo. During scenes at the party, she wears a sweatshirt designed by Givenchy.|$|E

2500|$|Madonna {{described}} {{the central theme}} of the show as a journey from darkness to light. The show was divided into four sections: Transgression, Prophecy, Masculine/Feminine and Redemption. It began with a cathedral setting, with the Kalakan trio doing religious chanting that morphs into Madonna's name. The dancers dressed in red robes are seen pulling a rope that rings a bell and are seen pushing a giant thurible. The middle screen splits into two, revealing a silhouette of Madonna in a [...] "glass confession box" [...] praying. <b>She</b> <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> holding a rifle and [...] "breaks" [...] the glass, revealing herself dressed in a tight black suit and starts singing Girl Gone Wild. She is accompanied by her dancers who are wearing outfits {{similar to that in}} the music video. The show continues with [...] "Revolver" [...] with Madonna's female dancers accompanying her with automatic rifles and Lil' Wayne being featured in the video backdrops. After the song, [...] "Gang Bang" [...] is performed in a motel setting where Madonna is seen shooting the male dancers who infiltrate her room with blood being splattered on the backdrops. A minimal version of [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] follows in which her dancers dressed in army pants, boots and masks tie her up, leading into [...] "Hung Up" [...] where Madonna utilizes slacklining while her dancers slide under the ropes. Madonna closes the first section performing [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] on guitar while Nicki Minaj is seen in the backdrops sitting on a throne. The first video interlude features various tombstones and a man walking through a cemetery while a mashup of [...] "Best Friend" [...] and [...] "Heartbeat" [...] is performed. The next section kicks off with Madonna dressed as a majorette while performing [...] "Express Yourself" [...] with a baton. The song, which features lyrical interpolations from Lady Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] and [...] "She's Not Me" [...] from Madonna's 2008 album Hard Candy, breaks down with the Just Blaze Remix of [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] with a marching band that is suspended from the air while Madonna and her female dancers dance with pompoms are dressed as cheerleaders. A short video interlude follows featuring Madonna's previous hits which then leads into [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] with Madonna on guitar wearing a leather dress and a black beret. [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is performed next with the Kalakan trio being formally introduced to the audience with [...] "Sagarra Jo" [...] intertwined with the song. The segment ends with [...] "Masterpiece" [...] with clips from W.E. displayed on the screens.|$|E
