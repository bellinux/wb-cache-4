2500|$|Coble creep is {{a second}} form of {{diffusion}} controlled creep. In Coble creep the atoms diffuse along grain boundaries to elongate the grains along the stress axis. This causes Coble creep to have a stronger grain size dependence than Nabarro–Herring creep, thus, Coble creep will be more important in materials composed of very fine grains. For Coble creep k {{is related to the}} diffusion coefficient of atoms along the grain boundary, Q = Q(grain boundary diffusion), m = 1, and b = 3. Because Q(grain boundary diffusion) < Q(self diffusion), Coble creep occurs at lower temperatures than Nabarro–Herring creep. Coble creep is still temperature dependent, as the temperature increases so does the grain boundary diffusion. However, since the number of nearest neighbors is effectively limited along the interface of the grains, and thermal generation of vacancies along the boundaries is less prevalent, the temperature dependence is not as strong as in Nabarro–Herring creep. It also exhibits the same linear dependence on stress as Nabarro–Herring creep. Generally, the diffusional creep rate should be the sum of Nabarro–Herring creep rate and Coble creep rate. Diffusional creep leads to grain-boundary separation, that is, voids or cracks form between the grains. To heal this, grain-boundary sliding occurs. The diffusional creep rate and the grain boundary <b>sliding</b> <b>rate</b> must be balanced if there are no voids or cracks remain. When grain-boundary sliding couldn't accommodate the incompatibility, [...] grain-boundary voids are generated, which is related to the initiation of creep fracture.|$|E

50|$|Analytic {{glacial erosion}} models suggest that ice flows passing through {{constrained}} spaces such as mountain passes produced enhanced erosion beneath thicker, faster ice flows, which deepens the channel below areas both upstream and downstream. The underlying physical phenomena is that erosion increases with {{the rate of}} ice discharge. Although this simplifies complex relationships among time-varying climates, ice sheet behaviors and bed characteristics, {{it is based on}} the general recognition that enhanced ice discharges typically increase the erosion rate. This is because the basal <b>sliding</b> <b>rate</b> and the erosion rate are interrelated and driven by the same variables: the ice thickness, the underlying bed slope, the overlying glacial slope and the basal temperature. As a result, the modeled fjords are deepest through the narrowest channels (i.e., regions with the highest surrounding highest topography). This corresponds with actual physical observations of fjords.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Sagittal split {{osteotomy}} (SSO) is {{a surgical}} technique largely employed for mandibular mobilizations in orthognatic procedures. However, the traditional design of buccal osteotomy, {{located at the}} junction of mandibular ramus and body, may prevent more extensive sliding between the bone segments, particularly on the advance, laterality and verticality of the mandibular body. The author proposes a new technical and conceptual solution, in which osteotomy is performed in a more distal region, next to the mental formamen. Technically, the area of contact between medullary-cancellous bone surfaces is increased, resulting in larger <b>sliding</b> <b>rates</b> among bone segments; it also facilitates the use of rigid fixation systems, with miniplates and monocortical screws.

This study was conducted using community-owned resource persons (CORPs) to provide {{early diagnosis}} and treatment of malaria, and collect data for estimation of malaria burden in four villages of Korogwe district, north-eastern Tanzania. Methods In 2006, individuals with history of fever within 24 hours or fever (axillary temperature ≥ 37. 5 °C) at presentation were presumptively treated using sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine. Between 2007 and 2010, individuals aged five years and above, with positive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were treated with artemether/lumefantrine (AL) while under-fives were treated irrespective of RDT results. Reduction in anti-malarial consumption was determined by comparing the number of cases that would have been presumptively treated and those that were actually treated based on RDTs results. Trends of malaria incidence and <b>slide</b> positivity <b>rates</b> were compared between lowlands and highlands. Results Of 15, 729 cases attended, <b>slide</b> positivity <b>rate</b> was 20. 4 % and declined by > 72. 0 % from 2008, reaching 40. 0 % in under-fives and > 20. 0 % among individuals aged five years and above.
