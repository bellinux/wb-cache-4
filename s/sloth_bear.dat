5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E
5|$|The {{subfamily}} Ursinae {{experienced a}} dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first {{members of the}} genus Ursus appeared around this time. The <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> is a modern survivor {{of one of the}} earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4 Mya, the species Ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's Asian black bear. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the <b>sloth</b> <b>bear.</b> Two lineages evolved from U. minimus: the black bears (including the sun bear, the Asian black bear, and the American black bear); and the brown bears (which includes the polar bear). Modern brown bears evolved from U. minimus via Ursus etruscus, which itself is ancestral to the extinct Pleistocene cave bear. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. The polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from the brown bear around 400,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|The {{region is}} {{home to one of}} the largest populations of {{endangered}} Indian elephant and Bengal Tiger in India. Elephant populations are found in eight fragmented sites in South India; in northern Karnataka, along the Western Ghats, in Bhadra–Malnad, in Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats, in Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore, in Anamalai–Parambikulam, in Periyar–Srivilliputhur and Agasthyamalai The region {{is home to}} one-third of the tiger population {{and more than half of}} the elephant population of India. There are 14 Project Tiger reserves and 11 Project Elephant reserves in the region. Other threatened and endangered species found in the region include grizzled giant squirrel, grey slender loris, <b>sloth</b> <b>bear,</b> nilgiri tahr, nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, and Indian leopard.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{animals that}} are found in Karnataka include the elephant, the tiger, the leopard, the gaur, the sambar deer, the chital or spotted deer, the muntjac, the bonnet macaque, the slender loris, the common palm civet, the small Indian civet, the <b>sloth</b> <b>bear,</b> the dhole, the striped hyena and the golden jackal. Some of the birds found here are the great hornbill, the Malabar pied hornbill, the Ceylon frogmouth, herons, ducks, kites, eagles, falcons, quails, partridges, lapwings, sandpipers, pigeons, doves, parakeets, cuckoos, owls, nightjars, swifts, kingfishers, bee-eaters and munias. Some species of trees found in Karnataka are Callophyllum tomentosa, Callophyllum wightianum, Garcina cambogia, Garcina morealla, Alstonia scholaris, , Artocarpus hirsutus, Artocarpus lacoocha, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Grewia tilaefolia, Santalum album, Shorea talura, Emblica officinalis, Vitex altissima and Wrightia tinctoria.

5|$|The city {{is divided}} into two {{distinctive}} geographic regions: the dry eastern side which includes majority of the urban area {{of the city and the}} western region which borders the Nilgiris, Anaimalai and Munnar ranges. Palghat Gap, a mountain pass which connects the neighbouring state of Kerala to Tamil Nadu, lies to the west of the city. Because of its location in the biodiversity hotspot of the Western Ghats, it is rich in fauna and flora. The Coimbatore urban wetlands harbours around 116 species of birds, of which 66 are resident, 17 are migratory and 33 are local migrants. The spot-billed pelican, painted stork, openbill stork, ibis, spot-billed duck, teal and black-winged stilt visit the Coimbatore wetlands on their migration. Apart from the species common to the plains, various threatened and endangered species such as Indian elephants, wild boars, leopards, Bengal tigers, gaurs, Nilgiri tahr, <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> and black-headed oriole are found in the region.|$|E

5|$|The <b>sloth</b> <b>bear,</b> {{though not}} as {{specialised}} as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects they favour. At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets. Some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults. Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Fish are {{an important source of}} food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten.|$|E

25|$|Dhole packs may attack sloth bears, {{though they}} are not a usual prey item. When attacking them, dholes try to prevent the bear from {{retreating}} into caves. In one case, a golden jackal (a species much smaller and less powerful than a <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> and not generally a pack hunter as is the dhole) was seen to aggressively displace an adult bear which passively loped away from the snapping canid, indicating the <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> does not regard other carnivores as competition.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of sloth bears grows when {{they live in}} high-profile reserves that protect species, such as tigers and elephants. Directly managed reserves could conserve the <b>sloth</b> <b>bear,</b> hence such reserves must be supported.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> (Melursus ursinus), {{also known}} as the labiated bear, is an insectivorous bear species native to the Indian subcontinent. The <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> evolved from ancestral brown bears during the Pleistocene and shares {{features}} found in insect-eating mammals through convergent evolution. The population isolated in Sri Lanka is considered a subspecies. Compared to brown and black bears, sloth bears have lankier builds, long, shaggy coats that form a mane around the face (similar to that of a lion), long, sickle-shaped claws, and a specially adapted lower lip and palate used for sucking insects. Sloth bears breed during spring and early summer and give birth near the beginning of winter. They feed on termites, honeybee colonies, and fruits. Sloth bears sometimes attack humans who encroach on their territories. Historically, humans have drastically reduced their habitat and diminished their population by hunting them for food and products such as their bacula and claws. These bears have been used as performing pets due to their tameable nature. The <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN due to habitat loss and poaching.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to define the physiological responses of captive <b>sloth</b> <b>bears</b> immobilized with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine hydrochloride and to determine and compare the values of hematology and serum biochemical parameters between sexes. A total of 15 <b>sloth</b> <b>bears</b> were immobilized using combination of ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine hydrochloride drugs at the dose rate of 5. 0 [*]milligram (mg) per kg body weight and 2. 0 [*]mg per kg body weight, respectively. The use of combination of these drugs was found satisfactory for the chemical immobilization of captive <b>sloth</b> <b>bears.</b> There were no significant differences observed in induction time and recovery time and physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and rectal temperature between sexes. Health related parameters comprising hematological values like packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell count (RBC), erythrocyte indices, and so forth and biochemical values like total protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline amino-transferase (ALT), aspartate amino-transferase (AST), and so forth were estimated in 11 (5 males and 6 females) apparently healthy bears. Comparison between sexes revealed significant difference in PCV (P< 0. 05) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (P< 0. 05).

25|$|In {{some areas}} of India and Burma, sloth bears are more feared than tigers, due to their {{unpredictable}} temperament. In Madhya Pradesh, <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> attacks accounted {{for the deaths of}} 48 people and the injuring of 686 others between the years 1989 and 1994, probably {{due in part to the}} density of population and competition for food sources. One specimen, known as the <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> of Mysore, was single-handedly responsible for the deaths of 12 people and the mutilation of 2 dozen others before being shot by Kenneth Anderson. Sloth bears defend themselves when surprised, with the majority of confrontations occurring at night. They typically charge on all fours with their head held low, before rearing on their hind legs and striking at their attackers with their claws and teeth.|$|E

25|$|Sloth bears {{may have}} reached their current {{form in the}} early Pleistocene, {{the time when the}} bear family {{specialized}} and dispersed. A fragment of fossilized humerus from the Pleistocene, found in Andhra Pradesh's Kurnool Basin is identical to the humerus of a modern <b>sloth</b> <b>bear.</b> The fossilized skulls of a bear once named Melursus theobaldi found in the Shivaliks from the early Pleistocene or early Pliocene are thought by certain authors to represent an intermediate stage between sloth bears and ancestral brown bears. M. theobaldi itself had teeth intermediate in size between sloth bears and other bear species, though its palate was {{the same size as the}} former species, leading to the theory that it is the sloth bear's direct ancestor. Sloth bears probably arose during the mid-Pliocene and evolved in the Indian subcontinent. The <b>sloth</b> <b>bear</b> shows evidence of having undergone a convergent evolution similar to that of other ant-eating mammals.|$|E
