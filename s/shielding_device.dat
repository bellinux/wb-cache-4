40|$|Abstract—A novel {{concentrator}} for static {{magnetic field}} enhancement is proposed and designed utilizing transformation optics. Compared with other devices for {{static magnetic field}} enhancement, our device has many good features: first, our concentrator can achieve a DC magnetic field enhancement in a relatively large free space with high uniformity. Secondly, our concentrator is composed by {{only one or two}} homogenous anisotropic materials with principal value greater than zero (without any infinitely large or zero value), which can be achieved by using currently available materials. Thirdly, the geometrical shape of the proposed device determines the enhancement factor and the permeability of the device. After choosing suitable geometrical parameters, we can obtain a concentration with a suitable enhancement factor and a material requirement that is easily achievable. The proposed concentrator will have many important applications in many areas (e. g., magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic sensors). Based on the same theoretical model, we also proposed a cascaded <b>shielding</b> <b>device</b> cloak for static magnetic fields. The proposed DC magnetic <b>shielding</b> <b>device</b> can be realized without using any material of zero permeability, and will have potential applications in, e. g., hiding a metallic object from being detected by a metal locator...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the radiation shield of radionuclide syringes and the personal dose equivalent by performing a simulation of radionuclides used in nuclear medicine diagnosis. In order to evaluate the dose depending on the distance between the radiation source and the ICRU sphere against the thickness of the <b>shielding</b> <b>device,</b> the distance at which a nuclear medicine worker may inadvertently come into contact with radiation from the radiation source was set at 0 cm to 30 cm according to the thickness of the shield, thus fixing the ICRU sphere.

40|$|Measurements of {{extremely}} low frequency electromagnetic fields and low frequency magnetic fields emitted {{by a set of}} video display terminal (VDT) units are reported. The field values measured at the position normally occupied by the user are below the safety limits.

Measurements with a commercial <b>shielding</b> <b>device</b> consisting of small plastic balls filled with a water solution of rare earth elements were also performed. The only physical mechanism that could be hypothesized to produce an active suppression of the VDT field is that rare earth atoms, which probably were chosen due to their large magnetic moment, behave as oscillating magnetic dipoles capable of emitting a secondary magnetic field that, along some particular directions, has a phase that is opposite to that of the exciting field.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{magnetic}} <b>shielding</b> <b>device</b> has been constructed for use in superconducting microelectronic applications where low ambient magnetic field is desirable. The shield was a specially designed superconducting thin film {{in the shape of}} a long cylindri- cal tube with a low pinning material in the central region and high flux pinning regions at the end. It was shown that magnetic flux perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder could be swept out of the interior of the shield by moving vortex-antivortex pairs to one side of the shield where they annihilate. The flux sweeping properties of the shield were found to work well in a small temperature window close to the transition temperature where the critical current for depinning vortices was less than the critical current for the forma- tion of hot spots. Once the vortices are swept out, the shield can be cooled to enhance the Meissner shielding effects against other stray fields.

40|$|Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) {{have been}} the {{detector}} of choice for imaging and spectroscopy in space missions for several decades, such as those being used for the Euclid VIS instrument and baselined for the SMILE SXI. Despite the many positive properties of CCDs, such as the high quantum efficiency and low noise, when used in a space environment the detectors suffer damage from the often-harsh radiation environment. High energy particles can create defects in the silicon lattice which act to trap the signal electrons being transferred through the device, reducing the signal measured and effectively increasing the noise. We can reduce the impact of radiation on the devices through four key methods: increased radiation <b>shielding,</b> <b>device</b> design considerations, optimisation of operating conditions, and image correction. Here, we concentrate on device design operations, investigating the impact of narrowing the charge-transfer channel in the device {{with the aim of}} minimising the impact of traps during readout. Previous studies for the Euclid VIS instrument considered two devices, the e 2 v CCD 204 and CCD 273, the serial register of the former having a 50 μm channel and the latter having a 20 μm channel. The reduction in channel width was previously modelled to give an approximate 1. 6 × reduction in charge storage volume, verified experimentally to have a reduction in charge transfer inefficiency of 1. 7 ×. The methods used to simulate the reduction approximated the charge cloud to a sharp-edged volume within which the probability of capture by traps was 100 %. For high signals and slow readout speeds, this is a reasonable approximation. However, for low signals and higher readout speeds, the approximation falls short. Here we discuss a new method of simulating and calculating charge storage variations with device design changes, considering the absolute probability of capture across the pixel, bringing validity to all signal sizes and readout speeds. Using this method, we can optimise the device design to suffer minimum impact from radiation damage effects, here using detector development for the SMILE mission to demonstrate the process...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the architectural integration of mobile external <b>shielding</b> <b>devices</b> with the building’s façade. In most cases these elements act as solar shading. For this reason, within the research, they are called by that name. The research mainly develops around the theme of environmental quality, strictly limited to the architectural integration of these mobile devices with the building’s façade. It concerns mainly the quality of open spaces but also of those internal. When we talk about environmental quality often it means an interest in microclimatic comfort. Recently the research tends to focus only on the energy aspects. These issues are left aside here, since the researches about energy-saving and microclimatic comfort sadly neglect some strategical aspects: {{in most cases the}} solar shading systems do not fall within an architectural design and also they may affect the appearance of places, from single side to the urban front, to the entire city. This research deals with all the main aspects of this area: history of architecture, manufacturing of solar shading systems, legislation, bibliography, software, technological and environmental design. The main goal of this research was to identify technological and architectural parameters for the choice of external dynamic <b>shielding</b> <b>devices.</b> These parameters must allow the integration of <b>shielding</b> <b>devices</b> with the building’s façade in connection with the culture and the traditions of the places. The ultimate goal of this research was to produce guidelines for architectural design and a user-friendly software. These instruments are addressed to the world of architectural design, manufacturing and sales of solar shading systems, but also to local authorities for the improvement of building regulations. Among the identified parameters the main are: color, type and dimension of the shading elements related to the buildings and their relationship with the context. On these basis, over one hundred case studies of contemporary international architecture have been analyzed. The data emerged from the analysis were developed in graphs and were compared across, producing scientific results under the form of stochastic analysis of the sample studied. The research has produced a system of guidelines dealing with the use of different façade types and different solar shading systems with specific color combinations and a software to quickly view these possible configurations...|$|R
40|$|Echinodermata is a {{group of}} marine non-chordate Deuterostomia with an unusual pentameric adult body plan. Photosensitivity within many species of {{echinoderms}} has been documented over the last 150 years but corresponding photoreceptor cells (PRCs) or organs in most cases remained enigmatic. Especially in the case of Echinoidea, which display a huge variety of photo elicited behaviors, no distinct PRC was ever identified. The genome sequencing of the echinoid Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and subsequent ex-pression analyses of genes known to be involved in PRC development and differentiation, provided the first time opportunity to investigate echinoid PRCs deploying a new molecu-lar approach. The aim {{of this study is to}} localize and characterize PRCs within echinoids and other echinoderms using a combined molecular and morphological approach. Protein and RNA localization of a rhabdomeric opsin (r-opsin), which comprises an essential component in phototransduction and which is expressed in S. purpuratus (Sp-opsin 4), led to the discovery of two disctinct PRC clusters in the tube feet of this echinoid. Using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy plus deployment of anti-Sp-Opsin 4 immunogold labeling, the PRC type could be classified as microvillar/ rhabdomeric. Antibody labelings against nervous system (NS) components demonstrated connection of the two echinoid tube foot PRC clusters to the animal's NS. The PRCs lack any associated shielding pigment, but one of the two PRC clusters is embedded in a depression of the echinoid's opaque skeleton that is hypothesized to act as a <b>shielding</b> <b>device</b> for these PRCs. Based on (i) a detailed examination of this skeletal depression deploying x-ray microtomography, (ii) immunoreaction of the echinoid specific r-opsin anti-body in asteroid optic cushions known to function in phototaxis, and (iii) onset of photo-taxis in S. purpuratus juveniles depending on complete skeletogenesis, a model of echi-noid vision is proposed, in which the animal functions as a huge “compound eye”. The skeleton shielding the PRCs arranged at the base of tube feet all around the echinoid body causes a limited illumination angle of each PRC cluster. Processing the different photic input of each PRC cluster thus enables the animal to detect the direction of in-coming light and perform phototaxis. This study provides first evidence of distinct PRCs in an echinoid and thus challenges the long proposed diffuse “dermal light sense” that was hypothesized to deploy unspecialized neurons of the echinoderm epidermal nerve net. The finding of r-opsins in tube feet PRCs of echinoids, asteroids and ophiuroids indicates homology of the r-opsin positive PRC type throughout these echinoderm groups. Asteroids and most certainly echinoids deploying a microvillar, r-opsin expressing PRC type for vision (phototaxis) as usually realized in protostomes thus contrast to most other deuterostomes in which visional functions are based on ciliary, c-opsin expressing PRCs. The findings of this study thus suggest that the functional shift from rhabdomeric to ciliary PRC systems might have happened as late as in the chordate stemline...|$|E
