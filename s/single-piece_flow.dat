50|$|An {{important}} aspect of financial control is the evaluation of inventory. Lean manufacturing always leads to substantial inventory reductions. When inventories are low and under good control (using pull systems, <b>single-piece</b> <b>flow,</b> supplier partnerships, etc.), the valuation of inventory becomes much less complex. Lean Accounting contains a number of methods for valuing inventory that are simple, accurate, and often visual. Several of these methods do not require any computer-based inventory tracking at all.|$|E
50|$|The {{paradigm}} aim is {{to achieve}} <b>single-piece</b> <b>flow</b> where a single discrete unit of product flows from process to process. In effect, the batch quantity is one. If there is no change in part or product model, then this objective needs to be balanced against the additional handling time, and the work-centres that perform the process will typically have to be arranged {{in close proximity to}} one another in a flow-line. This is often a characteristic of Repetitive-flow manufacturing and most manual assembly work is performed this way in the modern factory.|$|E
40|$|In the {{traditional}} batch mode or assembly line manufacturing process, {{the layout of}} shop floor is done according to the activities. Not so in the lean manufacturing system, where manufacturing cell is designed to process parts of the product in separate fixed areas, thus eliminating non value-added activities. Ultimately, the layout creates a <b>single-piece</b> <b>flow.</b> The Lean Manufacturing reduces the order flow time, work-in-progress, material handling cost, and so on, thus elevating customer satisfaction and profits...|$|E
50|$|Even Toyota hasn't {{reached the}} final stage in this journey, <b>single-piece</b> <b>flows,</b> across all of their processes; indeed they {{recommend}} following their journey {{rather than trying to}} jump into an intermediate stage. The reason Toyota advocate this is that each production stage is accompanied by adjustments and adaptations to support services to production; if those services are not given these adaptation steps then major issues can arise.|$|R
30|$|At {{fourth stage}} of UNIDO–ACMA Model, {{inventory}} management {{is very important}} aspect of any business. High inventory blocks the most important resource, i.e., fund. Minimum inventory or high inventory turn ratio (ITR) is desirable to improved cash flow in the business. Cost-effective inventory management is possible through application of use of red tags, quick change over, i.e., single-minute exchange of dies (SMED), small batch size, <b>single-piece</b> <b>flow</b> and containerization. This will help in minimizing the working capital to run the business.|$|E
30|$|Focused factory {{attempts}} {{to reduce the}} complexities of the manufacturing process. This may include any or all of the following: simplifying the organizational structure, reducing the numbers of products or processes, and minimizing {{the complexities of the}} physical constraints (White et al. 2010). The fundamental idea of Group Technology is to subsume items (e.g., parts, processes, equipment or tools) into families according to their similarity and to take advantage of these groups in order to increase productivity in manufacturing (Bohnen et al. 2011; Shunk 1985). Production smoothing is very critical to make pull production work. More specifically, different variants of a model produced on a shared production line should be distributed over the sequence as evenly as possible (Yavuz 2013). Reduction in batch size and creating the balanced <b>single-piece</b> <b>flow</b> of the items in entire system are the objectives of production smoothing.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{for this project}} was to help expand the {{existing}} capability of Sikorsky's main rotor blade business from raw material (titanium) through final assembly. The project helped to facilitate the ongoing lean transformation as the factory makes the journey to <b>single-piece</b> <b>flow.</b> During the internship, monthly kaizen events were used to help focus efforts on {{different areas of the}} value stream. These activities resulted in changes in the following areas: decrease in cycle times and lead times, reduction in inventory, procedural changes, and a future plan to physically change the factory floor to improve flow. by Casey J.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} modern surface {{hardening}} technology is obtaining reproducible, precisely planned {{parameters of the}} carburized layer, minimizing the negative phenomena that result in dimensional changes after hardening and {{making it possible to}} determine the nature and magnitude of these changes. This concerns mainly the concept of <b>single-piece</b> <b>flow</b> in heat treatment applied for the purposes of mass production, employing a special autonomous 4 D Quenching chamber for high pressure gas quenching (HPGQ). The main components of the 4 D Quenching chamber include a system of cooling nozzles surrounding the processed item and providing a uniform inflow of cooling gas from all directions (3 D) and a table rotating together with the item processed, contributing to uniform cooling (4 D). Within the framework of this paper there was studied the impact of gear wheel quenching in a 4 D Quenching chamber using nitrogen at pressure of 6 and 10 bar on changes in geometry. Geometric measurements of facewidth of gear, hole diameter and outside diameter were performed before and after carburization and quenching. The results obtained allowed us to determine the impact of quenching pressure inside a 4 D Quenching chamber on dimensional changes in gear wheels analyzed. The thermo-chemical treatment resulted in a decrease in outside diameters and hole diameters measured and an increase in facewidth of gears...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study a production line and apply Lean principles and tools to resolve quality problems and improve productivity. The production line selected for the study is the medium voltage line in ABB Group's Medium Voltage Products facility located in Pinetops, North Carolina. The production line was unable to achieve the desired production rate due to several reasons, including flow, work methods, constraints, rework, scrap, inventory, and storage arrangement.   One of the major improvements made during the project was to study the production flow data and balance the assembly process. After balancing the assembly line, <b>single-piece</b> <b>flow</b> was implemented to increase efficiency. Other major improvements made were to the Hydrophobic Cycloaliphatic Epoxy casting process and the winding process by reducing changeover times, and reducing worker idle times. Some of the Lean techniques that were used during the project were: value stream mapping, process flow diagrams, standardizing work procedures, 5 S, and visual management. These techniques were used to reduce and eliminate all waste surrounding the process. A key aspect {{of the study was to}} document all phases of the project and challenges faced during the implementation. This was done so that other companies with similar operations will benefit from the data and knowledge gained throughout the life of the project.   There is a supplement file that contains an enlarged version of the following diagrams: Current State Map, Current State Map with Kaizen Improvements, Future State Map, and Brainstorming Cloud.   M.
