40|$|A {{missense}} mutation in the gene coding for the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel, GIRK 2, {{is responsible for}} apoptosis in the external germinal layer (EGL) of the cerebellum and a nonapoptotic death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the weaver (wv) mouse. Failure of axonogenesis and <b>migration</b> are considered <b>to</b> be the primary consequences of GIRK 2 channel malfunction in the cerebellum. We investigated whether a disruption of the cell cycle precedes the failure of migration and axonogenesis and leads to massive apoptosis. To this end, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for PCNA, Cdk 4, cyclin D, cyclin A, and the Cdk inhibitor p 27 /kip 1, {{as well as in}} situ end-labeling for apoptotic DNA fragmentation, were applied to cerebella of P 7 -P 21 +/+, wv/+, and wv/wv mice. In +/+ and wv/+ mice, the expression of cell cycle proteins was limited to the outer, premigratory zone of the EGL. Antibodies to p 27, a marker of cell differentiation, gave a reverse <b>staining</b> pattern. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>migration</b> delay, patches of p 27 -positive cells persisted in the outer EGL in P 21 wv/+ mice. On the contrary, marked cell cycle up-regulation and absence of p 27 occurred throughout the EGL at all ages in wv/wv mice, indicating an inability to switch off the cell cycle. Mitotic index evaluation showed that cell cycle activation was unrelated to proliferative events. Cell cycle proteins were not expressed in the substantia nigra, suggesting that nonapoptotic death of mature dopaminergic neurons is not preceded by abortive cell cycle re-entry. Our data show that abnormalities of the cell cycle in wv/wv cerebellum represent a major and early consequence of GIRK 2 channel malfunction and may strongly influence the susceptibility of EGL cells to apoptosis. These observations may help in understanding the pathogenesis of human neurological channelopathies...|$|R

30|$|In 2010, {{a single}} semi-structured {{interview}} {{was conducted with}} the managing head of household {{of the majority of}} families in our study (n[*]=[*] 27) to evaluate decision-making and herding strategies among families (some families were unavailable during this time <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>migration).</b> We recognize that missing some families <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>migration</b> may introduce bias into our results for this survey. However, it is extremely common in the pastoralist literature to find missing data points in some analyses <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>migration,</b> loss of follow-up, and subject refusal to participate, among other reasons. Furthermore, the requirements set by the Institutional Review Board on the treatment of ethical subjects requires researchers to exclude any data from subjects who do not give their permission to participate in a particular assessment, measurement, or questionnaire. Therefore, it is possible that all research on human subjects includes some bias if ethical principles and rules of conduct are respected accordingly.|$|R
