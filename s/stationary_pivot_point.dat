40|$|We {{discovered}} motion during {{application of}} AC voltage (0. 8 V peak amplitude, f= 1 kHz) {{on the surface}} of the isolated mouse tectorial membrane (TM). The TM's motion response, which contained an average peak amplitude of 4 nm (in 5 TM preparations) was measured using a novel atomic force sensing (AFS) technique (Rousso et al, 1997). A 2 -D lateral mapping of motion at several points on the TM surface shows that the TM expands near the negative electrode and contracts near the positive electrode with a <b>stationary</b> <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> between the two electrodes. Lowering the pH in the bath surrounding the TM from 7. 3 to 4. 07 decreased the maximum amplitude of displacement from 4 nm to approximately 2. 5 nm while lowering the bath pH from 4. 07 to 3. 96 caused the TM to undergo a [pi] phase shift in its motion response. Based on this data, the TM has an isoelectric point and pKa near pH 4. 011. This supports the model that the TM motion response is altered by the state of ionization of charge groups in the TM, which varies with bath pH. by Roozbeh Ghaffari. Thesis (M. Eng.)

2500|$|An {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a pendulum}} {{that has its}} center of mass above its <b>pivot</b> <b>point.</b> It is often implemented with the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> mounted on a cart that can move horizontally and may be called a cart and pole {{as shown in the}} photo. Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 degree of freedom by affixing the pole to an axis of rotation. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a torque at the <b>pivot</b> <b>point,</b> by moving the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> horizontally as part of a feedback system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> in a feedback system is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger. [...] The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.|$|R

50|$|Price {{support and}} {{resistance}} levels are key trading tools in any market.

In <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> analysis, several levels, usually three, are commonly recognized below and above the <b>pivot</b> <b>point.</b> These are calculated from the range of price movement in the previous trading period, added to the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> for resistances and subtracted from it for support levels.|$|R

50|$|The upper <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> of {{the central}} {{supporting}} column is prevented from moving left/ right and front/ back by the fulcrum itself; it is prevented from moving up/ down by gravitational pull. The lower <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> of this column must be held in place so that it cannot sway left/ right and, to a lesser extent, front/ back as the arms move, but it experiences no up/ down movement forces— in this arrangement, the entire pivot process takes place on the upper central <b>pivot</b> <b>point,</b> which acts as the single fulcrum for the entire balance; {{it is possible to}} reverse this, so that the lower <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> acts as the fulcrum and the upper is only held in place so that it cannot sway left/ right or front/back.|$|R
40|$|Cantilever {{sheet pile}} walls are used {{routinely}} to retain medium heights of earth in geotechnical practice. Earth pressures developed {{on either side}} of the sheet pile wall ensure its moment and force equilibrium. Cantilever sheet pile walls suffer rotation about a <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> close to the base and generate passive and active earth pressures. Earlier methods to determine the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> either use iterative procedures or rely on centrifuge data or finite element analyses.

Consideration of moment equilibrium is sufficient to determine the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> and force equilibrium is automatically satisfied. The location of the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> obtained by this approach compared satisfactorily with the centrifuge and laboratory test data.
