60|$|One evening, {{after a day}} of bitter-sweet reveries of Jessie, Lemuel went to see Statira. She and 'Manda Grier {{were both}} very gay, and made him very welcome.

He could not help laughing at them; they were really very funny; but he felt somehow that it was all a preparation for something else. At last the two girls made a set at him, as 'Manda Grier called it, and tried to talk him into their old scheme of going to wait on table at <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> hotels, or the seaside.

60|$|We {{found the}} place full of cattle and provisions; but whether we might venture {{to take them}} where we could find them or not, we did not know; and though we were under a {{necessity}} to get provisions, yet we were loth to bring down a whole nation of devils upon us at once, and therefore some of our company agreed to try to speak with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> if we could, that we might see what course was to be taken with them. Eleven of our men went on this errand, well armed and furnished for defence. They brought word that they had {{seen some of the}} natives, who appeared very civil to them, but very shy and afraid, seeing their guns, for it was easy to perceive that the natives knew what their guns were, and what use they were of.|$|E
60|$|In {{the museums}} {{you will find}} acres of the most strange and {{fascinating}} things; but all museums are fascinating, and they do so tire your eyes, and break your back, and burn out your vitalities with their consuming interest. You always say you will never go again, but you do go. The palaces of the rich, in Melbourne, are much like the palaces of the rich in America, and the life in them is the same; but there the resemblance ends. The grounds surrounding the American palace are not often large, and not often beautiful, but in the Melbourne case the grounds are often ducally spacious, and the climate and the gardeners together make them as beautiful as a dream. It is said that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> seats have grounds--domains--about them which rival in charm and magnitude those which surround the country mansion of an English lord; but I was not out in the country; I had my hands full in town.|$|E

60|$|We {{stayed here}} till the {{beginning}} of May, when we were told the Chinese traders would set forward; for the northern monsoons end about the latter end of March or beginning of April; {{so that they are}} sure of fair winds home.

In these three vessels we took, in short, such a quantity of cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, and mace, besides silver, that our men began to be of my opinion,--that we were rich enough; and, in short, we had nothing to do now but to consider by what methods to secure the immense treasure we had got.|$|E

An old man inhabited it, whom nobody knew, and whose family appeared to be only a daughter and a female servant. He and his companions, he added, lived up among the neighbouring hills; and as they had been about at night, they had often seen strange lights, and heard strange sounds from the tower. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> people, who worked in the vineyards among the hills, believed the old man to be one that dealt in the black art, and were not over-fond of passing near the tower at night; [...] "but for our parts," [...] said the Gitano, [...] "we are not a people that trouble ourselves much with fears of that kind." ...|$|E

We are simply idling our time in Bergen op Zoom, {{and not one of}} us but is longing to be at home to bear his part in the events pending there. It is hard, indeed, to be confined in this miserable Dutch town while England is in danger. Unfortunately we are soldiers and must obey orders; but as you are as yet only volunteers, free to act as you choose, it would be foolish in the extreme for you to come over to this dull place while there is so much going on in England.
