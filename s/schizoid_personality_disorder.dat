50|$|Psychopathology in {{non-human}} primates {{has been}} studied since the mid-20th century. Over 20 behavioral patterns in captive chimpanzees have been documented as (statistically) abnormal for frequency, severity or oddness—some of which have also been observed in the wild. Captive great apes show gross behavioral abnormalities such as stereotypy of movements, self-mutilation, disturbed emotional reactions (mainly fear or aggression) towards companions, lack of species-typical communications, and generalized learned helplessness. In some cases such behaviors are hypothesized to be equivalent to symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in humans such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder.

500|$|Though Green {{has granted}} no {{interviews}} regarding her mental state, {{a number of}} sources have attempted to classify her pathology, if any, and her motivation for committing the crimes of which she was convicted. During Green's sentencing hearing, Marilyn Hutchinson, a psychologist hired by the defense, testified about Green's mental state and capabilities. She characterized Green as cognitively competent and capable of controlling her emotion at a basic level, but noted that Green appeared to be lacking in emotion beyond the level of basic competence. Green was prone to monosyllabic answers during her interview with Hutchinson, and described herself as [...] "tuning out" [...] to avoid excessive emotion. Hutchinson described an affidavit from the doctor who had treated Green during her commitment to the Menninger Clinic, which reported that she had been admitted on the basis of having either major or bipolar depression. Evaluations at the Clinic showed Green to be minimally able to cope with the world, and her treating physician reported that Green had been found to have the emotional capabilities of [...] "a very young child", pursuant to unspecified [...] "life experiences" [...] she had undergone as a preadolescent. Hutchinson's diagnosis for Green was <b>schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder.</b> Hutchinson's opinion was that Green's intelligence had generally allowed her to compensate for her limited emotional ability in day-to-day life, but that the external stressors of her impending divorce and the interpersonal conflict between Michael and Tim Farrar had overwhelmed her ability to compensate.

5000|$|The Five-Factor {{model was}} first {{extended}} to <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> {{in the early}} 1990s, when it was established that a satisfactory profile of each <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> in the DSM-III-R could be created through various levels of Big Five traits. Thomas Widiger {{and his colleagues have}} demonstrated that many of the central elements of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> can be explained in terms of Big Five traits - for example, borderline <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> is characterized by high levels of hostility, trait anxiety and depression, and vulnerability, all of which are facets of neuroticism. [...] This approach also helps to differentiate characteristics of disorders that overlap under the current categorical model, such as avoidant and <b>schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> The Five-Factor-based approach explains much of that overlap as well as {{the ways in which they}} are different. For example, both are characterized primarily by maladaptive excessive introversion, but antisocial <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> also includes high levels of facets of neuroticism (such as self-consciousness, anxiety, and vulnerability), while schizotypal <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> includes the addition of low assertiveness. The Five-Factor approach also resolves previous anomalies in factor analyses of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders,</b> which makes it a more explanatory model than the current categorical approach, which only includes three factors (odd-eccentric, dramatic-emotional, and anxious-fearful).|$|R

40|$|This article studies {{recalled}} parental bonding, adult attachment style, and <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> {{in child}} molesters and {{reports on the}} findings of two separate studies. The first study examines differences between a group of 84 child molesters and 80 matched normal control subjects. This study found that the antisocial and the <b>schizoid</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> are typical for the molester group, and that at an interpersonal level this group can be typified by recollections of an uncaring father and mother, recollections of an elevated level of autonomy emanating from the father, and insecure current attachment patterns. The second study compares a subgroup of personality-disordered child molesters to a subgroup without <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> This study revealed that recollections {{of the role of the}} father in parenting are decisive. The personality-disordered group reports that the father was both more uncaring and granted more autonomy. Regarding current adult attachment style, an avoidant and anxious-ambivalent attachment style characterised the disordered subgroup. We argue that the results can be useful for treatment. Since recalled parental experiences play a role in the development of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> and child molestation, psychotherapists should integrate interpersonal tools into treatment, especially in therapeutic work with child molesters who received less parental sensitivity and suffer from <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Since the 2000 there has been significant progress in our understanding of the early presentations, assessment, suspected neuropathology, and treatment of these disorders. Recent technological breakthroughs in basic sciences hold promise for advancing our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This collective monograph reviwers recent researches regarding the origins, onset, course, and outcome of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In particular, this book will be illustrate new developments in terms of conceptual models, and research methodology, genetics and genomics, brain imaging and neurochemical studies, neurophysiology and information processing in schizophrenia spectrum disorders patients. Also will be highlighted new developments in our understanding of the childhood psychosis, prodromal and first-episode states, in treatment and rehabilitation. Thus, the purpose of this book is to provide up-to-date overview of the rapid advances made in the clinical and basic science studies supporting our understanding of the relationship between cerebral processes and clinical, cognitive and other presentations of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In addition, this book aims to monitor important research developments, which may be relevant to treatment, and rehabilitation of patients. ...|$|R
40|$|Context: Imprisoned {{people are}} very much {{vulnerable}} to develop mental health problems. Some prisoners develop mental health problem before detainment and some develops after detainment. Aim: Present study assessed psychiatric morbidity in under trial prisoners. Materials and Methods: Based on purposive sampling technique, thirty three under trail inmates were selected from psychiatric inmate ward of RINPAS, Ranchi, India. Thirty three normal participants were selected from the general population. Both the groups were matched on age, gender, education, occupation, marital status and residence. All participants were assessed on MCMI-III. Results and Conclusions: Obtained responses were scored by using standard scoring procedure and subsequently statistically analyzed by using χ 2 test. Result discovered that under trial inmates group had more psychiatric morbidity, pathological <b>personality</b> traits and <b>disorders</b> in comparison to their normal counterparts. The most widespread psychiatric disorder among under trial inmates group was anxiety disorder, followed by alcohol dependence, drug dependence, major depression, delusional disorder, dysthymic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, thought disorder and bipolar manic disorder.
