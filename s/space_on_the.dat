5|$|Doppler {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of <b>space.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.|$|E

5|$|In 1824 the Supreme Court {{relocated}} to Indianapolis {{with the rest}} of the state's government. Initially the Court shared <b>space</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second floor of the Marion County Courthouse, before moving to the third Indiana Statehouse. In 1865 the Court was given its own building on lot number one in Indianapolis, where it remained until 1888, moving to its present location in the fifth Indiana Statehouse. As of 2012 the Court occupies the entire north wing of the third floor of the Indiana Statehouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Chinese {{businesses}} began relocating {{from the}} Loop to Chicago's South Side. Starting this trend, the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association appealed to deed-holder and former Illinois State's Attorney Jacob J. Kern to hire architect H. J. Swanson {{to design a}} building large enough to house 15stores, 30apartments and office <b>space</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 200 block of West 22nd Street (now Cermak Road). Built in 1912 for $200,000, the building's design {{was typical of the}} period; however, it featured white tile trim adorned with Chinese dragons and a third floor balcony. The Association relocated to the building's third floor by 1914.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} {{physical}} dividers between the sites occupied by individual oligonucleotides, {{a very limited}} <b>space</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of the microarray (one oligonucleotide sequence occupies a square 25×25μm) and the requirement of high fidelity of oligonucleotide synthesis dictate the use of site-selective 5'-deprotection techniques. In one approach, {{the removal of the}} 5'-O-DMT group is effected by electrochemical generation of the acid at the required site(s). Another approach uses 5'-O-(α-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl) (MeNPOC) protecting group, which can be removed by irradiation with UV light of 365nm wavelength.|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of an experimental program to study {{the possibility of using}} a silicon crystal for X-ray detection in the diagnostic energy range (10 - 100 keV), the authors present the first experimental results obtained with a silicon detector (300 mu m thick, 1. 4 * 1. 4 cm 2 surface) with microstrips deposited on each side: 25 mu m <b>spacing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> junction side and 50 mu m <b>spacing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ohmic side: 25 mu m <b>spacing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> junction side and 50 mu m <b>spacing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ohmic side; the read-out pitch is 100 mu m for both sides. Energy and spatial resolutions have been measured by means of collimated radioactive sources: 241 Am (E gamma = 60 keV) and 109 Cd (E gamma = 24 and 88 keV). A very good linearity in the response to the photon energy has been measured.
