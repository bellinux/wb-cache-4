5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I <b>synthesizer.</b> The Genetic Design had developed their <b>synthesizer</b> from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase sequencer into the semi-automated <b>synthesizer.</b> The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E
5|$|Industrial metal is {{the fusion}} of heavy metal music and {{industrial}} music, typically employing repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, <b>synthesizer</b> or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals. Founding industrial metal acts include Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM, and Rammstein.|$|E

5|$|Musically, {{the group}} builds upon {{the style of}} Russian bard music, which {{features}} strong vocals with a guitar accompaniment. The music mixes these more traditional instruments with an accordion, <b>synthesizer,</b> and drums.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage {{is divided}} into three sound groups, the Organ Section, the Piano Section, and the <b>Synthesizer</b> Section. Each section can be played {{independently}} or simultaneously, divided into specific key ranges (splitting), and blended with independent volume controls.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and <b>synthesizer</b> instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a <b>synthesizer</b> being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E

5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually sinusoidal. NCOs are often {{used in conjunction with}} a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital <b>synthesizer</b> (DDS).|$|E
5|$|A revised edition, the Nord Stage 2 {{appeared}} in September 2011, containing an improved <b>synthesizer</b> model and sampler functionality, {{as seen in}} the Nord Wave. The three models of the Stage 2 are the HA-88, containing 88 fully weighted keys, the HA-76, containing 76 weighted keys, and the SW-73, containing 73 semi-weighted keys. An updated model, the Stage 2 EX, with extended memory capacity, was announced in 2015.|$|E

The goal of the Nord Stage was to combine these two technologies together into a flagship instrument.|$|E
5|$|Editors are an English rock band, {{formed in}} 2002 in Birmingham.

5|$|Ghosts I–IV {{features}} a wide assortment of musical instruments, including piano, guitar, bass, <b>synthesizer,</b> marimba, tambourine, banjo, dulcimer, and xylophone, {{many of which}} were sampled and distorted electronically.

5|$|Spurious {{products}} {{are the result}} of harmonic or non-harmonic distortion {{in the creation of the}} output waveform due to non-linear numerical effects in the signal processing chain.
