This study investigated the lived experiences of 10 school counselors who integrate yoga into a comprehensive <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>program.</b> Through data analysis, five significant themes and subsequent subthemes emerged: 1) intentionality (personal experiences with yoga impacts professional intentions, yoga intentionally tied with comprehensive <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> goal); 2) yoga integration (organic commonalities between <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> and yoga, methods of yoga delivery, overlap of yoga philosophies and ASCA Mindsets 2 ̆ 6 Behaviors standards); 3) logistics of yoga integration (accessibility of yoga, managing yoga myths and stereotypes, program supports); 4) perception of yoga impact, (overall impact on school, impact on student, examples of students taking yoga “off the mat”); and 5) impact of yoga integration on school counselor (yoga as a self-care strategy, yoga is a meaningful aspect of school counselor role). Findings from this study suggest that yoga is a viable and valuable tool to include in a comprehensive <b>school</b> <b>counseling</b> <b>program.</b> Moreover, as the yoga in schools movement continues to grow, school counselors should be regarded as essential stakeholders in the development, implementation, and evaluation process.
