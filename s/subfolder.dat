25|$|Another notable System 7 {{feature is}} {{built-in}} cooperative multitasking. In System Software 6, this function was optional through the MultiFinder. System 7 also introduced aliases, similar to symbolic links on Unix, shortcuts that {{were introduced in}} later versions of Microsoft Windows, and shadows in IBM OS/2. System extensions were enhanced by being moved to their own subfolder; a <b>subfolder</b> in the System Folder was also created for the control panels. In System 7.5, Apple includes the Extensions Manager, a previously third-party program which simplified the process of enabling and disabling extensions.|$|E
25|$|When moving or copying files, Windows Explorer {{displays}} the full source and destination path, size {{and number of}} items and the transfer speed in megabytes per second (MB/s). If a conflict or error is encountered, it does not terminate the copy, move or delete operation. Rather, the file is skipped {{and the rest of}} the files processed. At the end of the operation, the errors are presented to the user with resolution options (if available). If two files have the same name, an option is available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the only options were to either replace the destination file or cancel the process. The user can also choose to apply the same action to further conflicts, if any. Also, for the first time in Windows, processing of dates when moving trees is somewhat consistent. Until now, every folder and <b>subfolder</b> obtained all three dates new to the time of operation. This was from the own nature of the operation at the file system level, create destination folders, move files, delete origin folders. Moved folders in Vista preserve creation and modification dates. Access date gets the time of the operation.|$|E
2500|$|The Apple menu, home only to desk {{accessories}} in System 6, {{was made}} more general-purpose: the user could now make often-used folders and applications—or anything else they desired—appear in the menu by placing aliases {{to them in}} an [...] "Apple Menu Items" [...] <b>subfolder</b> of the System Folder. System 7 also introduced the following: AppleScript, a scripting language for automating tasks; 32-bit QuickDraw, supporting so-called [...] "true color" [...] imaging, previously available as a system extension; and TrueType, an outline font standard.|$|E
5000|$|Until Windows XP, it {{contained}} other <b>subfolders</b> such as [...] "My Pictures", [...] "My Music" [...] and [...] "My Videos". Starting with Windows Vista, these <b>subfolders</b> were {{moved out of}} My Documents and were made its siblings.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} of Synchronize It! {{is to compare}} two folders - a source folder and a target folder. You can choose whether <b>subfolders</b> should be included (allowing exclusion of specific <b>subfolders),</b> whether only matching folders should be compared and you can apply file filters. Various actions and comparison modes are available (see below). Custom sessions can be saved and organized into projects.|$|R
2500|$|Windows Explorer, {{which has}} been renamed File Explorer, now {{includes}} a ribbon {{in place of the}} command bar. File operation dialog boxes have been updated to provide more detailed statistics, the ability to pause file transfers, and improvements in the ability to manage conflicts when copying files. A new [...] "File History" [...] function allows incremental revisions of files to be backed up to and restored from a secondary storage device, while Storage Spaces allows users to combine different sized hard disks into virtual drives and specify mirroring, parity, or no redundancy on a folder-by-folder basis. For easier management of files and folders, Windows 8 introduces the ability to move selected files or folders via drag and drop from a parent folder into a <b>subfolder</b> listed within the breadcrumb hierarchy of the address bar in File Explorer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{address bar}} has been {{modified}} {{to present a}} breadcrumbs view, which shows the full path to the current location. Clicking any location in the path hierarchy takes the user to that level, instead of repeatedly pressing the Back button or pressing the up button. This is roughly analogous to what is possible prior to Windows Vista by pressing the small down-arrow next to [...] "Back" [...] and selecting any folder {{from a list of}} previously accessed folders. It makes the [...] "Up One Level" [...] button obsolete so that is removed. It is also possible to navigate to any <b>subfolder</b> of the current folder using the arrow {{to the right of the}} last item, or to click in the space to the right of this to copy or edit the path manually. As with many other Microsoft-made Windows Vista applications, the menu bar is hidden by default. Pressing the Alt key makes the menu bar appear. Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars. Check boxes allow the selection of multiple files. When items are grouped, clicking the group header selects all items under that group. Multiple groups of files can also be selected by clicking the group headers while holding down Ctrl.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{computers}} organize files into hierarchies using folders, directories, or catalogs. The {{concept is}} the same irrespective of the terminology used. Each folder can contain an arbitrary number of files, and it can also contain other folders. These other folders {{are referred to as}} <b>subfolders.</b> <b>Subfolders</b> can contain still more files and folders and so on, thus building a tree-like structure in which one [...] "master folder" [...] (or [...] "root folder" [...] — the name varies from one operating system to another) can contain any number of levels of other folders and files. Folders can be named just as files can (except for the root folder, which often does not have a name). The use of folders makes it easier to organize files in a logical way.|$|R
50|$|AutoPlay's {{content search}} system will not scan the folders listed, nor their subfolders. IgnoreContentPaths takes {{precedence}} over ExclusiveContentPaths so if a path given in a &#91;IgnoreContentPaths&#93; section is a <b>subfolder</b> of a path given in an &#91;ExclusiveContentPaths&#93; section it is still ignored.|$|E

50|$|On Windows NT systems, each user's {{settings}} {{are stored in}} their own files called NTUSER.DAT and USRCLASS.DAT inside their own Documents and Settings <b>subfolder</b> (or their own Users sub folder in Windows Vista and above). Settings in this hive follow users with a roaming profile from machine to machine.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{change in}} Vista {{is that the}} media-specific [...] "My Pictures" [...] and [...] "My Music" [...] folders are now outside of the [...] "My Documents" [...] folder, instead of being <b>subfolders</b> (as well as {{removing}} the [...] "My" [...] Prefix - so My Documents becomes Documents, for example).|$|R
50|$|WRP also protects several {{critical}} folders. A folder containing only WRP-protected files may {{be locked}} {{so that only}} the trusted installer is able to create files or <b>subfolders</b> in the folder. A folder may be partially locked to enable administrators to create files and <b>subfolders</b> in the folder. Essential registry keys installed by Windows Vista are also protected. If a key is protected by WRP, all its sub-keys and values can be protected. Also, WRP copies only those files that are needed to restart Windows to the cache directory located at %WinDir%\WinSxS\Backup. Critical files that are not needed to restart Windows are not copied to the cache directory, unlike Windows File Protection which cached the entire set of protected file types in the Dllcache folder. The size of the cache directory and the list of files copied to cache cannot be modified.|$|R
5000|$|To a host {{computer}} the Cybook {{functions as a}} typical USB mass storage device. The user can categorize your books into folders and <b>subfolders</b> for easy access.
