40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the association between motor and <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairment,</b> to establish the relation to age, hemiplegic side, gender and emotion in ischemic stroke and to determine the factors, influences the recovery of the upper extremity functions in the hemiplegic patients. A total of 112 hemiplegic patients with the condition that at least 6 months were left from the onset of the stroke were assessed. Sensorial and motor functions of the upper extremity were examined by using the Fugl-Meyer (FM) Upper Extremity Performance Test, sensorial function test and the Motricity Index. FM motor and sensorial scores were correlated significantly with Motricity index (p< 0. 05). Motor and <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairment</b> were not related with age, hemiplegic side, but there were significantly correlations between the FM (motor-sensorial), Motricity index and emotional status (p< 0. 05). The patients, whose emotional status was good, had higher scores in the sensorimotor function tests and there was a significant difference between the groups (p< 0. 05). It was concluded that the age, hemiplegic side and emotional status are important factors that effects the recovery of the upper extremity in hemiplegic patients...|$|E
40|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} represents {{the most frequent}} chronic compressive neuropathy in man and hence may be investigated as a spontaneous model of peripheral nerve damage and repair. In the present report the fate of nerve fibers in the digital skin after long-lasting median nerve compression has been investigated immunohistochemically in comparison to normal digital skin, with special consideration to sensory endings and encapsulated receptors. The presence has been documented of the neurospecific marker PGP 9. 5, the glia-associated protein S- 100, and the neuropeptides CGRP and CPON which are mainly associated with the sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers respectively. The morphology and distribution of nerve fibers and corpuscles appeared {{comparable to that of}} normal digital skin; a reduction in the density of sensory receptors has, however, been observed, although not to the degree that was expected to explain the clinical deficits. It has been also demonstrated that {{at least part of the}} CGRP-containing sensory and CPON-containing sympathetic axons may survive unaltered even in patients with a long clinical history of profound <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairment.</b> An apparent discrepancy between the maintenance of nerve fibers and the sensory disturbances and the frequent observation of prompt postoperative recovery even after years of compression results from this investigation. The correlation of immunohistochemical observations and functional scores may not be considered conclusive. It must, however, be discussed if the <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairment</b> in this syndrome might have, at least in some cases, not only an anatomical but also an electrophysiological basis...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{spinal cord}} injury in {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} type IVA after cervical decompression Morquio A syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man # 253000) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulfatase encoded by the GALNS gene. Key clinical features are skeletal dysplasia and short stature. A 17 -year-old boy with Morquio A syndrome had slowly progressive signs of spinal cord compression at C 1 to C 3. His examination showed Medical Research Council grade 3 in the upper and 2 in the lower limbs, hyperactive reflexes without clonus or Babinski sign, and no <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairment.</b> After occipitocervical fixation in the prone position, he developed acute paraplegia, sensory losses below T 3, and striking MRI abnor-malities (figures 1 and 2).

40|$|Introduction: There are {{widespread}} concerns {{around the}} accessibility of mainstream technology which remains underdeveloped {{for the needs of}} many older people 1. The Mainstreaming on Ambient Intelligence (MonAMI) project 2, funded under the EU FP 6 framework in the area of e-Inclusion, developed an open technology platform and series of ‘telecare’ services designed to be accessed using mainstreamed devices (e. g. mobile telephones, personal computers). A field trial was conducted to evaluate the technology in the homes of disabled older people in three communities across Europe. Aims: The primary aim of the MonAMI trial was to evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the services in terms of whether they enable older people with needs to live independently and maintain a good quality of life. The secondary aim was to validate the technical and economic feasibility of delivering telecare services, using an open platform, in living community contexts. Methods: The MonAMI system was evaluated in a three-month field trial in the cities of Kosice (Slovakia), Stockholm (Sweden) and Zaragoza (Spain). Trial participants (users) included people over 65 years, with a varying range of physical, cognitive and <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairments.</b> In each of the users’ homes a bouquet of alert, home monitoring and home control services were installed and configured to users’ individual needs and lifestyle. Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were held at baseline and at post-trial follow-up, collecting data on users’ level of independence, health and wellbeing status, social networking, perceptions of safety, and acceptance of the services. Significance tests and regression analyses were performed to measure the impact of the services on users’ quality of life. Results: Sixty-eight users were recruited to the trial. The mean age was 78 years, 74...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Representative {{national}} data on disability {{are becoming increasingly}} important in helping policymakers decide on public health strategies. We assessed the respective contribution of chronic health conditions to disability for three age groups (18 - 40, 40 - 65, and > 65 years old) {{using data from the}} 2008 - 2009 Disability-Health Survey in France. METHODS: Data on 12 chronic conditions and on disability for 24, 682 adults living in households were extracted from the Disability-Health Survey results. A weighting factor was applied to obtain representative estimates for the French population. Disability was defined as at least one restriction in activities of daily living (ADL), severe disability as the inability to perform at least one ADL alone, and self-reported disability as a general feeling of being disabled. To account for co-morbidities, we assessed the contribution of each chronic disorder to disability by using the average attributable fraction (AAF). FINDINGS: We estimated that 38. 8 million people in France (81. 7 % [95 % CI 80. 9; 82. 6]) had a chronic condition: 14. 3 % (14. 0; 14. 6) considered themselves disabled, 4. 6 % (4. 4; 4. 9) were restricted in ADL and 1. 7 % (1. 5; 1. 8) were severely disabled. Musculoskeletal and <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairments</b> contributed the most to self-reported disability (AAF 15. 4 % and 12. 3 %). Neurological and musculoskeletal diseases had the largest impact on disability (AAF 17. 4 % and 16. 4 %, respectively). Neurological disorders contributed the most to severe disability (AAF 31. 0 %). Psychiatric diseases contributed the most to disability categories for patients 18 - 40 years old (AAFs 23. 8 %- 40. 3 %). Cardiovascular conditions were also among the top four contributors to disability categories (AAFs 8. 5 %- 11. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Neurological, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular chronic disorders mainly contribute to disability in France. Psychiatric impairments have a heavy burden for people 18 - 40 years old. These findings should help policymakers define priorities for health-service delivery in France and perhaps other developed countries...|$|R
40|$|Established beliefs {{concerning}} outcomes following anterior urethral reconstruction are changing, {{both with}} regards to the genital cosmetics and to the impact on sexual activity. To-day, the aim of stricture repair is not only to reinstate urinary function but also to safeguard sexual activity and guarantee genital cosmesis. A thorough evaluation of anterior urethroplasty results should include the sexual viewpoint which appears {{to play an important role}} in overall post-operative patient satisfaction. The most commonly reported sexual problems following anterior urethroplasty include: erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction, penile curvature or shortening, dissatisfaction with genital cosmetic appearance, <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairment</b> of glans. The prevalence of specific post-operative sexual problems may be related to the site of reconstruction (penile or bulbar) and to the technique of urethroplasty employed. In penile urethral reconstruction, the wide use of buccal mucosa grafts seems to excel the use of skin flaps which easily distort the cosmesis and elasticity of the penis. In bulbar reconstructions, graft augmentation techniques seem to impact less on sexual outcome than excision anastomotic techniques. Therefore, the policy of primarily indicating an excision anastomotic procedure, whenever possible, should come under scrutiny. Eventual sexual outcomes should be incorporated in the choice of the optimal anterior urethral reconstruction and in pre-operative patient counselling...|$|E
40|$|Inclusion of {{children}} with <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairment</b> in mainstream education demands the preparation of teachers to suit their needs. It requires skilled and motivated teachers who are competent {{enough to deal with}} the complexities in the classroom. Inclusive education as stressed by EFA, is not achieved, {{may be due to the}} lack of competent teachers. Inadequate staff training has been identified as a significant factor leading to the failure of inclusive program. In general, administration usually focuses on organizing in-service education program for inclusive education. It is being carried through DIETs, CTEs, IASEs and other national level institutes. The duration of the program varies from two lectures to five days intensive programs depending upon the type of program, target group, availability of time, funds and resources. Arranging, only in-service teacher education programs do not serve the purpose and maintain quality in regard to meet the challenges posed by inclusion of sensory impaired children in mainstream education. It is also observed that the curriculum they received during pre-service teacher education course is not adequate enough to meet the special education needs of sensory impaired children in inclusive setting. Hence teachers were unable to meet the demands of modifying and delivery of appropriate curriculum children with disabilities. The teacher himself demands the training on inclusive education. This paper throws its light on In-Service Training Programs, role of key teachers in inclusive educatio...|$|E
40|$|At {{the onset}} of West {{syndrome}} a specific impairment of visual function has been clearly demonstrated, while other aspects of sensorial development, and in particular of the auditory function, have been less studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate auditory function and orienting responses at {{the onset of}} West syndrome, and to relate the results with EEG patterns, visual function and neurodevelopmental competence. A prospective multicentric study was performed on 25 successively enrolled infants with West syndrome; all the patients underwent a full clinical assessment, including MRI and video-EEG, visual function and auditory orienting responses (AORs) as well as Griffiths' developmental scales. The whole assessment performed at the onset of spasms (T- 0) was repeated after two months (T- 1). AORs resulted significantly impaired both at T- 0 and T- 1. At the onset of spasms a highly significant relationship of auditory attention with visual function and neurodevelopmental competence was shown in both cryptogenic and symptomatic forms, but it was no longer present after two months. Our results may suggest a possible pervasive effect of the epileptic disorder on sensory processing, associated to a deficit of neurodevelopment. Although we failed to show a significant correlation between auditory orienting responses and EEG patterns, some evidence seems to support at least partially an influence of the epileptic disorder per se on the genesis of the <b>sensorial</b> <b>impairment.</b> A longer follow up and a larger cohort will be useful for a better clarification of these findings.

Beck depresion inventory (BDI) and Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) was meaningfully high among patients (p= 0, 0002; p= 0, 0004 respectively). In the female patient group, GRISS subscales vaginismus, orgasm disturbance in the male group low sexual intercourse frequency, impotance, premature ejeculation were high (p= 0, 005, p= 0, 00006; p= 0, 008 respectively).

It offers learning and data accession opportunities to learners notwithstanding time and place. In academic education, it was found that one of the critical problem is the appreciate education tool for disabilities students. Students with special education have difficulties to develop cognitive abilities and acquire new knowledge.

40|$|Severe {{poisoning}} {{has recently}} been diagnosed in humans having hip implants composed of cobalt-chrome alloys due {{to the release of}} particulate wear debris on polyethylene and ceramic implants which stimulates macrophagic infiltration and destroys bone and soft tissue, leading to neurological, <b>sensorial</b> and muscular <b>impairments.</b> Consistent with this premise, in this study, we focused on the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of Co(II) ions on skeletal muscle using mouse skeletal C 2 C 12 myotubes as an in vitro model. As detected using propidium iodide incorporation, increasing CoCl 2 doses (from 5 to 200 μM) affected the viability of C 2 C 12 myotubes, mainly by cell necrosis, which was attenuated by necrostatin- 1, an inhibitor of the necroptotic branch of the death domain receptor signaling pathway. On the other hand, apoptosis was hardly detectable as supported by the lack of caspase- 3 and - 8 activation, the latter resulting in only faint activation after exposure to higher CoCl 2 doses for prolonged time points. Furthermore, CoCl 2 treatment resulted in atrophy of the C 2 C 12 myotubes which was characterized by the increased expression of HSP 25 and GRP 94 stress proteins and other typical `pro-atrophic molecular hallmarks, such as early activation of the NF-kB pathway and down-regulation of AKT phosphorylation, followed by the activation of the proteasome and autophagy systems. Overall, these results suggested that cobalt may impact skeletal muscle homeostasis as an inducer of cell necrosis and myofiber atrophy...|$|R

Some patients who had a cerebrovascular accident may have difficulties in the response to the postural perturbations. The recovery of the postural control and of the balance depends {{on the quality of the}} motor action in order to use the ADL and to ensure the social and professional reintegration of the patients. That is why the postural control is essential in the recovery of the patients who had a cerebrovascular accident. The current study aims at the possibilities to regain the postural control for the patients with motor deficit by an individual program of recovery sessions. The current trial aimed at finding the way in which it is possible to influence the quality of life for the patients who had a cerebrovascular accident by using the MBT physiotherapy device. The use of the MBT physiotherapy devices in the recovery programme of the postural control after the cerebrovascular accident involves the need to set up an individualized programme of kinetic therapy. According to the established deficiency, namely the average one and the slight one, the recovery programme would need the introduction of techniques and methods whose effect is to reeducate the postural function. This can be done more easily if the recovery is initiated by using the MBT physiotherapy device that can intervene in the functional recovery which corresponds to each recovery stage...|$|R
