25|$|Although NIF was {{primarily}} designed as an indirect drive device, the {{energy in the}} laser is high enough {{to be used as}} a direct drive system as well, where the laser shines directly on the target. Even at UV wavelengths the power delivered by NIF is estimated to be more than enough to cause ignition, resulting in fusion energy gains of about 40 times, somewhat higher than the indirect drive system. A more uniform beam layout suitable for direct drive experiments can be arranged through changes in the <b>switchyard</b> that move half of the beamlines to locations closer to the middle of the target chamber.|$|E

25|$|Most nuclear {{stations}} require {{two distinct}} sources of offsite {{power feeding station}} service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the station's <b>switchyard</b> and can receive power from multiple transmission lines. In addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars {{before they reach the}} step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard). Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible. Nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and {{depressurized}} after a failed insulator in the plant's <b>switchyard</b> caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low voltage conditions on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} reactor coolant pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two reactor coolant pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the main generator) and natural circulation had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, secondary side of the plant to aid in the cooling process while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's turbine generator, preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's <b>switchyard.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the {{immediate}} {{wake of the}} tornado, The Salvation Army and American Red Cross set up temporary shelters for residents in Fairdale. The Rochelle Community Hospital was shifted into [...] "disaster mode" [...] to quickly handle {{the large number of}} casualties. Equipment and resources from over a dozen nearby fire departments aided in sifting through the remains of dozens of houses. More than 675 volunteers, coordinated by the Virginia faith-based nonprofit organization Operation Blessing, and countless residents from surrounding areas assisted in cleanup efforts. AmeriCorps coordinated their own operations beginning on April12. <b>Switchyard</b> Bar and Grill in Rochelle hosted a donation drive to provide victims with new household items. Ogle County Sheriff Brian VanVickle and DeKalb County Sheriff Roger Scott set up a lost-and-found for residents to retrieve missing items. Workers from [...] "Bees Designs" [...] created and sold shirts in Rochelle, with all proceeds donated to help tornado victims. A check from near Rochelle was discovered approximately 80mi (130km) northeast in Racine, Wisconsin, a common occurrence with violent tornadoes. Widespread severe weather across northern Illinois prompted the cancellation of more than 850 flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Governor Bruce Rauner declared DeKalb and Ogle counties as state disaster areas, freeing up a wide variety of resources for response efforts. Both the governor and Illinois U.S. Senator Mark Kirk toured the area. Total economic losses from the tornado reached $19 million (2015 USD).|$|E

2500|$|After the {{amplification}} {{is complete}} {{the light is}} switched back into the beamline, where it runs {{to the far end}} of the building to the target chamber. The target chamber is a [...] multi-piece steel sphere weighing [...] Just before reaching the target chamber, the light is reflected off various mirrors in the <b>switchyard</b> and target area in order to impinge on the target from different directions. Since the length of the overall path from the Master Oscillator to the target is different for each of the beamlines, optics are used to delay the light in order to ensure all of them reach the center within a few picoseconds of each other. NIF normally directs the laser into the chamber from the top and bottom. The target area and <b>switchyard</b> system can be reconfigured by moving half of the 48 beamlines to alternate positions closer to the equator of the target chamber.|$|E

2500|$|In 1893, {{satisfied}} that an automatic coupler could {{meet the demands}} of commercial railroad operations and, at the same time, be manipulated safely, the United States Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act. [...] Its success in promoting <b>switchyard</b> safety was stunning. Between 1877 and 1887, approximately 38% of all railworker accidents involved coupling. [...] That percentage fell as the railroads began to replace link and pin couplers with automatic couplers. [...] By 1902, only two years after the SAA's effective date, coupling accidents constituted only 4% of all employee accidents. [...] Coupler-related accidents dropped from nearly 11,000 in 1892 to just over 2,000 in 1902, even though the number of railroad employees steadily increased during that decade.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a seismic vulnerability analysis {{of the components of}} hydropower systems in Canada. A number of dams and their associated components (hydropower plants, <b>switchyards,</b> transmission towers, and supplementary equipment) at selected locations in western and eastern Canada were analyzed in the study. The seismic vulnerability for a given hydropower component was estimated by combining the probabilities of various levels of the seismic hazard at the component location, with the damage probabilities of the component corresponding to the seismic hazard levels considered. In this study, the seismic hazard was represented by the peak ground acceleration of the seismic motions. The calculation of the seismic hazard was based on the latest seismic hazard model developed by Geological Survey of Canada. The damage potential for the hydropower components was represented by fragility curves. The seismic vulnerability for each component was expressed by the damage probability as a function of peak ground acceleration. The results from this study show that the most vulnerable components of a hydropower system are the <b>switchyards</b> and the power plants...|$|R

40|$|Switching {{operations}} of power {{equipment such as}} disconnect switch and circuit breakers in high voltage substations produce high frequency transient currents, which propagate along the busbars. The busbars then act as antennae, producing transient electromagnetic fields in the <b>switchyards.</b> In electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) considerations, the resulting fields are important sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI); moreover, highly sophisticated,. new technology equipment are being introduced into substation environment for measurement, control, protection and communication purposes. These equipment are located close to other switching equipment in <b>switchyards.</b> Hence, to establish the electromagnetic compatibility of the electronic equipment, it is desirable to quantify the high voltage environment. This paper describes a new digital wireless measurement system {{that is based on}} Bluetooth technology and which could be used in power stations or other similar harsh environment. It comprises a Remote Acquisition Unit (RAU), a Wireless Data Communication Network (WDCN) and a PC-based Control Platform. The performance and capability of the system was assessed against another measurement system based on fiber optics technology and was found to be more portable, easier to install and cheaper. The limitations of the wireless system are considered and ways of addressing them in the future are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Prompt doses from x-rays {{generated}} as {{result of}} laser beam interaction with target material are calculated at different locations inside the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The maximum dose outside a Target Chamber diagnostic port is {approx} 1 rem {{for a shot}} utilizing the 192 laser beams and 1. 8 MJ of laser energy. The dose during a single bundle shot (8 laser beams) drops to {approx} 40 mrem. Doses calculated outside the Target Bay doors and inside the <b>Switchyards</b> (except for the 17 ft. - 6 in. level) range from a fraction of mrem to about 11 mrem for 192 beams, and scales down proportionally with smaller number of beams.

5000|$|In {{electric}} power distribution, a busbar (also bus bar, buss bar or bussbar) is a metallic strip or bar, typically housed inside switchgear, panel boards, and busway enclosures for local high current power distribution. They {{are also used}} to connect high voltage equipment at electrical <b>switchyards,</b> and low voltage equipment in battery banks. They are generally uninsulated, and have sufficient stiffness to be supported in air by insulated pillars. These features allow sufficient cooling of the conductors, {{and the ability to}} tap in at various points without creating a new joint.|$|R
5000|$|Busbars are {{produced}} {{in a variety}} of shapes such as flat strips, solid bars and rods typically copper, brass or aluminium in solid or hollow tubes. Some of these shapes allow heat to dissipate more efficiently due to their high surface area to cross-sectional area ratio. The skin effect makes 50-60 Hz AC busbars more than about 8 mm thickness inefficient, so hollow or flat shapes are prevalent in higher current applications. A hollow section also has higher stiffness than a solid rod of equivalent current-carrying capacity, which allows a greater span between busbar supports in outdoor electrical <b>switchyards.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{applications}} where high currents (up {{to thousands}} of amperes) flow, solid conductors are usually replaced by tubes, completely eliminating the inner portion of the conductor where little current flows. This hardly affects the AC resistance, but considerably reduces {{the weight of the}} conductor. The high strength but low weight of tubes substantially increases span capability. Tubular conductors are typical in electric power <b>switchyards</b> where the distance between supporting insulators may be several meters. Long spans generally exhibit physical sag but this does not affect electrical performance. To avoid losses, the conductivity of the tube material must be high.|$|R
