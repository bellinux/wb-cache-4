5|$|Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during {{intermission}} {{to drink}} at the saloon next door. The now unguarded President <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13pm, aimed {{at the back of}} Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.|$|E
5|$|Tipu {{appointed}} some Christian captives to {{posts in}} his household. He made Salu (Salvadore) Pinto Deputy Vizier and Anthony Gagialgar (clockmaker) Saldanha House Chamberlain. One {{of his most}} faithful servants, a Mangalorean Catholic named Manuel Mendes, saved Tipu's life in Travancore when he donned his master's robes and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> palanquin. Tipu escaped in the general panic whilst Mendes was captured and killed by the Nairs, who mistook him for Tipu.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{was given}} an office at the RNC, {{nominally}} as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration. RNC chairman Ray Bliss and his aides were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon and his aides considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he could {{not bring himself to}} fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> RNC office for a month after the inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff wondered at his presence.|$|E

5|$|In the American camp, {{the mutual}} resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally {{exploded}} into open hostility. Gates quickly reported {{the action of}} September 19 to the Congress and Governor George Clinton of New York, but he failed to mention Arnold at all. The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success. Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold's command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tent. Arnold protested, and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command and giving it to Benjamin Lincoln. Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington's command, which Gates granted, but instead of leaving he remained in his tent. There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed by line officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp.|$|E
5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E
5|$|With Zolak {{coming to}} {{the final year of}} his {{contract}} in 1998, he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> usual spot on the depth chart, in between starter Bledsoe and third stringer Tupa. He saw playing time in three games during {{the first three months of}} the season in relief of Bledsoe. His most significant appearance during this time came against the Atlanta Falcons on November 8, 1998, where he completed three of ten passes for 33yards and an interception in a 4110 loss. Near the end of the month, Bledsoe was sidelined with an injury and was questionable for the final November game. Bledsoe played in three more games, but his injury kept him from playing in the final two, giving Zolak his first starting appearance since 1995. Zolak's first start came against the San Francisco 49ers on December 20. He completed 14 of 30 passes for 205yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions and won the game, 2421. He faced the New York Jets the following week, completing 14 of 31 passes for 127yards and a touchdown, but lost the game 3110. Zolak finished the season with his most productive totals since 1992. He played in six games and started two, completed 32 of 75 passes for 371yards, three touchdowns, 3 interceptions, and had a passer rating of 61.8. Zolak's last appearance for the Patriots occurred in the playoffs, as Bledsoe was still injured, against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He completed 21 of 44 passes as the Jaguars eliminated the Patriots from playoff contention in a 2510 loss. He became an unrestricted free agent after the season ended, but was not asked back by the Patriots, ending his tenure there.|$|E

25|$|We {{were alone}} {{together}} among the strange poisons, {{each one of}} whom, with a quicker or a slower death-devil in his eye, <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> glass or porcelain sentry-box, a living force of bale. Should it be Hemp? No, that was too slow, uncertain, painful. Morphine? Too many antidotes — too much commonness, ostentation in that. Daturin? I {{did not like to}} ask how much of that was certain...|$|E
25|$|He made {{no attempt}} to direct this picture. He just <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{director}}'s chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E
25|$|This {{system of}} non-residence led {{also to the}} {{institution}} of vicars choral, each canon having his own vicar, who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> stall in his absence, and when the canon was present, in the stall immediately below, on the second form. The vicars had no place or vote in chapter, and, though irremovable except for offences, were the servants of their absent canons whose stalls they occupied, and whose duties they performed. Outside Britain they were often called demi-prebendaries. As time went on the vicars were themselves often incorporated {{as a kind of}} lesser chapter, or college, {{under the supervision of the}} dean and chapter.|$|E

25|$|At around 1:10p.m., Bryant got {{in line at}} {{the toll}} booth at the {{entrance}} to the historic site. Upon getting close to the toll booth, he left the line and moved to the back again. Eventually getting to the front of the line, he claimed someone had almost reversed into him. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Café, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the café. The security manager saw him go up to the café carrying a large bag and a video camera, but ignored him.|$|E
500|$|Dan White's {{arrest and}} trial caused a sensation, and {{illustrated}} severe {{tensions between the}} liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration, {{as well as the}} liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore [...] "Free Dan White" [...] T-shirts {{in the days after the}} murder. An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated: [...] "The more I observed what went on at the jail, the more I began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement." [...] White showed no remorse for his actions, and only exhibited vulnerability during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.|$|E
500|$|Voters {{cast their}} ballots on November 3, and that evening {{gathered}} in cities and around telegraph offices. In places like New York, the results were projected by stereopticon onto the sides of newspaper buildings. The election was {{considered by many to}} be the most crucial since 1860, and large numbers of voters followed the returns all night. McKinley cast his ballot early, going with his brother Abner to the polling place, and met Hanna for lunch. That evening, McKinley <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> library as the returns came in by telegraph. It was quickly apparent that McKinley was leading, and by midnight he had pencilled the figure [...] "241" [...] on a pad, the number of electoral votes of states that were certain, enough for victory. Hanna wired from Cleveland to Canton, [...] "The feeling here beggars description ... I will not attempt bulletins. [...] You are elected to the highest office of the land by a people who always loved and trusted you." ...|$|E

500|$|Before he left, Carlton plotted to {{kill the}} {{residents}} of Taliesin. His primary target was draftsman Emil Brodelle, who had called Carlton a [...] "black son-of-a-bitch" [...] on August 12 for not following an order. Brodelle and Carlton also engaged in a minor physical confrontation two days later. He planned the assault, targeting the noon hour, when Borthwick, her children, and the studio personnel would be {{on opposite sides of}} the property awaiting lunch. Wright was away in Chicago completing Midway Gardens while Borthwick stayed at home with her two children, 11-year old John and 9-year-old Martha. On August 15, Carlton grabbed a shingling hatchet and began an attack. He started with the Borthwicks, who were waiting on the porch off the living room. Mamah Borthwick was killed by a single blow to the face, and her son John was slaughtered as he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. Martha managed to flee, but was hunted down and slain in the courtyard. He then coated the bodies in gasoline and lit them on fire, setting the house ablaze.|$|E
500|$|On 8 November 2007 two RIRA members shot an off-duty PSNI officer as he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car on Bishop Street in Derry, causing {{injuries}} {{to his face}} and arm. On 12 November another PSNI member was shot by RIRA members in Dungannon, County Tyrone. On 7 February 2008, the RIRA stated that, after experiencing a three-year period of reorganisation, it intended to [...] "go back to war" [...] by launching a new offensive against [...] "legitimate targets". It also, despite having apologised for the Omagh bombing, denied any large scale involvement with the attack and said that their part had only gone as far as their codeword being used. On 12 May 2008 the RIRA seriously injured a member of the PSNI when a booby trap bomb exploded underneath his car near Spamount, County Tyrone. On 25 September 2008 the RIRA shot a man in the neck in St Johnston, near the Derry border. The same man was targeted in a pipe bomb attack on his home on 25 October, the RIRA did not claim responsibility for the attack, but security forces believe they were responsible for it.|$|E
500|$|Rodin {{planned to}} stay in Belgium a few months, but {{he spent the next}} six years outside of France. It was a pivotal time in his life. He had {{acquired}} skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> workshop, since he could not afford castings. Though his relationship with Carrier-Belleuse deteriorated, Rodin found other employment in Brussels, displaying some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there. Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of Donatello and Michelangelo. Their work {{had a profound effect on}} his artistic direction. Rodin said, [...] "It is Michelangelo who has freed me from academic sculpture." [...] Returning to Belgium, he began work on The Age of Bronze, a life-size male figure whose realism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheating—its realism and scale was such that critics alleged he had cast the work from a living model. [...] Much of Rodin's later work was explicitly larger or smaller than life, in part to demonstrate the folly of such accusations.|$|E
