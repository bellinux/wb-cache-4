500|$|Audi had not {{originally}} planned {{to participate in}} the African marathon events, but now found it necessary to enter the penultimate round, the Rallye Côte d'Ivoire, due to their title battles with Opel. Just {{before the start of the}} event, Mouton received news that her father had succumbed to cancer in his house in Nice. His last wish was that Mouton start the rally. After a first day of over 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) of racing in temperatures over 30°C (86°F), she was eight minutes clear of Mikkola and nearly half an hour ahead of title rival Röhrl. Mikkola said that he had never been in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> car, and Röhrl estimated that the temperature inside his car reached an [...] "almost unbearable" [...] 70°C. With just over half of the 5,000km (3,100mi) behind, Mouton led from Röhrl by over an hour despite losing 25 minutes due to transmission problems. On the third day, both Mouton and Röhrl struggled with several reliability issues and her lead over Röhrl shrank to 18 minutes. The Toyota Celica GT2000s of Eklund and Waldegård were still over two hours behind. Should Mouton go on to hold off Röhrl, she would reduce Röhrl's lead in the championship to just two points. As a driver's seven best results counted towards the championship at the time, Mouton would only need a third place in the RAC Rally to take the title even if Röhrl would win. On the final day, she continued to suffer from mechanical problems and had the complete fuel injection system changed. For the next time control, Röhrl and Mouton arrived almost simultaneously. With only 600km to go, Mouton went off the road and rolled her car. She drove the severely damaged Quattro for five more kilometres before giving up.|$|E
2500|$|It is omnivorous, {{feeding on}} seeds, green vegetation, insects, and dried animal matter. It {{occasionally}} caches food. Redstem fialree (Erodium cicutarium) and brome grass (Bromus rubens) are important food {{items for the}} squirrels. However, their diet may differ depending {{on the time of}} day or time of year. [...] Green vegetation is the most common diet type from December to mid-April because it is the most abundant during this period. [...] Likewise, insects make up more than 90% of the squirrel's diet from mid-April to December because they are more abundant. [...] Although seeds are available for most of the year, it is not the preferable diet of the squirrels. They will choose insects or green vegetation when available over seeds, even if the seeds are more abundant and easier to access. [...] Some speculate that this could be due to the higher amount of water in insects and green vegetation, which would be necessary for the species to survive in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot,</b> dry climate. [...] Unfortunately for the Nelson's antelope squirrel, there is not an abundant water source nearby. [...] Under laboratory conditions, the squirrels readily accept water. However, they can also survive at least 7 months in the shade without water. At the end of 7 months they appeared relatively healthy and not at all emaciated.|$|E
2500|$|Belaney's {{first book}} called The Men of the Last Frontier was {{published}} in 1931, and it traced the devastating story of the beaver as well as posed some very valid concerns {{about the future of}} Canada and its forests. Beaver pelts had become <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> commodity in Canadian industry that the beaver {{was on the verge of}} extinction when Anahareo helped Belaney understand the desperate need for protecting the animal instead of trapping it. According to Belaney in The Men of the Last Frontier, trappers swarmed to the forests in higher numbers than ever before in 1930 because of the beaver's scarcity, and he argued that the only way to save this animal was to remove all of the trappers from the forests. This was an extremely difficult feat however because their pelts were so valuable and the job economy was so poor in the 1930s that he described their role in the economy as [...] "beavers [...] to the north what gold was to the west". Though much of his focus in his writings were on the beaver, he also believed that this animal could be used as a symbol for the disappearing future of Canadian wilderness in a broader sense. Belaney believed that Canada's wilderness and vastly open nature was what made it unique from other countries of the world, and this was disappearing at an extremely fast rate due to consumerism and the modernist emphasis on capital.|$|E

5000|$|Agression {{was part}} of the first wave of skatepunk bands to emerge from {{southern}} California in the early 1980s.
