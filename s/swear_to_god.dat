Unlike {{others in}} the Memphis Mafia, he was {{interested}} in spiritual questions and recalls how, from their first conversation, Presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties: [...] "I mean {{there has to be a}} purpose... there's got to be a reason... why I was chosen to be Elvis Presley.... I <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> <b>God,</b> no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel." [...] Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which the singer read voraciously. Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.|$|E
500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and I <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open." ...|$|E

In an interview, Freeman said, [...] "About everywhere you go, people say, The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw [...] " [...] and that such praise [...] "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, [...] "I <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> <b>God,</b> all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, {{there are people who}} say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, [...] "If that isn't the best , it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it." [...] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was [...] "a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe".|$|E

500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> <b>God,</b> when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E

It transferred to Broadway in 1979. Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after Evita. In an interview in 2011, LuPone commented, [...] "He writes crap music... Evita was his best score, Evita in its bizarreness - when I first heard it I thought 'I <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> <b>God,</b> he hated women' [...] There are some very romantic moments in his music, {{and there is some}} real...trash that he doesn't even think about parting with.

50|$|In some {{versions}} of the Swayamvara, Arjuna is forbidden by Kunti to attend the Swayamvara. Kunti's reasoning is that only Yudhishthira and Duryodhana would be acceptable candidates for Draupadi's hand; anyone else, not set to inherit the throne, would be an insult to Panchal. She allows Bhima to attend because he is Yudhishthira's heir and could win Draupadi for his brother without controversy. When Arjuna disobeys her anyway, as he is firing the arrow, he <b>swears</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> that if he wins Draupadi's hand, he would never disobey his mother's commands.|$|R

Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "I {{know it was}} a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." [...] Drummer Dave Krusen said, [...] "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." [...] He added that [...] "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out." ...|$|E

O heroes of Bab Amr, you slaughter the Alawites and take out their hearts to eat them!" [...] in an apparent attempt to increase sectarianism. Video of the event emerged two months later and resulted in considerable outrage, especially from Human Rights Watch which classified the incident as a war crime. According to the BBC, {{it was one of}} the most gruesome videos to emerge from the conflict to-date. On 29 March, rebels captured the town of Da'el after fierce fighting. The town is located in Daraa Governorate, along the highway connecting Damascus to Jordan. On 3 April, rebels captured a military base near the city of Daraa.|$|E

If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot {{determine}} what the punishment should be." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not saying that I believe the defense," [...] but that [...] "it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B" [...] via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. Ford believed George Anthony was [...] "dishonest." [...] She said the jury [...] "was sick to [...] stomachs to get [...] verdict" [...] and that the decision process overwhelmed them {{to the point where they}} did not want to talk to reporters afterwards. Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the St. Petersburg Times that [...] "everybody agreed if we were going fully on feelings and emotions, [...] was done". He stated that a lack of evidence was the reason for the not-guilty verdict: [...] "I just <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> <b>God...</b> I wish we had more evidence to put her away. I truly do... But it wasn't there." [...] He also said that Anthony was [...] "not a good person in my opinion".

He asks his father, the Pharaoh, (portrayed as a troubled but fair ruler) for advice, but their conversation (including a musical number) is interrupted by the Jews beginning to graphically slaughter lambs, so as to avoid the tenth plague.
