Alfred's company erected something which might be called a wall. They built a bridge across the water where the herdsman's boat had been accustomed to ply. They raised two towers to watch and guard the bridge. All these defenses were indeed of a very rude and simple construction; still, they answered the purpose intended. They afforded a real protection; and, more than all, they produced a certain moral effect upon the minds of those whom they shielded, by enabling them to consider themselves as no longer lurking fugitives, dependent for safety on <b>simple</b> <b>concealment,</b> but as a garrison, weak, it is true, but still gathering strength, and advancing gradually toward a condition which would enable them to make positive aggressions upon the enemy.|$|E

40|$|Data lost in {{the form}} of dropped packets is a major {{obstacle}} to actualizing real time Internet video via modem connection with frame rates as high as 30 frames per second. Error concealment (EC) techniques must restore the lost data. Due to rigid system specifications of this application, only the computationally <b>simplest</b> error <b>concealment</b> methods are plausible. Replication, which is the <b>simplest</b> temporal error <b>concealment</b> (TEC) method, fits well in this situation. There are however circumstances when replication is inadequate and linear interpolation, the simplest spatial EC, is used in its place. In this work, we consider an alternative spatial EC to linear interpolation, i. e. the DCT-coefficient based EC algorithm, with comparable computational cost and consistently better image quality in real-time Internet video applications. 1.

By taking {{the advantage of}} the bit plane coding and the multiple description coding, the proposed strategy adopts layered multiple description coding (LMDC) for the embedded wavelet coders to improve the error resistant capability of the important bit planes in the meaning of D(R) function. Then, the post-compression ratedistortion (PCRD) optimization process is used to improve the overall performance. At decoding, a <b>simple</b> error <b>concealment</b> technique is used to compensate the data loss.

This study analyzes voice quality distortions caused by packet losses occurring over a multi-hop WSN testbed: A comprehensive analysis of transmitted voice quality {{is given in}} a real setup. In the experiments, recorded signals are partitioned into data segments and delivered efficiently at the source. Throughout the network, two reconstruction scenarios are considered for the lost segments: In the first one, a raw projection is applied on voice with no error concealment (V-NC) whereas the latter encodes a <b>simple</b> error <b>concealment</b> (V-EC).

Our framework {{consists of an}} encoding station, an edge server {{and a set of}} clients with various access rates. The edge server is capable of performing <b>simple</b> error <b>concealment</b> operations on the incoming data before forwarding the adapted media to its clients. We study two encoding scenarios: versions (multiple encodings at various output rates) and layers. We develop a unified end-to-end distortion model, which we use to derive the optimal coding strategy for both scenarios. Finally we analyze the performance of MPEG- 4 coded versions against MPEG- 4 FGS-coded layers in rate-constrained lossy environments. Experiments show that versions perform better than layers when the constraint on the aggregate rate is somewhat relaxed, for low to medium packet loss ratios. ...|$|R

Most low-level media errors, such as those caused by tape damage or imperfections, are now dealt with by forward error correction techniques, and those which overwhelm the FEC layer are typically too severe to remedy using <b>simple</b> line-based error <b>concealment</b> techniques, because damage to the compressed bitstream will often damage {{large parts of the}} video image. However, since occasional signal drop-outs can still occur, either through severe tape damage or because of packet loss in packetized video transmission, modern error concealment techniques that are aware {{of the structure of the}} compressed video format have been developed to deal with these.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The Multiview Video Coding (MVC) {{standard}} is currently under development by the Joint Video Team {{as an extension}} of the Advanced Video Coding (H. 264 /AVC) standard. An MVC encoder compresses more than one viewpoint of a scene captured by different cameras. Redundancies between views can be used for inter-view prediction in encoding as well as error concealment in decoding. In this paper, a new algorithm utilizing motion information of pictures from other views to conceal a lost picture is proposed. The algorithm first derives motion information for a lost picture based on motion fields of pictures in adjacent views. Then, traditional motion compensation is invoked within the view containing the lost picture to derive a concealed frame. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve video quality with a negligible computational complexity overhead compared to <b>simple</b> temporal error <b>concealment</b> algorithms.

40|$|Abstract — Motion {{compensation}} (MC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important technologies capable of removing the temporal redundancy and widely adopted by the main video standards. From the older MPEG- 2 to the latest H. 264 and the Chinese AVS, many efficient coding tools have been introduced into MC, such as new motion vector prediction, bi-directional matching, quarter precision interpolation, etc. However, these new features enormously increase the computational complexity and the memory bandwidth consumption. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture design of Motion compensation (MC) for multiple video standards including MPEG- 2, H. 264, and AVS. The proposed design has a macroblock-level pipelined structure which consists of MV Predictor, Cache-based Fetch, and Pixel Interpolation unit. The proposed architecture exploits the parallelism in MC algorithm to accelerate the processing speed and uses the dedicated design to optimize the memory access. MV Predictor unit can cover all MV prediction algorithms for the three standards and provide a <b>simple</b> error <b>concealment</b> scheme. Cache-based Fetch unit can save 25 % memory bandwidth of MC in average and doesn’t impact the performance in the worst case. Pixel Interpolation unit adopts fully separate 1 -D filtering structure which is designed to effectively avoid the redundant calculations. The architecture can achieve the real-time multiple-standard decoding for HDTV 1080 i (1920 × 1088 4 : 2 : 0 60 field/s) video. The efficient design can work at the frequency of 148. 5 MHz and the total gate count for logic circuit s is about 56 K. ...|$|R
40|$|Scalable {{image and}} video has been {{proposed}} to transmit image and video signals over lossy networks, such as the Internet and wireless networks. However, scalability alone is not a complete solution since there is a conflict between the unequal importance of the scalable bit stream and the agnostic nature of packet losses in the network. This thesis investigates three methods to combat the detrimental effects of random packet losses to scalable images and video, namely the error resilient method, the error concealment method, and the unequal error protection method within the joint source-channel coding framework. For the error resilient method, an optimal bit allocation algorithm is proposed without considering the distortion caused by packet losses. The allocation algorithm is then extended to accommodate packet losses. For the error <b>concealment</b> method, a <b>simple</b> temporal error <b>concealment</b> mechanism is designed to work for video signals. For the unequal error protection method, the optimal protection allocation problem is formulated and solved. These methods are tested on the wavelet-based Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees(SPIHT) scalable image coder. Performance gains and losses in lossy and lossless environments are studied for both the original coder and the error-controlled coders. The results show performance advantages of all three methods over the original SPIHT coder. Particularly, the unequal error protection method and error concealment method are promising for future Internet/wireless image and video transmission, because the former has very good performance even at heavy packet loss (a PSNR of 22. 00 dB has been seen at nearly 60 % packet loss) and the latter does not introduce any extra overhead...|$|R
