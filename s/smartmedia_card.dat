50|$|<b>SmartMedia</b> memory <b>cards</b> are {{no longer}} {{manufactured}} as of around 2006. There have been no new devices designed for SmartMedia {{for quite a long}} time now. <b>Smartmedia</b> <b>cards</b> are still frequently available on eBay mostly in used condition with new cards coming up from time to time.|$|R
50|$|The Eiger MPMan F20 was {{a similar}} model that used 3.3 V <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> for expansion, and ran {{on a single}} AA battery, instead of {{rechargeable}} NiMH batteries.|$|R
50|$|The Olympus C-220 Zoom, {{also known}} as Olympus D-520 Zoom is an entry level digital camera from Olympus. It works as a {{standard}} USB storage device, and uses <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> for storage.|$|R
50|$|The {{cards are}} all 3.3V 2MB SmartMedia memory cards {{manufactured}} by Hagiwara Sys-Com. The Mario no Photopi game came {{with an empty}} memory <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card</b> for storing the user creations.|$|E
50|$|A <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card,</b> and the FlashPath adapter, {{is used as}} a {{plot device}} in the film Colombiana (2011), during the opening scenes set in the mid-1990s. A card is {{swallowed}} by the 9 year old orphaned victim to hide it, then regurgitated.|$|E
5000|$|PhotoBridge HD1000, {{a system}} for {{displaying}} images on a high-definition television, as well as streaming MPEG video. The unit has four card readers {{on the front and}} can read from a CompactFlash Card type II, Memory Stick, MultiMediaCard, SD Memory Card, or <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>Card</b> ...|$|E
50|$|<b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> came in two formats, 5 V and {{the more}} modern 3.3 V (sometimes marked 3 V), named for their main supply voltages. The {{packaging}} was nearly identical, except for the reversed placement of the notched corner. Many older SmartMedia devices only support 5V <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards,</b> whereas many newer devices only support 3.3V cards. In order to protect 3.3V cards from being damaged in 5V-only devices, the card reader should have some mechanical provision (such as detecting the type of notch) to disallow insertion of an unsupported type of card. Some low-cost, 5V-only card readers do not operate this way, and inserting a 3.3V card into such a 5V-only reader will result in permanent damage to the card. Dual-voltage card readers are highly recommended.|$|R
5000|$|... xD and <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> {{can be used}} by hobbyists as a {{convenient}} source of NAND flash memory chips for custom projects. For example, the Mattel Juice Box PMP can be booted into Linux using a modified cartridge containing an xD card with a boot image written on it. Additionally, <b>SmartMedia</b> and xD <b>card</b> readers can be used to read the data from NAND flash chips in electronic devices, by soldering leads between the chip and the card reader.|$|R
5000|$|<b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> {{larger than}} 128 MB were never released, {{although}} there were rumors of a 256 MB card being planned. Technical specifications for the memory size were released, and the 256 MB cards were even advertised in some places. Some older devices cannot support cards larger than 16 or sometimes 32 MB without a firmware update, if at all.|$|R
50|$|The Rio 500 was {{the first}} MP3 player to allow file {{transfer}} via USB cable, and PC & Mac support. It features 64 MB of flash memory available for music, has light blue backlight, ability to set bookmarks, has an expansion card slot (<b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card)</b> and is powered by one AA battery. It is {{roughly the size of}} a standard pack of playing cards. Subsequent firmware updates made better use of the available screen space by displaying additional track information including bitrate.|$|E
50|$|MOTIF {{keyboards}} {{include three}} internal expansion slots (two on the rack-mount version). These slots allow {{the user to}} augment the instrument's soundset through the purchase of Yamaha PLG Expansion Boards. The MOTIF Classic featured 4MB of onboard sampling RAM, which could be increased to 64MB with the purchase of third party memory sticks. External connectors include a firewire 400 port for connecting an mLAN network card; a USB 1 port for connecting the instrument to a computer via a MIDI cable OR for external storage; and a SmartMedia port for storing sequence, voice, and sample data (which requires a third-party <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Cybiko is a Russian {{hand-held}} computer introduced in May 2000 by David Yang's company and designed for teenage audiences, featuring its own two-way radio text messaging system. It has over 430 [...] "official" [...] freeware games and applications. Because {{of the text}} messaging system, it features a QWERTY keyboard that was used with a stylus. An MP3 player add-on was made for the unit {{as well as a}} <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card</b> reader. The company stopped manufacturing the units after two product versions and only a few years on the market. Cybikos can communicate with each other up to a maximum range of 300 metres (0.19 miles). Several Cybikos can chat with each other in a wireless chatroom.|$|E

50|$|The {{overall design}} {{is not unlike}} the {{original}} version of the Game Boy Advance. The GP32 {{is based on a}} 133 MHz ARM CPU and 8 MB of RAM. Unlike other hand held gaming systems, which tend to be proprietary cartridge-based, the GP32 uses <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> (SMC) for storing programs and data, making it accessible for amateur developers as no further development hardware is required.|$|R
50|$|At the raw {{hardware}} level, an xD card {{is simply}} an ordinary NAND flash integrated circuit in an unusual package. Comparing the pinout of an xD card to the pinout of a NAND flash chip in a standard TSOP package, one finds a nearly one-to-one correspondence between the active pins of the two devices. xD cards share this characteristic with the older <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards,</b> which are also basically raw NAND flash chips, albeit in a larger package.|$|R
50|$|A <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card</b> {{consists}} of a single NAND flash chip embedded in a thin plastic card, although some higher capacity cards contain multiple, linked chips. It {{was one of the}} smallest and thinnest of the early memory cards, only 0.76mm thick, and managed to maintain a favorable cost ratio as compared to the others. SmartMedia cards lack a built-in controller chip, which kept the cost down. This feature later caused problems, since some older devices would require firmware updates to handle larger capacity cards. The lack of built-in controller also made it impossible for the card to perform automatic wear levelling, a process which prevents premature wearout of a sector by mapping the writes to various other sectors in the card.|$|E
50|$|The MC-909 is {{the first}} Roland groovebox to feature a sampler. It can record audio {{from any of the}} {{external}} audio inputs, SPDIF connectors, or import wav and aiff files from a computer using a USB port. The sampler can be upgraded up to a total of 272 MB RAM (16 MB User + 256 MB PC-100 or PC-133 168-Pin DIMM Module), and the samples can be also be stored on a 128 MB 3.3 volt <b>Smartmedia</b> <b>card.</b> The unit is also able to store on two 128 MB Smartmedia cards, if you have larger than 256 MB DATA in its user memory. There are tricks from user forum sites that have found ways to go beyond this limitation using xD-Picture Cards as other means for storage.|$|E
50|$|Typically, SmartMedia {{cards were}} used as storage for {{portable}} devices, {{in a form that}} could easily be removed for access by a PC. For example, pictures taken with a digital camera would be stored as image files on a <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card.</b> A user could copy the images to a computer with a SmartMedia reader. A reader was typically a small box connected via USB or some other serial connection. Modern computers, both laptops and desktops, will occasionally have SmartMedia slots built in. While availability of dedicated SmartMedia readers has dropped off, readers that read multiple card types (such as 4-in-1, 10-in-1) continue to include the format, but even these have decreased in quantity, with many dropping SmartMedia in favour of MicroSD and/or Memory Stick Micro.|$|E
5000|$|FlashPath (FlashPath Floppy Disk Adapter) were {{a series}} of devices {{produced}} by SmartDisk that allowed a variety of memory cards {{to be used in}} a 3.5" [...] Floppy disk drive. The initial version introduced in May 1998 allowed <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> to be used with a floppy drive. Later, Memory Stick and Secure Digital/Multi Media Card versions were made as well. FlashPath adapters were sold both branded by SmartDisk, and as OEM devices under other brand names.|$|R
50|$|SmartMedia is a {{flash memory}} card {{standard}} owned by Toshiba, with capacities ranging from 2 MB to 128 MB. <b>SmartMedia</b> memory <b>cards</b> are no longer manufactured.|$|R
50|$|Commercial games {{could be}} {{acquired}} via internet download (encrypted to the GP32's ID) or in a retail box. The retail boxes contained <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>Cards</b> with the games which were encrypted to run only from these cards (SMC ID). They could alternatively be downloaded from a Korean portal after submitting the GP32's ID, {{they were then}} encrypted to run only on that GP32. Downloading the games effectively reduced {{the cost to the}} consumer, who was no longer paying for the manufacture of the cartridge. Downloading a game online could range from US$10 to US$30.|$|R
5000|$|The Cybiko is a Russian {{handheld}} computer {{introduced in the}} U.S. by David Yang's company Cybiko Inc. as a retail test market in New York on April 2000, and rolled out nationwide in May 2000. It is designed for teens, featuring its own two-way radio text messaging system. It had over 430 [...] "official" [...] freeware games and applications. Because of the text messaging system, it features a QWERTY keyboard that was used with a stylus. An MP3 player add-on was made for the unit {{as well as a}} <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card</b> reader.

Several Cybikos can chat with each other in a wireless chatroom. By the end of 2000, the Cybiko Classic sold over 500,000 units.|$|E
50|$|SmartMedia cards {{frequently}} become corrupted and unusable {{when the}} cards are read / {{written in a}} card reading device. Affected SmartMedia cards will be unusable and the camera or device {{will be unable to}} format, read or write to the card. Data loss and a change in the capacity that the device displays are also signs of a low level format corruption or a corrupted CIS (Card Information System). The majority of these card format errors can be repaired and the data or photos can be recovered. A low level format with the proper software and equipment can return the SmartMedia memory card to its proper working order. With some research on the internet one can find several sources of information and companies that provide a <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card</b> repair service. Considering the dwindling supply of SmartMedia memory format, these corrupted cards and the devices they support are needlessly being discarded. The majority of corrupted or unusable SmartMedia cards can be repaired.|$|E
40|$|Digital {{photography}} {{has become}} a practical alternative to film photography for documentation, communication, and education about orthopaedic problems and treat-ment. Digital cameras {{may be used to}} document preop-erative and postoperative condition, intraoperative find-ings, and imaging studies. Digital photographs are cap-tured on the charged coupler device (CCO) of the cam-era, and processed as digital data. Images may be imme-diately viewed on the liquid crystal display (LCD) screen of the camera and reshot if necessary. Photographic image files may be stored in the camera in a floppy diskette, CompactFlash ™ card, or <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>card,</b> and transferred to a computer. The images may be manipu-lated using photo-editing software programs, stored on media such as ZipTM disks or CO-R discs, printed, and incorporated into digital presentations. The digital pho-tographs may be transmitted to others using electronic mail (e-mail) and Internet web sites. Transparency film slides may be converted to digital format and used in digital presentations. Despite the initial expense to obtain the required hardware, major cost savings in film and processing charges may be realized over time com-pared with film photography...|$|E
5000|$|The SP-303 itself {{provides}} up {{to three}} minutes and twelve seconds of sampling. The sample time can be expanded {{by the use of}} <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> (8MB-64MB supported). The SP-303 features twenty-six internal effects that can be applied to samples and external sources as well. It also has a built-in sequencer. The SP-303 is often praised for its unique sound qualities. Frequent SP-303 user Dibiase said of the sampler, [...] "The difference between the 303 and SP-404 is that the vinyl sound compression sounds way different in the 303. It has a grittier sound." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> {{include a}} little-known copy {{protection}} feature known as [...] "ID". This is why many cards are marked with [...] "ID" [...] beside the capacity. This gave every card a {{unique identification number}} for use with copy protection systems. One of the few implementations of this primitive DRM system was by the Korean company Game Park, which used it to protect commercial titles for the GP32 handheld gaming system. Samsung's 1999 Yepp Hip-Hop MP3 player also used the feature in order to implement Secure Digital Music Initiative DRM.|$|R
50|$|SmartMedia {{was popular}} in digital cameras, and {{reached its peak}} in about 2001 when it {{garnered}} {{nearly half of the}} digital camera market. It was backed especially by Fujifilm and Olympus, though the format started to exhibit problems as camera resolutions increased. Cards larger than 128 MB were not available, and the compact digital cameras were reaching a size where even <b>SmartMedia</b> <b>cards</b> were too big to be convenient. Eventually Toshiba switched to smaller, higher-capacity Secure Digital <b>cards,</b> and <b>SmartMedia</b> ceased to have major support after Olympus and Fujifilm both switched to xD. It did not find as much support in PDAs, MP3 Players, or Pagers as some other formats, especially in North America and Europe, though there was still significant use.|$|R
