40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} the mathematical modelling and simulation {{of the whole}} milling action in a milling machine. The mathematical model includes: (a) {{a model of the}} dynamics of the X axis drive, (b) a model of the dynamics of the <b>spindle</b> <b>drive,</b> (c) a model of the dynamics of the cutting process itself with cutting forces and torques and (d) the interconnection of (a), (b) and (c) to form the complete model of the milling action. The model uses both z and s plane transfer functions in order to model discrete and continuous parts of the system. The models of the X axis drive dynamics and <b>spindle</b> <b>drive</b> dynamics include models of the digital filter and analog converter in the velocity and position loop control. Friction is modelled in the machine table (part of the X axis drive) as a combination of stiction, coulomb and viscous friction. The model of the X axis drive dynamics is explained in detail whereas the model of the <b>spindle</b> <b>drive</b> dynamics is derived from the former. The model of the cutting process dynamics, which connects the other two models, is based upon a relatively simple analysis of the forces generated during face milling. The model is designed to be simulated by an existing computer simulation package and for this reason some dynamic equations are reoriented in order to avoid differentiation. This part of the paper concludes with an overall block diagram to represent the model of the whole milling action. The simulation of the mathematical model is then described, as are the tests carried out on the model and the actual machine in order to validate the model...|$|E

40|$|In {{multi-axis}} machining centers {{the individual}} operating loads of axis and <b>spindle</b> <b>drives</b> are often unknown. Especially in serial production, drive systems are oversized including electric motors, frequency inverters and shaft drives. But also in special plant engineering, where multiple drive systems {{are connected to}} one intermediate circuit, the individual operating loads cannot be assessed. Subsequently, performance, operating points and energy efficiency are suboptimal. Economic disadvantages, such as the necessity of higher investments and increased operational costs, are associated. Therefore an approach to active power measurement behind the frequency inverter to separate the power consumption profiles of <b>spindle</b> and axis <b>drives</b> is necessary. In this paper two systems for an active power measurement for variable frequency drives are discussed. One of them has been developed by the authors themselves with the advantage of lower cost compared to commercially available systems. The systems were analyzed for performance, accuracy, installation effort and costs. The investigated active power measurement systems provide basic data for an optimal dimensioning of drive systems for industrial equipment manufacturers...|$|R

50|$|The {{millstones}} themselves turn {{at around}} 120 rpm. They are laid {{one on top}} of the other. The bottom stone, called the bed, is fixed to the floor, while the top stone, the runner, is mounted on a separate <b>spindle,</b> <b>driven</b> by the main shaft. A wheel called the stone nut connects the runner's spindle to the main shaft, and this can be moved out of the way to disconnect the stone and stop it turning, leaving the main shaft turning to drive other machinery. This might include driving a mechanical sieve to refine the flour, or turning a wooden drum to wind up a chain used to hoist sacks of grain to the top of the mill house. The distance between the stones can be varied to produce the grade of flour required; moving the stones closer together produces finer flour.|$|R
