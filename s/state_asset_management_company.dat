30|$|China {{being the}} world’s second largest economy {{provides}} a unique market setting {{in terms of}} institutional setting, development of capital markets, and ownership concentration. Chinese companies are highly concentrated in terms of ownership concentration. A single largest owner held about 36 % of an average company share, while 52 % shares are held by the five largest owners (Guo et al. 2013). Compared to western economies Chinese firms have a very unique ownership structure. Shares are divided into three categories, i.e., state, legal, and shares held by individuals under Chinese company law. Central and provincial governments and their respective ministries hold the state shares. State-owned and non-state-owned enterprises hold the legal entity shares. Individual investors hold the individual shares. Moreover, before 2004, shares of state-owned and legal entities could be traded in stock exchange. This situation is further {{complicated by the fact}} that control rights remain with the Chinese government. Shares held by state-owned shareholders exceed other shares held by other shareholders (individuals and non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs)) in Chinese companies. Guo et al. (2013) reported that by the end of September 2006, the largest shareholders who hold 56 % of shares were state shares controlled by the Chinese government and other <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} stylized {{sequencing}} of banking supervision and bank restructuring measures designed to complement and expedite {{the adoption of}} indirect instruments of monetary policy. Appropriate sequencing reflects both operational considerations and macroeconomic effects of structural measures. It typically involves implementing initially {{a critical mass of}} reforms of prudential supervision and of financial structure of both banks and enterprises, and subsequently adapting and refining these measures in line with the evolution of markets and internal governance. This approach facilitates implementation because the initial cost of bank restructuring can be offset, partly, through the budgetary effects of improved enterprise finances.

Indonesia exemplified its enthusiasm in reforming <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> {{policies and}} practices through the establishment of the Directorate General of <b>State</b> <b>Assets</b> in 2006. The Directorate General of <b>State</b> <b>Assets</b> have stressed the new direction that it is taking <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> laws and policies through the introduction of Republic of Indonesia Law Number 38 Year 2008, which is an amended regulation overruling Republic of Indonesia Law Number 6 Year 2006 on Central/Regional Government <b>State</b> <b>Asset</b> <b>Management.</b> Law number 38 / 2008 aims to further exemplify good governance principles and puts forward a ‘the highest and best use of assets’ principle in <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore and analyze specific contributing influences to <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> practices, answering the question why innovative <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> policy implementation is stagnant.

40|$|Efficient <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> {{is crucial}} for governments as they {{facilitate}} the fulfillment of their public functions, which include the provision of essential services and other public administration support. In recent times economies internationally and particularly in South east Asia, have displayed increased recognition {{of the importance of}} efficiencies across <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> law, policies and practice. This has been exemplified by a surge in notable instances of reform in <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management.</b> A prominent theme in this phenomenon is the consideration of governance principles within the re-conceptualization of <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> law and related policy, with many countries recognizing variability in the quality of asset governance and opportunities for profit as being critical factors. This issue is very current in Indonesia where a major reform process in this area has been confirmed by the establishment of a new Directorate of <b>State</b> <b>Asset</b> <b>Management.</b> The incumbent Director-General of <b>State</b> <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> has confirmed a re-emphasis on adherence to governance principles within applicable <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> law and policy reform. This paper reviews aspects of the challenge of reviewing and reforming Indonesian practice within <b>state</b> <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> law and policy specifically related to public housing, public buildings, parklands, and vacant land. A critical issue in beginning this review is how Indonesia currently conceptualizes the notion of asset governance and how this meaning is embodied in recent changes in law and policy and importantly in options for future change.
