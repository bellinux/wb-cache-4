When a dependent <b>source</b> is contained within an essential mesh, the dependent <b>source</b> should be treated like an independent <b>source.</b> After the mesh equation is formed, a dependent <b>source</b> equation is needed.

5|$|As the {{radiation}} <b>sources</b> can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} <b>sources</b> are placed in or next to the target tumour, the <b>sources</b> maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation <b>sources</b> remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E
