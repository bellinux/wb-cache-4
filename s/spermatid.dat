In situ hybridization with a cDNA probe for the Prm- 1 gene transcript performed on both whole testis sections and spermatogenic cell suspensions showed that there was no statistical difference in distribution of grains over step- 5 to step- 10 <b>spermatids</b> from Robertsonian-translocation heterozygous mice and from control mice of normal karyotype.

Male mice lacking both alleles of Ra 175 (Ra 175 −/−) were infertile and showed oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia; almost no mature motile spermatozoa were found in the epididymis. Heterozygous males and females and homozygous null females were fertile and had no overt developmental defects. RA 175 was mainly expressed on the cell junction of spermatocytes, elongating and elongated <b>spermatids</b> (steps 9 to 15) in wild-type testes; the RA 175 expression was restricted to the distal site (tail side) but not to the proximal site (head side) in elongated <b>spermatids.</b> In Ra 175 −/− testes, elongated and mature <b>spermatids</b> (steps 13 to 16) were almost undetectable; round <b>spermatids</b> were morphologically normal, but elongating <b>spermatids</b> (steps 9 to 12) failed to mature further and to translocate to the adluminal surface.

40|$|Here {{we report}} a {{detailed}} analysis of waves of histone acetylation that occurs throughout spermatogenesis in mouse. Our data showed that spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes contained acetylated core histones H 2 A, H 2 B and H 4, whereas no acetylated histones were observed throughout meiosis in leptotene or pachytene spermatocytes. Histones remained unacetylated in most round <b>spermatids.</b> Acetylated forms of H 2 A and H 2 B, H 3 and H 4 reappeared in step 9 to 11 elongating <b>spermatids,</b> and disappeared later in condensing <b>spermatids.</b> The spatial distribution pattern of acetylated H 4 within the <b>spermatids</b> nuclei, analyzed in 3 D by immunofluorescence combined with confocal microscopy, showed a spatial sequence of events tightly associated with chromatin condensation. In order to gain an insight into mechanisms controlling histone hyperacetylation during spermiogenesis, we treated spermatogenic cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), which showed a spectacular increase of histone acetylation in round <b>spermatids.</b> This observation suggests that deacetylases are responsible for maintaining a deacetylated state of histones in these cells. TSA treatment could not induce histone acetylation in condensing <b>spermatids,</b> suggesting that acetylated core histones are replaced by transition proteins without being previously deacetylated. Moreover, our data showed a dramatic decrease in histone deacetylases in condensing <b>spermatids.</b> Therefore, the regulation of histone deacetylase activity/concentration appears {{to play a major role}} in controling histone hyperacetylation and probably histone replacement during spermiogenesis...|$|R

Mitotic divisions in triploid fowls {{are similar to those}} in diploid fowls, but meiosis in both the ZZZ and ZZW triploid fowl is abnormal and many defective gametes are produced. The majority of <b>spermatids</b> have structural abnormalities and this is attributed to the aneuploidy expected from meiotic chromosome pairing in a triploid. Some <b>spermatids</b> were observed to possess an irregularly shaped head, 2 centriolar complexes, 2 acrosomes and 2 tails and this type differentiated into large-headed spermatoza. Such <b>spermatids</b> and spermatozoa are suggested to be near diploid due to their large nuclear size and 2 sets of organelles. Other <b>spermatids,</b> observed with only 1 centriolar complex, 1 acrosome and 1 tail, are suggested to be near haploid. Differentiation of these <b>spermatids</b> is similar to the process observed in diploid fowls except that there is a high percentage of abnormally shaped heads.

In ZZW triploid fowls gamete formation is more severely affected than in ZZZ triploid fowls and it is suggested that many of the degenerative changes occurring in ZZW fowls could be attributed to those <b>spermatids</b> that possess a W sex chromosome, since normal male fowls are the homogametic sex (ZZ) and normal <b>spermatids</b> and spermatozoa contain only a Z sex chromosome...|$|R

Whether the establishment of the genetic paternal imprint in this immature haploid sperm cell is complete and stable at this stage of maturation has never been analysed. In the present study, a highly sensitive heminested methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for the target region 15 q 11 - 13 was developed for imprinting analysis at the single-cell level. Imprinting analysis was then carried out on DNA extracted from single diploid leucocytes (n = 25), ejaculated spermatozoa (n = 88), elongated testicular <b>spermatids</b> (n = 30), and round <b>spermatids</b> (n = 25). Amplification was obtained in 57 % of the ejaculated spermatozoa, in all elongated <b>spermatids</b> and in 20 % of the round <b>spermatids.</b> In the amplified samples, only the paternal imprint was detected. The maternal imprint was not found at all in any of the sperm cells; in 56 % of the diploid leucocytes, the maternal and paternal imprints were detected at the same time (complete failure in the other 44 %).
