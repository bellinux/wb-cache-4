40|$|The {{object of}} this report is to survey the work carried out by Swedish <b>student</b> <b>unions</b> in {{taking care of the}} {{interests}} of distance students as a part of their activities.

This means that distance students, who study at various seats of learning, are often forced to join a number of <b>student</b> <b>unions</b> without necessarily getting better service as a result. Another aim of the report is to map the <b>student</b> <b>union</b> membership fees, and to see if distance studies qualify students for reduced membership fees. The survey took place during June and July 2005, and comprises all regulated <b>student</b> <b>unions.</b> However the percentage of answers is not comprehensive and information concerning a number of small and medium-sized <b>student</b> <b>unions</b> is not available. The results show at many <b>student</b> <b>unions</b> are aware that the needs of distance students vary from those of campus students, and that special methods must be applied to satisfy these needs. This awareness is reflected not least in the fact that many <b>student</b> <b>unions</b> reduce their membership fees for distance students. Furthermore there are a number of good examples of <b>student</b> <b>unions</b> which have found various ways to tackle the problem of membership in multiple <b>student</b> <b>unions...</b>|$|R
