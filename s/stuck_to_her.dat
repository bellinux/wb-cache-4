5|$|Elsewhere in town, Mike meets up {{with his}} friends, the Terenzi {{brothers}} (Michael Siegel and Peter Licassi), and using the intercom on an ice cream truck, they drive around town attempting to warn people of the invading klowns. At Debbie's house, popcorn <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> clothes from her earlier encounter with the klowns mutates into monsters and attack her. She fends off the creatures, but another group of klowns arrive and trap her in a giant balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzis witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to an amusement park, and the relocated circus tent. Journeying through a funhouse leading to the klowns' lair, the Terenzi brothers become separated and meet two female-looking klowns. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a crazy straw to drink liquefied townspeople, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of tricks and traps.|$|E
500|$|Public {{interest}} in the Cottingley Fairies gradually subsided after 1921. Elsie and Frances eventually married and lived abroad for many years. In 1966, a reporter from the Daily Express newspaper traced Elsie, who was by then back in England. She admitted in an interview given that year that the fairies might have been [...] "figments of my imagination", but left open the possibility she believed that she had somehow managed to photograph her thoughts. The media subsequently became interested in Frances and Elsie's photographs once again. BBC television's Nationwide programme investigated the case in 1971, but Elsie <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> story: [...] "I've told you that they're photographs of figments of our imagination, and that's what I'm sticking to".|$|E

50|$|Throughout the years, Schloss <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> figurative painting. <b>Her</b> {{subjects}} were usually conveyed {{those who were}} weaker, oppressed, deprived and discriminated against. This included a variety of subjects - from children, the elderly, women, refugees and animals.|$|R
500|$|Through her {{production}} company, IPC Films, {{she produced}} films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film Fun With Dick and Jane {{is generally considered}} her [...] "comeback" [...] picture. Also in 1977, she portrayed the playwright Lillian Hellman in Julia, receiving positive reviews, BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress, and an Oscar nomination. During this period, Fonda announced that she would make only films that focused on important issues, and she generally <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> word. She turned down An Unmarried Woman because she felt the part was not relevant. She won another BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1979 with The China Syndrome, about a cover-up of a vulnerability in a nuclear power plant. The same year, she starred in The Electric Horseman with her previous co-star, Robert Redford.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{decision}} not to remarry, and made a conscious choice not to have children. She believed that motherhood should be a full-time commitment, {{and said it was}} not one she was willing to make. [...] "I would have been a terrible mother," [...] she told Berg, [...] "because I'm basically a very selfish human being." [...] She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own. Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn may have been a lesbian or bisexual, which she often joked about. In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in which he argued this was the case. In response to this speculation about her aunt, Katharine Houghton said, [...] "I've never discovered any evidence whatsoever that she was a lesbian." [...] However, in a 2017 documentary, columnist Liz Smith, who was a close friend, attested to the fact that she was.|$|E
500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with , and she <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E

All the time he <b>stuck</b> close <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> bristling with a small boy's pride of her. For no other woman looked such a lady as she did, in her little black bonnet and her cloak. She smiled when she saw women she knew. When she was tired she said <b>to</b> <b>her</b> son: ...|$|R

[...] "Contrary to popular belief, artistes don't always have a bag a money to drop on an album." [...] Tessanne stated songs that <b>stuck</b> out <b>to</b> <b>her</b> were [...] "Who"" [...] because of its dub-style reggae feel, Flying High because it represents where she is in her life right now, [...] "Taken" [...] and [...] "You and Me", the duet with her sister Tami Chynn.|$|R
2500|$|On July 21, 1923, she befriended Louella Parsons, who {{interviewed her}} for The New York Morning Telegraph. In 1931, when Bow came under tabloid scrutiny, Parsons defended her and <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> first opinion on Bow: ...|$|E

2500|$|Ronstadt {{captured}} {{the sounds of}} country music and the rhythms of ranchera musicwhich she likened in 1968 to [...] "Mexican bluegrass"and redirected them into her rock 'n' roll {{and some of her}} pop music. Many of these rhythms and sounds were part of her Southwestern roots. Likewise, a country sound and style, a fusion of country music and rock 'n' roll called Country rock, started to exert its influence on mainstream pop music around the late 1960s, and it became an emerging movement Ronstadt helped form and commercialize. However, as early as 1970, Ronstadt was being criticized by music [...] "purists" [...] for her [...] "brand of music" [...] which crossed many genres. Country Western Stars magazine wrote in 1970 that [...] "Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn't quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda." [...] She never categorized herself and <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> genre-crossing brand of music.|$|E
60|$|When, {{after half}} an hour of this wearying cross-examination, Madame at last granted him a respite, he made a pretext of urgent {{business}} at M. le Comte d'Artois' headquarters and took his leave of the ladies.

Madame <b>stuck</b> obstinately <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chair and was blind and deaf to every hint of appeal from him, whilst Crystal, who was singularly absorbed and had lent but a very indifferent ear to his narrative, made no attempt to detain him.|$|R

2500|$|In 1889, she {{was sent}} as {{representative}} of the Associated Press to the International Exposition at Paris. She {{was the first woman}} who ever represented the press at an international council. When she and her companion presented themselves at the council room, the French official refused them tickets of admission. “But, madam, you are a woman,” he said in explanation. “Yes, and in monsieur, I expect to find a gentleman,” she answered. The official went on to explain that a woman had never sat at such a gathering, and that it was impossible for him to allow her to enter. With characteristic persistency, Sullivan <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> point. she said,” do you not think that Paris should establish a precedent?” She and her companion were given tickets of admission. At the exposition, the President of France wanted to put her in a somewhat subordinate position at some great function held in Paris. She refused as representative of the American press to take it and through a telegram to James G. Blaine, then Secretary of State, she was given the place of honor.|$|E

25|$|During the 1860s, Patti {{possessed a}} sweet, high-lying voice of birdlike purity and {{remarkable}} flexibility which was ideal for such parts as Zerlina, Lucia and Amina; but, as Verdi noted in 1878, her lower notes gained fullness and beauty when she grew older, enabling <b>her</b> <b>to</b> excel in weightier fare. Patti, however, {{turned into a}} conservative singer in {{the final phase of}} her operatic and concert career. She knew what suited <b>her</b> aging voice <b>to</b> perfection and she <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> it. Typically, <b>her</b> recital programs during the 1890s featured an array of familiar, often sentimental, not-too-demanding popular tunes of the day, which were sure <b>to</b> appeal <b>to</b> <b>her</b> adoring fans.|$|R
60|$|Jenny {{could not}} tell whether <b>her</b> {{presence}} conduced <b>to</b> diligence or to chatter, but he minded her more than any one else, and always <b>stuck</b> close <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> insisting on her admiring all his proteges. There was one with whom he was certainly doing a work, which, as Julius truly said, no one more clerical could have done so well-- namely, the son of his landlady, a youth who held a small clerkship in an office at Willansborough, and who had fallen this year under the attraction of the Backsworth races, so as to get into serious difficulties with his master, and narrowly escape dismissal {{for the sake of}} his mother.|$|R

60|$|And {{yet this}} day {{brought with it}} some annoyances, which once would have fretted her so much as to {{interfere}} even with such joy as she now felt. The song, with which she had taken so much pains, {{ought to have been}} sent home a week before, but owing to the delay caused by Emily's carelessness, it had been burnt in the fire in the schoolroom, and Lily could not feel herself forgiven till she had talked the disaster over in private with her friend, and this was out of her power throughout the day, for something always prevented her from getting Alethea alone. In the morning Jane <b>stuck</b> close <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and in the afternoon William walked to the school gate with them. But Alethea's manner was kinder towards her than ever, and she was quite satisfied about her.|$|R
60|$|While {{these things}} were {{floating}} in his mind, Mrs. Budd and her handsome niece were making preparations for passing the night, aided by Biddy Noon. The old lady was factotum, or factota, {{as it might be}} most classical <b>to</b> call <b>her,</b> though we are entirely without authorities on the subject, and was just as self-complacent and ambitious of seawomanship below decks, as she had been above board. The effect, however, gave Spike great satisfaction, since it kept her out of sight, and left him more at liberty to carry out his own plans. About nine, however, the good woman came on deck, intending {{to take a look at}} the weather, like a skilful marineress as she was, before she turned in. Not a little was she astonished at what she then and there beheld, as she whispered to Rose and Biddy, both of whom <b>stuck</b> close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side, feeling the want of good pilotage, no doubt, in strange waters.|$|R
5000|$|The Prescribed Medicines files (released {{annually}} in October) - This file contains one household-reported prescribed medicine purchase during the calendar year.

Prescribed medical events may {{be more difficult to}} analyze, since the strength of the drug and quantity purchased may vary, despite two separate prescription-events being the same chemical substance. Prescribed medical events may also be more difficult to analyze, since, unlike other recorded medical events, a pharmacy encounter does not guarantee that the medication has been administered (i.e. that the patient <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> his or <b>her</b> drug regiment). This file should be thought of as containing one record per pharmacy encounter.|$|R
