A protective item (e.g. book, file, rolled-up newspaper) might be tucked into the student's trouser waistband to protect the lower back from strokes that land off-target. The student then places his hands on a desk or chair, bends over or leans forward, and receives the caning on the seat of his uniform trousers or shorts. Based on first-hand accounts, the student typically feels moderate to acute pain for the first few minutes, depending on the number of strokes. This soon leads to a stinging sensation and general soreness around the points of impact, usually lasting for some hours; sitting down is likely to be uncomfortable. <b>Superficial</b> <b>bruises</b> and weals may appear on the buttocks and last for a few days after the punishment.

Along the production chain certain manufacturing steps may cause <b>slight,</b> <b>superficial</b> flaws or mere optical effects without greater impact on performance whereas others may lead to severe changes of the final part properties. These production–induced defects can arise already {{in the early stages}} of the production chain and may hence cause significant downstream effects. Ultrasonic spot welding is a well-established manufacturing step in aerospace industries. As such, it is applied in preforming to locally melt the matrix of advanced thermoplastic prepregs, to bond stacked layers to one another and later produce a tailored organic sheet or part, e. g. via vacuum consolidation. Depending on the process parameters ultrasonic spot welding may, however, cause detrimental overheating of the laminate, penetration of the horn into the part and disruption of fibres. 	 In this work the influence of production-induced defects on the properties of fully consolidated specimen is investigated and correlated with methods of non-destructive testing. The experimental analysis focusses on the impact of the respective welding and processing parameters on the mechanical performance and the detectability by non-destructive testing, e. g. optical lock-in thermography. The aim is to improve the robustness of the process by detecting, defining and dimishing production-induced defects.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was initiated {{to determine the}} fate and behavior of a virulent marker strain of Staphylococcus aureus (MS) injected intramuscularly into both control and traumatized tissues. Control tissues appeared to possess a clearing mechanism highly active against this organism, whereas bruised tissues stimulated and supported its growth. This stimulation {{may be due to}} the presence of extrastromal hemoglobin in the bruised areas. By use of the disc-sensitivity procedure, extrastromal hemoglobin was found to enhance the growth of S. aureus (MS) and this stimulation was linearly dependent on concentration in the range of 0. 002 to 0. 008 μmole per disc. Physical and physiological factors affecting the fate of staphylococci in poultry tissues were studied. The results showed that the number of viable cells of S. aureus (MS) in the initial inoculum exerted little effect on the survival activity patterns of this organism in the traumatized tissues. Control tissues, however, only became infected when a suspension containing 1. 34 × 109 cells of the marker strain was injected. Regardless of the concentration of cells of this test culture inoculated into bruised areas, the staphylococci did not increase in number above a log of 8. 5 organisms per gram of tissue. The extent of both tissue damage and accumulation of blood and fluid seemed to play an important role in the fate of staphylococci in experimentally induced infection. A correlation was noted between the severity of the bruise and the rate of growth and multiplication of virulent staphylococci in the tissue. The rate of growth showed a 100 -fold increase in 1 day in the severe bruise, in 2 days in the medium bruise, and in 3 days in the <b>superficial</b> <b>bruise.</b> Time-course studies revealed that virulent S. aureus (MS) was able to persist in bruised tissue for long periods of time (18 days) even in the absence of noticeable infection.

There were 14 subsequent in-hospital deaths, bringing the ultimate death toll to 191. This report describes {{the organization of}} clinical management and patterns of injuries in casualties who {{were taken to the}} closest hospital, with an emphasis on the critically ill. A total of 312 patients were taken to the hospital and 91 patients were hospitalized, of whom 89 (28. 5 %) remained in hospital for longer than 24 hours. Sixty-two patients had only <b>superficial</b> <b>bruises</b> or emotional shock, but the remaining 250 patients had more severe injuries. Data on 243 of these 250 patients form the basis of this report. Tympanic perforation occurred in 41 % of 243 victims with moderate-to-severe trauma, chest injuries in 40 %, shrapnel wounds in 36 %, fractures in 18 %, first-degree or second-degree burns in 18 %, eye lesions in 18 %, head trauma in 12 % and abdominal injuries in 5 %. Between 08 : 00 and 17 : 00, 34 surgical interventions were performed in 32 patients. Twenty-nine casualties (12 % of the total, or 32. 5 % of those hospitalized) were deemed to be in a critical condition, and two of these died within minutes of arrival. The other 27 survived to admission to intensive care units, and three of them died, bringing the critical mortality rate to 17. 2 % (5 / 29). The mean Injury Severity Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores for critically ill patients were 34 and 23, respectively. Among these critically ill patients, soft tissue and musculoskeletal injuries predominated in 85 % of cases, ear blast injury was identified in 67 % and blast lung injury was present in 63 %. Fifty-two per cent suffered head trauma.

40|$|Bruises in cattle develop {{after the}} {{application}} of force, and they provide evidence for sub-optimal animal welfare. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the gross characteristics of bruises in cows arriving at the slaughterhouse directly from farms or through the livestock market. The number of bruises and their distribution on the carcass as well as their severity, shape, size and colour were assessed post mortem in a slaughterhouse in Chile. A total of 258 cow carcasses were evaluated, and a total of 846 bruises were found on 243 of the carcasses. Cows that had passed through a livestock market (M-carcasses) had in total 563 bruises (mean 3. 8 bruises/carcass, s. d. 2. 0), whereas cows transported directly from farms (F-carcasses) had in total 283 bruises (mean 2. 5 bruises/carcass, s. d. 1. 8). The backs of F-carcasses had twice as many bruises as M-carcasses (32. 9 % and 16. 2 %, respectively), whereas bruises in the rib area were more frequently observed in M-carcasses (13. 1 %) than in F-carcasses (8. 1 %). <b>Superficial</b> <b>bruises</b> (grade 1) were the most frequently observed (66. 2 % of all bruises). Regarding the size of the bruises, 64 (7. 6 %) were classified as large, 271 (32. 0 %) as medium and 511 (60. 4 %) as small. Irregularly shaped bruises were the most frequent (91. 1 %, n = 771), followed by linear (3. 8 %, n = 32), circular (3. 1 %, n = 26) and tramline-shaped bruises (1. 9 %, n = 16). The latter were noticed only in M-carcasses, which may indicate that these animals were beaten more frequently with sticks or other rod-shaped objects. Fresh, bright red-coloured bruises were found more frequently on all the animals (69. 5 % from farms and 70. 5 % from market) compared with bluish (29. 7 % and 29. 3 %, respectively) and yellow bruises (0. 4 % and 0. 2 %, respectively). The method of selling was significantly associated with the number of bruises on the carcass (P < 0. 001) and the anatomical site (P < 0. 05), but not with the severity, shape and colour of the bruises. Increased fat coverage reduced the severity of bruises (P < 0. 001). This study shows that, in Chile, market animals have more bruises than those sourced directly from farms, and their distribution is different. More information about the causes of infliction may help reduce bruises and it may also improve their welfare. Further studies are required to elucidate whether the causes of the high bruising in the case of animals passing through markets are related only to extra handling (repeated loading, unloading, transportation, eventual mixing) or to the way of handling by personnel and inadequate desig...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{this new}} realism {{applied to the}} study of human life from the beginning—for example, in Machiavelli's works—the {{definitive}} argument for the final rejection of Aristotle was associated especially with Francis Bacon. Bacon sometimes wrote as if he accepted the traditional four causes ("It is a correct position that [...] "true knowledge is knowledge by causes".

40|$|Chromosome {{behavior}} during spermatogenesis is considered in {{several species of}} Drosophila. The material is not favorable for detailed study. Perhaps the most favorable species is D. funebris; but since the genetic behavior of this species is not well known, others are used for the main account, supplemented by observations on funebris. Homologous chromosomes undergo synapsis in the telophase of the last spermatogonial division, as in other Diptera, and apparently remain in intimate association during the growth stages. The sex chromosomes remain relatively condensed and attached to or incorporated in the nucleolus, which shows wide divergence in size and appearance in different species. The autosomes become diffuse at an early growth stage and are so indistinct that no account can be given of their detailed behavior. In D. funebris they form a granulated canopy or net-like cap at {{one side of the}} nucleus and arise in prophase by the condensation of this and coalescence of the granules. No indications of definite threads such as seen during the leptotene and early diplotene stages of many insects and other animals are found here. It is difficult to attach any positive significance to the chromosome behavior so far as the question of genetic crossing over is concerned. The enormous growth of the spermatocytes brings into prominence many interesting cytoplasmic structures which have been noted here but not really studied, although they merit careful observation. The nuclear wall remains intact at both divisions, permitting a distinction between cytoplasmic and nuclear components. In some species numerous non-chromosomal bodies (fragments of nucleolus, cytoplasmic granules, etc.) stain deeply and sometimes bear a <b>slight</b> <b>superficial</b> resemblance to chromosomes, at the first division. Both maturation divisions are normal as far as chromosome distribution is concerned — the first division being reductional so far as known (e. g. where dimorphic sex chromosomes are found). At the first division the chromosomes tend to be drawn out and irregular in contour, especially when long and V-shaped. And they do not, as a rule, form a flat metaphase plate, save in D. obscura and its relatives. Figures are consequently best analysed in side view. The second division is more nearly of the ordinary type and presents no special peculiarities. The behavior of the sex-chromosomes in the first spermatocyte prophase is such as to permit their identification on this basis alone. The evidence indicates that Y remains relatively dense and compact while X behaves more like the autosomes. This leads to the view that Y may remain relatively inert or passive while X is more active during the growth period. X and Y appear to be connected only for a short region, or regions; from which it is inferred that they many be similar in constitution in these regions only...|$|R

Each study was analyzed according to a methodology of review which considered the problems involved in eliciting meaningful data from a group of studies grounded on different assumptions and conducted according to disparate research designs. The studies were compared and contrasted to determine what factors were significantly related to child abuse. Thereafter, both major theories of child abuse were tested against the findings of the literature review to determine to what extent the respective theories successfully predicted and related significant factors in child abuse. The review of the literature clearly established a demographic profile of the child abuse victim and his family. The abused child is usually very young, typically below the age of three. Neither race nor gender are specifically related to the age of the victim. Abusing families tend to have more than the average number of children, but usually select only one child - frequently, the eldest or the youngest - as the target for abuse. The child is likely to have been born prematurely and to have had more than the usual number of serious physical illnesses or disabilities throughout his life. In addition, a significant number of abused children display intellectual, social, and psychological dysfunction which may have resulted from injuries sustained from previous abuse. Most injuries stemming from child abuse fall into the general category of <b>superficial</b> <b>bruises</b> and welts although compared with accidental childhood injuries, there is a higher frequency of fractures and head injuries. The pattern that emerges from the somewhat limited data is that abused children are unusually impaired in intellectual, social, and psychological functioning. Nearly all child abuse is committed by parental figures most of whom are the natural mothers and fathers of abused children. Most abusing parents are around twenty-five years old reflecting the fact that the majority of abuse victims are infants and younger children. Mothers are the most frequent child abusers. Although only one parent actually attacks the abuse victim, generally speaking, the other parent is overtly, or at least covertly involved in abusing the child. Abusing parents are characterized by a history of anti-social behavior and psychological problems. A general atmosphere of instability and disruption surrounds the child abusing family indicated by frequent discord among married parents, as well as separations and divorces. On all measures of socioeconomic status, child abusing families have low achievement and face the stresses of poverty and its associated conditions. However, neither race nor socioeconomic status distinguish the abusing family when compared with the social, racial, and economic groups to which they belong. Abusing families are distinguished by their transience and inability to maintain social contact with the community or affiliation with social organizations. Neither a sociocultural or a psychodynamic theory of child abuse effectively relates and explains all the significant findings of the literature review. While the former predicts the several environmental factors significantly related to child abuse and the latter explains the significant findings associated with the perpetrator, neither theory provides an explanation of the role of the child abuse victim. This review suggests that an alternative theoretical framework which incorporates environmental factors and relates significant factors about the child abuse victim and perpetrator will produce the most comprehensive explanation of child abuse...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{histology}} of gastric biopsies in 501 dogs, consisting of 19 clinically healthy dogs and 482 vomiting dogs is presented. Whole stomachs of four young clinically healthy laboratory dogs were used as controls. Eleven percent of forceps biopsies were unsuitable for examination; all suction biopsies were of good quality. Slight to severe gastritis was found in 168 vomiting dogs (35 %), whereas five dogs (26 %) of the clinically healthy group showed a mainly <b>slight</b> gastritis. <b>Superficial</b> and diffuse gastritis were the most prominent findings in the 168 dogs with gastritis. A single type of gastritis was found in 114 dogs, a combination of different types in 54 dogs. Gastric atrophy was seen in 23 (5 %) vomiting dogs and in three (15 %) clinically healthy dogs, atrophy with a slight to severe fibrosis in 21 (4 %) vomiting dogs, and in 84 (17 %) vomiting dogs and two (11 %) healthy dogs, gastric fibrosis was present. Carcinomas were seen in 26 vomiting dogs, of which 17 also had gastritis. A differential diagnosis of granulomatous gastritis/carcinoma {{had to be made}} in one case. Seven dogs showed a lymphosarcoma, and in six other dogs a differential diagnosis of lymphosarcoma and/or gastritis was made. One adenomatous polyp was seen. In one clinically healthy dog an adenomyoma was diagnosed. Ulceration was found in 24 dogs, but only five of these lacked other lesions. Other biopsy findings were pseudopyloric metaplasia, hyperplasia, cysts, calcification and edema. Some dogs showed "antralization"...|$|R
