50|$|Mechanical {{models that}} treat accretionary {{complexes}} as critically tapered wedges of sediment demonstrate that pore pressure controls their <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> by modifying basal and internal shear strength. Results from some {{studies show that}} pore pressure in accretionary wedges {{can be viewed as}} a dynamically maintained response to factors which drive pore pressure (source terms) and those that limit flow (permeability and drainage path length). Sediment permeability and incoming sediment thickness are the most important factors, whereas fault permeability and the partitioning of sediment have a small effect. In one such study, it was found that as sediment permeability is increased, pore pressure decreases from near-lithostatic to hydrostatic values and allows stable <b>taper</b> <b>angles</b> to increase from ∼2.5° to 8°-12.5°. With increased sediment thickness (from 100 - 8000 m), increased pore pressure drives a decrease in stable <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> from 8.4°-12.5° to <2.5-5°. In general, low-permeability and thick incoming sediment sustain high pore pressures consistent with shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high-permeability and thin incoming sediment should result in steep geometry. Active margins characterized by a significant proportion of fine-grained sediment within the incoming section, such as northern Antilles and eastern Nankai, exhibit thin <b>taper</b> <b>angles,</b> whereas those characterized by a higher proportion of sandy turbidites, such as Cascadia, Chile, and Mexico, have <b>steep</b> <b>taper</b> <b>angles.</b> Observations from active margins also indicate a strong trend of decreasing <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> (from >15° to <4°) with increased sediment thickness (from <1 to 7 km).|$|R
40|$|A 1203 pattern had a <b>steep</b> {{sidewall}} <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> and no width reduction during etching. SIMS and XPS {{studies on}} the photoresist surface after etching revealed that the deposited polymer using CH 3 F contained fewer C [...] F bonds than the damaged layer ex-posed to CHF 3 ion beam. The incident angle dependence of photoresist etching rate suggested that physical sput. ter-etching of the depos-ited polymer was a rate-determining process on photore-sist. The etching rate of A 120 ~ was also dominated by sput-tering of nonvolatile reaction products formed on the etched A 1203 surface. Acknowledgments We {{would like to thank}} Dr. Y. Sugita for helpful and en-couraging discussions {{during the course of this}} study. We are also indebted to Messr. T. Okai, Messr. S. Kaizu, and Messr. M.

40|$|The model {{delamination}} {{fracture toughness}} and fatigue strength of thin-section three-dimensional (3 D) woven composite materials is experimentally determined. The non-crimp 3 D orthogonally woven carbon-epoxy composites were thin (2 mm) and consequently their through-thickness z-binder yarns were inclined {{at a very}} <b>steep</b> <b>angle</b> (about 70) from the orthogonal direction. The <b>steep</b> z-binder <b>angle</b> has a marked effect on the delamination toughening and fatigue strengthening mechanisms. Experimental testing revealed that the fracture toughness and fatigue resistance increased progressively with the volume content of z-binders. However, the <b>steep</b> <b>angle</b> caused the z-binder yarns bridging the delamination crack to deform and fail in shear and through-thickness tension, rather than in-plane tension which usually occurs in thick 3 D woven composites. Model pull-off tests on a single woven z-binder yarn embedded within the composite revealed that the crack bridging traction load, strain energy absorption and failure mechanism were strongly affected by the <b>steep</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R
