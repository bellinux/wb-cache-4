Because there is currently no experimental data available on the sensitizing properties of <b>persulfate</b> salts (ammonium, <b>sodium,</b> and potassium <b>persulfates),</b> we determined their dermal sensitizing capacity, using the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: For three consecutive days, BALB/c mice were dermally treated with ammonium, <b>sodium,</b> or potassium <b>persulfate</b> or with the vehicle alone (dimethyl sulfoxide) on each ear (2 x 25 microl). On D 6, mice were injected intravenously with [(3) H]-methyl thymidine. The draining auricular lymph nodes were removed, and the incorporation of [(3) H]-methyl thymidine was compared with that of vehicle-treated control mice. A stimulation index (SI) relative to the vehicle-treated control value was derived. The sensitizing potency of the chemicals tested was determined by estimating the concentration of chemical required to induce a SI of 3 (EC 3). RESULTS: All three chemicals provoked positive responses in the LLNA, with dose-dependent increases in proliferation. Maximal SIs recorded were 6. 8 +/- 1. 8, 6. 5 +/- 1. 2, and 5 +/- 1. 0 at 5 % for ammonium, <b>sodium</b> or potassium <b>persulfate,</b> respectively. The EC 3 values were 1. 9 %, 0. 9 %, and 2. 4 % for ammonium, <b>sodium,</b> and potassium <b>persulfates,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{activated}} form of C 4 (C 4 b) 1 is {{an essential}} component of two key enzymes of the classical pathway, C 3 convertase (C 4 b 2 a) and C 5 convertase (C 4 b 2 a 3 b). The function of these enzymes is limited by the decay of C 2 a, which is very labile at 37 °C. There is also evidence that another serum enzyme, C 3 b-inactivator (C 3 bINA) can inhibit the activity of cell-bound C 4 b 2 a, probably by cleaving C 4 b (1). Some uncertainty exists regarding the activity of C 3 bINA on C 4 b. According to Shiraishi and Stroud (2) the activity of C 3 bINA on fluid phase C 4 b required a high molecular weight cofactor. Recent studies of Pangburn et al. (3) have shown that cleavage of C 4 b requires a different protein (fllH) as an essential cofactor. Mouse (4) and human serum (5) contain a high molecular weight protein with several combining sites for C 4 b. This protein, named C 4 -hinding protein (C 4 -bp), differs from all known complement components and inactivators. Because in mouse and human serum most or all C 4 b generated by activation of the complement cascade is found in combination with C 4 -bp, we considered the possibility that C 4 -bp might be the cofactor which modulates the function and/or assembly of C 3 and C 5 convertase in the fluid phase.

Thermal activation results {{in the production of}} a highly reactive sulfate free radical (SO 4 center dot-). The method of half-lives was used to determine the reaction order with respect to TCE. This was accomplished by conducting a series of kinetic experiments and keeping in great excess (and therefore essentially constant) the <b>sodium</b> <b>persulfate</b> concentration while varying the TICE initial concentration. Resulting plots of normalized TCE concentration (C/C-o) vs time were analyzed by polynomial regression analysis. Half-lives were calculated based on the resulting polynomial equations. To determine the reaction order with respect to persulfate, experiments were designed to examine a range of initial persulfate concentrations while maintaining the same initial TICE concentration. These results were also analyzed using polynomial regression analysis. The results of these studies indicate that the degradation rate of TCE by <b>sodium</b> <b>persulfate</b> could be described by the kinetic rate equation -d[TCE]/dt == (5. 59 x 10 (- 4) mM(0. 2) min(- 1)) [TCE](0) [S 2 O 82 -](0. 8) within the limits of the experimental conditions utilized here (i. e., 40 degrees C, ionic strength 0. 1, pH 7, TCE 0. 14 - 0. 52 mM, and S 2 O 82 - 13. 5 - 43. 7 mM).
