40|$|Background: Traumatic {{posterior}} hip subluxation is {{a potentially}} devastating injury {{that is often}} misdiagnosed as a simple hip <b>sprain</b> <b>or</b> <b>strain.</b> The {{purpose of the present}} study was to outline the injury mechanism, pathoanatomy, clinical and radiographic findings, and treatment of traumatic hip subluxation in an athletic population. Methods: Over a nine-year period, eight participants in American football who had sustained a traumatic posterior hip subluxation were evaluated and treated. The injury mechanism, clinical findings, and radiographic findings were reviewed. The mean duration of follow-up was thirty-four months. Results: The most common mechanism of injury was a fall on a flexed, adducted hip. Physical examination revealed painful limitation of hip motion. Initial radiographs demonstrated a characteristic posterior acetabular lip fracture. Ini-tial magnetic resonance images revealed disruption of the iliofemoral ligament, hemarthrosis, and a viable femoral head. Two players were treated acutely with hip aspiration, and all eight players were treated with a six-week regimen of toe-touch weight-bearing with use of crutches. Six players recovered and returned to the previous level of competi-tion. Two players had development of severe osteonecrosis and ultimately required total hip arthroplasty. Conclusion: The pathognomonic radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging triad of posterior acetabular lip frac-ture, iliofemoral ligament disruption, and hemarthrosis defines traumatic posterior hip subluxation. Patients in whom large hemarthroses are diagnosed on magnetic resonance images should undergo acute aspiration, and all player...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} aimed {{to analyze the}} index value trends of injured {{employed}} persons (IEPs) covered in Pakistan Labour Force Surveys from 2001 – 02 to 2012 – 13. Methods: The index value method based on reference years and reference groups was {{used to analyze the}} IEP trends in terms of different criteria such as gender, area, employment status, industry types, occupational groups, types of injury, injured body parts, and treatment received. The Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was also performed to investigate the inter-relationship of different occupational variables. Results: The values of IEP increased {{at the end of the}} studied year in industry divisions such as agriculture, forestry, hunting, and fishing, followed by in manufacturing and construction industry divisions. People associated with major occupations (such as skilled agricultural and fishery workers) and elementary (unskilled) occupations were found to be at an increasing risk of occupational injuries/diseases with an increasing IEP trend. Types of occupational injuries such as <b>sprain</b> <b>or</b> <b>strain,</b> superficial injury, and dislocation increased during the studied years. Major injured parts of body such as upper limb and lower limb found with increasing trend. Types of treatment received, including hospitalization and no treatment, were found to decrease. Increased IEP can be justified due to inadequate health care facilities, especially in rural areas by increased IEP in terms of gender, areas, received treatment, occupational groups and employment status as results found after Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. Conclusion: The increasing trend in the IEP% of the total employed persons due to agrarian activities shows that there is a need to improve health care setups in rural areas of Pakistan...|$|E
40|$|Florida International University's (FIU) Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) {{evaluated}} five saws {{for their}} effectiveness in cutting specially prepared fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactively contaminated glove boxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Milwaukee worm drive circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Milwaukee worm drive circular saw is a hand-held tool with a 7 1 / 4 -inch diameter circular blade for cutting wood. The saw contains a fixed upper and a retractable lower blade guard to prevent access to the blade during use. The unit is operated with an on/off guarded trigger switch; and is supported with a handgrip mounted on top of the saw. An adjustable lever sets the depth of cut. The retractable blade guard permits blind or plunge cuts and protects from blade access during shutdown and blade coast. Kickback, the sudden reaction to a pinched blade, is possible when using this saw and could cause the saw to lift up and out of the work piece toward the operator. Proper work position and firm control of the saw minimizes the potential for a <b>sprain</b> <b>or</b> <b>strain.</b> Care needs to be exercised to support the work piece properly and to not force the tool. Personal noise sampling indicated that one worker was near the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Action Level of 85 decibels (dBA) while the other was at the Action Level with time-weighted averages (TWA's) of 82. 7 and 84. 6 dBA, respectively. These data are not entirely representative as they were gathered during a simulation and not at the actual worksite. Additional sampling should be conducted on-site, but the workers should wear hearing protection until it is determined that it is no longer necessary. Air sampling was performed while the workers dismantled the fiberglass-reinforced crates. The total nuisance dust sample for the Milwaukee circular saw was 36. 07 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m{sup 3 }), which is much higher than the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 15 mg/m{sup 3 } and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 10 mg/m{sup 3 }.

40|$|Background: Football is {{a popular}} female team sport played by {{approximately}} 40 million women in over 100 countries all over the world. In Sweden football is the largest female team sport with more than 56, 000 players over 15 years of age. Aim: The aims of this thesis were to investigate injuries and injury incidences among female non-elite players in second division as well as elite football players in the premiere league in Sweden over an entire football season with special emphases on regional and level differences; to investigate range of motion (ROM) {{at the beginning of}} the football season in relationship to upcoming joint (sprain) and muscle-tendon (strain) injuries; to investigate if the injury incidence varied during the different phases of the menstrual cycle and if there was a difference in injury incidence according to oral contraceptive (OC) pill usage. Material and methods: Thirty teams (n= 522 players) from two different league levels in Sweden, the second division (9 teams from the most Northern league and 9 teams from the most Southern league, comprising 18 teams) and the premiere league (12 teams), were studied during an entire football season. Baseline information was obtained and ROM was measured. During the season menstruation and OC usage, football exposure and injuries were registered. Result: A total of 466 injuries were studied. The overall injury incidence was 9. 6 injuries/ 1000 hours of football in the second division and 4. 6 injuries/ 1000 hours of football in the premiere league. Traumatic injuries were in majority (59 - 69 %), and the most common type of traumatic injury was sprain, mainly to the ankle. The distribution of injuries varied between regions; the number of total injuries as well as the total injury incidence was higher in the northern than southern region in the second division. Both traumatic and overuse injuries occurred mainly during the early preseason and {{at the beginning of the}} competitive spring season. Increased/decreased ROM in the lower extremity did not appear to be a predisposing risk factor for joint (sprain) or muscle-tendon (strain) injuries of the lower extremity. More than half the players began their football season with physical complaints, which in most cases disturbed their football activity. A total of 2 586 menstrual cycles were studied. An increased injuries incidence was noted during the menstrual phase compared to the pre- ovulatory phase as well as during the post-ovulatory phase compared to the pre-ovulatory phase for non-OC users. An increased incidence of traumatic injuries was also noted during the menstrual phase compared to the pre- ovulatory phase for non-OC users. There were no differences between the OC/non-OC groups concerning injury incidence during practice, game or total football. Conclusion: Evidence is presented in this thesis that regional factors as well as play- level are associated with injury incidence. Preseason ROM measurements cannot identify players at risk for upcoming <b>sprain</b> <b>or</b> <b>strain</b> injuries. An increased injury incidence during the menstrual phase was found, however, no significant difference in injury incidence between OC-users and non- users were found.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{accidents}} {{in the period}} 1998 – 2008 reported during harvesting operations in ÖBf AG, Austria’s largest forest enterprise, {{with a focus on}} cable yarding. In total 1888 accidents were recorded with 8. 7 % of these associated with cable yarding activities. The overall accident rate amounted to 36 incidents per million cubic meter extracted by cable yarder. There was a clear spike in accidents between 2 and 3 pm. Most accidents occurred onWednesdays and Mondays (26 and 25 %, respectively). The four months of March, June September and November accounted for 45 % of all accidents. The majority of accidents (63. 2 %) were caused by broken spar and anchor trees, bouncing cables and falling objects. Frequently injured body parts were the extremities such as hand and feet (64 %) and the head and neck area (15. 2 %). Contusions (37. 8 %) are the most common kind of injury followed by bone fractures (12. 8 %), <b>sprain</b> <b>or</b> <b>strains</b> (11. 6 %) and punctures or lacerations (10. 4 %). An average cable yarding accident required 17. 9 days for recovery, compared to the 25. 6 days for manual extraction and 29. 7 days for extraction by means of a tractor or skidder. Accident severity varied among body parts: eye injuries resulted in three lost work days, while injured extremities required 20 days for recovery. During wood extraction, some stems with branches may be unhooked and fall down. In this case, the accidents caused are the most severe needing 27 days for recovery...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSDs) are {{an important}} cause for morbidity in military service. They result in disabilities needing long-term rehabilitation and functional impairment leading to premature discharge from military service. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the incidence and nature of MSDs in Finnish conscripts. Methods Two successive arrivals of 18 – 28 -yr-old male conscripts (N = 955, median age 19) were followed for six months. MSDs, including overuse and acute injuries, treated at the garrison clinic were identified and analysed. Results During the 12 -month study period there were 437 outpatient clinic visits in 955 persons. The occurrence rate was 33 % during 6 -month service while the event-based incidence was 3. 3 per 1000 person-days. Occurrence peaked in summer months. The most common types of MSDs were low back pain (LBP, 20 %), lower limb overuse injuries (16 %) and <b>sprains</b> <b>or</b> <b>strains</b> (13 %). Disorders mostly occurred in combat training in combat gear (40 %) and during marching on foot or bicycle (28 %). Overuse-related MSDs were more prevalent (66 %) than traumatic ones (34 %). One-third (34 %) of the MSDs were recurrent and 66 % were new ones. Disorders of the back and the knee were most frequently recurrent conditions (44 % for both). Fractures, knee ligament ruptures, dislocations and muscle strains accounted for the highest number of service days lost. Twenty-four (2. 5 %) out of 955 conscripts were prematurely discharged due to MSDs. Conclusion Preventive measures during military service should be targeted at decreasing low back pain and lower limb overuse injuries, because these inflict the largest burden of MSDs and tend to have a chronic nature. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{patterns}} and causes of tennis-related injuries using, {{for the first}} time, a nationally representative dataset. Design: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database. Setting: All tennis-related injuries treated in U. S. emergency departments (EDs) from 1990 to 2011 were analyzed. Patients: During the study period, an estimated 492, 002 (95 % CI= 364668 - 619336) individuals, ages 5 to 94 years, presented to U. S. EDs for tennis-related injuries. Assessment of Risk Factors: Independent variables include patient age and gender, mechanism of injury, and location of injury event. Main Outcome Measures: Outcome variables include injury diagnosis, body region injured, disposition from ED, and involvement of the net. Results: Most injuries were sustained by a nonspecific mechanism during play (37. 9 %) and occurred at a sport or recreation facility (83. 4 %). Children ages 5 - 18 years had a higher mean injury rate than adults older than 19 years. The most commonly injured body regions were the lower extremities (42. 2 %) and upper extremities (26. 7 %). <b>Sprains</b> <b>or</b> <b>strains</b> (44. 1 %) were {{the most common type}} of injury. The number of tennis-related injuries decreased by 41. 4 % from 1990 to 2011, and the rate of these injuries decreased by 45. 2 %- 53. 4 % during a 12 - 18 year period. Among the 3. 4 % of patients who were admitted to the hospital, two-thirds (65. 6 %) involved patients 56 years of age or older. Conclusions: Despite the decrease in tennis-related injuries, the growing popularity of this sport warrants increased efforts to prevent injuries, especially among child and older adult participants.

40|$|Background There {{are several}} {{plausible}} mechanisms whereby either short or long term exposure to pollution {{can increase the}} risk of stroke. Over the last decade, several studies have reported associations between short-term (day-to-day) increases in ambient air pollution and stroke. The findings from a smaller number of studies that have looked at long-term exposure to air pollution and stroke have been mixed. Most of these epidemiological studies have assigned exposure to air pollution based on place of residence, but these assignments are typically based on relatively coarse spatial resolutions. To date, few studies have evaluated medium-term exposures (i. e, exposures over the past season or year). To address this research gap, we evaluated associations between highly spatially resolved estimates of ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), a marker of traffic pollution, and emergency department visits for stroke in Edmonton, Canada. Methods This was a case-control study with cases defined as those who presented to an Edmonton area hospital emergency department between 2007 and 2009 with an acute ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. Controls were patients who presented to the same emergency departments for lacerations, <b>sprains,</b> <b>or</b> <b>strains.</b> A land-use regression model provided estimates of NO 2 that were assigned to the place of residence. Logistic regression methods were used to estimate odds ratios for stroke in relation to an increase in the interquartile range of NO 2 (5  ppb), adjusted for age, sex, meteorological variables, and neighborhood effects. Results The study included 4, 696 stroke (cases) and 37, 723 injury patients (controls). For all strokes combined, there was no association with NO 2. Namely, the odds ratio associated with an interquartile increase in NO 2 was 1. 01 (95 % confidence interval {CI}: 0. 94 - 1. 08). No associations were evident for any of the stroke subtypes examined. Conclusion When combined with our earlier work in Edmonton, our findings suggest that day-to-day fluctuations in air pollution {{increase the risk of}} ischemic stroke during the summer season, while medium term exposures are unrelated to stroke risk. The findings for medium term exposure should be interpreted cautiously due to limited individual-level risk factor data...|$|R

The crash-involved vehicles were classified by type (passenger car or light truck/van) and age (pre- 1995 or 2002 -newer). Moreover, the injury types, hospital charges, and length of stay of the crash-involved occupants were considered. Finally, logistic regression models were developed to compare the injury odds ratios {{for each of the}} four types of crashes. Some of the findings included the following: • New vehicles are more likely to be involved in property damage only crashes while old vehicles are more likely to be involved in all levels of injury crashes (fatal, incapacitating, non-incapacitating, and possible injury). • The highest emergency department charges are associated with rollover and head-on crashes. • For head-on crashes, the emergency department charges were significantly lower for occupants of new vehicles than occupants of old vehicles. • In angle crashes, occupants of new vehicles were less likely to suffer spine and back injuries <b>or</b> <b>sprains</b> and <b>strains.</b> Occupants of new vehicles were more likely to suffer extremity injuries, fractures, and superficial contusions. • In angle crashes, LTV occupants were more likely to suffer injuries to the spine and back area <b>or</b> <b>sprains</b> and <b>strains</b> than passenger car occupants; LTV occupants were less likely to suffer superficial contusions than passenger car occupants...|$|R
