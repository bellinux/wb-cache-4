Two car parks (on the A308) adjoin the Windsor entrance (these may be closed in winter due to flooding etc.). The car parks near the Old Windsor entrance are managed by the National Trust which imposes a charge for parking, however this is free for members. The car park at the Runnymede Pleasure Ground further along the A308 at the Egham entrance to the meades is managed by Runnymede Borough Council which imposes a <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges.</b> Runnymede lies on the Thames Path National Trail.

5000|$|In 1863 {{the working}} {{arrangement}} between the owning {{company and the}} GS&WR was due to expire. Much work remained {{to be done in}} completing the stations, and the A&MJR had been paying its shareholders handsome dividends but had failed to generate capital to complete the works. An impasse arose over the renewal of the working arrangement, and negotiations to absorb the A&MJR into the G&SWR also failed. The negotiations dragged on and the G&SWR agreed a [...] "perpetual working agreement" [...] with a <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> between 39% and 45% of gross receipts. The G&SWR may have been motivated to concede better terms by the fear that the Caledonian Railway might step in. The new terms were ratified by Act of Parliament of 13 July 1863. The A&MJR chairman was Rigby Wason, and his tenacity is credited with getting good terms for his company.|$|E
