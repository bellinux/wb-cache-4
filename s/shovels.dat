50|$|A power <b>shovel</b> (also {{stripping}} <b>shovel</b> or front <b>shovel</b> {{or electric}} mining <b>shovel)</b> is a bucket-equipped machine, usually electrically powered, used for digging and loading earth or fragmented rock and for mineral extraction.|$|R
5|$|Gunpowder {{was used}} to loosen the marl, which was then removed by steam <b>shovels.</b> Various other steam-powered devices were used to remove mud, clay and rock. All the hard {{material}} was used for embankments and quay roads around the docks. The mud was placed behind these, and in trenches to seal the works from water, using special side-tipping wagons.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{earthworks}} {{were built}} up from local chalk; the ditches dug around the fortification {{would not have}} provided enough for the mound itself, and local tradition suggests {{that much of the}} earth was quarried instead from the nearby Gallows Pits in the town. The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging with wooden <b>shovels,</b> and probably without pickaxes. It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24,000 man days of effort to build.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into eight caverns, which must be {{explored}} whilst avoiding death from enemy attacks, cave-ins, and fatal falls. The player-character, Digger T. Rock, can utilise multiple tools such as ladders, <b>shovels,</b> armour, and explosives, {{which can be used}} to explore and discover new areas. Monsters such as moles, mosquitoes, and dragons seek to kill the player-character. Digger's only defence is his shovel, which can be used to attack enemies as well as mining stone. The player starts the game with three lives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shovel</b> Diver (Shoberu Daibā): A {{combination}} of the Rescue Diver with the Rescue <b>Shovel.</b> Its Final Rescue is a crash attack called <b>Shovel</b> Crash, in which its <b>shovel</b> claw pulls the target out away from any obstructions for easy dispatching.|$|R
50|$|Roth criticised the <b>shovel</b> example on {{the basis}} that the <b>shovel</b> is not a factor of {{production}} independent of human capital because somebody invented it, and the <b>shovel</b> cannot act independently: the physical productiveness of the <b>shovel</b> before labour is added to it is zero.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{subsoiling}} <b>shovel</b> is {{the main}} tool for subsoiling in conservation tillage and its quality directly influences the effect of subsoiling. In this paper, based on the subsoiling <b>shovel</b> retrofit design, the research achievements of bionic techniques were applied to design the subsoiling <b>shovel,</b> and the three-dimensional models of modified subsoiling <b>shovel</b> and bionic subsoiling <b>shovel</b> were created through the software of Pro/E. Then apply Finite Element Method was used to do analog simulations for the two kinds of subsoiler. Analysis Result showed that the bionic subsoiling <b>shovel</b> reduced working resistance and the obvious phenomenon of stress concentration did not appear {{at the tip of}} bionic subsoiling <b>shovel.</b> Development design of bionic subsoiling <b>shovel</b> can effectively reduce the operation energy consumption and create great economic benefits...|$|R
5|$|Viva Piñata is a first-person life {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player restores and tends to a neglected garden on Piñata Island. The player uses gardening tools, such as <b>shovels</b> and watering cans, to plough their garden, sow seeds, create ponds, and sculpt the garden to their liking. When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden will attract a black-and-white outline of a given piñata species. After fulfilling additional requirements, the piñata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version.|$|E
5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. When they reach the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take <b>shovels</b> and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|During the night, the American artillery, {{under the}} command of Henry Knox, {{occasionally}} fired shells into Trenton to keep the British on edge. As Cornwallis had, Washington also called for a council of war. Using the road leading to Princeton, and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there. By 2am on January 3, the army {{was on its way to}} Princeton. Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and <b>shovels</b> to make the British think they were digging in. By morning, these men too had evacuated, and when the British came to attack, all of the American troops were gone.|$|E
50|$|The Marion Steam <b>Shovel,</b> {{also known}} as the Le Roy Steam <b>Shovel,</b> is a {{historic}} Model 91 steam <b>shovel</b> manufactured by the Marion Steam <b>Shovel</b> and Dredge Company of Marion, Ohio. It is located on Gulf Road in the Town of Le Roy, New York, United States.|$|R
40|$|The <b>shovel</b> depth {{generally}} {{references to}} the depth of material pile operation, or according to operators’ experiences to determine the depth while loader <b>shovelling</b> original raw soil. In view of this situation, {{the relationship between the}} <b>shovel</b> depth of loader bucket and <b>shovel</b> resistance is analyzed in this paper, and a mathematical model is constructed for calculating the time of the material filling up the bucket. Taking ZL 50 loader as an example, and combined with the relationship curve of the bucket work resistance and the <b>shovel</b> depth, and the traction characteristic curve of I gear, the relationship of the driving speed and <b>shovel</b> depth is worked out, on the basis of this, the mathematical model of optimization algorithm of the <b>shovel</b> depth is established. The result shows that there is an optimal <b>shovel</b> depth when loader <b>shovelling</b> original raw soil, while the operation efficiency of loader is the highest, and there is a best operation depth range of loader <b>shovel,</b> in which work efficiency of loader changes a little, this will bring great convenience to the operation for the driver.  </p...|$|R

5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than <b>shovels</b> and spades, {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.|$|E
5|$|The large {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 13th century. The {{south side of the}} church has memorials from the 18th century to Henry Morris, Rector of Llanfachraeth, and his sons Richard and Owen, and also some 19th-century memorials. A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also noted a memorial to Hugh Wynne, who died in 1714: he was Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral and rector of Aberffraw and Trefdraeth. Two copper collecting <b>shovels</b> with wooden handles were given to St Beuno's in 1777 by Hugh Williams, the rector.|$|E
5|$|The road charged 25 cents ($ {{in modern}} dollars) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches. The tolls, {{collected}} at three separate gates, primarily reflected {{the cost of}} retaining a large crew of men with snow <b>shovels</b> to keep the road open in wintertime; {{they were able to}} keep the road open through its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full speed, with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10–25 hours and five changes of horses.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{ordered that}} the excess baggage {{be taken to}} Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground had frozen, making it {{possible}} to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was complete, with the baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and <b>shovels</b> to make the British think that they were digging in. Before dawn, these men were to join up with the main army.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using <b>shovels</b> by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott <b>shovels</b> as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E

5|$|Planning for {{the lake}} began in 1987. The main {{goal was to}} meet Southern California seasonal, drought and {{emergency}} needs. MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location, and began construction planning in 1993. Construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams. With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The <b>shovels,</b> loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{was fought}} over three days between 3 and 5 January 1941, {{as part of}} Operation Compass, the first {{military}} operation of the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. It was the first battle {{of the war in}} which an Australian Army formation took part, the first to be commanded by an Australian general and the first to be planned by an Australian staff. Major General Iven Mackay's 6th Division assaulted the strongly held Italian fortress of Bardia, Libya, assisted by air support and naval gunfire, and under the cover of an artillery barrage. The 16th Infantry Brigade attacked at dawn from the west, where the defences were known to be weak. Sappers blew gaps in the barbed wire with Bangalore torpedoes and filled in and broke down the sides of the anti-tank ditch with picks and <b>shovels.</b> This allowed the infantry and 23 Matilda II tanks of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment to enter the fortress and capture all their objectives, along with 8,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} {{scrambled to}} their feet and rushed forward while the sappers hurried to break down the sides of the antitank ditch with picks and <b>shovels.</b> They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E
40|$|<b>Shovelling</b> of the incisors is {{considered}} to be a polygenic inheritable trait. <b>Shovelling</b> differs considerably between groups of racial populations but is relatively stable within each group. Presence or absence of <b>shovelling</b> helps in racial identification and in exploration of ancestry. Periapical radiographs of patients of several nationalities from Asian and African continents were obtained. <b>Shovelling</b> and invaginations associated with the shovel-shaped incisors was studied according to nationality. Results indicated that the incidence of <b>shovelling</b> in Syrians, Jordanians, Palestinians and Filipinos was 5 – 6 per cent. In Saudi Arabians, Pakistanis and Indians, the incidence of <b>shovelling</b> was 10 – 12 per cent. Among Yemenis, Sudanese and Egyptians, the incidence of <b>shovelling</b> was 20 – 25 percent.
