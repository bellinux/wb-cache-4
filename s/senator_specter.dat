He was the longest-serving of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senators, and it was said that he had done more for the state than anyone else, {{with the possible exception of}} Benjamin Franklin himself.

The DOJ Inspector General recognized that Gonzales was in the difficult position of testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about a highly classified program in an open forum On July 31, 2007, Director of National Intelligence J. Michael McConnell confirmed, in a letter to <b>Senator</b> <b>Specter,</b> that the activities publicly referred to [...] "as the TSP did not exhaust the activities subject to periodic authorization by the President. [...] Gonzales was then able to explain publicly, on August 1, 2007, that while TSP [...] "was an extraordinary activity that presented novel and difficult issues and was, as , the subject of intense deliberations within the Department," [...] the aspect of Mr. Comey's advise [...] that prompted the Gang of Eight meeting on March 10, 2004, was not about TSP, but was about another or other aspects of the intelligence activities in question, which activities remain classified. [...] Comey himself acknowledged that the nature of the disagreement at issue on March 10, 2004, is [...] "a very complicated matter", but he declined to discuss in a public setting.

[...] This passage has been historically interpreted to mean that the right of habeas corpus is inherently established. Gonzales dissents from the consensus view, siding with Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who said [...] "though the Constitution prohibits Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus except during times of rebellion or invasion, this provision was probably meant to keep Congress from suspending the writ and preventing state courts from releasing individuals who were wrongfully imprisoned. [...] The constitutional provision does not create a right to habeas corpus; rather federal statutes [...]" [...] Additionally, [...] "the Constitutional Convention prevented Congress from obstructing the states courts' ability to grant the writ, but {{did not try to}} create a federal constitutional right to habeas corpus". [...] "After all, if the suspension clause itself were an affirmative grant of procedural rights to those held in federal custody, there would have been little need for the first Congress to enact as it did, habeas corpus protections in the Judiciary Act of 1789.
