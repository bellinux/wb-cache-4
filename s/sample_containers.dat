5000|$|Swinging head (or {{swinging}} bucket) centrifuges, {{in contrast}} to fixed-angle centrifuges, have a hinge where the <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> {{are attached to the}} central rotor. This allows all of the samples to swing outwards as the centrifuge is spun.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Westphalen {{faced her}} first big medical {{emergency}} aboard the seaQuest when Darwin, the ships resident dolphin, was stricken with a mysterious ailment during an investigative mission near a black smoker. She {{was unable to}} cure Darwin, despite assistance from Bridgers old friend and marine biologist, Malcolm Lansdowne. Lansdowne was able to determine that it was bacteria from the black smoker that had infected Darwin, and would have infected Bridger as well had she not frantically contacted the sea deck imploring Bridger not to touch the <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> from the smoker.|$|E
50|$|The Earth Re-entry Capsule (ERC) — fully passive concept: {{ballistic}} re-entry, no parachute, {{hard landing}} on ground with maximum impact deceleration of 1700 g to the sample. Modeling of the thermal design indicates the <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> temperature during reentry {{would be less}} than 40 C. A location beacon would be included within <b>sample</b> <b>container.</b>|$|R
40|$|The "Hayabusa" {{re-entry}} capsule {{was safely}} carried into the clean room of Sagamihara Planetary Sample Curation Facility in JAXA on June 18, 2010. After executing computed tomographic (CT) scanning, removal of heat shield, and surface cleaning of <b>sample</b> <b>container,</b> the <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> was enclosed into the clean chamber. After opening the <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> and residual gas sampling {{in the clean}} chamber, optical observation, sample recovery, sample separation for initial analysis will be performed. This curation work is continuing for several manths with some selected member of Hayabusa Asteroidal Sample Preliminary Examination Team (HASPET). We report here on the 'Hayabusa' capsule recovery operation, and transportation and acceptance at the curation facility of the Hayabusa re-entry capsule...|$|R
50|$|SOFIA {{comprises}} a {{multiwell plate}} <b>sample</b> <b>container,</b> an automated means for successively transporting {{samples from the}} multiwell plate <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> to a transparent capillary contained within a sample holder, an excitation source in optical communication with the sample, wherein radiation from the excitation source is directed {{along the length of}} the capillary, and wherein the radiation induces a signal which is emitted from the sample, and, at least one linear array.|$|R
50|$|A DTA {{consists}} of a sample holder, thermocouples, <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> and a ceramic or metallic block; a furnace; a temperature programmer; and a recording system. The key feature is the existence of two thermocouples connected to a voltmeter. One thermocouple is placed in an inert material such as Al2O3, while the other is placed {{in a sample of}} the material under study. As the temperature is increased, there will be a brief deflection of the voltmeter if the sample is undergoing a phase transition. This occurs because the input of heat will raise the temperature of the inert substance, but be incorporated as latent heat in the material changing phase.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second problem}} occurs as {{the sample is}} removed from the water source and begins to {{establish}} chemical equilibrium with its new surroundings - the sample container. <b>Sample</b> <b>containers</b> must be made of materials with minimal reactivity with substances to be measured; and pre-cleaning of <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> is important. The water sample may dissolve part of the sample container and any residue on that container, or chemicals dissolved in the water sample may sorb onto the sample container and remain there when the water is poured out for analysis. Similar physical and chemical interactions may take place with any pumps, piping, or intermediate devices used to transfer the water sample into the sample container. Water collected from depths below the surface will normally be held at the reduced pressure of the atmosphere; so gas dissolved in the water may escape into unfilled space {{at the top of the}} container. Atmospheric gas present in that air space may also dissolve into the water sample. Other chemical reaction equilibria may change if the water sample changes temperature. Finely divided solid particles formerly suspended by water turbulence may settle to the bottom of the sample container, or a solid phase may form from biological growth or chemical precipitation. Microorganisms within the water sample may biochemically alter concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds. Changing carbon dioxide concentrations may alter pH and change solubility of chemicals of interest. These problems are of special concern during measurement of chemicals assumed to be significant at very low concentrations.|$|E
50|$|The Modular Equipment Transporter (MET) was a two-wheeled, hand-pulled {{vehicle that}} {{was used as an}} {{equipment}} hauling device on traverses across the lunar surface. Designed after Apollo 12 astronauts Pete Conrad and Alan Bean had difficulties lugging their equipment significant distances to and from their Lunar Module, the MET primarily functioned as a portable workbench with a place for hand tools and their carrier, cameras, spare camera magazines, rock sample bags, environmental <b>sample</b> <b>containers,</b> and the portable magnetometer with its sensor and tripod. It was carried on Apollo 14 and planned to be used on Apollo 15, but was used only on Apollo 14, since Apollo 15's mission was changed {{to be the first to}} employ the motorized Lunar Roving Vehicle, which transported both astronauts and equipment.|$|E
40|$|A low gravity {{exothermic}} heating/cooling apparatus is disclosed {{for processing}} materials in space which includes an insulated casing and a sample support carried within the casing which support a <b>sample</b> <b>container.</b> An exothermic heat source includes {{a plurality of}} segments of exothermic material stacked one upon another to produce a desired temperature profile when ignited. The <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> is arranged within {{the core of the}} stacked exothermic heating material. Igniters are spaced vertically along the axis of the heating material to ignite the exothermic material at spaced points to provide total rapid burn and release of heat. To rapidly cool and quench the heat, a source of liquid carbon dixoide is provided which is conveyed through a conduit and a metering orifice into a distribution manifold where the carbon dioxide is gasified and dispersed around the exothermic heating material and the <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> via tubes for rapidly cooling the material sample...|$|R

25|$|The sample return mission {{would be}} {{designed}} to break the chain of contact between Mars and {{the exterior of the}} <b>sample</b> <b>container,</b> for instance, by sealing the returned container inside another larger container in the vacuum of space before return to Earth. In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the current plan is to return the capsule to the Earth without the use of parachutes: the capsule will fall at terminal velocity and the impact will be cushioned by the capsule's thermal protection system. The <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> would {{be designed to}} withstand the force of the impact.|$|R
5000|$|The Enterprise in {{the process}} of {{transporting}} Mikulak biological tissue samples intended for use in combating an epidemic of Correllium fever on Nahmi IV. The transport of the samples is delicate, and when they find one of the <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> is leaking, they are forced to destroy it to prevent the contamination of the other samples. LaForge tells Riker he is concerned that one of his engineers, Reginald Barclay, has been underperforming and notes that he is late to help with the sample transport. What LaForge does not realize is that Barclay has been in the holodeck acting in a simulation of other Enterprise crew members, avoiding contact with their real counterparts. LaForge requests that Barclay be transferred from the Enterprise but Picard recommends that LaForge take Barclay on as a [...] "pet project".|$|E
5000|$|Sample {{preservation}} may partially {{resolve the}} second problem. A common procedure is keeping samples cold {{to slow the}} rate of chemical reactions and phase change, and analyzing the sample as soon as possible; but this merely minimizes the changes rather than preventing them. A useful procedure for determining influence of <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> during delay between sample collection and analysis involves preparation for two artificial samples {{in advance of the}} sampling event. One sample container is filled with water known from previous analysis to contain no detectable amount of the chemical of interest. This sample, called a [...] "blank", is opened for exposure to the atmosphere when the sample of interest is collected, then resealed and transported to the laboratory with the sample for analysis to determine if sample holding procedures introduced any measurable amount of the chemical of interest. The second artificial sample is collected with the sample of interest, but then [...] "spiked" [...] with a measured additional amount of the chemical of interest at the time of collection. The blank and spiked samples are carried with the sample of interest and analyzed by the same methods at the same times to determine any changes indicating gains or losses during the elapsed time between collection and analysis.|$|E
5000|$|NAPE-PLD is {{an enzyme}} {{activity}} - a phospholipase, acting on phospholipids {{found in the}} cell membrane. It is not homology but the chemical outcome of its activity that classes it as phospholipase D. The enzymatic activity was discovered and characterized {{in a series of}} experiments culminating in the 2004 publication of a biochemical purification scheme from which peptide sequencing could be accomplished. [...] Researchers homogenized (finely ground) hearts from 150 rats and subjected the resulting crude lysate to sucrose sedimentation at 105,000 x g to separate out the cell membranes from the remainder of the cell. The integral membrane proteins were then solubilized using octyl glucoside and subjected to four column chromatography steps (HiTrap SP HP cation-exchange column, HiTrap Q anion-exchange column, HiTrap Blue affinity column, Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite column). Each of these separates the different types of membrane proteins into different <b>sample</b> <b>containers</b> when the proteins are eluted from the column over time, and by measuring the activity of samples in each container it was possible to track which ones received the active enzyme. Measurement of the enzyme activity was done by thin layer chromatography of a radioactive substrate sensitive to the NAPE-PLD enzymatic activity: Cleavage of the substrate affected where it appeared on the plate when the radiation was detected on a bioimaging analyzer.|$|E

50|$|Part of {{the sample}} return mission would be to prevent contact between the Martian {{environment}} and {{the exterior of the}} <b>sample</b> <b>container.</b> In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the current plan is to use the thermal protection system to cushion the capsule upon impact (at terminal velocity). The <b>sample</b> <b>container</b> will be designed to withstand the force of the impact. To receive the returned samples, NASA proposed a specially designed Biosafety Level 4 containment facility, the Mars Sample Return Receiving facility (MSRRF). Not knowing what properties (e.g., size) any Martian organisms might exhibit is a complication in design of such a facility.|$|R
