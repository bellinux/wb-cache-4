5|$|In {{the postwar}} period, De Soto {{continued}} {{to serve with}} the Navy, mostly in South American waters, until resold to her original owners in 1868 for resumption of service as a passenger ship. <b>She</b> <b>caught</b> fire and was burned to the waterline in December 1870.|$|E
5|$|Portraits of Mary {{show that}} she had a small, oval-shaped head, a long, graceful neck, bright auburn hair, hazel-brown eyes, under heavy lowered eyelids and finely arched brows, smooth pale skin, a high forehead, and regular, firm features. She was {{considered}} a pretty child and later, as a woman, strikingly attractive. At some point in her infancy or childhood, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> smallpox, but it did not mark her features.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} ship Scotia was requisitioned {{during the}} Great War, and saw {{service as a}} freighter. On 18 January 1916 <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> fire, and was burned out on a sandbank in the Bristol Channel. One hundred years after Bruce, a 2003 expedition, in a modern version of Scotia, used information collected by the SNAE {{as a basis for}} examining climate change in South Georgia during the past century. This expedition asserted that its contribution to the international debate on global warming would be a fitting testament to the SNAE's pioneering research.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} Yangwu drifted as the French fired {{on her as}} <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> fire and sank. The victory of the French forces at Foochow was decisive, with losses {{estimated}} either at six or 12 personnel with 27 missing. The Chinese losses were far greater, at 521 killed, 150 wounded {{and a large number}} missing after the battle. The bombardment of the arsenal lasted for two days before the French ships headed back down the river, destroying any forts they encountered on the way.|$|E
5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable to {{conceive}} children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E

5|$|Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American film actress, director, producer, and writer. Howard {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, {{but left}} before graduating {{to take on}} roles on Broadway. During a performance of As You Like It where Howard portrayed Rosalind, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> the attention of director M. Night Shyamalan, and he cast her in what would be her breakout film, the psychological thriller The Village (2004) {{and then in the}} fantasy thriller Lady in the Water (2006). Her performance in Kenneth Branagh’s film adaptation of As You Like It (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 2006 she co-wrote and directed the short film Orchids.|$|E
5|$|Evelyn is a {{character}} that appears in flashback sequences in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. She is voiced and motion captured by Merle Dandridge. She is a celebrated historian and knew and worked with Cassandra Morgan, Nate and Sam's mother. One night, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> the two boys breaking into her house {{when they went to}} retrieve their mother's belongings, but decided to share with them what their mother found. Just as the police arrive at the scene, Evelyn tells the boys that she will buy them some time, but suddenly collapses. She was a heavy smoker, and died from a lung disease and the boys are associated with her death.|$|E
5|$|She {{then took}} up {{wheelchair}} basketball, playing for GRBK Gothenburg in the Swedish league, but Sweden had no national women's team. She spent two semesters studying German in Insbruck, {{but there was}} no wheelchair basketball team there, and she began playing for USC Munich, initially for their second team. There, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> the attention of Holger Glinicki, the coach of the German national team, who asked her if she would like to play for the German national team. She took German citizenship, a relatively painless procedure for an athlete, and made the German national team, which went on to win gold at the 2011 European Championships in Nazareth, Israel, defeating the Netherlands in the final, 48-42.|$|E
50|$|After <b>she</b> was <b>caught,</b> <b>she</b> {{was sentenced}} in 1972 to 10 {{additional}} years for escape, but her death sentence was commuted {{to life in}} prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment as unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972).|$|R

5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the Catalogue. <b>She</b> <b>caught</b> Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, was surely present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against South Africa, Healy was {{elevated}} two positions to No. 7. Coming in upon {{the fall of}} Cameron, her partner Sarah Elliott was then run out without further addition to the score. Healy hit one boundary and was then out for 8 from 6 balls at 7/151. Her dismissal {{was part of a}} sudden collapse as Australia lost 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. Healy did not make a dismissal as Australia completed a 22-run win. In the final group match against the West Indies, Healy came in at 6/111 and hit 12 from 8 balls, before being caught from the final ball of the innings as Australia finished on 7/133. She had put on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar. <b>She</b> <b>caught</b> Deandra Dottin from the bowling of Perry for a golden duck as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten {{at the top of their}} quartet.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{about life}} in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) {{describes}} the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> a whiff of her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At {{the end of the}} day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was sent}} to the Mediterranean in May 1795 under Captain John Pakenham, who had taken command in August the {{previous}} year. Joining Admiral William Hotham's fleet on 14June, Gibraltar fought in an action off the Hyères Islands in July. The fleet was re-victualling in San Fiorenzo bay on 8July when a small squadron under Commodore Horatio Nelson approached, followed by the French Fleet from Toulon. The British fleet was not able to put to sea immediately due to contrary winds but was spotted by the French, who abandoned their chase. Hotham finished refitting and supplying his ships, and finally managed to set off after his quarry at 21:00; almost twelve hours later. Following a storm, the British were carrying out repairs when they sighted the French fleet at dawn on 13July. At 03:45 Hotham gave the order to make all possible sail in pursuit of their enemy, five miles off and heading for Fréjus. The two fleets were close enough to exchange fire at 08:00 when the British van engaged the rearmost French ships, one of which struck after six hours. However, <b>she</b> <b>caught</b> fire and exploded before the British could take possession of her. Just as Gibraltar was joining the action, Hotham signalled to disengage, believing the fleet to be running out of sea-room but being too far back to see that this was not the case. Hotham resigned his position early the following year and was eventually replaced by Admiral John Jervis.|$|E
