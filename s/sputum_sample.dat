40|$|Pyrazinamide is a {{first-line}} {{drug for}} treating tuberculosis, but pyrazinamide resistance testing is usually {{too slow to}} guide initial therapy, so some patients receive inappropriate therapy.

40|$|SummaryInduced sputum is a {{non-invasive}} {{sampling technique}} {{for the analysis}} of airway inflammation in various lung diseases and comprises valuable potential for the identification of biomarkers and therapeutic targets by molecular methods. In the context of biobanking with preservation of induced <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> for subsequent analyses we applied the HEPES-glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent protection effect (HOPE) -technique for preparation of induced <b>sputum</b> <b>samples.</b> Induced <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> of 20 patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 12 healthy controls were collected.

Immunostaining of paraffin-block sections for interleukin- 8, interleukin- 17, myeloperoxidase, matrixmetalloproteinase- 9, CD 68, and CD 8 revealed distinct signals without antigen retrieval. Moreover, RNA was extracted and successfully used for transcription microarray analysis. <b>Sputum</b> <b>samples</b> preserved by the HOPE-technique display a tool to address scientific approaches in pulmonary research, which can enable the identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in respiratory diseases...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} Legionella cause {{water-based}} infections resulting in severe pneumonia. Here we analyze and compare the bacterial microbiome of <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> from pneumonia patients {{in relation to the}} presence and abundance {{of the genus}} Legionella. The prevalence of Legionella species was determined by culture, PCR, and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Nine <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> out of the 133 analyzed were PCR-positive using Legionella genus-specific primers. Only one sample was positive by culture. Illumina MiSeq 16 S rRNA gene sequencing analyses of Legionella-positive and Legionella-negative <b>sputum</b> <b>samples,</b> confirmed that indeed, Legionella was present in the PCR-positive <b>sputum</b> <b>samples.</b> This approach allowed the identification of the sputum microbiome at the genus level, and for Legionella genus at the species and sub-species level. 42 % of the <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> were dominated by Streptococcus. Legionella was never the dominating genus and was always accompanied by other respiratory pathogens. Interestingly, <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> that were Legionella positive were inhabited by aquatic bacteria that have been observed in an association with amoeba, indicating that amoeba might have transferred Legionella from the drinking water together with its microbiome.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to set up a rapid phage assay for the testing of drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, streptomycin, and ciprofloxacin, directly on decontaminated <b>sputum</b> <b>samples.</b> MethodsMueller–Hinton broth was used instead of 7 H 9 broth to make the method more economical. Vancomycin and polymyxin B were added to the concentrated <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> to reduce the bacterial contamination. The phage assay on decontaminated <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> was compared with the proportion method using M. tuberculosis isolates from the same <b>sputum</b> <b>samples.</b> ResultsPhage assay results were available within 48 h for rifampin and streptomycin and within 72 h for all the other drugs. In contrast the proportion method required 4 – 6 weeks from the primary cultures. The sensitivity of the phage assay was in the range of 93 % to 100 % and specificity in the range of 96 % to 100 % for all the drugs tested. The interpretation of results was possible for 334 of the 370 (90. 3 %) acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> by the phage assay.

Adults hospitalized with acute respiratory tract illnesses were recruited during the winters of 2008 and 2009.

A total of 83 (44 %) of 189 viral detections were positive by both methods, 43 (23 %) were positive by NTS alone, and 63 (33 %) were positive only with <b>sputum</b> <b>samples.</b> The inclusion of RT-PCR performed with <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> significantly increased the diagnostic yield for respiratory viral infections in adults.

Objective: To evaluate cough of 3 weeks versus 2 weeks duration using two <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> versus three samples in chest symptomatic patients attending the OPD. Study Design: Hospital-based cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: Outpatients (2810) with H/O cough of 3 weeks and 2 weeks duration were screened by subjecting them to sputum microscopy for tuberculosis using two <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> as well as three samples following standard procedure for sputum collection, staining and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) identification. Those on drugs were not included. Results: Using ≥ 2 weeks cough, sputum positivity rate was 12 %, nearly {{as high as the}} sputum positivity among patients with ≥ 3 weeks cough, i. e. 14 %. First sputum smear alone on an average could detect 91. 8 % cases, while the first two sputum smears could detect on an average 96 % cases. The study showed that maximum number of cases was diagnosed by only two sputum smears and added diagnostic value of third specimen was small, i. e. 4 %. High sputum positivity rate using ≥ 2 weeks cough with two <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> was seen. Conclusion: The sensitivity analysis of the study showed that using ≥ 2 weeks cough with two <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> gives almost similar values as ≥ 3 weeks cough with three <b>sputum</b> <b>samples,</b> but this needs further confirmatory results of culture sensitivity. Hence, using ≥ 2 weeks cough with two <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> as the diagnostic criteria for screening of cough patients for TB should be recommended as one way of improving efficient use of scarce resources...|$|R
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{develop a}} rapid, sensitive, and {{reproducible}} {{test for the}} detection of beta lactamase in sputum, and to relate these findings to bacteriological culture results. METHODS [...] One hundred and twenty <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> from inpatients were investigated for beta lactamase activity using the chromogenic cephalosporin nitrocefin. <b>Sputum</b> <b>samples</b> were sonicated and incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C with nitrocefin for up to two hours. Positive results (production of a red colour) were treated with blue sepharose beads to remove albumin (which can cause non-specific hydrolysis of nitrocefin) and retested. Samples were also cultured for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates being tested for beta lactamase production using nitrocefin. All positive <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> and beta lactamase producing isolates were further examined by isoelectric focusing (IEF) to determine isoelectric point(s) (pIs). RESULTS [...] The process of sonication and albumin removal had no demonstrable effect on beta lactamase activity. Forty seven of the 120 <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> were positive on initial testing, and of these, 16 remained positive following removal of albumin. These 16 subsequently yielded 19 beta lactamase producing bacteria. All <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> yielding beta lactamase producing bacteria were also positive on direct nitrocefin testing. On no occasion were <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> positive in the absence of enzyme producing bacteria [...] that is, the test was both 100 % specific and 100 % sensitive. The presence of beta lactamase activity in the <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> was also confirmed using a microbiological method. In 11 <b>sputum</b> <b>samples</b> the beta lactamases detected had similar pI values to the beta lactamases obtained from their bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION [...] Detection of beta lactamase activity in sputum using nitrocefin, after treatment with blue sepharose beads, is a rapid, reproducible test with high specificity and sensitivity. Analytical isoelectric focusing showed that for 11 of the 16 positive sputa, the source of the beta lactamases could be traced to their concurrent bacterial isolates...|$|R
