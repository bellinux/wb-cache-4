40|$|The {{majority}} of weight loss studies fail to standardize {{conditions such as}} diet and exercise via a weight maintenance period prior to commencement of the trial. This study aimed {{to determine whether a}} weight stabilization period is necessary to establish stable baseline hormone concentrations. Fifty-one obese male participants with a body mass index of 30 – 40 kg m? 2 and aged 25 – 54 years underwent 4 weeks on an energy balance diet that was designed to achieve weight stability. Blood samples were collected in the fasting state at commencement and completion of the 4 -week period, and circulating concentrations of 18 commonly measured hormones were determined. During the 4 -week weight maintenance period, participants achieved weight stability within ? 1. 5 ± 0. 2 kg (? 1. 4 ± 0. 2 %) of their initial body weight. Significant reductions in serum insulin (by 18 ± 6. 5 %) and leptin (by 21 ± 6. 0 %) levels occurred, but no significant changes were observed for gut-derived appetite-regulating hormones (ghrelin and peptide YY), nor thyroid, adrenal, gonadal or <b>somatotropic</b> <b>hormones.</b> There were no significant correlations between the change in body weight and the change in circulating concentrations of insulin or leptin over the 4 -week period, indicating that the observed changes were not due to weight loss, albeit significant negative correlations were observed between the changes in body weight and plasma ghrelin and peptide YY levels. This study demonstrates the need for baseline weight maintenance periods to stabilize serum levels of insulin and leptin in studies specifically investigating effects on these parameters in the obese.

40|$|International audienceMutations that {{decrease}} insulin-like {{growth factor}} (IGF) and growth hormone signaling limit body size and prolong lifespan in mice. In vertebrates, these <b>somatotropic</b> <b>hormones</b> {{are controlled by}} the neuroendocrine brain. Hormone-like regulations discovered in nematodes and flies suggest that IGF signals in the nervous system can determine lifespan, but it is unknown whether this applies to higher organisms. Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, we show that brain IGF receptors (IGF- 1 R) efficiently regulate somatotropic development. Partial inactivation of IGF- 1 R in the embryonic brain selectively inhibited GH and IGF-I pathways after birth. This caused growth retardation, smaller adult size, and metabolic alterations, and led to delayed mortality and longer mean lifespan. Thus, early changes in neuroendocrine development can durably modify the life trajectory in mammals. The underlying mechanism {{appears to be an}} adaptive plasticity of somatotropic functions allowing individuals to decelerate growth and preserve resources, and thereby improve fitness in challenging environments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the pig, under-nutrition {{in utero}} causes low birth weight, a {{decrease}} in muscle fiber number, {{and a reduction in}} postnatal growth rate. Low protein intake during gestation and lactation has been demonstrated to increase the loss of body protein and to reduce the visceral organ mass of the newborn piglets. The effect of under-nutrition of pregnant swine on subsequent serum hormones characteristics of their offspring was investigated. The trial involved 16 pregnant MeiShan sows. The swine were allocated randomly to one of two groups: a treatment group (n= 8) and a control group (n= 8). During gestation and lactation, the diet of the treatment group was decreased to 50 % of their daily protein requirement. The control group was fed 100 % of their daily requirement to support the swine growth throughout gestation and lactation. All of swine were artificial insemination mated. Diets provided similar amounts of metabolizable energy. In this experiment, organ weights of piglets were reported as fresh weight (grams), scaled to empty body weight (EBW; grams per kilogram). Serum hormones of offspring were sampled at 0 d, 15 d and 35 d of lactation. Piglets were slaughtered at 0 d and 35 d of lactation for organ weight determination.

Apart from gonadal steroids and <b>somatotropic</b> <b>hormones,</b> thyroid hormones are known to affect bone maturation and homeostasis and are additional candidate determinants of adult bone mass. Objective: We aimed to investigate between-subject physiological variation in free and total thyroid hormone concentrations, TSH, and thyroid binding globulin (TBG) in relation to parameters of bone mass, geometry, and mineral density in healthy men {{at the age of}} PBM. Design and setting: We recruited 677 healthy male siblings aged 25 - 45 years in a cross-sectional, population-based study. Areal and volumetric bone parameters were determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Total and free thyroid hormones, TBG, and TSH were determined using immunoassays. Results: Free and total thyroid hormone concentrations were inversely associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) at the hip and total body (free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), total T(3) (TT(3)), and total T(4) (TT(4))) and at the spine (FT(3)). TBG was negatively associated with BMC and areal BMD at all sites. At the radius, cortical bone area was inversely associated with TT(3), TT(4), and TBG, and trabecular bone density was inversely associated with free thyroxine, TT(4), and TBG. We observed inverse associations between cortical bone area at the mid-tibia and FT(3), TT(3), TT(4), and TBG. No associations between TSH and DXA or pQCT measurements were found.

40|$|Studies of {{the effects}} of single-gene {{mutations}} on longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus identified homologous, highly conserved signalling pathways that influence ageing. In each of these very distantly related species, single mutations which lead—directly or indirectly—to reduced insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) or insulin/IGF-like signalling (IIS) can produce significant increases in both average and maximal lifespan. In mice, most of the life-extending mutations described to date reduce <b>somatotropic</b> (growth <b>hormone</b> (GH) and IGF- 1) signalling. The reported extensions of longevity are most robust in GH-deficient and GH-resistant mice, while suppression of somatotropic signalling ‘downstream’ of the GH receptor produces effects that are generally smaller and often limited to female animals. This could be due to GH influencing ageing by both IGF- 1 -mediated and IGF- 1 -independent mechanisms. In mutants that have been examined in some detail, increased longevity is associated with various indices of delayed ageing and extended ‘healthspan’. The mechanisms that probably underlie the extension of both lifespan and healthspan of these animals include increased stress resistance, improved antioxidant defences, alterations in insulin signalling (e. g. hypoinsulinaemia combined with improved insulin sensitivity in some mutants and insulin resistance in others), a shift from pro- to anti-inflammatory profile of circulating adipokines, reduced mammalian target of rapamycin-mediated translation and altered mitochondrial function including greater utilization of lipids when compared with carbohydrates...|$|R
40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factor}} I (IGF-I) {{is central to}} the <b>somatotropic</b> (growth <b>hormone)</b> axis. It {{promotes}} tissue growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adulthood. Accumulating evidence from the last decade, however, reveals that circulating levels of IGF-I also significantly affects cognitive brain function. Specifically, the decline of serum IGF-I might be associated with the age-related cognitive decline in elderly people. Moreover, psychiatric and neurological conditions characterized by cognitive impairment may be characterized by altered levels of IGF-I. Some evidence is emerging that interventions that target the GH/IGF-I axis may improve cognitive functioning, at least in deficient states. As there is evidence linking high serum IGF-I levels with cancer risk these interventions should be carefully evaluated. On a cellular and molecular level, IGF-I may be a crucial component of neural homeostasis since disturbed IGF-I input is inevitably linked to perturbed function. Consistent with this, all nerve cells are potential targets of IGF-I actions, including neurons, glia, endothelial, epithelial, and perivascular cells. Indeed, many key cellular processes in the brain are affected by IGF-I's neurotrophic and modulatory actions. We review the regulation by IGF-I of neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity and conclude that serum IGF-I is an important mediator of neuronal growth, survival and function throughout the lifespan. The role of IGF-I in synaptic plasticity render its neurotrophic potential a key target for remediating the cognitive impairment associated with a range of neurological conditions.

Fertile broiler eggs (Arbor Acres, n= 880) were pre-weighed and randomly assigned 1 of 2 incubation treatment groups: i) dark condition (control group), and ii) monochromatic green light group (560 nm). The monochromatic lighting systems sourced from light-emitting diode lamps were equalised at the intensity of 15 lux (lx) at eggshell level. The dark condition was set as a commercial control from day one until hatching. After hatch, 120 day-old male chicks from each group were housed under white light with an intensity of 30 lx at bird-head level.

METHODS: Two groups of 152 young boys (age: 13. 3 +/- 0. 9 years) participated in this study: (1) 91 soccer players, and (2) 61 non-athletic boys used as control subjects. The bone mineral density (BMD) and the bone mineral content (BMC) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Pubertal stages were assessed, and serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3), growth hormone (GH) and the total testosterone were measured. RESULTS: The BMD and BMC for whole body, lumbar spine, femoral neck, pelvis and lower limbs were higher in soccer players than in controls (p< 0. 001). In early puberty, the soccer players also exhibited significantly greater BMD and BMC in the whole body and in weight-bearing bones compared with the controls (p< 0. 001). However, there was no intersubject variability due to puberty in either BMD or BMC. The pubescent soccer players had significantly higher hormonal concentrations of IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 3 than their counterpart controls (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} an {{inherited}} neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor, cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. Patients exhibit other symptoms including sleep and mood disturbances, muscle atrophy {{and weight loss}} which {{may be linked to}} hypothalamic pathology and dysfunction of hypothalamo-pituitary axes. We studied neuroendocrine profiles of corticotropic, somatotropic and gonadotropic hypothalamo-pituitary axes hormones over a 24 -hour period in controlled environment in 15 healthy controls, 14 premanifest and 13 stage II/III Huntington's disease subjects. We also quantified fasting levels of vasopressin, oestradiol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, thyroid stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, free total thyroxine, prolactin, adrenaline and noradrenaline. <b>Somatotropic</b> axis <b>hormones,</b> growth hormone releasing hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1 and insulin-like factor binding protein- 3 were quantified at 06 : 00 (fasting), 15 : 00 and 23 : 00. A battery of clinical tests, including neurological rating and function scales were performed. 24 -hour concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone did not differ significantly between the Huntington's disease group and controls. Daytime growth hormone secretion was similar in control and Huntington's disease subjects. Stage II/III Huntington's disease subjects had lower concentration of post-sleep growth hormone pulse and higher insulin-like growth factor- 1 :growth hormone ratio which did not reach significance. In Huntington's disease subjects, baseline levels of hypothalamo-pituitary axis hormones measured did not significantly differ from those of healthy controls. The relatively small subject group means that the study may not detect subtle perturbations in hormone concentrations. A targeted study of the somatotropic axis in larger cohorts may be warranted. However, the lack of significant results despite many variables being tested does imply that the majority of them do not differ substantially between HD and controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{lymphocyte}} {{composition of}} the thymus and spleen from weaned (4 month old) hypopituitary dwarf Snell-Bagg mice were compared to those of their phenotypically normal littermates and of hormone (<b>somatotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> plus thyroxine) -treated individuals. Detection of cells bearing receptors for peanut agglutinin, physical analysis and measurement of in vitro reactivities to phytohaemagglutinin and concanavae intra-thymic lymphocyte population of dwarf mice. Examination of spleen-cell suspensions demonstrated a slightly higher frequency of T lymphocytes (Thy 1 - 2 + alpha-Naphthyl esterase+, high electrophoretic mobility) and lower frequency of B lymphocytes (surface immunoglobulin+, low electrophoretic mobility) in dwarf mice than in control mice. The degree of splenocyte responsiveness to T- and B-cell mitogens, however was similar in the two mouse types. High mobility (T) splenic cells were found to exhibit a smaller modal volume in dwarf mice (110 micron 3) than in control mice (122 micron 3) but this difference was not corrected by hormone administration. More pronounced were the quantitative differences between the spleens of hormone-deficient and normal mice. Thus, when expressed {{as a function of}} body weight, the numbers of splenic T and B lymphocytes in untreated dwarf mice were about half the corresponding values in hormone-reconstituted or normal littermates. These data suggested that in adult life, developmental hormones exert little direct effect on the thymus lymphocytes but influence the size of the pool of both peripheral T and B lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that kisspeptin signaling {{is necessary for the}} onset of puberty in laboratory animals. However, the role that kisspeptin may have in regulating puberty in large domestic animals is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that either central or peripheral infusion of kisspeptin would stimulate gonadotropin and GH secretion in prepubertal gilts. In experiment 1, prepubertal gilts were fitted with i. c. v. cannula and indwelling jugular catheters. Animals were randomly assigned to receive 0, 10, or 100 μg kisspeptin in saline. In experiment 2, prepubertal gilts, fitted with indwelling jugular catheters, randomly received 0, 1, 2. 5, or 5 mg kisspeptin in saline intravenously. Serial blood samples were collected every 15 min for 3 h before and 5 h after infusions, and serum concentrations of LH, FSH, and GH were determined. Mean concentrations of LH and FSH remained at basal levels for control animals but were increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) for animals receiving i. c. v. infusion of kisspeptin. Area under the LH and FSH curves following i. c. v. infusion of kisspeptin increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) in a dose-dependent manner. Concentrations of GH were unaffected by i. c. v. treatment. Peripheral administration of kisspeptin increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) serum concentrations of LH but not FSH or GH. Thus, kisspeptin can activate gonadotropic but not <b>somatotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> secretion in prepubertal gilts. The present data support the concept that kisspeptin plays a role in the mechanism involved in initiating puberty in swine...|$|E
40|$|Performance and hormones were {{determined}} in eight middle- and nine long-distance runners after {{an increase in}} training volume (ITV, February 1989) or intensity (ITI, February 1990). Seven runners participated in both studies. The objective was to cause an overtraining syndrome. The mean training volume of 85. 9 km week- 1 increased within 3 weeks to 176. 6 km week- 1 during ITV and 96 - 98 % of training volume was performed as long-distance runs at mean(s. d.) 67 (8) % of maximum capacity. Speed endurance, high-speed and interval runs averaging 9 km week- 1 increased within 3 weeks to 22. 7 km during ITI, and the total volume increased from 61. 6 to 84. 7 km. A plateau in endurance performance and decrease in maximum performance occurred during ITV, probably due to overtraining, with performance incompetence over months. Nocturnal catecholamine excretion decreased markedly (47 - 53 %), contrary to exercise-related plasma catecholamine responses, which increased. Resting and exercise-related cortisol and aldosterone levels decreased. Improvement in endurance and maximum performance occurred during ITI indicating a failure to cause an overtraining syndrome in ITI. Decrease in noctural catecholamine excretion was clearly lower (9 - 26 %), exercise-related catecholamine responses showed a significant decrease, cortisol and aldosterone levels remained almost constant, exercise-related prolactin levels decreased slightly. There were no differences in insulin, C-peptide, free testosterone, <b>somatotropic</b> <b>hormone</b> (STH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), tri-iodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4). The decrease in nocturnal catecholamine excretion during ITV might indicate a decrease in intrinsic sympathetic activity in exhausted sportsmen. But it remains open whether this reflected a central nervous system incompetence...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The <b>somatotropic</b> axis (growth <b>hormone</b> [GH] and insulinlike {{growth factor}} I [IGFI]) {{play a role}} in the {{cognitive}} deficits seen with aging, GH deficiency, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease. We recently reported elevations in basal plasma GH and IGFI levels in patients with Huntington disease (HD). Here, our objective was to determine whether somatotropic axis abnormalities predicted cognitive dysfunction in HD. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study of 109 patients with genetically documented HD, aged 21 to 85 years, we determined fasting blood levels of total IGFI, GH, and insulinlike factor binding protein 3 at baseline, and we used the cognitive Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale to assess cognitive impairment at baseline and for up to 5 years subsequently. Associations were evaluated using mixed linear model analysis. RESULTS: Higher plasma IGFI concentrations were associated with greater cognitive decline (beta Stroop Words, - 6. 01, p = 0. 003; beta Stroop Color, - 4. 41, p = 0. 01; beta Stroop Color/Words, - 3. 86, p = 0. 02; beta Symbol Digit Modalities, - 3. 69, p = 0. 03; and beta verbal fluency, - 5. 01, p = 0. 03). Higher free IGFI concentrations and higher GH concentrations in men also predicted greater cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in patients with HD suggest that a high IGFI level at baseline may be associated with greater subsequent declines in executive function and attention...|$|R
40|$|CORTICOTROPIC AXIS: The {{nycthemeral}} {{pattern of}} cortisol {{is a good}} marker of the circadian clock. Cortisol levels fluctuate between a peak level, observed {{in the early hours}} of the morning, and a minimal level around midnight. This variability is considerably reduced or even abolished in Cushing s syndrome. THYREOTROPIC AXIS: The nycthemeral pattern of TSH secretion is dependent on both the circadian clock and sleep (which inhibits hormone secretion). The moment of the evening rise is a reliable marker of the circadian rhythmicity. <b>SOMATOTROPIC</b> AXIS: Growth <b>hormone</b> is essentially pulsatile. GH levels are often undetectable between pulses. The circadian rhythmicity plays only a minor role in the regulation of growth hormone secretion. LACTOTROPIC AXIS: Nycthemeral variations in prolactin secretion are mainly regulated by wake-sleep cycles; peak levels occur in the middle of the night. Prolactin secretion is also modulated by the circadian rhythmicity. GONADOTROPIC AXIS: Gonadotropins are secreted in pulses, following the pulses of GnRH secretion. In adult women, nycthemeral variations in LH are strongly modulated by the menstrual cycle. MELATONIN: The nychtemeral pattern of melatonin is an excellent marker of the circadian clock. Diurnal concentrations are low and vary little whereas peak levels are observed in the middle of the night. Melatonin rhythmicity is not influenced by sleep, but is dependent on exposure to light and darkness. English AbstractJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tResearch Support, U. S.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of growth hormone-releasing peptide- 2 (GHRP- 2) and cysteamine (CS) administration on growth performance in yaks with growth retardation and try to elucidate its regulatory mechanisms. Trial 1, thirty-six 1 -year-old Qinghai high plateau yaks (body weight 38 - 83. 2 kg) were randomly chosen for body weight and jugular blood samples collection. The relationship between body weight and serum GHRH (P < 0. 05, R = 0. 45), GH (P < 0. 05, R = 0. 47), IGF- 1 (P < 0. 05, R = 0. 62) was significantly correlated in yaks colonies with lighter body weights. Trial 2, fifteen 1 -year-old Qinghai high plateau yaks with growth retardation (average body weight 54. 8 ± 8. 24 kg) were randomly selected and assigned to negative control group (NG), GHRP- 2 injection group (GG) and cysteamine feeding group (CG), with 5 yaks per group. Another five 1 -year-old Qinghai high plateau yaks with normal growth performance (average body weight 75. 3 ± 2. 43 kg) were selected as positive control group (PG). The average daily gain (ADG) of the GG and CG were significantly higher than those in the PG and NG (P < 0. 05). Both GHRP- 2 and CS administration significantly enhanced the myofiber diameter and area of skeletal muscle (P< 0. 05). GHRP- 2 significantly enhanced the serum GH and IGF- 1 levels (P < 0. 05), and up-regulated GHR, IGF- 1 and IGF- 1 R mRNA expression in the liver and skeletal muscle (P < 0. 05), enhanced the mRNA expression of PI 3 K, AKt and mTOR in the skeletal muscle (P< 0. 05). CS significantly reduced the serum SS levels and the hypothalamus SS mRNA expression (P < 0. 05), and enhanced GHR and IGF- 1 mRNA expression in the liver (P < 0. 05), decreased the mRNA expression of muscle atrophy F-box (Atrogin- 1) and muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF 1) mRNA (P < 0. 05). Growth retardation in yaks was primarily due to <b>somatotropic</b> axis <b>hormones</b> secretion deficiency. Both GHRP- 2 and CS administration can accelerate growth performance and GH, IGF- 1 secretion in yaks with growth retardation. GHRP- 2 enhanced muscle protein deposition mainly by up-regulated the protein synthesis pathways, whereas CS worked mainly by down-regulated the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway...|$|R
