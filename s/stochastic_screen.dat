The general approach to <b>stochastic</b> <b>screen</b> design employs either spatial domain or frequency domain filtering to generate binary patterns with "blue noise" characteristic at each gray level, which can be summed to form a single threshold array. In this paper, we will propose a novel technique to design stochastic screens using an error diffusion approach called symmetric error compensation (SEC) [1], where all neighbors of the current pixel {{are involved in the}} computation. The screen is still designed at each gray level, but each level is constructed using SEC. Typically, SEC is used to identify those pixels to be removed or added for building neighbor binary patterns.

Kodak, using its multilevel printing architecture, has created a new stochastic screening technology, with long-run color stability comparable to that of traditional screens.

50|$|The {{technique}} of <b>stochastic</b> <b>screening,</b> which has existed since the seventies, {{has had a}} revival in recent times thanks to increased use of computer-to-plate (CTP) techniques. In previous techniques, computer to film, during the exposure {{there could be a}} drastic variation in the quality of the plate. It was a very delicate and difficult procedure that was not much used. Today, with CTP during the creation of the plate you just need to check a few parameters on the density and tonal correction curve. When you make a plate with <b>stochastic</b> <b>screening</b> you must use a tone correction curve, this curve allows one to align the tone reproduction of an FM screen to that of an industry standard.Given the same final presswork tone value, an FM screen utilizes more halftone dots than an AM/XM screen. The result is that more light is filtered by the ink and less light simply reflects off the surface of the substrate. The result is that FM screens exhibit a greater color gamut than conventional AM/XM halftone screen frequencies.The creation of a plate with <b>stochastic</b> <b>screening</b> is done the same way as is done with an AM/XM screen. A tone reproduction compensation curve is typically applied to align the <b>stochastic</b> <b>screening</b> to conventional AM/FM tone reproductions targets (e.g. ISO 12647-2).|$|R

As a result, innovations {{in the press and}} plate coating technologies along with imaging software technologies have challenged the way we view print. With lithography being the predominant printing process, printers now have to find ways to differentiate themselves from others especially in the color reproduction arena. For years, traditional halftoning methods have reproduced original continuous tone images with success. Today, however, the once accepted rosette is now being challenged by a new technology that does away with conventional screen rulings and dot patterns. This new technology called <b>Stochastic</b> <b>Screening,</b> offers many benefits and is loudly touted by its champions. Tone reproduction whether it be through conventional <b>screening</b> methods or <b>stochastic</b> <b>screening</b> methods is influenced by all parameters in the printing process. In this study, the effects of inking on dot gain and print contrast were studied. A test form was developed to test the prediction that stochastically screened images will perform equally or better than conventionally screened images under normal and increased inking conditions. Evaluation of the test results shows that conventionally screened images actually performed better than stochastically <b>screened</b> images. <b>Stochastic</b> images actually experienced increased dot gain and loss of print contrast in the 48 % and 70 % tint areas under normal and increased inking conditions. Although stochastic images had less of a performance, the images appeared to have less variation throughout the run.

A rapid and economical analytical method to detect PCB contamination is still required. To address this issue, we propose here the first microfluidic screening method for PCB contamination in insulating oil. The insulating oil was pretreated using a multilayer capillary column and a microfluidic liquid–liquid partitioning. PCBs in the pretreated oil were measured using a microfluidic kinetic exclusion assay. In order to detect PCBs with high sensitivity, conditions of the microfluidic kinetic exclusion assay were optimized. Measurements were rapidly completed (within 43 min). The measurement range was estimated to be 0. 26 – 3. 3 mg/kg defined as the relative absorbance from 20 % to 80 %. The screening performance (false positive and false negative rates) was tested on fifty real oil samples; results about these tests were discussed in detail, especially suitable cutoff by comparing with the data analyzed using high-resolution-gas-chromatography/high-resolution-mass-spectrometry.

30|$|Knox and Wang [18] {{proposed}} a halftone-based watermarking method involving <b>stochastic</b> <b>screening.</b> For a single input contone image, two stochastic threshold matrices {{are used to}} ensure that the statistics of two output halftone images are correlated only in predetermined regions. When these two halftones are overlaid, dots in the uncorrelated regions are randomly located with respect to each other (i.e., most of the dots do not overlap), resulting in a darker gray level and therefore the appearance of a hidden watermark. Sharma and Wang [19] also {{proposed a}} halftone-based watermarking method involving screening, but unlike [18], the clustered-dot screen patterns are used. The hidden watermark is embedded by the varying phase of the dot-clusters between two halftone images. When overlaid, the hidden watermark appears in the regions that have phase disagreement. Fu and Au [20] proposed a data-hiding method in which ED is used for generating two halftone images: one halftone is generated using regular ED and the other is generated with stochastic ED. When the two halftones are overlaid, the regions characterized by the stochastic property darken, leading to the formation of a watermark pattern. For the abovementioned halftone-based watermarking method, the data are retrieved only if the multiple halftone images are obtained. Hence, the security level is high; however, the data capacity is commonly limited.|$|R
40|$|Most {{printers}} {{based on}} electrophotographic technology use periodic, clustered-dot screening for rendering smooth stable prints. Despite great advancement {{in the print}} quality from periodic clustering, there exists one major drawback, namely periodic moiré, which is caused due to interference between multiple periodic screens superposed for color printing. Researchers have proposed solutions to this problem {{in the form of}} optimized screen periodicities, screen angles, and screen growth sequences. These solutions work well, but only when the involved color planes are few in number. A common scenario nowadays is the use of six or more primary colors. An alternative solution to avoid periodic interference between conventional clustered-dot screens is to use <b>stochastic</b> clustered-dot <b>screens.</b> A set of <b>stochastic</b> <b>screens</b> can be designed with optimum coarsenesses to be used exclusively or in conjunction with periodic screens to greatly reduce the chances of undesirable interference. ^ In this thesis, we propose a method of stochastic, clustered-dot halftoning and screen design based on Direct Binary Search (DBS). In earlier publications, DBS was shown to generate stochastic, dispersed-dot texture. An analysis of the relationship between halftone changes and the update of filtered-error in DBS lays ground for the development of CLU-DBS which originates as a clustered-dot halftoning variant of DBS. ^ The CLU-DBS procedure evolves from DBS by a simple modification of the filter sizes. CLU-DBS uses the optimization framework of DBS. Like DBS, it first initializes the filtered-error LUT on the basis of an initial random halftone. Subsequently, it iteratively selects pixels for toggle and swap with an objective to minimize the magnitude of the filtered error, and updates the filtered-error. The essential deviation from DBS is the use of different filters in the initialization and update steps. CLU-DBS uses an update filter of larger size than the initialization filter. ^ After proposing an intuitive explanation for the development of stochastic, clustered-dot texture from CLU-DBS optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the underlying cost function that is being minimized in the course of optimization. Later this cost function is established as the guiding metric for stochastic, clustered-dot halftoning. In other words, CLU-DBS is implemented based on the cost metric. The dual-component cost metric reveals {{a great deal of information}} about the relationship between the input parameters and the output texture. We make use of this information to improve the quality of output texture. This is done by an intelligent selection of input filter sizes, the initial halftone, and the optimization procedure. ^ After developing a procedure for halftoning an image with CLU-DBS, we develop an algorithm for screen design. The screen design is complete after being post-processed for removal of certain defects from the tone reproduction curve. In order to evaluate the quality of halftones resulting from designed screen, we performed psychophysical experiments. The experiments involved comparison of CLU-DBS printed halftones with the halftones resulting from methods developed previously. The results of these experiments indicate subjects 2 ̆ 7 clear preference of the CLU-DBS halftones over other halftones in terms of smoothness of prints. ...|$|R

Variable selection procedures included in these comparisons include methods based on g-priors, reciprocal lasso, adaptive lasso, scad, and minimax concave penalty criteria. The use of precision-recall curves eliminates the sensitivity of our conclusions to the choice of tuning parameters. We find that Bayesian variable selection procedures based on nonlocal priors are competitive to all other procedures {{in a range of}} simulation scenarios, and we subsequently explain this favorable performance through a theoretical examination of their consistency properties. When certain regularity conditions apply, we demonstrate that the nonlocal procedures are consistent for linear models even when the number of covariates p increases sub-exponentially with the sample size n. A model selection procedure based on Zellner's g-prior is also found to be competitive with penalized likelihood methods in identifying the true model, but the posterior distribution on the model space induced by this method is much more dispersed than the posterior distribution induced on the model space by the nonlocal prior methods. We investigate the asymptotic form of the marginal likelihood based on the nonlocal priors and show that it attains a unique term that cannot be derived from the other Bayesian model selection procedures. We also propose a scalable and efficient algorithm called Simplified Shotgun <b>Stochastic</b> Search with <b>Screening</b> (S 5) to explore the enormous model space, and we show that S 5 dramatically reduces the computing time without losing the capacity to search the interesting region in the model space.

40|$|The {{proposed}} work addresses {{two main}} objectives: (1) {{to pursue the}} development of the random diffraction screen model for analytical/computational characterization of the extinction and near-forward scattering by ring models that include particle crowding, uniform clustering, and clustering along preferred orientations (anisotropy). The characterization is crucial for proper interpretation of past (Voyager) and future (Cassini) ring, occultation observations in terms of physical ring properties, and is needed to address outstanding puzzles in the interpretation of the Voyager radio occultation data sets; (2) to continue the development of spectral analysis techniques to identify and characterize the power scattered by all features of Saturn's rings that can be resolved in the Voyager radio occultation observations, and to use the results to constrain the maximum particle size and its abundance. Characterization of the variability of surface mass density among the main ring, features and within individual features is important for constraining the ring mass and is relevant to investigations of ring dynamics and origin. We completed the developed of the <b>stochastic</b> geometry (random <b>screen)</b> model for the interaction of electromagnetic waves with of planetary ring models; used the model to relate the oblique optical depth and the angular spectrum of the near forward scattered signal to statistical averages of the stochastic geometry of the randomly blocked area.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the choice of priors in Bayesian model selection and their applied, theoretical and computational aspects. As George Box famously said ?all models are wrong, but some are useful"; many statisticians and scientists {{are aware of the}} importance of model selection. In a Bayesian perspective, however, it is challenging to choose the prior on the parameters involved in model selection or how to evaluate the criterion on the prior, especially when the number of models to be compared is massive or when a nonparametric model is considered. For high-dimensional Bayesian model selection for linear models, my dissertation studies theoretical perspectives of the choice of the prior on the regression coefficient. Especially, I consider the nonlocal prior densities that assign zero density around the null value, which is typically 0 in model selection settings. When certain regularity conditions apply, I demonstrate that the model selection procedure based on the nonlocal priors is consistent for linear models even when the number of covariates p increases sub-exponentially with the sample size n. I investigate the asymptotic form of the marginal likelihood based on the nonlocal priors and show that it attains a unique penalty term that adapts to the strength of signal corresponding variable in the model, and I remark that this term cannot be attained from local priors such as Gaussian prior densities. Another topic of my dissertation is about computational aspects of Bayesian model selection under high-dimensional settings. A full posterior sampling using existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to explore high-dimensional model space is highly inefficient and often not feasible from a practical perspective. To overcome this issue, I propose a scalable stochastic search algorithm called Simplified Shotgun <b>Stochastic</b> Search with <b>Screening</b> (S 5), which efficiently explores the model space. The S 5 algorithm dramatically reduces the computational burden to search the neighborhood of a model by considering a screening step within the algorithm. Its empirical performance is examined in several examples, and it outperforms existing algorithms in the sense that S 5 is computationally fast while it efficiently searches the model space. S 5 is used to implement the model selection procedures introduced in this dissertation, including linear and nonparametric model selection. The computing functions are provided in the R package BayesS 5 in CRAN ([URL] For nonparametric regression models, I introduce a new shrinkage prior on function spaces, the functional horseshoe prior, that encourages shrinkage towards parametric classes of functions. When the true underlying function is in the parametric class, improved estimation performance is obtained relative to classical nonparametric procedures. The proposed prior also provides a natural penalization interpretation, and casts light on a new class of penalized likelihood methods for function estimation. I theoretically exhibit the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing an adaptive posterior concentration property. The last topic of the dissertation is about a novel extension of the nonlocal idea to functional spaces, called the nonlocal functional prior, which is suitable for nonparametric Bayesian hypothesis testing (model selection) problems. I illustrate the asymptotic rate of the Bayes factor defined by the proposed prior for nonparametric hypothesis testing problems. I apply the proposed prior densities for high-dimensional model selection of nonparametric additive models, and investigate the model selection consistency of the resulting model selection procedure. I provide some simulation studies and real data examples that show that the proposed model selection procedure outperforms state-of-the-art methods in finite samples...|$|R
