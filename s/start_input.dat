40|$|Time-to-digital {{converters}} (TDCs) {{occur in}} many realms of high-energy physics, such as time-of-flight {{positron emission tomography}} (TOF PET) [1]. Density tests[2] are often used to characterize the non-uniformity of TDCs. Such tests require a uniform time interval generator, often realized by a probabilitistic exponential source, such as a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD), and a known time reference. However, if the exponential source’s event rate is too large, static distortions will occur in the measured INL. Additionally, the correlated shot noise created by the probabilitistic source will introduce some uncertainty into measurements of the differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral non-linearity (INL). This paper will discuss these two unwanted effects, and present measurements showing that the analysis is correct. Let a TDC have its <b>start</b> <b>input</b> connected to a probabilisti...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a high precision time interval digitizer is described. The time digitizer is a 10 psec resolution stop watch covering a range of up to 340 msec. The measured time interval is determined as a separation between leading edges {{of a pair of}} pulses applied externally to the <b>start</b> <b>input</b> and the stop input of the digitizer. Employing an interpolation techniques and a 50 MHz high precision master oscillator, the equivalent of a 100 GHz clock frequency standard is achieved. Absolute accuracy and stability of the digitizer are determined by the external 50 MHz master oscillator, which serves as a standard time marker. The start and stop pulses are fast 1 nsec rise time signals, according to the Nuclear Instrument means of tunnel diode discriminators.

These SoftSpan ™ ADCs can be softwareprogrammed for 0 V to 5 V, 0 V to 10 V, ± 5 V or ± 10 V input spans {{and operate}} {{from a single}} 5 V supply. The 8 -channel multiplexer can be programmed for single-ended inputs or pairs of differential inputs or combinations of both. In addition, all channels are fault protected to ± 25 V. A fault condition on any channel will not affect the conversion result of the selected channel. An onboard high performance sample-and-hold and precision reference minimize external components. The low 40 mW power dissipation is made even more attractive with two user selectable power shutdown modes. DC specifications include ± 3 LSB INL for the LTC 1859, ± 1. 5 LSB INL for the LTC 1858 and ± 1 LSB for the LTC 1857.

40|$|Modern mobile devices offer a {{great variety}} of data that can be recorded. This broad range of {{information}} offers the possibility to tailor applications more to the needs of a user. Several context information can be collected, like e. g. information about position or movement. Besides integrated sensors, a broad range of additional sensors are available which can be connected to a mobile device. These additional sensors offer for example the possibility to measure physiological signals of a user. The human body offers a broad range of different signals. These signals have been used in several examples to conclude on the state of a user. The different signals allow to get a deeper insight into emotional or mental state of a user. Electrodermal activity gives feedback about the current arousal level of a user. Heart rate and heart rate variability can give an estimation about valence and mental load of a user. Several models exist to conclude from information like valence and arousal on different emotional states. Russell defined a two dimensional model, using valence and arousal to define affective states. Yerkes and Dodson developed a curve that expresses the relationship between arousal and performance of a user. Different examples exist, that use physiological signals to determine the user state for tailoring and adapting of applications. At the time of this work most of these examples did not address the usage of physiological signals for user state estimation in mobile applications and in mobile scenarios. Mobile scenarios lead to several challenges that need to be addressed. Influencing factors on physiological signals, like e. g. movement have to be controlled. Furthermore a user might be interrupted and influenced by environmental aspects. The combination of physiological data and context information might improve the interpretation of user state in mobile scenarios. In this work, we present a model that addresses the challenges of usage in mobile scenarios to offer an estimation of user state to mobile applications. To address a broad range of mobile applications, affective and cognitive state are provided as output. As input heart rate and electrodermal activity are used, as well as context information about movement and performance. Electrodermal activity is measured by a simple sensor that can be worn as a wristband. Heart rate is measured by a chest strap as used in sports. The input channels are transformed to affective and cognitive state based on a fuzzy rule based approach. With help of fuzzy logic, uncertainty can be expressed and the data continuously being processed. At the <b>start,</b> <b>input</b> channels are fuzzified by defined functions. After a that, a first fuzzy rule set transforms the input signals into values for valence, arousal and mental load. In a second step, these values and context information are transformed with another fuzzy rule set to values for affective and cognitive state. Affective state is based on the model of Russell, where valence and arousal are used to determine different emotional states. The output of the model are eight different affective states (alarmed, excited, happy, relaxed, tired, bored, sad and frustrated), which can have a high, medium, low or very low value as output. Cognitive state is determined based on mental load and context information about performance and movement. The output value can be very high, high, medium or low. The model was implemented as background service for Android devices. Different applications have been used for evaluation of the model. The model has been integrated in a multiplayer space shooter game, called ”Zone of Impulse”, which mainly benefits from the affective state. Cognitive state is more addressed in applications like a simple vocable trainer, which adapts difficulty based on user state. A study to evaluate different aspects of the model has been conducted. The study was designed to investigate the suitability of the model for mobile scenarios. The game ”zone of impulse” and the vocable trainer have been investigated in different configurations. Versions with integrated model have been compared to version of the applications without model, as well as versions of the model without context information. In total 41 participants took part in the study. A part of the participants had to do the tasks of the study in a mobile scenario, walking around several streets. The remaining participants had to do the tasks in a controlled environment in a sitting position. Different aspects were collected with ratings and questionnaires. Overall, participants rated that they did not feel impaired by the sensors they had to wear. The results showed, that the combination of physiological data and context information had an advantage against versions without context information in part of the ratings. A comparison between versions with and without model showed, that the subjective mental load ratings were significantly better for the version with model. Subjective ratings for aspects like fun, overstrain and support were mixed. When comparing the application versions in indoor and outdoor scenarios, no significant difference could be found, which leads to the assumption that there is no loss of interpretation quality in outdoor scenarios. The results also showed that the model seems to be robust enough to compensate the loss of an input channel, as {{there was no significant difference}} between application versions with full integrated model and versions with one channel lost. With the model developed in this work, context information and physiological data were combined to improve user state estimation. Furthermore pitfalls of user state estimation in mobile scenarios are overcome with this combination. However, the model has only been evaluated with a limited amount of applications and situations that mobile scenarios offer...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} open cluster metallicities helps to {{understand}} the local stellar formation and evolution throughout the Milky Way. Its metallicity gradient is an important tracer for the Galactic formation in a global sense. Because open clusters can be treated in a statistical way, the error of the cluster mean is minimized. Our final goal is a semi-automatic statistical robust method to estimate the metallicity of a statistically significant number of open clusters based on Johnson BV data of their members, an algorithm that can easily be extended to other photometric systems for a systematic investigation. This method incorporates evolutionary grids for different metallicities and a calibration of the effective temperature and luminosity. With cluster parameters (age, reddening and distance) {{it is possible to}} estimate the metallicity from a statistical point of view.
