5000|$|Poston Mine Number 6 {{was said}} to be the Sunday Creek Coal Company's best mine and safest in the Hocking Valley. The {{explosion}} occurred 10,200 feet from the main shaft around 11:45 am. It was the result of an accumulation of gas in section 6 North, which was known for being gassy. The ignition was believed to be caused by an electrical arc between a fallen trolley wire and the rail. The section of the trolley rail where the explosion occurred was broken and therefore inactive. There was no reason for power to be on that line. [...] The explosion caused many of the walls to cave in, wrecking the interior.

40|$|Based on FBG fiber Bragg grating {{technology}} and BOTDA distributed optical fiber sensing technology, this study uses fine sand to simulate overburden layer in vertical <b>shaft</b> model <b>equipment.</b> It studies the placing technique and test method for optical fiber sensors in the overburden layer, combined with MODFLOW software {{to simulate the}} change of the water head value when the overburden layer is losing water, and obtains the deformation features of overburden layer. The results show, {{at the beginning of}} water loss, the vertical deformation increases due to larger hydraulic pressure drop, while the deformation decreases gradually and tends to be stable with the hydraulic pressure drop reducing. The circumferential deformation is closely related to such factors as the distance between each drainage outlet, the variations of water head value, and the method of drainage. The monitoring result based on optical fiber sensing technology is consistent with the characteristics of water loss in overburden layer simulated by MODFLOW software, which shows that the optical fiber sensing technology applied to monitor shaft overburden layer is feasible...|$|R

40|$|DE 19823511 A UPAB: 20000118 NOVELTY - A screw {{conveyor}} and antistatic devices {{are used to}} control the rate of addition of the material to the air stream. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The material is stored in a vessel with a conical base to lead the material towards a dosing screw (19) which passes the material through a bush (24) to a nozzle (2) into which atmospheric air is led at an air inlet (4). A pipe carries the mixture to an injector (27) activated by compressed air with which it forms the aerosol. The conical base of the storage vessel is ribbed, and the air entering nozzle (2) can be electrically charged, to counter static charges produced within the material. Dosing can be varied by altering {{the speed of the}} dosing screw motor or mounting screws with different pitches and thread depths. A swing arm (26), running close to the walls of the storage vessel, is attached to the screw <b>shaft.</b> The <b>equipment</b> is intended for small-scale operation with a material usage between 2 g/h and 10 mg/h.

30|$|As {{a form of}} user innovation, the Rome adopted {{military}} technology from the surrounding nations. The military of Ancient Rome {{was based on the}} weapons and the tactics of the Greeks. For example, the basic combat formation of ‚ÄúPhalanx‚Äù with long spears and circular shields was derived from the Greeks. However, with territorial expansions and the resulting variations in terrain, the military techniques of the Greeks proved to be insufficient. The Roman capacity for openness showed itself in military situations as well. In mountainous regions, long spears were discarded after their limitations were recognized, and short swords were adopted in their stead. The short swords in question were the modified versions of the Iberian ‚ÄúGladius.‚Äù Also, recognizing the dangers of javelins used by the Samnites, the Romans adopted the javelin ‚ÄúPilum,‚Äù which eventually was developed into the ‚ÄúPlumbata,‚Äù which was light enough for a soldier to carry multiple <b>shafts.</b> As the <b>equipment</b> of the army underwent changes, the combat and defense formations and techniques changed subsequently as well.

The drivelines involved were guarded by inverted U-shaped tunnel guards that did not completely enclose the drivelines. The drivelines were located about 4 feet above the ground, limiting visibility of the hazard. The drivelines concerned were associated with Models 54 A, 54 B, 58, and 62 of a bale thrower manufactured by New Holland prior to 1976.

Such aircraft {{can be used for}} diverse purposes, including military reconnaissance, radio communications, and safety-related monitoring of wide areas. The need for stability-augmentation devices arises because adverse meteorological conditions generally affect smaller aircraft more strongly than they affect larger aircraft: Miniature aircraft often become uncontrollable under conditions that would not be considered severe enough to warrant grounding of larger aircraft. The need for the stability-augmentation devices to be non-aerodynamic arises because there is no known way to create controlled aerodynamic forces sufficient to counteract the uncontrollable meteorological forces on miniature aircraft.

He felt it could by applying space technology to the task. The initial contact led to a two year project which he organized and headed a team, co-sponsored by EAO and the National Geographic Society (NGS), to apply space technology in an effort to examine and photograph the Giza Chamber. The NGS photographic division modified and tested a remotely controlled video system and a 35 -millimeter camera, and developed a lighting system that would not elevate the chamber temperature.

40|$|PaperPg. 149 - 152. Compressor {{and driver}} shafts often {{prove to be}} {{overstressed}} in equipment uprate situations. This paper shows how a change from conventional gear-type couplings to the more recent diaphragm coupling design can lower the shaft stresses sufficient to avoid shaft replacement during power uprates of centrifugal compressors or compressor drivers. Equipment uprate projects involving turbomachinery often appear to require time consuming and costly shaft replacements. However, closer examination of how the equipment vendor arrived at his maximum allowable stress levels may frequently show that such shaft replacements can be avoided without undue risk if the coupling selection is optimized. This conclusion {{is based on the}} fact that gear-type coupling have the potential of inducing in a shaft both torional stresses and bending stresses, whereas diaphragm couplings tend to primarily induce torisonal stresses and insignificant bending stresses at best. The economic incentives of finding ways of salvaging major rotating <b>equipment</b> <b>shafts</b> illustrated on a steam turbine shaft originally rated to transmit 17, 600 hp maximum at 6, 400 rpm. If uprating the turbine to 19, 600 hp were being considered, the required changeout of stationary steam path components would cost around $ 60, 000, but a combined replacement cost of about $ 500, 000 would probably be quoted for the main and spare rotor shafts. A rigorous calculation of shaft stresses shows the shaft factor of safety to be greater at 19, 600 hp using a diaphragm coupling than at 17, 600 hp using a conventional gear coupling...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new optimization {{model for the}} simultaneous synthesis of heat and work exchange networks. The work integration is performed in the work exchange network (WEN), while the heat integration is {{carried out in the}} heat exchanger network (HEN). In the WEN synthesis, streams at high-pressure (HP) and low-pressure (LP) are subjected to pressure manipulation stages, via turbines and compressors running on common <b>shafts</b> and stand-alone <b>equipment.</b> The model allows the use of several units of single-shaft-turbine-compressor (SSTC), as well as helper motors and generators to respond to any shortage and/or excess of energy, respectively, in the SSTC axes. The heat integration of the streams occurs in the HEN between each WEN stage. Thus, as the inlet and outlet streams temperatures in the HEN are dependent of the WEN design, they must be considered as optimization variables. The proposed multi-stage superstructure is formulated in mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), in order to minimize the total annualized cost composed by capital and operational expenses. A case study is conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the heat integration between the WEN stages is essential to enhance the work integration, and to reduce the total cost of process due the need of a smaller amount of hot and cold utilities.
