5|$|Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, {{led by the}} Free Officers Movement of Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{in which}} the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown, the {{university}} began {{to be separated from}} the mosque. A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school, and the college was officially designated a university in 1961. The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world. The law also created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation. The reforms of the curriculum have led to a massive {{growth in the number of}} Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of <b>students</b> <b>reported</b> to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early in 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{reliability}} and validity of <b>student</b> <b>reports</b> of parental SES characteristics was investigated. Using panel data for <b>student</b> <b>reports</b> and independent surveys of both mothers and fathers, it was found that <b>student</b> <b>reports</b> were relatively stable over time and were more reliably measured for parental education than for either fatherâ€™s income or occupa-tion. The validities of the reports were, for all but income reports, moderate. The validity of income reports was very low. It was concluded that <b>student</b> <b>reports</b> should be utilized with some caution, and, where possible, direct measures of parental SES should be used...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the roles of prosocial {{perceptions}} and gender in the relative relationships between relational victimization and depressive symptoms; and relational victimization and loneliness/social dissatisfaction among preadolescents. Five hypotheses guided this investigation. First, it was hypothesized that <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> high-level relational victimization would experience higher levels of depressive symptoms as compared to <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> low-level relational victimization. Second, it was hypothesized that <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> high-level relational victimization would experience higher levels of loneliness/social dissatisfaction as compared to <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> low-level loneliness/social dissatisfaction. The third hypothesis was prosocial perceptions would moderate the relative relationships between relational victimization and depressive symptoms; and relational victimization and loneliness/social dissatisfaction. Hypothesis four was <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> both high-level relational victimization and high-level prosocial perceptions would report lower levels of depressive symptoms and loneliness/social dissatisfaction compared to <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> both high-level relational victimization and low-level prosocial perceptions. The final hypothesis guiding this investigation was the path coefficients would be stronger for girls. ^ Participants in this study included 907 sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students from three Midwestern middle schools that participated in a larger longitudinal study on bullying and peer relationships. Findings from one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) supported the hypotheses that <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> high-level relational victimization report higher levels of depressive symptoms and loneliness/social dissatisfaction than <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> low-level relational victimization. Findings from Structural Equation Modeling analyses did support the hypothesis that prosocial perceptions would moderate the relative relationships between relational victimization and depressive symptoms; and relational victimization and loneliness/social dissatisfaction. The hypothesis that path coefficients would be stronger for girls, was not supported. Findings supported the hypothesized protective function of prosocial perceptions in the associations among relational victimization, depressive symptoms, and loneliness/social dissatisfaction. Specifically, <b>students</b> <b>reporting</b> high-level relational victimization and high-level prosocial perceptions experienced fewer depressive symptoms and loneliness/social dissatisfaction than high-level relational victims reporting low-level prosocial perceptions. ^ The theoretical and applied implications of these findings are discussed, along with limitations of the current investigation. Finally, possible directions for future research are identified. ...|$|R

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that if the sexual {{harassment}} was done by a male, {{both male and female}} victims experienced behavioral problems, in contrast to if the female was the perpetrator, where the behavioral problems occurred less. Being absent from school frequently, having difficulties concentrating on school work, and performing poorly on academic work often result. In a 2011 nationwide survey conducted by the AAUW of 7th-12th grade students, 32% of students who had experienced sexual harassment did not want to return to school after it occurred. This included 37% of female students and 25% of male students. 31% of the surveyed students felt physically sick after being sexually harassed, with 37% of females and 21% of males reporting this effect. 30% of students had difficulties studying and focusing on school as a result of sexual harassment including 34% of females and 24% of males, and 19% of <b>students</b> <b>reported</b> having a difficult time sleeping due to sexual harassment, including 22% of females and 14% of males.

25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law <b>students</b> <b>reported</b> receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on responsiveness.|$|E
