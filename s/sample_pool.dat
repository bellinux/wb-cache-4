40|$|A novel <b>sampling</b> <b>pool</b> {{selection}} scheme is {{proposed for the}} online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) based on improved Gath-Geva (IGG) fuzzy segmentation algorithm. Tidal change is a time-varying process whose dynamics vary with changes of internal and environmental factors such as celestial bodies movements, coastal topology and environmental disturbances. When OS-ELM is implemented for identifying time-varying system dynamics, it usually sequentially selects samples with fixed number. Under such circumstance, samples representing different system dynamics are mixed together so that the online representation and prediction abilities of OS-ELM may be deteriorated. To consciously select samples with most representing ability and construct appropriate <b>sampling</b> <b>pool</b> for OS-ELM, in this study, a dynamic <b>sampling</b> <b>pool</b> {{selection scheme}} is proposed based on IGG fuzzy segmentation approach. Time series of input and output variables are segmented as per their dynamics characteristics. The change points split up the time series into several segments and the change points themselves represent the changes of system dynamics. Samples within the same segment are considered as possessing homogeneous characteristics. To achieve best representing abilities for current system dynamics, the proposed IGG-based sampling scheme is implemented for selecting <b>sampling</b> <b>pool.</b> The OS-ELM selects homogeneous <b>samples</b> from <b>sampling</b> <b>pool</b> thus possesses better representing ability for current dynamics. In the meantime, conventional harmonic analysis is also applied to represent the influences of celestial bodies and coastal topology. The harmonic method and IGG-based OS-ELM are combined together and the resulted modular prediction scheme is applied for online tidal level prediction of ports of King Point, Mokuoloe and Old Port Tampa in the United States. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed sampling scheme and the modular tidal prediction approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

This data was derived from a <b>sample</b> <b>pool</b> consisting of eighty two radiocarbon dates and seven archaeomagnetic dates.

By classifying artifacts, a picture of what cultures occupied the Basin during what times can be understood. In addition, a view of when the basin remained uninhabited can also be drawn. Identifying cultural time periods and phases, along with determining patterns of occupation, can also be very beneficial when determining the amount of contact between cultural phases and groups residing simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|The {{calculation}} of LGD (or Downturn LGD) poses significant challenges to modelers and practitioners. Final resolutions of defaults {{can take many}} years and final losses, and hence final LGD, cannot be calculated until all of this information is ripe. Furthermore, practitioners are of want of data since BIS II implementation is rather new and financial institutions may have only just started collecting the information necessary for calculating the individual elements that LGD is composed of: EAD, direct and indirect Losses, security values and potential, expected future recoveries. Another challenge, and maybe the most significant, {{is the fact that}} the default definitions between institutions vary. This often results in a so-called differing cure-rates or percentage of defaults without losses. Calculation of LGD (average) is often composed of defaults with losses and defaults without. Naturally, when more defaults without losses are added to a <b>sample</b> <b>pool</b> of observations LGD becomes lower. This is often the case when default definitions become more 'sensitive' to credit deterioration or 'early' signs of defaults. When institutions use different definitions, LGD parameters therefore become non-comparable.|$|E
40|$|Many {{biomedical}} {{experiments are}} carried out by <b>pooling</b> individual biological <b>samples.</b> However, <b>pooling</b> <b>samples</b> can potentially hide biological variance and give false confidence concerning the data significance. In the context of microarray experiments for detecting differentially expressed genes, recent publications have addressed {{the problem of the}} efficiency of sample-pooling, and some approximate formulas were provided for the power and sample size calculations. It is desirable to have exact formulas for these calculations and have the approximate results checked against the exact ones. We show that the difference between the approximate and exact results can be large. In this study, we have characterized quantitatively the effect of <b>pooling</b> <b>samples</b> on the efficiency of microarray experiments for the detection of differential gene expression between two classes. We present exact formulas for calculating the power of microarray experimental designs involving <b>sample</b> <b>pooling</b> and technical replications. The formulas can be used to determine the total numbers of arrays and biological subjects required in an experiment to achieve the desired power at a given significance level. The conditions under which pooled design becomes preferable to non-pooled design can then be derived given the unit cost associated with a microarray and that with a biological subject. This paper thus serves to provide guidance on <b>sample</b> <b>pooling</b> and cost effectiveness.

40|$|Abstract Background Microarray {{technology}} {{has become a}} very important tool for studying gene expression profiles under various conditions. Biologists often <b>pool</b> RNA <b>samples</b> extracted from different subjects onto a single microarray chip to help defray the cost of microarray experiments {{as well as to}} correct for the technical difficulty in getting sufficient RNA from a single subject. However, the statistical, technical and financial implications of pooling have not been explicitly investigated. Results Modeling the resulting gene expression from <b>sample</b> <b>pooling</b> as a mixture of individual responses, we derived expressions for the experimental error and provided both upper and lower bounds for its value in terms of the variability among individuals and the number of RNA <b>samples</b> <b>pooled.</b> Using "virtual" pooling of data from real experiments and computer simulations, we investigated the statistical properties of RNA <b>sample</b> <b>pooling.</b> Our study reveals that <b>pooling</b> biological <b>samples</b> appropriately is statistically valid and efficient for microarray experiments. Furthermore, optimal pooling design(s) can be found to meet statistical requirements while minimizing total cost. Conclusions Appropriate RNA pooling can provide equivalent power and improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness for microarray experiments with a modest increase in total number of subjects. Pooling schemes in terms of replicates of subjects and arrays can be compared before experiments are conducted. </p...|$|R

50|$|This {{methodology}} {{is beneficial}} {{in its applicability}} to participants who may be illiterate or have difficulty communicating because of language barriers, lack of education, or a disability. This characteristic of Photovoice allows researchers who choose to use this methodology to choose participants from a large <b>sample</b> <b>pool</b> {{because there are no}} language or literacy requirements. Photovoice may be a powerful research tool because it allows the researcher to see the topic being studied from the participant's perspective. It also encourages the participants and the researcher to reflect on the images and meaning behind them as they highlight an aspect or perspective of the research topic perhaps not previously considered. In this way visual methods of data production can act as tools of defamilairisation, fighting familiarity for both researchers and participants and allowing space for a more nuanced understanding of the topics studies (Mannay 2010) The use of Photovoice also has its limits. It requires the researcher to budget for the equipment used to carry it out, such as cameras, ink and printing costs. This may be problematic for the researcher if the research has been given limited or insufficient funds. Another problem that may arise in the use of Photovoice is the question of photograph ownership. The researcher may be providing the equipment, but it is the participants who are taking the pictures. To avoid any potential issues regarding photograph ownership, it is advised that researchers obtain from their participants permission to use the photographs they take. It is particularly important to think carefully about informed consent in an era of digital dissemination and open access publication where images can be reworked, redistributed and recirculated in the digital economy, in ways that may not have been envisaged {{at the time of the}} research study (Mannay, 2014).|$|E

RT-PCR was used for 172 tissue <b>sample</b> <b>pools</b> (total of 859 fish) originating from a field survey on the occurrence of VHSV and IHNV in farmed and wild salmonids in Switzerland. These samples represented all sites with fish that were either identified as virus-positive by means of virus isolation (three sites, four positive tissue <b>sample</b> <b>pools)</b> and/or demonstrated positive anti-VHSV-antibody titres (83 sites, 121 positive blood samples) in a serum plaque neutralization test (SPNT). The RT-PCR technique confirmed the four VHSV-positive tissue <b>sample</b> <b>pools</b> detected by virus isolation and additionally identified one VHSV-positive sample that showed positive anti-VHSV-AB titres, but was negative in virus isolation. With IHNV, RT-PCR detected two positive samples not identified by virus isolation while in these fish the SPNT result had been questionable. One of the IHNV-positive samples represents the first detection of IHNV-RNA in wild brown trout in Switzerland. Compared to SPNT, the RT-PCR method detected, as with virus isolation, a much lower number of positive cases; reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Our results indicate that RT-PCR can not only be successfully applied in field surveys, but may also be slightly more sensitive than virus isolation. However, in a titration experiment under laboratory conditions, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was not significantly higher when compared with virus isolation...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to deduct the {{composition}} for recycled multilayer film plastic waste and {{how it could be}} compatibilized in theory. The composition analysis was carried out using three different methods: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and polarized light optical microscopy. Recycled multilayer plastic film samples were provided by Arcada University of applied sciences after initial screening. FTIR and optical microscopy were used on all samples. Some samples had their materials written on the packages. DSC was used only on samples with unknown material composition. Optical microscopy was used to produce cross-section images of the multi-layer films. Layer thicknesses and the number of layers were differentiated from these images. Different plastics exhibit various interference colors with polarized light, thus individual layers could be identified. Top and bottom layers were analyzed by FTIR and then cross-referenced with the data from the layer analysis. Analysis was carried out for 121 samples and 738 layers. This lead to the total thickness of each material used in the <b>sample</b> <b>pool,</b> which was used to further calculate the proportions of each material in relation to volume for different package types and the whole <b>sample</b> <b>pool.</b> The <b>sample</b> <b>pool</b> consisted of 56. 7 % polyethylene (PE), 13. 5 % of polypropylene (PP), 9. 5 % of polyamide- 6 (PA- 6), 7. 8 % of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 4. 5 % of copolymers of PE and PP, 4. 1 % of print, 2. 0 % of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) or tie layers and of 1. 9 % ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH).
