40|$|Tests were {{performed}} to determine the dynamic behavior and establish baseline dynamic data for five self-acting face seals employing Rayleigh-step lift-pads and inward pumping as well as outward-pumping spiral grooves for the lift-generating mechanism. The primary parameters measured in the tests were film thickness, <b>seal</b> <b>seat</b> axial motion, and seal frictional torque. The data show the dynamic response of the film thickness to {{the motion of the}} <b>seal</b> <b>seat.</b> The inward-pumping spiral-groove seals exhibited a high-amplitude film thickness vibratory mode with a frequency of four times the shaft speed. This mode was not observed in the other seals tested. The tests also revealed that high film thickness vibration amplitude produces considerably higher average film thickness than do low amplitude film thickness vibrations. The seals were tested at a constant face load of 73 N (16. 4 lb) with ambient air at room temperature and atmospheric pressure as the fluid medium. The test speed range was from 7000 to 17000 rpm.

The {{distributed}} fatigue {{stresses of}} 353130 B roller bearing of China freight car with K 5 type titling bogie are investigated using an elastic-plastic finite element (FE) analysis.

Second, local analysis {{is applied to}} the local axle-bearing-adapter part, in which on the section of axle is with the bound condition obtained from the integral analysis. Wheel contact force spectrum on a curved railway line by on-line inspection is used for the present study. Previous proposed multivariate quadratic regression approach is applied for transferring the load spectrum to the dynamic stress spectrum at a special position of the bearing. Results reveal that the rollers, inner-and outer-rings of bearing are subjected to distribute axially equivalent stress amplitude. The closer to axle side, the larger the equivalent stress amplitude. The equivalent stress amplitude of outer ring at the position close to the <b>seal</b> <b>seat</b> is relative larger to that of inner ring.

25|$|A unique {{supersonic}} {{escape capsule}} {{was designed for}} the XF-103. The pilot's seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area {{in front of the}} pilot's legs.

Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window in the front of the shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the bottom of the aircraft, allowing the pilot to simply walk into the seat, sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft.
