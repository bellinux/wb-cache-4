5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E

50|$|In the United States {{the dish}} is {{commonly}} prepared {{with a kind}} of shellfish called steamers, a somewhat generic name that usually refers to a small <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> harvested and served along the East Coast and in New England. Steamers are so named because of the way are most often prepared.|$|E
5000|$|In culinary use, {{within the}} eastern {{coast of the}} United States, the term [...] "clam" [...] most often refers to the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria. It may also refer to a few other common edible species, such as the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam,</b> Mya arenaria and the ocean quahog, Arctica islandica. Another species commercially {{exploited}} on the Atlantic Coast of the United States is the surf clam Spisula solidissima. Scallops are also used for food.|$|E
50|$|As well {{as being}} eaten by humans, the soft-shelled clam is {{apparently}} relished by sea otters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where the clam is an invasive species (see image below). In New England the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> is preyed heavily upon by northern moon snails and invasive green crabs. They are also a favorite of sea gulls, which pull the clam from the sand, climb to about 15 - 20 ft, and then drop the clam on a hard surface, breaking the shell. They then dive down quickly to eat the soft parts of the clam before others can get to it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Soft-shell</b> <b>clams</b> can {{be eaten}} steamed, fried, or in clam chowder. [...] "Steamers" [...] (steamed <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clams)</b> are an {{integral}} part of the New England clam bake, where they are served steamed whole in the shell, then pulled from the shell at the table, the neck skin is removed and then while holding the clam by the neck it is dipped, first in the clam broth in which they were cooked, to rinse away remaining sand, and then very briefly in melted butter.|$|R

50|$|Balanus improvisus is {{the first}} benthos species which spread from the Black Sea in the early 20th century and settled in the Sea of Azov. Its current density is 7 kg/m2. From 1956, Rapana venosa is {{observed}} in the Sea of Azov, but it could not adjust to low salinity and therefore {{is limited to the}} neighborhood of the Kerch Strait. Several Sea of Azov mollusks, such as shipworm (Teredo navalis), <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> (Mya arernaria), Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and Anadara inaequivalvis, originate from the Black Sea. Another example of invading species is the Dutch crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii which is observed both in saline and freshwater parts.|$|E
50|$|Seafood in the United States {{originated}} with the Native Americans, who often ate cod, lemon sole, flounder, herring, halibut, sturgeon, smelt, drum on the East Coast, and olachen and salmon on the West Coast. Whale was hunted by Native Americans off the Northwest coast, especially by the Makah, {{and used for}} their meat and oil. Seal and walrus were also eaten, in addition to eel from New York's Finger Lakes region. Catfish was also popular among native peoples, including the Modocs. Crustacean included shrimp, lobster, crayfish, and dungeness crabs in the Northwest and blue crabs in the East. Other shellfish include abalone and geoduck on the West Coast, while on the East Coast the surf clam, quahog, and the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam.</b> Oysters were eaten on both shores, as were mussels and periwinkles.|$|E

50|$|Fossils of Laternula elliptica {{dating back}} to the late Pliocene are common in certain {{sedimentary}} rocks on Cockburn Island and the James Ross Island group off the Antarctic Peninsula. Some of these fossils are still in the positions the molluscs occupied when alive and it has been found that they are all orientated in roughly the same direction, many with a variance of only 10° and all within a 66° range. This orientation is similar {{to the way in which}} the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> (Mya arenaria) places itself at right angle to the main water movements it experiences, a positioning that is believed to optimise water flow through the siphons. Another bivalve, the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera), is not exposed to the ebb and flow of the tide and locates itself so that the inhalant siphon is upstream of the exhalant siphon. This rheotaxis may help Laternula elliptica maximise energy gain in the summer in an environment where the food availability and consequent growth of organisms varies greatly at different times of the year. The orientation of modern Laternula elliptica has not yet been studied.|$|E
5000|$|... 4 {{species of}} {{shellfish}} {{can be found}} in the coastal municipality of Salacgrīva: <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> (Mya arenaria), Baltic clam (Macoma Baltica), lagoon cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum), and the bay mussel (Mytilus trossulus). Aforetime locals used shellfish as a feed for chicken, as such diet provided stronger egg shells.Salacgriva district is a part of the North Vidzeme Biosphere Reserve, and a nature reserve “Vidzemes akmeņainā jūrmala” (the rocky seashore of Vidzeme) lies within the area of the municipality. The size of this nature reserve is 3370 ha and it takes up 12 km of the sea cost of Vidzeme. Very rare and protected habitats, which are not present elsewhere in Latvian, are abundant in this area. The beaches are covered with stones and pebbles, meadows, foredunes or white dunes. Between beaches and forests an unusual habitat - Grey dunes - is hidden. Sandstone outcrops can be seen on the sea shore. Typical as well as rare and protected species and habitats can be found on the Stony beach. The boulders, which are located on the underwater part of the water level, serve as “brakes” during strong winds and storms, protecting the shore and forelands from erosion. The sandstone which can be seen in the outcrops of “Vidzemes akmeņainajā jūrmalā” (rocky seashore of Vidzeme) has formed over 350 million years ago. The largest outcrop on Vidzeme coast is the Veczemju cliffs.|$|E

50|$|Brown bears {{will also}} {{commonly}} consume animal matter, which {{in summer and}} autumn may regularly be {{in the form of}} insects, larvae and grubs, including beehives. Most insects eaten are of the highly social variety found in colonial nests, which provide a likely greater quantity of food, although they will also tear apart rotten logs on the forest floor, turn over rocks or simply dig in soft earth in attempts to consume individual invertebrates such as bugs, beetles and earthworms. Honey bees and wasps are important supplemental foods in Eurasia from the furthest west of their range, in Spain, to the furthest east, in Hokkaido. Bears in Yellowstone and Montana eat an enormous number of moths during the summer, sometimes consuming as many as 40,000 army cutworm moths (Euxoa auxiliaris) in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects. In Europe, a variety of species of ants have been found to factor heavily into the diet in some areas such as Scandinavia and eastern Europe. In Slovenia, for example, up to 25% of the dry mass consumed by bears was ants. Locally heavy consumption of ants has been reported in North America as well, as in west-central Alberta, 49% of scat contained ants. This species mainly feed on ants with a passive response to the colony being dug out and low levels of formic acid, therefore carpenter ants (Camponotus ssp.), which are accessed through rotten logs rather than underground colonies, are preferred where available. Other important insect aggregations that brown bears feed heavily on in some regions include ladybirds and caddisfly. Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat crabs and clams. In Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve, bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> (Mya arenaria) and Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula), providing a more nutritious source of dietary energy in spring than plant life before fish become available there. The zarigani (Cambaroides japonicus), a type of crayfish, of Hokkaido is also an important, protein-rich dietary supplement for bears there.|$|E

40|$|The {{non-indigenous}} {{green crab}} (Carcinus maenas) {{is an important}} predator on bivalve wild beds in coastal areas worldwide. This study explored size-dependent green crab prey preference on American oysters (Crassostrea virginica), blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), and <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clams</b> (Mya arenaria) in a productive coastal system of Atlantic Canada. Using two sizes of prey and three different experimental manipulations, small, medium, and large green crabs were given a choice among these three bivalves, and their daily feeding rates were monitored {{over the course of}} 3 days. For both prey sizes, green crabs showed an early feeding preference for <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clams</b> and, only as they declined in numbers, a switch toward mussels and subsequently toward oysters.

40|$|Attempts to {{introduce}} infectious or foreign material into oysters and other bivalve mollusks usually involve force or trauma because of immediate, prolonged adduction of the tightly closing valves. The <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam,</b> Mya arenaria, {{is unable to}} seal its valves completely and relaxes readily, exposing soft tissue and a large siphon. This species is free from fouling organisms and is readily available at all seasons in the New England and mid-Atlantic areas. Suspensions of five strains of Vibrio sp. that cause bacillary necrosis in larval and juvenile bivalve mollusks were injected into the heart, siphon tissue, and the incurrent and excurrent siphon lumina of soft-shell clams. All vibrio strains caused significant mortality, usually within 2 days. Heaviest losses resulted from heart and excurrent siphon injections. No mortality occurred in control clams injected with seawater, broth, Serratia sp., and Escherichia coli. The <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> {{appears to be a}} useful animal for testing the pathogenicity of marine microorganisms for bivalve mollusks...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> Mya arenaria from seven locations in Europe (two stations in the southern Baltic Sea (the Gulf of Gdansk) and two in the North Sea (Veerse Meer and Oosterschelde), and three additional stations in the Denmark Straits and Bay of Biscay) was determined using starch gel electrophoresis of allozymes. The results showed {{a low level of}} genetic variability and a lack of genetic differentation among the populations studied. Basic polymorphism characteristics calculated for populations from the North Sea estuaries and the Gulf of Gdansk were: He 0 · 094 – 0 · 145, Ho 0 · 092 – 0 · 130, percentage of polymorphic loci 33 (0 · 95 criterion), mean number of alleles per locus 2 · 0 – 2 · 7. The mean value of FST was 0 · 0133 and not significant. It is concluded that in spite of a low level of genetic polymorphism the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> is a successful colonizer.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} genetic diversity in the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> Mya arenaria on a widegeographical scale using mtDNA COI gene sequences. Low levels of genetic diversity was found, whichcan most likely be explained by a bottleneck effect during Pleistocene glaciations and/or selection. Thegeographical genetic structuring of the studied populations was also very low. The star-like phylogeny ofthe haplotypes indicates a relatively recent, rapid population expansion following the glaciation periodand repeated expansion following the founder effect(s) after the initial introduction of the soft-shell clamto Europe. North American populations are characterized by the largest number of haplotypes, includingrare ones, as expected for native populations. Because of the founder effect connected with initial andrepeated expansion events, European populations have significantly lower numbers of haplotypes incomparison with those of North America. We also observed subtle differentiations among populationsfrom the North and Baltic seas. The recently founded <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> population in the Black Seaexhibited the highest genetic similarity to Baltic populations, which confirmed the hypothesis thatM. arenaria was introduced to the Gulf of Odessa from the Baltic Sea.
