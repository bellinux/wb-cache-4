5|$|Until the 1920s, {{there were}} no {{significant}} changes to the building. Neither World War I nor the November revolution of 1918 caused damage to it. In 1920, the administrative burden was considerably increased by the incorporation of several outlying towns and villages into the city of Berlin in the Greater Berlin Act. As a result, some departments and units had to be housed outside the building. In 1929, the Magistrat commissioned the city planning division to develop a concept for a new administrative building encompassing two city blocks that would also link the Stadthaus to the City Hall. This plan also included the existing main city library and the city savings bank. It would have been part of a wideranging plan to redevelop the area of the Molkenmarkt, including replacement of the old and <b>substandard</b> <b>housing</b> along Am Krögel, an alley leading to the Spree. These plans had to be abandoned in 1931 because of the political and economic situation of Berlin after World War I.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this suburbanization significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made {{efforts to create}} new attractions, such as the Gateway Arch, which construction became a focus {{of the civil rights}} movement to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace <b>substandard</b> <b>housing</b> by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, {{the city}} had 38 {{clothing}} manufacturers. The Saint-Leu and Saint-Pierre quarters and the suburb of Hem dominated the textile industry, contrasting with the prosperity of the city centre and uptown by concentrating poverty and <b>substandard</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Preston Road Estate, {{also known}} as the East Hull Estate, is a housing estate in the east of Kingston upon Hull built from the 1920s to the 1940s by Hull Corporation. At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century considerable redevelopment of the estate took place, with a large community centre established, and demolition or modification of older <b>substandard</b> <b>houses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, the Peninsular War, {{the loss}} of colonies in the Americas, and the {{continuing}} coups prevented the city from developing interesting architecture (Royal Theatre,the National Library of Spain, the Palace of the Senate and the Congress). In the slums of Madrid during this time, a kind of <b>substandard</b> <b>house</b> was developed that today has a special historical charm: {{an example is the}} corralas, which currently still exist in the neighborhood of Lavapiés.|$|R
50|$|Housing {{associations}} {{were recently}} criticised by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), the design watchdog, for producing <b>substandard</b> affordable <b>housing,</b> but Network claimed the Brent project ‘will {{show that the}} sector does produce dynamic and well-designed properties’.|$|R
25|$|Several {{urban renewal}} {{projects}} {{were built in}} the 1950s, as the city worked to replace old and <b>substandard</b> <b>housing.</b> Some of these were poorly designed and resulted in problems, of which Pruitt-Igoe became a symbol of failure. It was torn down.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} problem, East Port of Spain Development Company {{was formed in}} 2005 with a mandate to develop and redevelop a zone in east Port-of-Spain to improve the economic, social and {{physical}} environment of those areas. Large parts of Port of Spain's Eastern entrance have been cleared of old warehouses and <b>substandard</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Plans {{were made}} in the 1960s to replace the <b>substandard</b> <b>housing</b> in Notting Dale. This would {{displace}} 3,000 people, who were to be accommodated in the Lancaster West Estate scheme. This was to have included an office complex and a shopping centre, but they were never built. The master plan was drawn up by the architect Peter Deakins.|$|E

50|$|City {{officials}} {{hoped that}} {{construction of the}} Greater Richmond Convention Center and Visitors Bureau at {{the eastern edge of}} Jackson Ward would bring renewed vitality to the neighborhood. However, the construction of the convention center destroyed a number of historic houses (including that used by the Hill, Tucker and Marsh law firm), and separated it from much of downtown. Vacant and <b>substandard</b> <b>houses</b> in the neighborhood have been targeted in Richmond's Neighborhoods in Bloom program. In some areas, the progress of renovation has been slow, most notably with the First Virginia Volunteers Battalion Armory, best known as the Leigh Street Armory. In the mid-1980s, the Richmond School Board leased the armory building to the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia, and the museum is expected to open in the armory in 2015.|$|R

25|$|Mental illness: Living in a ghetto {{increases}} the likelihood of developing a mental illness, especially in children. People in this environment are less likely to receive effective mental health services. Children exposed to ongoing poverty, present in a ghetto, present a high level of depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, peer conflict and aggression. Mental health symptoms are increased in the ghetto due to exposure to community crime, gang induced violence, neighborhood drug infestations, and <b>substandard</b> <b>housing</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|Megacities, {{cities with}} {{population}} in the multi-millions, have proliferated into the dozens, arising especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Economic globalization fuels the growth of these cities, as new torrents of foreign capital arrange for rapid industrialization, as well as relocation of major businesses from Europe and North America, attracting immigrants from near and far. A deep gulf divides rich and poor in these cities, with usually contain a super-wealthy elite living in gated communities and large masses {{of people living in}} <b>substandard</b> <b>housing</b> with inadequate infrastructure and otherwise poor conditions.|$|E
50|$|Cumulatively, SFDPH also {{observed}} the {{disproportionate share of}} unwanted land uses (such as power plants, sewage treatment facilities, <b>substandard</b> public <b>housing,</b> and poor public infrastructure) in places like Bayview/Hunters Point as contributing to significant disparities in life expectancy for residents. Finally, SFDPH also witnessed residential development in historically industrial areas generating noise, traffic emissions, and pedestrian hazards for residents and workers in these areas.|$|R
50|$|After election, Kennedy {{tried to}} {{establish}} a new cabinet department to deal with urban issues. It was to be called the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Postwar suburban development, following the construction of highways, and economic restructuring had drawn population and jobs from the cities. The nation was faced with a stock of <b>substandard,</b> aged <b>housing</b> in many cities, and problems of unemployment.|$|R
50|$|Črnomerec city {{district}} covers {{much wider}} area than former village, incorporating also old urbanized villages of Vrhovec, Jelenovec, Kustošija, Fraterščica, Čukovići, and others. Positioned {{on the very}} end of historic Zagreb, according to urban regulation plans from 1865, 1887 and 1919 Črnomerec was meant to serve as industrial and army part of the city. Therefore, number of factories and army barracks were built there, together with <b>substandard</b> suburban <b>housing.</b>|$|R
25|$|Slum {{areas are}} {{characterized}} by <b>substandard</b> <b>housing</b> structures. Shanty homes are often built hurriedly, on ad hoc basis, with materials unsuitable for housing. Often the construction quality is inadequate to withstand heavy rains, high winds, or other local climate and location. Paper, plastic, earthen floors, mud-and-wattle walls, wood held together by ropes, straw or torn metal pieces as roofs {{are some of the}} materials of construction. In some cases, brick and cement is used, but without attention to proper design and structural engineering requirements. Various space, dwelling placement bylaws and local building codes may also be extensively violated.|$|E
25|$|Residential {{buildings}} occupy 26.46% of the city, or 71.11% of its built-up area; 5–14-storey buildings {{dominate the}} central part and the outlying areas are mostly built up with single-storeyed houses. The population rise in the 1990s–2000s due to the inflow of external workforce sharply {{increased the number of}} <b>substandard</b> <b>housing,</b> mainly {{on the outskirts of the}} city. More than half of the slums (1,242,490 m²) are located in northern Bogor, whereas their area is only 89,780 m² in southern part of the city. To improve this situation, the city administration launched a program of construction of cheap housing types (light prefabricated houses) in the western Bogor. These houses combine reasonable rent ($22 per year) at acceptable living conditions.|$|E
25|$|Lackawanna Steel Co. had a rocky {{relationship}} with the town of West Seneca. The company demanded large investments in sewer, water, gas and road improvements but refused {{to pay for them}} (even though the company was much wealthier than the town). The large influx of workers from the company's old Pennsylvania site swelled the Town's population, leading to the creation of extensive tracts of extremely <b>substandard</b> <b>housing</b> and severe public health problems (including outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and influenza). To save the town, West Senecans proposed separating the area around the steel mill as its own incorporated municipality. Lackawanna Steel opposed the incorporation of the proposed municipality (to be named Lackawanna), but it relented in 1909 after the two-year-long Panic of 1907 nearly bankrupted the Town of West Seneca and imperiled the company's operations.|$|E
40|$|Colonia settlements, {{commonly}} {{described as}} rural unincorporated clusters of generally <b>substandard</b> <b>houses,</b> are scattered widely {{along the southern}} border of the United States. These settlements, which have proliferated without constraint {{largely because of the}} absence of effective controls on rural county land use, often lack access to essential services, such as public water, gas, electricity, telephone, and sewage disposal. A challenging problem in the southwestern border States is how to improve the living conditions of people residing in these settlements. Information about the infrastructure and geographic distribution of colonias will assist the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in making important decisions on funding grants and assistance programs for meeting the needs of these economically depressed areas. Consequently, the HUD Office of Research, Evaluation, and Monitoring, Washington, D. C., joined with the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), Reston, Va., to evaluate the potential of forthcoming commercial high-resolution satellite images for the landscape characterization of colonia settlements.

40|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) {{levels in}} sixteen <b>substandard</b> <b>houses</b> located in Houston, Texas were examined. The {{classification}} of the <b>houses</b> as <b>substandard</b> {{was based on}} an assessment of structural integrity which would affect air exchange rates. In these homes, unvented gas space heaters were operated as the primary source of heat. ^ The Ogawa passive sampling device was used to measure NO 2 concentrations over 24 to 48 -hour periods during generally cold weather. A sampler was placed in the kitchen and bedroom of each house. The female head of household was asked to wear a monitor during area monitoring to assess her personal exposure. Outdoor levels of NO 2 were also measured. ^ Mean (standard deviation) levels of kitchen, bedroom and personal exposures were 280 (125) ppb, 256 (155) ppb and 164 (102) ppb, respectively.

25|$|Each of {{the four}} {{official}} class governments (Sophomore and Junior Steering Committees and the Freshman and Senior Senates) makes significant annual donations to various philanthropic causes throughout the community, state, country, and world. Every year since 2001, the Senior Senate has fully funded {{the construction of a}} house in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity of Lake County, Illinois, a non-profit organization that fights homelessness and <b>substandard</b> <b>housing.</b> A recent goal of the campaign was 10 houses in 10 years, and the class of 2010 fulfilled that goal. New Trier is the only school so far to build 10 houses with Habitat. Many fundraisers contribute to this and various other causes {{over the course of the}} academic year. The New Trier Tsunami Relief Committee donated more than $18,000 to relief organizations to save people who were affected by the tsunami, and also helped victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004.|$|E
25|$|The city of Cleveland {{suffered}} a significant loss of heavy industry beginning about 1950, {{which led to}} markedly higher unemployment. Meanwhile, large numbers of African Americans left the Deep South during the Second Great Migration. Cleveland saw a significant influx of blacks (who mistakenly believed the city was still a source of good jobs), but racial segregation and racially discriminatory housing practices left most African Americans able to find housing only in the city's eastern neighborhoods. The number of residents living there jumped from 150,000 in 1950 to 250,000 in 1960. Among the changing areas was the Glenville neighborhood. In 1950, Glenville was overwhelmingly white, middle-class, and Jewish. As these residents began migrating into Cleveland's far eastern suburbs in the 1950s, single-family homes were turned into rentals, and thousands of African Americans moved in. By 1960, Glenville was overwhelmingly black and poor. Most people in Glenville also lived in crowded, <b>substandard</b> <b>housing.</b> Quite often, single-family homes in Glenville were subdivided into four or more apartments, each of which accommodated a large, extended family.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reasons behind}} the continual growth of the phenomenon of famers ‘planting’ cheap and <b>substandard</b> <b>houses</b> on farmland in rural China repeatedly and without government permission. The practice has been commonly interpreted by local governments as schemes instigated by greedy farmers to maximise compensation payments from the government when their properties are requisitioned for public infrastructural or private development projects. Researchers however have found that such practices are measures farmers learnt from others to insure themselves against land grabs as well as inadequate compensation offered by local governments and developers. Their vulnerability however also spanned a growing illegal industry where farmers short of cash were lured into participating in organised ‘house planting’ projects although they could be caught and put in jail by local authorities. Other researchers are equally concerned {{by the threat of}} food security should these incidences continue to escalate. However, these problems would not be easily addressed because the survival of local governments has grown to be heavily dependent on both the huge revenues generated by and winning political mileage from urbanising the rural, or converting agricultural to non-agricultural lands.
