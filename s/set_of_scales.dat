This style was {{in contrast to}} more typical means of composing, such as providing musicians with a complete score or, as was more common for improvisational jazz, providing the musicians with a chord progression or series of harmonies.|$|E

25|$|The first, {{descriptive}} task naturally {{requires a}} clarification of one's terms, above all, the word religion. Historians of religion have long underscored the problematic {{character of this}} term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally {{in the direction of}} reification. The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary. With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology {{over the course of the}} 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be measured, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians. Factor analysis was also brought into play by both psychologists and sociologists of religion, in an effort to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales.</b> The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other postmodern viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.|$|E
500|$|The Archangel Michael, the {{embodiment}} and conduit of divine justice, is positioned directly below Christ, the only figure to reach both Heaven and Earth. He wears a dispassionate expression as {{he holds a}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> to weigh souls. Unusually for Christian art, the damned outweigh the blessed; Michael's scales have only one soul in each pan, yet the left pan tips below the right. Michael is given unusual prominence in a [...] "Last Judgement" [...] for the period, and his powerful presence emphasises the work's function in a hospice and its preoccupation with the liturgy of death. His feet are positioned {{as if he is}} stepping forward, almost about {{to move out of the}} canvas and he looks directly at the viewer, giving the illusion of judging not only the souls in the painting but also the viewers. Michael, like Sebastian and Anthony, was a plague saint and would have been visible to inmates through the openings of the pierced screen as they lay in their beds. Michael is painted with iconographic elements associated with paintings of the Last Judgement, and is by far the most beautifully and colourfully painted figure; he is dressed in a red cope with woven golden fabrics over a shining white alb, which dominates the lower panels, [...] "hypnotically attracting the viewer's glance" [...] according to Lane. He is surrounded by four cherubs, playing trumpets to call the dead to their final destination. Michael's role in the Last Judgement is emphasised through van der Weyden's use of colour: Michael's gleaming white alb contrasts with the cherub's red vestments, set against a blue sky directly below heaven's golden clouds.|$|E

40|$|To keep {{abreast of}} the advent of new occupations and majors, the 1994 Strong Interest Inventory (SII) was revised in 2004. This study {{examined}} the concurrent validity of the 2004 Strong Interest Inventory, primarily investigating the scales abilities to differentiate between different college majors for women. Discriminant analyses were {{used to examine the}} ability <b>of</b> the 41 <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> the SII to separate 31 college majors. <b>Of</b> the 41 <b>scales,</b> 39 scales were statistically significant in separating college majors for women. In addition, the utility <b>of</b> specific <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> and the cumulative ability <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> SII <b>scales</b> to correctly classify women college majors was explored. <b>Sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> investigated were the Personal Style Scales, the General Occupational Themes, and the Basic Interest Scales. Findings for the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> indicated that the PSSs, the GOTs, and the BISs were all useful in discriminating between female college majors. Furthermore, support was found for the hypothesis that the Basic Interest Scales were the most powerful predictors of college major for women due to their specificity in measuring career interests. Also, when the statistical models generated for women were examined regarding their applicability for a male sample, the fit for men was good. The author concludes that the vocational interests of women and men have much similarity. Other interesting univariate and multivariate findings were explored...|$|R

2500|$|Even so venerable a {{constellation}} as Libra {{was once an}} asterism. Until {{the middle of the}} first millennium BC, the Zodiac consisted of only eleven constellations. The biblical reference to [...] "the eleven stars" [...] (Genesis 37:9) is more accurately [...] "the eleven asterisms/constellations (of the Zodiac)." [...] At the time, Scorpius' claws were pictured as extending to Zubenelgenubi, [...] "the southern claw" [...] and Zubeneschamali, [...] "the northern claw" [...] (Alpha and Beta Librae). Later, when Virgo became Astraea, the goddess of justice, the Claws became a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> held in her hand. By Ptolemy's day, Libra had become an independent constellation, unconnected with either of its neighbors. Still, the names of its stars reflect the time when it had been the asterism of [...] "The Claws", and its figuration is that of the old sectional asterism within Virgo.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the conventional method of composing during the time, modal compositions were to be written {{as a series of}} sketches in which each performer is given a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>scales</b> that defines the parameters of their improvisation. Modal composition, with its reliance on musical scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] According to Davis, [...] "Classical composers—some of them—have been writing this way for years, but jazz musicians seldom have". In early 1958, Davis began using this approach with his sextet, a jazz ensemble made up of alto sax player Julian [...] "Cannonball" [...] Adderley, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. Influenced by Russell's ideas, Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of Milestones (1958), which was based on two modes, recorded in April of that year. Instead of soloing in the straight, conventional, melodic way, Davis's new style of improvisation featured rapid mode and scale changes played against sparse chord changes. Davis' acclaimed collaboration with Gil Evans on Porgy and Bess gave him an opportunity to experiment with Russell's concept, as Evans' third stream compositions for Davis contained only a musical scale and no chords, the basis for modality.|$|E

The <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> factors for the correction of HF/ 3 - 21 G*//HF/ 3 - 21 G* QMFF of II was determined using its well-characterised vibrational spectrum. Transferral <b>of</b> the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> factors obtained for II to the QMFF's of I, III and IV and {{calculation of the}} fundamental frequencies resulted in good agreement between the calculated and previously assigned experimental frequencies of III.

Thus the calculations performed permitted the accurate assignment of the fundamental vibrational frequencies in the experimental IR spectrum of IV.
