5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power. None had come close to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)).|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{in one of}} {{the closest}} polls in UK history, Sir Harmar Nicholls held the seat by three votes after seven recounts. Nicholls was the Conservative member from 1950 to 1974, when he lost in the October {{election}} of that year to Labour's Michael Ward, having held on by just 22 votes after four recounts in the election eight months earlier. The growth in the New Town from 1967 may in part account for Labour's victory here in 1974. In 1979, however, Ward lost the <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Brian Mawhinney, who would represent Peterborough for the entire duration of the incoming Conservative government and was a Cabinet Minister and Conservative Party Chairman during the second Major government (1992–97).|$|E
50|$|Democrats lost fifty-four <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party in the House of Representatives, and Democrats {{also lost}} eleven <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republicans in the U.S. Senate, {{allowing}} Republicans {{to take control}} of both chambers. A Progressive also lost a <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> a Republican.|$|R

5|$|The parish is {{represented}} in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{as part of the}} North East Somerset constituency, which is a county constituency created by the Boundary Commission for England as the successor <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wansdyke Parliamentary Seat. It came into being at the 2010 general election, and {{is represented}} by the Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{had long}} seen a Senate seat as a logical next step once he {{concluded}} {{his time as}} governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman's, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor's supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers' Alliance, and {{did not support the}} forces trying to prevent Tillman's re-nomination in 1892. Butler's seeming apostasy disheartened Conservatives, who did not bother to run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler's Senate <b>seat)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it that popular candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.|$|E
5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews {{to take action}} to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual care of all the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church , so far as we personally can, and authorise you, if you find the situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the teinds of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you shall transfer with the episcopal <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese , who shall have power to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.|$|E
5|$|Other early designs {{included}} Drum House, which boasted Scotland's first venetian window, and Mavisbank, both near Edinburgh. Mavisbank House, constructed between 1723 and 1727, was {{the first}} Palladian villa in Scotland, a collaboration between Adam and the owner, amateur architect Sir John Clerk of Penicuik. The latter claimed much of the credit, and certainly criticised some of Adam's suggestions, although evidence suggests Adam got his way {{on a number of}} points. As at Hopetoun, here Adam enjoyed an unusually close relationship with his client, despite their differences of opinion. His most ambitious early work was the baroque, Vanbrugh-inspired house at Arniston, near Gorebridge. Built for Robert Dundas, a lawyer and politician linked to the Earl of Stair, Arniston includes extensive grounds laid out by Adam, with a parterre and cascade, and a main avenue centred on Arthur's <b>Seat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. The stucco work to the hall at Arniston is one of Adam's finest Vanbrughian interiors.|$|E

Mair, however, then assisted in returning his <b>seat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Party at the May 1947 election. In 1948, he sold 'Rockwood'.|$|E
