5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. <b>Some,</b> <b>like</b> eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or {{stonefish}} (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously injure or kill humans. <b>Some,</b> <b>like</b> the electric eel and the electric catfish, {{can give a}} severe electric shock. Others, such as the piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and have sometimes attacked human bathers. Reports indicate {{that some of the}} catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the {{fatalities}} listed {{occurred on}} St Peter's Field. Others, such as John Lees of Oldham, died later of their wounds, and <b>some</b> <b>like</b> Joshua Whitworth {{were killed in}} the rioting that followed the crowd's dispersal from the field.|$|E
5|$|Some English {{surnames}} {{from the}} Middle Ages name animals. These have different origins. <b>Some,</b> <b>like</b> Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are metonyms for a swineherd, while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an oxherd and Shepherd (1279 onwards) means {{as it sounds}} a herder of sheep.|$|E

50|$|A Prayer for the Dying has a mixed reaction. <b>Some</b> <b>liked</b> Rourke's performance. Others put {{fault in}} his Irish accent. Other critics thought Bob Hoskins was miscast in his {{portrayal}} of the priest.|$|R
5|$|The wood warblers are a {{group of}} small often {{colorful}} passerine birds restricted to the New World. Most are arboreal, but <b>some</b> <b>like</b> the ovenbird and the two waterthrushes, are more terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores.|$|E
5|$|To modern, {{rational}} Cybertronians, of course, {{this account}} {{is little more}} than a myth; but <b>some,</b> <b>like</b> Omega Supreme, know which parts of it are fact.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive {{growth in the number of}} microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. <b>Some</b> <b>like</b> Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.|$|E

50|$|In Georgia, {{original}} soundtracks {{are kept}} in TV series and films, and Georgian voice-over translation is voiced. But also here can be <b>some</b> exception, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> children cartoon.|$|R
50|$|Reactions to the {{shooting}} among political activists were split. <b>Some</b> liberals, <b>like</b> Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, called for stricter gun control laws, while <b>some</b> Republicans, <b>like</b> Chris Collins, blamed anti-Trump rhetoric. Other activists blamed growing national polarization for causing {{the shooting}}.|$|R
5|$|Films {{released}} {{during the}} dump months {{have not always}} been consigned to cinematic oblivion. <b>Some,</b> <b>like</b> Tremors and Office Space, have become cult classics. Starting with Cloverfield, some 21st-century dump-months releases have managed to exceed $100 million on box office receipts. The similar success of low-budget horror films like The Devil Inside and Mama in the early 2010s has prompted studios to release films in that genre at times of the year other than Halloween and the dump months.|$|E
5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, <b>some,</b> <b>like</b> Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
5|$|In his own time, Whitman {{attracted}} {{an influential}} coterie of disciples and admirers. <b>Some,</b> <b>like</b> Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter, viewed Whitman {{both as a}} prophet of a utopian future and of same-sex desire – the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism.|$|E
60|$|Next, {{they were}} of very differing {{substances}} as to transparency and colour; some white, some almost black, some brown, <b>some</b> Metalline, or <b>like</b> Marchasites; <b>some</b> transparent <b>like</b> white Marble, others <b>like</b> flaw'd Crystal, <b>some</b> gray, some of divers colours; <b>some</b> radiated <b>like</b> those long petrify'd drops, which are commonly found at the Peak, and in other subterraneous caverns, which {{have a kind of}} pith in the middle.|$|R

5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets vary {{in their}} diets; <b>some</b> <b>like</b> the tawny mole cricket are herbivores, others are omnivores, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses, and others like the {{southern}} mole cricket are mainly predacious. As well as consuming roots underground, mole crickets leave their burrows at night to forage for leaves and stems which they drag underground before consumption.|$|E
5|$|Several beaches dot Banton's coast {{including}} Macat-ang, Tabonan, Mahaba, Recodo, Togbongan, Mainit, and Tambak beaches. <b>Some</b> <b>like</b> Macat-ang, Tabonan, and Tambak {{are white}} sand beaches, while others, like Togbongan, are pebbled and rocky. The island's waters are also well-known dive sites, with corals {{that serve as}} breeding ground for groupers, snappers, sharks, and stingrays.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} makers, like Pobjeda Sport, use {{different}} brands {{depending on the}} market and their local distributors. <b>Some</b> makers <b>like</b> Y.A.S. use empty cases manufactured by other ammunitions makers in this particular case it's Umarex and <b>some</b> makers <b>like</b> Turac produce cases by themselves.|$|R

5|$|The forests were {{dominated}} by birds, {{and the lack of}} mammalian predators led to <b>some</b> <b>like</b> the kiwi, kakapo, weka and takahē evolving flightlessness. The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of rats, ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle.|$|E
5|$|The raiding {{forces were}} mostly {{provided}} by the British Commandos, but the two largest raids, Operation Gauntlet and Operation Jubilee, drew heavily on Canadian troops. The size of the raiding force depended on the objective. The smallest raid was two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest raid involved over 10,500 men in Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight, but <b>some,</b> <b>like</b> Operation Gauntlet, were conducted {{over a number of}} days.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in Bus Stop (1956), Monroe founded her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, in 1955; the company produced one film independently, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Monroe then appeared in <b>Some</b> <b>Like</b> It Hot (1959) and The Misfits (1961). She was {{suspended from the}} filming of Something's Got to Give in June 1962, and the film remained uncompleted when she died in August. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million {{by the time of}} her unexpected death in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. <b>Some,</b> <b>like</b> classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} large nasal horn and four long frill spikes, the cranial {{ornamentation}} was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like projections and knobs at the posterior margin of the frill, similar to but smaller than those in Centrosaurus. Others had less prominent tabs. <b>Some,</b> <b>like</b> the type individual, had a third pair of long frill spikes. Others had much smaller projections, and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults. Like most ceratopsids, Styracosaurus had large fenestrae (skull openings) in its frill. The front of the mouth had a toothless beak.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{are often}} polymorphic, and many species {{make use of}} camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. <b>Some,</b> <b>like</b> the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many {{butterflies}} are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.|$|E
