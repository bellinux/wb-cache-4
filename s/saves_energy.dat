5|$|Proponents of DST {{generally}} {{argue that}} it <b>saves</b> <b>energy,</b> promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business.

25|$|This {{process of}} {{recycling}} {{as well as}} reusing the recycled material has proven advantageous because it reduces amount of waste sent to landfills, conserves natural resources, <b>saves</b> <b>energy,</b> reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and helps create new jobs. Recycled materials can also be converted into new products that can be consumed again, such as paper, plastic, and glass.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial cost}} of an {{incandescent}} bulb is small compared {{to the cost of}} the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, {{over the course of a}} year a more efficient lighting system <b>saves</b> <b>energy</b> in nearly all climates.|$|E

50|$|A {{counterweight}} is {{a weight}} that, by exerting an opposite force, provides balance {{and stability of}} a mechanical system. Its purpose is to make lifting the load more efficient, which <b>saves</b> <b>energy</b> and is less taxing on the lifting machine.|$|E
50|$|Balancing {{limits the}} flow in favoured circuits, forcing water through unfavoured circuits.
