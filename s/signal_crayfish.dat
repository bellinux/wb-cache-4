2500|$|Water {{quality in}} the river was {{generally}} moderate in 2016, {{although there was a}} section where the quality was bad, the lowest rating given by the Environment Agency, who monitor English rivers. The river hosts a large population of <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish,</b> an invasive species which has increased as the eel population has deminished.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{crayfish}} {{suffer from}} a disease called crayfish plague, caused by the North American water mould Aphanomyces astaci which was transmitted to Europe when North American species of crayfish were introduced there. Species of the genus Astacus are particularly susceptible to infection, allowing the [...] plague-coevolved <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> to invade parts of Europe.|$|E
50|$|Fish species {{native to}} the lake include {{northern}} pike, perch, roach, and, to some degree, rudd. There are many introduced species such as rainbow trout, North American brook trout, trout, and the hybrid species splake making the lake well-attended by anglers during both summers and winters. Crayfish plague eliminated the population of noble crayfish in 1987, but some 1.200 <b>signal</b> <b>crayfishs</b> were introduced in the early 1990s.|$|R
30|$|Examinations of <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish’s</b> gut {{contents}} showed vascular detritus, filamentous green algae, crayfish {{fragments and}} larvae of Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera {{to be the}} main parts of its diet throughout the year. Direct predation of fish as well as cannibalism occurred. Pacifastacus leniusculus mainly feeds at night. The estimated ration of a day ranged from 0.22 to 6.02  % of wet body weight with bigger rations in adult animals and during summer and autumn [8].|$|R
40|$|Undergraduate Research ExperienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence potential increasing suspended sediment loads due to global climate change could have on Orconectes virilis chemical communication. Experiments were designed to determine if suspended sediment triggers an increase in the quantity of chemical stress <b>signals</b> that <b>crayfish</b> release voluntarily under stressful environments. As well as determine if crayfish behavior is altered when exposed to chemical stress signals and damage-induced signals under turbid water conditions. In order to determine if suspended sediment triggers an increase in urine quantity crayfish were catheterized and exposed to clear water as well as turbid water in separate treatments. The influence of suspended sediment on the behavior of conspecifics exposed to both stress signals and alarm signals was determined by monitoring behavior in a Y-maze experimental stream. This Y-maze consisted of two separated arms to allow for the simultaneous input of clear and turbid with holding tanks for conspecifics to release chemical <b>signals.</b> First, <b>crayfish</b> exposed to turbid water conditions released urine quantities that were similar to that of crayfish exposed to clear water conditions. The behavior of conspecifics exposed to damage-induced alarm signals in turbid water showed no difference from the behavior of conspecifics exposed to these chemicals in clear water conditions. This indicates that Orconectes virilis disturbance chemical communication is tolerant to turbid water conditions for at least short durations of time...|$|R
50|$|In both Sweden and Finland (where {{crayfish}} are eaten) {{the catch}} of <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> exceeds {{that of the}} noble crayfish. The <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> is sold at roughly half the price compared to the noble crayfish.|$|E
50|$|As invading <b>signal</b> <b>{{crayfish}}</b> are a {{major threat}} to native crayfish, both in Britain and in Europe, Peay has studied the effects of <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> on white clawed crayfish and their environment, particularly on native fish stocks, and has researched control and eradication methods.|$|E
50|$|A less {{positive}} {{story is}} that of the native white-clawed crayfish, which has suffered at the hands of another American import, the <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish.</b> Originally imported by the aquaculture industry, the <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> was seen as a way for trout farms to diversify and exploit new markets. However, due to their expert, escapologist nature, <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> soon escaped into surrounding river systems and quickly spread throughout the majority of the UK's southern river system. <b>Signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> have carried crayfish plague, to which they are resistant, but the native white-clawed crayfish is not. The result has been the gradual eradication of native crayfish from the UK's rivers. In the case of the Chess, white-clawed crayfish have been extinct since the mid-1990s.The Chess is also home to a number of invasive alien plant species including Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam and Orange balsam.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{is situated in}} the Cotswolds valley, between Nettleton and Castle Combe, in a village setting, about 13 mi north of Bath. The bridge at Fosse Way over Broadmead Brook is nearby, where <b>signal</b> and native <b>crayfish</b> have been recorded by use of traps. It is surrounded by wooded forest land of about 2.5 ha. The stream that flows through the property is known for trout fishing. Wildlife is also recorded {{in the vicinity of}} the mill house.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Crayfish {{establish}} social dominance hierarchies through agonistic interactions, {{and these}} hierarchies are maintained through assessment of social status. Chemical signals influence {{several aspects of}} fighting behavior, but the specific chemosensory sensilla involved in detecting these <b>signals</b> in <b>crayfish</b> are unknown. The goal of our {{study was to examine}} the importance of aesthetasc sensilla—olfactory sensors on the antennules of decapod crustaceans—in regulating changes in fighting behavior in crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, over the course of repeated pairings. We selectively ablated aesthetascs from pairs of crayfish after the first day of trials and compared the behavior of these ablated animals to that of pairs of intact controls. Results show that unablated crayfish significantly decreased the number and duration of fights over repeated pairings, whereas crayfish lacking aesthetascs continued to engage in similar amounts of fighting across all three trial days. This difference shows that aesthetascs regulate fighting behavior in P. clarkii...|$|R
40|$|Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii {{are highly}} {{invasive}} freshwater crayfish and are having detrimental impacts on native species and habitats throughout Europe. The application of pheromone baits {{have been proposed}} {{as a way of}} increasing trap efficiency for population control, however the chemical identity of crayfish pheromones is unknown. An incomplete understanding of chemical communication has delayed progress in the development of appropriate bioassays. This thesis therefore focused on researching the natural context of chemical <b>signalling</b> by <b>crayfish,</b> including <b>signal</b> delivery and receiver response. Urine release by male and female crayfish was found to coincide with aggressive behaviours rather than reproductive behaviours. Female urine release was essential for initiating mating, with males detecting female receptivity by spying on hormones and metabolites released with threat signals. Physiological indicators of reception included a brief cardiac and ventilatory arrest followed by an increase in rate. Both behavioural and physiological responses formed the basis of a novel assay design. During courtship male crayfish do not appear to advertise by urine signals. This raised the question of whether chemical signals were important for female assessment of the quality of size-matched males. When given a free choice, females could not distinguish dominant and subordinate males through chemical signals alone. This suggests that females either use other criteria (e. g. size) for mate choice or perform cryptic postcopulatory mate choice. Blocking natural urine release of crayfish, which had previously fought to establish dominance, and artificially introducing urinary signals proved an effective bioassay for investigating the mechanisms of dominance hierarchy formation. Urine from the dominant male was the key factor in establishing dominance relationships. In the absence of dominant urine, subordinate males were less likely to retreat from aggressive bouts and fights were more intense. The mechanisms of signal delivery during agonistic encounters were investigated by measuring ventilatory activity. Increased ventilation rate was associated with highly aggressive behaviours and urinary <b>signalling.</b> This indicated <b>crayfish</b> create gill currents to disperse signals and increase transfer efficiency from sender to receiver. This thesis sheds light into the mechanism of chemical communication in crayfish and provides the basis for future bioassay guided purification of crayfish pheromones.

50|$|In 1959, {{to bolster}} dwindling stocks of native crayfish, the <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> was {{introduced}} to Sweden. The <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> {{was known to be}} resistant, and it was not recognised at that time that it was a carrier of the disease.

50|$|The <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> is an omnivore, {{with most}} of its dietary intake being detritus.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} reasons for this decline is the {{introduction}} of the invasive North American <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). The <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish</b> is a carrier of crayfish plague, an infectious disease to which it has resistance while the native crayfish have none. The British species is also sensitive to many kinds of pollution, such as insecticides.|$|E
30|$|Three {{years later}} Nyström et al. {{compared}} effects of both crayfish species on a complete benthic food web. They imitated a pond shore habitat in large plastic basins filled with natural densities of macrophytes, invertebrates and either <b>signal</b> or noble <b>crayfish</b> or as crayfish-free controls. Results were evaluated after two summer months. With {{regard to the}} overall impact on the ecosystem, similar findings as in previous research could be found. Crayfish took in most of their carbon from invertebrates and less from primary producers and {{had no effect on}} biomass of predatory invertebrates which mainly consisted of active swimmers. They had a strong impact on grazers and an indirect positive effect on periphyton on the substrate, probably due to the reduction of grazing snails. Crayfish grazed selectively on macrophytes and reduced the biomass of Chara while Elodea was less affected.|$|R
50|$|The <b>signal</b> <b>crayfish,</b> Pacifastacus leniusculus, is a North American {{species of}} crayfish.

50|$|From 1907, {{crayfish}} plague, {{an infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} water mould Aphanomyces astaci, damaged stocks of the native European crayfish Astacus astacus.
