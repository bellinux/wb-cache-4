5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, Braathens <b>SAFE</b> applied for a {{concession}} to fly to it along the West Coast, as well as the direct route from Oslo. SAS applied to fly the Oslo-service. The ministry wanted Braathens <b>SAFE</b> to fly the route with a concession granted to SAS, but Braathens <b>SAFE</b> rejected this. Instead, they were granted both the routes on temporary basis. The new airport received three daily flights to Oslo, of which two went via Ålesund, and four services on the West Coast route. At the same time, there was a discussion about who was to operate the new STOL-airports on the West Coast. Braathens <b>SAFE</b> stated that they wanted a local airline to do the flying, and chose not to apply. The concession was granted to Widerøe, and Braathens <b>SAFE</b> subsequently bought part of the airline.|$|E
5|$|The route Stavanger–Bergen–Trondheim {{was awarded}} to Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap in 1956, but this company filed for {{bankruptcy}} the following year. Ålesund Airport, Vigra was {{scheduled to open in}} 1958, and both Braathens <b>SAFE</b> and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens <b>SAFE</b> and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens <b>SAFE</b> stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since {{that would allow them to}} cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens <b>SAFE,</b> where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens <b>SAFE</b> had a monopoly on the routes Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted a monopoly on the routes Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss. In 1958, Braathens <b>SAFE</b> had 77,591 passengers.|$|E
5|$|A 1985 {{government}} committee, led by State Secretary Per Arne Watle, {{recommended that}} more route be flown by both Braathens <b>SAFE</b> and SAS, and that additional airlines {{be allowed to}} start other routes. On 5 September 1985, Braathens <b>SAFE</b> applied for the route Trondheim – Bodø – Harstad/Narvik – Tromsø and Tromsø–Longyearbyen. SAS had stated that it was fine with them if other airlines started flying international routes they did not, and on 17 October Braathens <b>SAFE</b> also applied for the routes Bergen–Stavanger–Paris, Bergen–Stavanger–Manchester, Oslo–Stavanger–Brussels and Trondheim–Bergen–Newcastle. The applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that SAS would retain all rights to fly internationally between Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Århus.|$|E

However, that attempt failed, as the club existed for one season only. After one season without football in <b>Safed,</b> it was decided in 2011 to bring back Hapoel <b>Safed,</b> 16 years after the original club was folded.

5|$|Both Braathens <b>SAFE</b> and SAS {{applied for}} the {{concession}} to fly from the mainland to Norway. This was granted to SAS, who would have one weekly service. From the airport was taken into use until the official opening, Braathens <b>SAFE</b> continued to fly charter flights for Store Norske. The first landing at the new airport was made on 14 September 1974 with a Fokker F-28, and Braathens <b>SAFE</b> continued to fly until 1 September 1975. Russian authorities granted a concession for a semi-weekly service by Aeroflot from Murmansk Airport. The first attempt to officially open the airport was made with a SAS Douglas DC-9 on 14 August 1975. Among the guests on board was King Olav V, but thick fog at Longyearbyen forced the airplane to return. On 1 September, a Fokker F-27 from Braathens <b>SAFE</b> was used to calibrate the runways; on board were pilots from SAS and Aeroflot {{to learn about the}} landing conditions. The following day, the second attempt to open the airport was successful. In addition to the scheduled services, Store Norske chartered cargo flights from Fred Olsen Air Transport.|$|E

5|$|Both Braathens <b>SAFE</b> and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} fly to unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens <b>SAFE</b> announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens <b>SAFE</b> stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E
5|$|Braathen <b>SAFE</b> Flight 139 was an {{aircraft}} hijacking {{that occurred in}} Norway on 21 June 1985. The incident took place on a Boeing 737-205 belonging to Braathens <b>SAFE</b> that was on a scheduled flight from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The hijacker was Stein Arvid Huseby, who was drunk {{during most of the}} incident. It was the first plane hijacking to take place in Norway; there were no deaths and no injuries.

5|$|Braathens <b>SAFE</b> {{was also}} {{given the right}} to fly its first {{international}} scheduled flights {{for the first time}} in several decades. On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted concession to fly to Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air-X was granted concession to fly the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non-Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could fly to that city. Braathens <b>SAFE</b> lost many contracts in the charter market in 1990, following Scanair's purchase of larger Douglas DC-10 aircraft. On 18 May 1990, Braathens <b>SAFE</b> was awarded the concession a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991. The airline was also awarded the route from Tromsø to Murmansk, Russia, once per week from 28 January 1993.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE's {{domestic}} market was deregulated on 1 April 1994. Since then, any airline within the European Economic Area {{is free to}} operate any domestic or international route. Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, Nice and Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens <b>SAFE</b> bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five domestic routes, was merged into Braathens <b>SAFE.</b> The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens <b>SAFE</b> and the airlines started a partnership.|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular {{that several}} {{countries}} stated that a bilateral agreement {{would have to}} be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens <b>SAFE</b> applied for fifteen-year concession on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens <b>SAFE</b> a concession, {{but at the same time}} he was worried that Braathens <b>SAFE</b> could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens <b>SAFE</b> be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens <b>SAFE</b> built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola.|$|E
