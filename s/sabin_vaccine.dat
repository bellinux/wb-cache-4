5|$|In 1961, type 1 and 2 {{monovalent}} oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, {{and became}} the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine. A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic {{decline in the number}} of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the <b>Sabin</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.|$|E
5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} attenuating the Sabin 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the <b>Sabin</b> <b>vaccine</b> replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the <b>Sabin</b> <b>vaccine</b> replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1940s, Jonas Salk used {{rhesus monkey}} studies {{to isolate the}} most virulent forms of the polio virus, which led to his {{creation}} of a polio vaccine. The vaccine, which was made publicly available in 1955, reduced the incidence of polio 15-fold in the United States over the following five years. Albert Sabin improved the vaccine by passing the polio virus through animal hosts, including monkeys; the <b>Sabin</b> <b>vaccine</b> was produced for mass consumption in 1963, and had virtually eradicated polio in the United States by 1965.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo examine {{forces that}} drive {{vaccination}} policy to eradicate wild- and vaccine-derived poliovirus, and {{to focus on}} the efficacy of vaccines to support decision-making and further research. MethodsWe searched PubMed and Ovid databases for English-language publications, without date restrictions. We also collected references from major reviews on polio vaccine immunogenicity or protection. We conducted a meta-analysis of human immunity to polio infections using multiple non-linear regression, and built a database from a broad (but not systematic) set of polio vaccine studies (46 studies, > 10000 subjects). ResultsThe outcome was an immunological model representative of many different datasets. Parameters measured immunogenicity to both humoral and mucosal immune compartments for Salk and <b>Sabin</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The immunity model was more highly correlated with the data than a simpler per-dose efficacy model. ConclusionsThe model offers new insights for immunization policy.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) in stool specimens of immunodeficient patients such as HIV-positive children (including those with an AIDS indicator condition, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention classification) by applying various molecular techniques. Methods and Results: A total of 164 stool samples from HIV-positive children and 23 stool samples from healthy immunocompetent children (the control group) were analysed during 2003 and 2004. By applying a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in combination with a nested PCR, a total of 54 enteroviruses were detected in the stool specimens of the immunodeficient children. The use of restriction enzymes and a Sabin specific RT-triplex PCR confirmed the presence of 13 polioviruses (PVs), such as seven Sabin PV type 1, four Sabin PV type 3 and two Sabin PV type 2 isolates. The 5 'untranslated region and the VP 1 capsid-encoding protein of the 13 PVs and the three PVs from the stools of the immunocompetent children were partially sequenced and their genetic relatedness was deduced from the constructed phylogenetic trees. The majority of the PVs isolated from the stools of the immunodeficient children (10 of 13 isolates) were classified as 'oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) -like viruses', as these isolates had close sequence relationships (> 99 % in VP 1 nucleotide sequences) to the original <b>Sabin</b> PV <b>vaccine</b> strains. Three PVs showed ≤ 99 % VP 1 sequence identity to the <b>Sabin</b> PV <b>vaccine</b> strains and were classified as 'suspected' immunodeficient VDPVs (iVDPVs). All of the OPV-like isolates and the 'suspected' iVDPVs carried mutations at specific positions in their partially sequenced regions, which have been associated with reversion of the attenuated <b>Sabin</b> PV <b>vaccine</b> strains to increased neurovirulence. Conclusions: Thus, this study adds further evidence to the observation that immunodeficient individuals may excrete OPV strains with potential neurovirulent phenotypes...|$|R
