Soon she becomes frightened after Tigerstar discusses his plans to rule the forest with his Clanmates, including hiring BloodClan and setting a pack of dogs on ThunderClan. Extremely scared and changing her mind, Sasha flees, but before she can get far she is approached by Tigerstar who asks if she will join ShadowClan.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} similar in {{thematic}} content to Mötley Crüe's video for the single [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". But in contrast, this video tells the story from Madonna's point of view. [...] <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> into the cubicles {{to make eye contact}} with the men but they are unable to return it. She also looks assertively into the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them. Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being. Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as 'baby' while shaking her body.|$|E

'You've come {{round to}} it, then?' he said, {{giving her a}} {{pleasant}} look from his twinkling, almost kindly eyes. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at him and turned aside. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on him both literally and figuratively.

500|$|The {{two girls}} gaze out wistfully {{from beneath the}} outstretched arms of Mrs. Mason. The hats that the {{children}} wear are drawn {{in such a way}} that they form halos around their heads, a touch Blake also uses in Songs of Innocence and of Experience to indicate the innate and divine visionary capacity of the child (see for example [...] "The Ecchoing Green" [...] and [...] "The Little oy Found"). The children’s eyes are open – they are looking at what a fine morning it is and longing to take part in it. They cannot participate, however, for they are under the suffocating influence of Mrs. Mason. In contrast to the children’s halo-like hats Mrs. Mason wears a large cumbrous bonnet. Her eyes are downcast to such an extent that they appear to be shut. Blake often draws Urizen's eyes in this way to signify the blindness of his rational and materialist ‘Single vision.’ See for example plates 1, 9 and 22 of The Book of Urizen and plate 11 of For Children: The Gates of Paradise where Urizenic 'Aged Ignorance,’ wearing large spectacles, blindly clips the wings of a child thus preventing its imaginative flight in the morning sunrise. Ironically then, Mrs. Mason is the only individual in the illustration who is not seeing what a fine morning it is. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> at the hard factual earth, ignoring the infinite and holy life around her.

2500|$|The figure symbolizing {{poetry is}} the only one of the three figures that faces the relief of Heine. It also faces towards a rose, which is {{supposed}} to express a particularly intimate relationship between poetry and Heine. From the right of the Heine-relief is the figure of satire, which turns her upper body towards Heine. In the back of the monument is positioned the [...] "melancholy". The hair of the figure is long and unadorned, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> sadly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{woman in}} Fukaku Shinobu Koi ( [...] , [...] "deeply hidden love") has {{blackened}} her teeth with ohaguro, which normally signifies a married woman, but she lacks the shaved eyebrows {{that would also}} signify her being married; she is perhaps yet young and recently married. [...] Her ornate kanzashi hairpin has a flower design on it. [...] <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> and holds a kiseru tobacco pipe in her right hand.

2500|$|The {{characters}} of Cupid and Psyche are fixed onto a long, vertical canvas. They appear long and larger than life. Cupid places a leg on a cloud for balance, and similarly balances the frame. Limbs interconnect in soft embraces. Bouguereau catches Cupid and Psyche in an inhale of breath, placing a light peck on Psyche’s cheek. Her hand almost pushes Cupid away, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down</b> {{and away from}} him. The blue cloth floats behind them and onto the surrounding clouds. The {{focus is on the}} subjects, who are above the earthly realm and gracefully play in the sky.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{members of}} the cast {{described}} Hustle's filming schedule as incredibly hectic. Vaughn said that [...] " [...] was offered to me, and I was told {{to get on a}} plane an hour after I got the phone call and start shooting the following day." [...] Speaking in 2009 after filming four series of the show, Lester explained that [...] "when we start shooting Hustle we film two episodes concurrently, with the scenes out of sequence. Knowing where you are in the intricate plots at any one moment is... challenging". Murray, by contrast, claimed that the hardest scene to film was from the fourth episode, when Danny loses spectacularly to Stacie in strip poker and ends up entirely naked. [...] "It was the toughest scene for me of the entire six months we spent filming the series... Stacie is supposed to be calm, cool and collected... <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down,</b> checks him out and casually and suavely makes a comment. I kept looking down, dissolving into fits of laughter and was almost unable to deliver my line. So all you'll see is me laughing".|$|E

60|$|The other {{picture is}} more deeply felt, still. It is of Christ {{brought to the}} foot of the cross. There is no {{wringing}} of hands or lamenting crowd--no haggard signs of fainting or pain in His body. Scourging or fainting, feeble knee and torn wound,--he thinks scorn of all that, this shepherd-boy. One executioner is hammering the wedges of the cross harder down. The other--not ungently--is taking Christ's red robe off His shoulders. And St. John, a few yards off, is keeping his mother from coming nearer. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>down,</b> not at Christ; but tries to come.|$|E

They are totally out of character. I will take those white Bride roses, too. It seems a fatality, but there really isn't {{anything}} else, and I can laugh with her about them, if it all turns out well." [...] She talks to herself rather than the florist, who stands patient behind the counter, and repeats, dreamily, [...] "Laugh with her!" ...|$|E

Had ye seen the Connecticut tatterdemalions file by last night, with arms reversed, showing their teeth at his Excellency, and yet not daring to bite; had ye watched these faint-hearts, these doubting Thomases, ripe for rebellion against his Excellency, against the cause, but chiefly against the weather,--ye would pray for a thaw that would melt the hearts of these men as it would these stubborn fields around us. Two weeks more of such weather would raise up not one Allan Brewster, but a dozen such malcontent puppies ripe for a drum-head court-martial." ...|$|E

And up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable Indian. The lamp in the hall shines on him, and I fail to recognize Mr. J. T. Little Bear, alumnus of the class of '91. What I see is a Cherokee brave, and the warpath is what he has been travelling. Firewater and other things have got him going. His buckskin is hanging in strings, and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen's. The dust of miles is on his moccasins, and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear. But in his arms he brings that kid, his eyes half closed, with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the Indian's collar.|$|E
