40|$|This paper {{presents}} some analysis {{techniques of}} the voltages induced in the stator windings after <b>supply</b> <b>disconnection,</b> to detect broken rotor bars in induction motor (IM). When the motor is disconnected from the supply voltage, the broken bars cause a distortion of the magnetomotive force generated by rotor windings, and some particular harmonics induced in the stator windings increase their amplitude. The diagnostic technique is based on monitoring these voltage harmonics via the non parametric estimation of the modified periodogram and averaged periodogram. These techniques permit to evidence the principal harmonic frequencies of the signal and decrease the noise influence, thus allowing a better detection of the broken rotor bars.

40|$|Copyright 2007 IEEEThe {{detection}} of broken rotor bar faults {{based on the}} common steady-state Fourier transform technique {{is known to be}} dependent on the loading condition {{and the quality of the}} supply. This paper attempts to minimise these issues by utilising the induced voltage in the stator windings after <b>supply</b> <b>disconnection.</b> When the supply is disconnected, the stator current rapidly drops to zero and the only source of the stator induced voltage an instant after the <b>supply</b> <b>disconnection</b> is due to currents in the rotor. The rotor currents are sensitive to broken rotor bar faults and directly affect the rundown induced voltage in the stator windings. The performance of two different broken rotor bar detection techniques, based on the Fourier transform and the wavelet transform, are investigated over a wide range of loading conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{progress}} in artificial intelligence {{enables us to}} conceive adaptive systems whose characteristics are nearer and nearer to those of living beings. These characteristics though depend on ingenious choices by the designer of these systems: Initial conditions, parameters, optimisation functions, gradient and measure of fitness within the environment. Nevertheless, in living systems which are non-finalist, there are no programmers or designers to conceive of such ingenious choices. Our paper Self-Programming Machines I presents a non-finalist model since initial states and functions are randomly chosen {{at the beginning and}} once and for all. In {{spite of the fact that}} they are non-finalist, these machines always stabilise at fixed points when they are connected to an external process. This paper studies the dynamics of a mono-layered network of self-programming machines driving a real device, the Ashby homeostat, and shows the striking properties of such networks. This system stabilises only at fixed points even if it is subjected to small perturbations or intentional breakdowns such as a reversal of power <b>supply</b> or <b>disconnection</b> of one or several motors. Real and simulated experiences are compared and theoretical results are demonstrated...|$|R
5000|$|A {{fault in}} the {{appliance}} which causes a live conductor {{to contact the}} casing will cause a current to flow in the earth conductor. If large enough, this current will trip an over-current device (fuse or circuit breaker (CB)) and disconnect the <b>supply</b> [...] The <b>disconnection</b> time has to be fast enough not to allow fibrillation to start {{if a person is}} in contact with the casing at the time. This time and the current rating in turn sets a maximum earth resistance permissible. To provide supplementary protection against high-impedance faults it is common to recommend a residual-current device (RCD) also known as a residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), or residual current operated circuit-breaker with integral over-current protection (RCBO), which will cut off the supply of electricity to the appliance if the currents in the two poles of the supply are not equal and opposite.|$|R

This increases the stress on the existing poles and for this reason the system for supplying the loads along the railway is to be removed from the poles and be replaced by some other system. This thesis is a study on a two-level low voltage (1 kV and 0. 4 kV) electrical system with the aim to investigate if it can be an alternative to the system used today taking into account the voltages, fault currents and costs. In this thesis the following tasks have been performed: � Gathering of data � Description of basic theory � Loadow and fault current calculations of the system with MATLAB � Life Cycle Cost estimate of the system � Analysis and conclusions from the results The results show that the new system can be an alternative to replace today's system. The simulations and calculations show that the voltage drop is at an acceptable level and that the fault currents are large enough to <b>supply</b> a safe <b>disconnection</b> if a fault occurs {{at the far end of}} the system...|$|R

The unit provides automatic disconnection of the appliances from the alternating current (AC) mains supply upon the expiration of a pre-set time delay period. The system works by detecting a transition from light to darkness in a room, which triggers the device into a time-out mode. During the time delay period, the appliance e. g.

Background: the impetus for this work came from involvement in a collaboration between industry and clinicians, entitled Woundcare Research for Appropriate Products. Experiences from that study highlighted the notable absence of research {{about the impact of the}} supply chain on the users of dressings. Method: interview data are presented following an outline of the grounded theory method used. These data were obtained from key stakeholders (n = 41) within the wound dressing supply chain such as nurses, manufacturers, distributors, professional organizations, government organizations and user groups. Results: the consequences of <b>supply</b> <b>disconnection</b> revealed haphazard supply, unmet user needs and lack of information transfer between player groups.

40|$|Induction motors are {{reliable}} and {{widely used in}} industrialised nations. However induction motors, like any other machine, will eventually fail. If the failure is not anticipated, it {{can result in a}} significant revenue loss. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop an efficient maintenance program. The most cost-effective solution is condition-based maintenance. An effective condition-based maintenance program requires an on-line condition monitoring system that can diagnose the condition of an induction motor {{in order to determine the}} types of faults and their severity while the motor is under a normal operating condition. The work in this thesis investigates the detection of stator and rotor faults (i. e. shorted turn faults, eccentricity faults, and broken rotor bar faults) using three types of sensor signals (i. e. current, leakage flux, and vibration) under different loading conditions. The work is based on an extensive series of sensor measurements taken using a number of nominally identical healthy machines (2. 2 kW) and custom-modified machines (2. 2 kW) with configurable stator and rotor fault settings. The thesis starts by investigating the estimation of rotor speed and rotor slot number. These two parameters are important in determining the fault frequency components that are used for detecting the stator and rotor faults. The rotor speed investigation compares four different estimation methods from the three different sensor signal types. It is found that the speed estimation techniques based on the eccentricity harmonics and the rotor frequency in the stator current, the axial leakage flux, and the motor vibration sensor signals can detect the rotor speed very accurately even when the load is as low as 2 %. Similarly, this thesis proposes three different rotor slot number estimation techniques from the three different types of sensors and demonstrates that all three techniques can estimate the rotor slot number accurately. In addition, it is shown that the reliability of the estimation techniques can be increased significantly when the three techniques are combined. The shorted turn investigation in this thesis examines and compares potential shorted turn features in the three sensor signal types under five different fault severities and ten different loading conditions. The useful shorted turn features are identified in the thesis, and then examined against variations between the healthy machines in order to determine the loads and the fault severities in which the feature can reliably detect the faults. The results show that the feature based on the EPVA (extended Park’s vector approach) is the best method. This feature can detect turn to turn faults with a severity of 3. 5 % or greater at loads greater than 20 % and phase to phase turn faults with a severity of 1. 7 % or greater under all loading conditions. However, estimating the fault severity is generally found to be difficult. The thesis also examines the feasibility of detecting static eccentricity faults using the different types of sensor signals under ten different loading conditions. The thesis compares potential eccentricity features under nine different fault severities. The useful features are identified and then combined through weighted linear combination (WLC) in order to produce a better eccentricity fault indicator. The indicator begins to show significant magnitude variation when the fault severity is greater than or equal to 25 % and the load is greater than or equal to 25 %. The experimental results show that detecting the static eccentricity faults is possible but estimating the fault severity may be difficult. Furthermore, the effects of misalignment faults on the useful eccentricity features are investigated. In this thesis, the analysis of broken rotor bar faults is performed under motor starting and rundown operation. The starting analysis introduces a new approach to detect broken rotor bar faults that utilises the wavelet transform of the envelope of the starting current waveform. The results of the wavelet transform are then processed in order to develop a normalised parameter, called the wavelet indicator. It is found that the wavelet indicator can detect a single broken bar under all loading conditions during motor starting operation. The indicator also increases its magnitude as the severity of the fault increases. On the other hand, the rundown analysis proposes several broken rotor bar fault detection techniques which utilise the induced voltage in the stator windings and the stator magnetic flux linkage after <b>supply</b> <b>disconnection.</b> The experimental results show that detecting the faults during rundown is generally difficult. However, the wavelet approach, which is based on monitoring changes in the motor torque for a given slip, seems to give the best result. Thesis (Ph. D.)
