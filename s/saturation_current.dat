25|$|A. Nakagawa et. al. {{invented the}} device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs in 1984. The {{invention}} {{is characterized by}} the device design setting the device <b>saturation</b> <b>current</b> below the latch-up current, which triggers the parasitic thyristor. This invention realized complete suppression of the parasitic thyristor action because the maximum collector current was limited by the <b>saturation</b> <b>current</b> and never exceeded the latch-up current. After the invention of the device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs, IGBTs evolved rapidly and the design of non-latch-up IGBTs became a de facto standard.|$|E

25|$|Dark current: The current {{through the}} {{photodiode}} {{in the absence}} of light, when it is operated in photoconductive mode. The dark current includes photocurrent generated by background radiation and the <b>saturation</b> <b>current</b> of the semiconductor junction. Dark current must be accounted for by calibration if a photodiode is used to make an accurate optical power measurement, and it is also a source of noise when a photodiode is used in an optical communication system.|$|E

At room temperature, boron doping induces a quasi-intrinsic region, resulting in an important increase of the breakdown voltage. At higher temperatures the boron effect is reduced.

40|$|GaInP/GaInAs/GaAs Modulation Doped Field Effect Transistors (MODFET's) with a pseudomorphic {{channel and}} a pseudomorphic barrier have been {{fabricated}} from layer structures grown on Ga/As substrates by metalorganic {{chemical vapour deposition}} MOCVD). Transistors with a gatelength of 1 mu m show drain <b>saturation</b> <b>currents</b> of 570 mA/mm and extrinsic transconductances of 420 mS/mm. Furthermore, a high drain-source breakdown voltage of 16 V is achieved from which an output power of 1 W/mm is estimated for class-B operation. Non-passivated devices do not show any degradation when subjected to high temperature operation to 1 50 deg C. Transistors with a gatelength of 0, 1 5 mu m show drain <b>saturation</b> <b>currents</b> of 580 mA/mm and extrinsic transconductances of 660 mS/mm. The devices have excellent RF properties with extrinsic cutoff frequencies of 120 and 295 GHz for f(T), and f(max), respectively.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of limiter biasing on the plasma {{parameters}} as floating potential, ion and electron <b>saturation</b> <b>currents,</b> plasma potential and electron temperature has been investigated. The measurements have been done by the Langmuir-ball pen probe in IR-T 1 plasma edge. For this purpose, this probe has been constructed and installed on IR-T 1. In this work, the biased limiter voltages are V=+ 200 V, V= 0 and V=- 200 V. The results show that ion and electron <b>saturation</b> <b>currents</b> have decreased when the collector retracts inside the tube. The negative biased voltage has reduced the ion and electron <b>saturation</b> <b>currents</b> while the positive voltage has increased them. The ratio R I I 	 {{is very close to}} one at a certain collector position. The results show that this position changes with the applying limiter biasing. The results show that the ratio R is very close to one at h=- 1. 1 mm, h=- 0. 7 mm and h=- 0. 6 mm for Vbiasing=+ 200 V, Vbiasing= 0 and Vbiasing=- 200 V, respectively. In this collector position, the plasma potential that is close to floating potential is about 54 V, 45 V and 39 V for Vbiasing=+ 200 V, Vbiasing= 0 and Vbiasing=- 200 V respectively, in plasma edge. The biased limiter with Vbiasing=+ 200 V causes to the increase of plasma potential (> 20 %) and electron temperature (> 30 %) in plasma edge. But the plasma potential and electron temperature decrease ( 40 %) due to applying the negative biased voltage (Vbiasing=...|$|R
25|$|If the {{frequency}} {{and the intensity of}} the incident radiation are fixed, the photoelectric current increases gradually with an increase in the positive potential on the collector electrode until all the photoelectrons emitted are collected. The photoelectric current attains a saturation value and does not increase further for any increase in the positive potential. The <b>saturation</b> <b>current</b> increases with the increase of the light intensity. It also increases with greater frequencies due to a greater probability of electron emission when collisions happen with higher energy photons.|$|E
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse <b>saturation</b> <b>current</b> term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|E
25|$|As {{the channel}} length becomes very short, these {{equations}} become quite inaccurate. New physical effects arise. For example, carrier transport {{in the active}} mode may become limited by velocity saturation. When velocity saturation dominates, the saturation drain current is more nearly linear than quadratic in VGS. At even shorter lengths, carriers transport with near zero scattering, known as quasi-ballistic transport. In the ballistic regime, the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at high inversion charge density. In addition, drain-induced barrier lowering increases off-state (cutoff) current and requires an increase in threshold voltage to compensate, which in turn reduces the <b>saturation</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to predict the structure of ions generated in methane flames. These simulations might lead {{to a better understanding of}} the interactions between ions in hydrocarbon flames. It was thought that such an understanding could lead to technology for electrically controlling combustion processes, formation of soot, and heat transfer;The reaction mechanisms used in this study was for a methane or hydrogen/methane flame. It contains reactions for the oxidation of fuels, chemiionization, ion-molecule reactions, and dissociative recombination. A computer model was developed to evaluate the formation of ions based on the proposed reaction mechanism;The computer code developed solved the governing equations of a laminar, premixed, one-dimensional flame immersed in an electric field. It included an iterative method that employed time splitting and finite difference techniques. Time dependent forms of the governing equations were solved until the solution relaxed to steady state;The <b>saturation</b> <b>currents</b> predicted by this model were used to determine the effective activation energies for the ionic phenomena. These values were successfully compared to experimental data. The activation energies were then compared to the values in the reaction mechanism. This led to the prediction of the ionic structure in methane flames;It appears that the depletion of the ions in the flame was by the recombination reaction H[subscript] 3 O[superscript]+ + e[superscript]- → H + H[subscript] 2 O. It was also demonstrated that C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 3 O[superscript]+ + H[subscript] 2 → H[subscript] 3 O[superscript]+ + C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 2 was the rate limiting reaction in determining <b>saturation</b> <b>currents.</b> The activation energy for this reaction was found to be in agreement with the value predicted using the <b>saturation</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R
40|$|New {{models for}} the high {{frequency}} capacitance-voltage, C(V) and forward curreat-voltage, I-F(V-F) characteristics of a large area 6 H-SiC boron compensated pn junction have been developed and implemented in an optimal parameter extraction program. The C(V) model and SIMS measurements confirm the presence of two type regions (p(-) and n(-)) in the quasi-intrinsic layer induced by boron doping. The extracted values of the net doping of these zones (6 - 10 x 10 (12) cm(- 3)) are in good agreement with previously reported data. In contrast, {{the thickness of the}} quasi-intrinsic layer, about twice the epilayer width, proves the expansion of the quasi-intrinsic region in the substrate.
