We report the isolation and characterization of a sex-pheromone-degrading enzyme from the <b>sensory</b> <b>hairs</b> of the silkmoth Antheraea polyphemus. In {{the presence of this}} enzyme at physiological concentration, the pheromone [(6 E, 11 Z) -hexadecadienyl acetate] has an estimated half-life of 15 msec.

500|$|The oral disc has {{a central}} mouth, usually slit-shaped, {{surrounded}} {{by one or}} more whorls of tentacles. The ends of the slit lead to grooves in the wall of the pharynx known as siphonoglyphs; there are usually two of these grooves, but some groups have a single one. The tentacles are generally tapered and often tipped by a pore, but in some species they are branched, club-tipped, or reduced to low knobs. The tentacles are armed with many cnidocytes, cells that are both defensive and used to capture prey. Cnidocytes contain stinging nematocysts, capsule-like organelles capable of [...] suddenly, giving the phylum Cnidaria its name. Each nematocyst contains a small venom vesicle filled with actinotoxins, an inner filament, and an external <b>sensory</b> <b>hair.</b> A touch to the hair mechanically triggers a cell explosion, which launches a harpoon-like structure that attaches to the organism that triggered it, and injects a dose of venom in the flesh of the aggressor or prey.|$|E

2500|$|In mammals, {{otoliths}} {{are small}} particles, {{composed of a}} combination of a gelatinous matrix and calcium carbonate in the viscous fluid of the saccule and utricle. The inertia of these small particles causes them to stimulate hair cells when the head moves. The hair cells are made up of 40 to 70 stereocilia and one kinocilium, which is connected to an afferent nerve. When the body changes position or begins a movement the weight of the membrane bends the stereocilia and stimulates the hair cells. Hair cells send signals down sensory nerve fibers, which are interpreted by the brain as motion. The brain interprets the orientation of the head by comparing the input from the utricules and saccules from both ears to the input from the eyes, allowing the brain to discriminate a tilted head from movement of the entire body. When the head is in a normal upright position, the otolith presses on the <b>sensory</b> <b>hair</b> cell receptors. [...] This pushes the hair cell processes down and prevents them from moving side to side. However, when the head is tilted, the pull of gravity on otoliths shift the hair cell processes to the side, distorting them and sending a message to the central nervous system that the head is no longer level but now tilted. (see: BPPV) This theory may have to be reevaluated because of an experiment in which a blindfolded owl in zero gravity was able to keep its head level while a handler was rocking its body back and forth.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the outer hair cells in cochlea have {{demonstrated}} active motilities. However, very little study {{has been done on}} the vestibular hair cells. The present study shows the motile response of the vestibular hair cells induced by application of Ca^ /ATP promoting contraction. Reversible cell shape changes could be shown in 10 of 16 isolated type I hair cells and 8 of 15 isolated type II hair cells by applying the contraction solution. The cell shape changes revealed mainly the decrease in width of the cuticular plate and infracuticular region. Furthermore, the <b>sensory</b> <b>hairs</b> in the utricular epithelium pivoted around the base and stood perpendicularly to the apical borderline of the epithelium in response to the application of the same solution.

50|$|This {{sense is}} common in aquatic animals, the most cited example being the lateral line system, the array of {{hydrodynamic}} receptors found in fish and aquatic amphibians. Arthropods (including crayfish and lobsters) and some mammals (including pinnipeds and manatees) can use <b>sensory</b> <b>hairs</b> to detect water movements. Systems that detect hydrodynamic stimuli are also used for sensing other stimuli. For example, <b>sensory</b> <b>hairs</b> are also used for the tactile sense, detecting objects and organisms up close rather than via water disturbances from afar. Relative to other sensory systems, our knowledge of hydrodynamic sensing is rather limited. This could be because humans do not have hydrodynamic receptors, which {{makes it difficult for}} us to understand the importance of such a system. Generating and measuring a complex hydrodynamic stimulus can also be difficult.|$|R

50|$|The {{objective}} of the newt experiment was to study the early development of gravity-sensing organs (see figure).

The pull that gravity exerts on the otoliths is sensed by the hair cells, and information about the gravitational stimulus is transmitted to the brain via connecting nerve fibers.
