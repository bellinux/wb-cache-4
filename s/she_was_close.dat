5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
5|$|In late 1758 Brilliant {{joined a}} Royal Navy {{squadron}} supporting amphibious raids along the French coastline. In company with other frigates she protected fleet transports and bomb vessels and assisted with shore bombardment in the Battle of Saint Cast on 11 September 1758. The progenitor of the Royal Geographic Society, James Rennell, was a midshipman aboard Brilliant {{during this period}} and produced his first coastal map while the frigate was stationed off Saint Cast. Brilliant played an undistinguished role in this engagement as her draught was too deep for her to approach the shore. By {{the afternoon of the}} battle <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> enough to the beach for her crew to witness the surrounding and defeat of the British Grenadier Guards, but was too distant to range her guns onto their French assailants.|$|E

5|$|This {{proved a}} turning point in Eleanor and Sara's long-running struggle, and as Eleanor's public role grew, she {{increasingly}} broke from Sara's control. Tensions between Sara and Eleanor over her new political friends rose {{to the point that the}} family constructed a cottage at Val-Kill, in which Eleanor and her guests lived when Franklin and the children were away from Hyde Park. Eleanor herself named the place Val-Kill, loosely translated as waterfall-stream from the Dutch language common to the original European settlers of the area. Franklin encouraged Eleanor to develop this property as a place where she could implement some of her ideas for work with winter jobs for rural workers and women. Each year, when Eleanor held a picnic at Val-Kill for delinquent boys, her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves assisted her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to Eleanor throughout her life. Seagraves concentrated her career as an educator and librarian on keeping alive many of the causes Eleanor began and supported.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E

Her long association with Morrison began in her early Fabian days; Morrison was very reticent about this friendship, choosing not to mention Wilkinson in his 1960 autobiography despite their close political association. Vernon says that the relationship almost certainly became [...] "more than platonic", but as Wilkinson's private papers were destroyed after her death, and Morrison maintained silence over the matter, the full nature and extent of their friendship remains unknown.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E

As the two lines of battlecruisers deployed to engage each other, Seydlitz began to duel with her opposite in the British line, Queen Mary. By 16:54, the range between the ships decreased to , which enabled Seydlitzs secondary battery to enter the fray. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> enough to the ships of the British 9th and 10th Destroyer Flotillas that her secondary guns could effectively engage them. The other four German battlecruisers employed their secondary battery against the British battlecruisers.|$|E
