5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of <b>sexual</b> <b>response,</b> ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Extinction {{involves}} an inhibitory form of new learning {{that is highly}} dependent on the context for expression. This is supported by phenomena such as renewal and spontaneous recovery, which may help explain the persistence of appetitive behavior, and related problems such as addictions. Research on these phenomena in the sexual domain is lacking, where it may help to explain the persistence of learned <b>sexual</b> <b>responses.</b> METHOD: Men (n =  40) and women (n =  62) participated in a differential conditioning paradigm, with genital vibrotactile stimulation as US and neutral pictures as conditional stimuli (CSs). Dependent variables were genital and subjective sexual arousal, affect, US expectancy, and approach and avoid tendencies towards the CSs. Extinction and renewal of conditioned <b>sexual</b> <b>responses</b> were studied by context manipulation (AAA vs. ABA condition). RESULTS: No renewal effect of genital conditioned responding could be detected, but an obvious recovery of US expectancy following a context change after extinction (ABA) was demonstrated. Additionally, women demonstrated recovery of subjective affect and subjective sexual arousal. Participants in the ABA demonstrated more approach biases towards stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the context dependency of extinction and renewal of conditioned <b>sexual</b> <b>responses</b> in humans. This knowledge may have implications {{for the treatment of}} disturbances in <b>sexual</b> appetitive <b>responses</b> such as hypo- and hypersexuality...|$|R
50|$|One way {{to study}} sexual arousal in {{women and men}} is to conduct sexual psychophysiological {{research}} in a laboratory setting. This field of research looks at physical <b>sexual</b> <b>responses</b> in addition to mental and emotional experiences of sexual arousal.|$|R
25|$|Shortly after Masters and Johnson {{published}} their book, several scholars criticized {{their model}} of the human <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> cycle. For example, Helen Singer Kaplan argued that Masters and Johnson only evaluated <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> from a physiological perspective, and that psychological, emotional, and cognitive factors {{need to be taken}} into consideration. As a result, she proposed her {{model of the}} <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> cycle which includes three phases: desire, excitement, and orgasm. She argues that these three phases are interconnected, yet they have different neurophysiological mechanisms. Similarly, Paul Robinson argued that the excitement and plateau phases are the same; he criticizes Masters and Johnson's work for not clearly distinguishing when the excitement phase ends, and when the plateau phase begins.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} have also criticized how Masters and Johnson define <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> solely in terms of physiology; for example, Everaerd, and Laan have found that sexual arousal {{can be defined as}} an emotional state in both men and women. Other {{researchers have}} stated that {{there is a lack of}} concordance between women's subjective sexual arousal and their genital arousal. Rosemary Basson argues that this model poorly explains women's <b>sexual</b> <b>response,</b> especially for those who are in long-term relationships.|$|E
25|$|Rosemary Basson {{proposed}} an alternative model of <b>sexual</b> <b>response.</b> She {{argues that the}} linear model is good at explaining men's <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> but it poorly explains women's sexual responses; thus, she puts forth a circular model. She states that closeness or attachment to a partner increases the effectiveness of sexual stimulation. This leads to enhanced sexual arousal, which may ultimately result in orgasm. Consequently, this positive sexual arousal continues the sexual desire that women feel, and this desire increases intimacy with the partner. Other researchers have attempted to evaluate women's sexual functioning {{in terms of this}} new model but have found contradictory results. In one study conducted by Giles and McCabe, they found that the linear model of <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> was a good predictor of women's sexual functioning (and dysfunction), while the circular model was a poor predictor. Once they modified the pathways of the model, the circular model then became a good predictor of sexual functioning. In another study looking at Malaysian women, researchers found that the circular model was actually a good predictor of women's sexual desire and arousal. More research {{needs to be done in}} this area to show whether the circular model more accurately describes women's <b>sexual</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E
40|$|Affective and {{cognitive}} factors {{play an important}} role in the activation and regulation of men’s sexual arousal. Barlow (1986) argued that initial affective reactions determine the allocation of attention to sexual stimuli. We applied Barlow’s model to our understanding of the role of sexual arousal in sexual orientation, where sexual arousal patterns have consistently been found to be congruent with self-reported orientation in men, but not in women. Visual attention of 28 heterosexual and 22 homosexual men to same- and opposite-sex erotic stimuli was assessed and experimentally-directed by means of a newly developed software application, while genital (penile rigidity) and affective responses (self-reported and physiological) were measured. In line with previous research, we found “category specificity” in men’s sexual arousal, in that <b>sexual</b> <b>responses</b> were strongest to orientation-congruent stimuli. Also, both homosexual and heterosexual men experienced stronger <b>sexual</b> <b>responses</b> to conditions in which their attention was directed to sexual versus nonsexual content of orientation-congruent stimuli. Only homosexual men manifested higher <b>sexual</b> <b>responses</b> when their visual attention was directed towards the sexual content of orientation-incongruent stimuli. Heterosexual men experienced weaker positive and stronger negative affective responses to orientation-incongruent content, suggestive of potential avoidance or inhibitory mechanisms. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The female <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> {{system is}} complex and even today, not fully understood. The most {{prevalent}} of female sexual dysfunctions that {{have been linked to}} menopause include lack of desire and libido; these are predominantly associated with hormonal physiology. Specifically, it is the decline in serum estrogens that causes these changes in sexual functioning. Androgen depletion may also play a role, but currently this is less clear. The hormonal changes that take place during the menopausal transition have been suggested to affect women's <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> through several mechanisms, some more conclusive than others.|$|E

25|$|In menopausal women, sexual {{functioning}} can impact several {{dimensions of}} a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being.

Females showed significantly more <b>sexual</b> <b>responses</b> to courtship by novel males than to previous mates in experiment 1 or to males that resembled previous mates in experiment 2. These results suggest that females discriminate actively against previous mates, and extend this discrimination to males with similar colour patterns to previous mates. This could lead to negative frequency-dependent sexual selection against common colour patterns (a 'redundant male effect'), which could contribute to the maintenance of the extraordinarily high levels of genetic polymorphism in guppy colour patterns...|$|R

50|$|As {{previously}} discussed, though {{distinct from}} one another, sexual desire and romantic love are often experienced together, and various theories propose explanations for why this may be, generally {{within the context}} of promoting reproduction and pair-bonding.

25|$|Sexual desire {{has been}} related to three {{separate}} components: drive, beliefs and values, and motivation. Particularly in postmenopausal women, drive fades {{and is no longer}} the initial step in a woman's <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> (if it ever was).|$|E
25|$|The human <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> cycle set the {{foundation}} for studying and categorizing sexual dysfunctions in men and women.

Recent research however, suggests that the current model of <b>sexual</b> <b>response</b> needs to be revised to better treat these dysfunctions.

40|$|Abstract Women with {{a history}} of {{childhood}} sexual abuse (CSA) are at greater risk for experiencing sexual problems in their adult lives.
