5000|$|Melanie Haupt of The Austin Chronicle {{found the}} release to be [...] "uniquely American {{in all the}} best ways: gritty, determined, soaked in sweat and love and drive." [...] Similarly, Graeme Thomson of Uncut called it [...] "primal, {{pounding}} folk music", and he {{found that it was}} facilitated with a subdued amount of [...] "drama." [...] Lastly, Thomson proclaimed that [...] "Nothing is overcooked," [...] which means the sound can readily and [...] "easily be recreated by the band on some makeshift stage." [...] Conversely, Phil Mongredien of The Observer faulted the album because the [...] "songs float prettily", which does not create an impression because the band produced [...] "gossamer-light and gossamer-memorable" [...] music. In agreement, Will Hermes of Rolling Stone told that the music here [...] "basically argues that a bunch of Americans can lead slowly-accelerating lovelorn singalongs just as well as UK yankophile Marcus Mumford, bringing fiddle scratching, marching-band snare rolls, parlor-room piano chords, and Kingston Trio guitar strumming to an album that’s long on nostalgic reverie." [...] But, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy vowed that [...] "they've <b>still</b> <b>got</b> plenty more <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off their chest", so this album gives them the potential <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that done.|$|R
500|$|Los Angeles Timess Ann Powers {{described}} it as an [...] "aggressive track", while Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald wrote [...] "Carey's musical stiff-arm ends with some vocal acrobatics {{to let us know}} she's <b>still</b> <b>got</b> it. Expect <b>to</b> <b>get</b> 'Obsessed' this summer." [...] MTV News rated the song as one of the contenders for the [...] "best of the summer", writing [...] "Mimi returns, this time with an Auto-Tuned kiss-off to wannabe lotharios (and Eminem?) that will probably be the soundtrack to a million summer hookups and just as many public-intoxication collars. Glossy, flossy and decidedly [...] "urban", Mariah strikes back. Your radio has been warned. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song as a [...] "top pick" [...] from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, while Amos Barshad of The New York Times listed it as the fifth top song of the summer. In contrast, [...] "Obsessed" [...] received a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times writer, Todd Martens, who wrote that although [...] "its feistier Mimi than 're used to", she ultimately [...] "has been molded to fit current trends" [...] and that the single [...] "again sells out the songbird to her producers." [...] At the ASCAP 27th Annual Pop Music Awards, [...] "Obsessed" [...] won [...] "Most Performed Song".|$|R

5000|$|Against Duke, {{he threw}} for a career-high 299 yards. Wide {{receiver}} Jermaine Lewis said, [...] "Brian {{won the first}} four games and the team tends to really rally around him... I guess we {{tend to have a}} lot of confidence with him in there." [...] Cummings suffered a broken toe on his right foot and bruised shoulder and Milanovich returned to his starting role after his suspension. Cummings saw no action in Maryland's fifth game, a 31 - 3 loss to Georgia Tech, which knocked the team out of the Top 25 rankings. At Wake Forest, Cummings came off the bench in relief of Milanovich, who had struggled reading the blitz, and played the last 39 minutes. He completed 20 passes on 30 attempts for 222 yards. He led three drives that culminated in a field goal, touchdown, and a final series which used eight minutes of the game clock in the 9 - 6 victory. After the game, head coach Mark Duffner praised Cummings' play, but stopped shy of naming him the starter. Cummings started against Clemson and , but the offense struggled and Milanovich started the last three games, while Cummings nursed a sore shoulder. Duffner said of Cummings, [...] "One of our kids said he's a linebacker playing quarterback. On a scramble, when he can slide to get down, he'll try to run over a kid for extra yards. We've <b>still</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some of that out of him, but you've got to love that toughness." [...] Because he felt his arm needed the rest, Cummings did not play college or amateur baseball in 1996 for the first time since he was ten years old.|$|E
