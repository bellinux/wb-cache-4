5|$|Kaganovichs radar suite is unknown, but it {{is likely}} she was {{equipped}} {{with a mix of}} Soviet and British and American Lend-Lease radars.

50|$|The 2009 South Sydney Rabbitohs {{season in}} Australian rugby league was the 100th in the club's history.

50|$|The headroll is a trick {{involving}} rolling {{an object}} or prop, typically a ball, {{around on the}} juggler's head. The most commonly performed version is rolling a ball from temple to temple, across <b>the</b> forehead. At <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> trick, the object may be balanced in place at a certain location on the head. Points where the prop may be balanced (also known as placement, or trap) include: the temple, {{the center of the}} forehead, the back of the neck, the eye socket, the mouth, and the most difficult; the top of the head.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of each level the player is {{informed}} who they are pursuing, a great distance away: They must apprehend the criminal before their time limit expires. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.|$|R

5|$|At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives.

As more and more difficulty emerged in his life, he gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 {{with the help of}} Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E
5|$|Hardy often {{acted as}} a scout who would help bring {{supplies}} to troops on the front line.

Eventually, horses were brought in and killed for food. The hospital was designed to treat 60 - 70 patients, but at one point was being used to treat 600 wounded soldiers.|$|R

5000|$|Since 2005, filling of the {{reservoir}} {{has led to}} the reduced flow of Bhagirathi water from the normal [...] to a mere [...] This reduction has been central to local protest against the dam, since the Bhagirathi is considered part of the sacred Ganges whose waters are crucial to Hindu beliefs. At <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> year, the tampering with Bhagirathi waters means this tributary stops flowing. This has created resentment among many Hindus, who claim that the sanctity of the Ganges has been compromised for the generation of electricity. Though the officials say that when {{the reservoir}} is filled to its maximum capacity the flow of the river will again become normal. In spite of concerns and protestation, operation of the Tehri Dam continues.|$|R
50|$|On February 25, 2012 Alexander {{moved up}} to welterweight {{and put on a}} {{dominating}} performance against highly regarded and hard-charging Marcos Maidana. Alexander landed the right hook at will, catching Maidana with his left hand down throughout the contest. Maidana was seemingly surprised by both the speed and power Alexander displayed at his first fight at welterweight. Only one of the three judges had Maidana winning a round. The impressive nature of the win earned Alexander a title match with Randall Bailey in September 2012. Alexander was criticized by some however, for fighting illegally at <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> fight.|$|R
50|$|Wigan Athletic {{had a tough}} season, {{spending}} {{much of it in}} the relegation zone and often in the bottom two. They had eight consecutive losses, between 10 September and 6 November, until earning a draw against fellow strugglers Blackburn Rovers on 19 November. Wigan were rock-bottom from 15 October to 26 November, when winning against Sunderland. They started to improve afterwards, accumulating <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Christmas period, but returned to losing ways with four-straight losses, all in January. Once again, after the defeat against Tottenham Hotspur on 31 January, Wigan were bottom in the table. After winning against fellow strugglers Wanderers, Wigan remained bottom on goal difference.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, MacLaren led Lancashire {{to victory}} in the County Championship, their only such success under his captaincy. Unusually for a Championship-winning team, the club relied heavily on batting rather than bowling. MacLaren played several big innings, scoring at a rapid pace, as his team began {{the season with a}} string of victories. Their form faded later in the season, but they {{remained}} unbeaten. In all first-class cricket, MacLaren scored 1,191 runs at 31.34. At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> season, he was asked by Ranjitsinhji, a close friend, to become his private secretary, and both men travelled to India during the winter of 1904–05. Ranjitsinhji at the time was pursuing his claim to the throne of Nawanagar, and he remained in India when MacLaren returned to England for the 1905 cricket season.|$|E

Along the Eastern Shore, the hurricane produces a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay side in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The large size of Isabel causes strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and a gust of 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge. Over 1.4million people throughout the state lose electric power at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> storm. One death in Maryland is attributed to the hurricane, and over 200injuries are reported. In all, damage is estimated at over $530million (2003USD, $621million 2008USD).

The final version of the temple dates to the 5th century AD.

5|$|The soundtrack for {{the game}} is an {{original}} score composed by Alex Guilbert. The theme for Saw, a series of plunking piano keys joined by a bass drum and violins, can be heard <b>during</b> <b>the</b> menu screen and the end credits. At <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> game, a quick tempo score similar to the opening piano track is used to increase suspense during trap and puzzle sequences. A high-pitched tune can be heard during slower parts of the game, which was used to make these parts more ominous. Variations or mixes of these tracks occur throughout the game. The game utilizes a minimalist approach to music, {{with most of the}} ambient sound being provided by other victims, screaming or taunting protagonist David Tapp. Because the tracks were meant for a video game, there are no vocals; the tracks are much shorter than typical songs and are more abundant.|$|R
