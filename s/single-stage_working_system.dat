40|$|The {{development}} {{of human resources}} {{is based on the}} fact that <b>working</b> <b>systems</b> have to be designed in order to promote qualification, since for the maintainance and {{development of}} qualification, these <b>working</b> <b>systems</b> should contain learning incentives in the process of working. This article shows that the design of work promoting qualification should consider <b>working</b> <b>systems</b> in the sense of whole organizational units and not single working places. With the example of two case studies it is shown that often only an expansion of the <b>working</b> <b>system</b> boundaries considering the product as well as the process will lead to a design of work which will promote qualification...|$|R

We consider a synthetic example that is created by commercial black oil simulator Eclipse 100 and perform six production periods as a <b>working</b> <b>system,</b> where each period lasts 8  h. Figure  3 depicts {{the configuration of the}} horizontal “well # 1 ” in the synthetic reservoir. As we aim to evaluate the productivity in unstable <b>working</b> <b>systems,</b> we eliminate the prolonged production period in the synthetic example, which was explained as the last <b>working</b> <b>system</b> of modified backpressure test.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{companies}} {{operate in a}} turbulent environment caused by various effects of global market, quick expansion of new products and production processes, fastidious customers and increased competition. In these circumstances only those companies are successful which can respond to market changes as fast as possible-i. e. they have the shortest response time regarding fulfilment of customer requirements (short delivery time and reliable delivery in addition to price and quality). Consequently, a reductionof mean inventory, range and lead time of <b>working</b> <b>systems</b> in the company is an ever increasing strategy that ensures an increase of growth and profit of the company.

Different sources were used in order to obtain the data related to <b>working</b> <b>systems</b> and their relation to the global cities concept. The conducted systematic review indicate that the search words: sustainability, occupational and global city were not crossed for research.
