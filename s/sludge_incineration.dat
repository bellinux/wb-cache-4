40|$|If left to {{conventional}} treatment processes, {{the destruction of}} toxic organic wastewaters and associated sludge volume reduction clearly becomes an overwhelming problem. Two options, incineration and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO), exist for the complete destruction of toxic wastewaters and organic <b>sludges.</b> <b>Incineration</b> has associated problems such as very high cost and public resentment; {{on the other hand}} SCWO {{has proved to be a}} very promising method for the treatment of many different wastewaters and sludges. In early 1998 Chematur Engineering inaugurated its 250 kg/h SCWO demonstration facility and since then several successful treatability tests have been performed. Among these are tests with different complex wastes, from a SCWO process point of view. They have been performed in two different ways: 1. Making the waste treatable in an “ordinary ” SCWO unit, i. e. remove halogens and dissolved salts. 2. Making the SCWO unit able to handle the difficulties in the waste, e. g. halogens. Another waste, de-inking sludge, has been treated several times. The appealing results from these tests are that, besides the complete destruction of the organic material, the remaining paper filler has shown to be good enough for reuse. This exemplifies the general possibility to destroy the organic material in the waste by SCWO and leave a “clean ” valuable inorganic material in the effluent, which could easily be recovered. The extremely clean inorganic material recovered ought to increase the interest in SCWO treatment. This type of waste may very well be the breakthrough of SCWO...|$|R

30|$|The main {{disposal}} {{routes of}} <b>sludge</b> are <b>incineration,</b> sanitary landfill, or use for land-based applications including structural soil improvement, soil buffer, and soil amendment [2]. Application of treated sewage sludge as amendment to land {{could account for}} the larger part of the nitrogen and phosphorus requirements for many crops. Moreover, the use of sludge on land, principally in agriculture, compared to incineration or sanitary landfill, has lower costs. For this reason in Europe, in particular in the Mediterranean region where high summer temperatures combined with intensive and inappropriate cultivation practices promote a constant decrease in the soil organic matter [3], 40 % of sewage sludge is used as a soil organic amendment due to its high organic matter content [1]. The use of sludge in the agricultural sector varies greatly among Member States. In some EU 15 countries—Walloon Region of Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Spain, and the UK—more than half of all sludge production is used in agriculture, but in three of the EU 27 Member States, no sludge is used in the agricultural sector (Romania, Brussels Region, and Flemish Region of Belgium), and in six other countries (Finland, Netherland, Romania, Slovakia, Greece, and Slovenia) the amounts are less than 5 % of the total sludge produced [1].|$|R
40|$|For <b>sludge</b> disposal, <b>incineration</b> is {{considered}} to be better than direct burial because of regulations and space limitations in Taiwan. Additionally, burial after incineration can effectively prolong the lifespan of a landfill. Therefore, it is the most satisfactory method for treating sludge at present. Of the various incineration technologies, the fluidized bed incinerator is a suitable choice due to its fuel flexibility. In this work, sludge generated from industrial plants was treated in a pilot-scale vortexing fluidized bed. The moisture content of the sludge was 48. 53 %, and its LHV was 454. 6 kcal/kg. Primary gas and secondary gas were fixed at 3 Nm 3 /min and 1 Nm 3 /min, respectively. Diesel burners with on-off controllers were used to control the temperature; the bed temperature was set to 750 ± 20 °C, and the freeboard temperature was 850 ± 20 °C. The experimental data show that the NO emission increased with bed temperature. The maximum NO emission is 139 ppm, which is in agreement with the regulation. The CO emission is low than 100 ppm through the operation period. The mean particle size of fly ash collected from baghouse decreased with operating time. The ration of bottom ash to fly ash is about 3. Compared with bottom ash, the potassium in the fly ash is much higher. It implied that the potassium content is not the key factor for aggregation of bottom ash...|$|R
40|$|Iron is an {{important}} element for modern sewage treatment, inter alia to remove phosphorus from sewage. However, phosphorus recovery from iron phosphorus containing sewage <b>sludge,</b> without <b>incineration,</b> is not yet economical. We believe, increasing the knowledge about iron-phosphorus speciation in sewage sludge can help to identify new routes for phosphorus recovery. Surplus and digested sludge of two sewage treatment plants was investigated. The plants relied either solely on iron based phosphorus removal or on biological phosphorus removal supported by iron dosing. Mössbauer spectroscopy showed that vivianite and pyrite were the dominating iron compounds in the surplus and anaerobically digested sludge solids in both plants. Mössbauer spectroscopy and XRD suggested that vivianite bound phosphorus made up between 10 and 30 % (in the plant relying mainly on biological removal) and between 40 and 50 % of total phosphorus (in the plant that relies on iron based phosphorus removal). Furthermore, Mössbauer spectroscopy indicated {{that none of the}} samples contained a significant amount of Fe(III), even though aerated treatment stages existed and although besides Fe(II) also Fe(III) was dosed. We hypothesize that chemical/microbial Fe(III) reduction in the treatment lines is relatively quick and triggers vivianite formation. Once formed, vivianite may endure oxygenated treatment zones due to slow oxidation kinetics and due to oxygen diffusion limitations into sludge flocs. These results indicate that vivianite is the major iron phosphorus compound in sewage treatment plants with moderate iron dosing. We hypothesize that vivianite is dominating in most plants where iron is dosed for phosphorus removal which could offer new routes for phosphorus recovery. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{recovery}} of phosphorus from sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>incineration</b> ash {{as well as}} the separation of heavy metals from ash was investigated by using the biotechnological process of bioleaching and bioaccumulation of released phosphorus by newly developed population of bioleaching bacteria, Acidithiobacillus sp. strains, and polyphosphate (poly-P) accumulating bacteria, the AEDS-population (Acidithiobacillus sp. enriched digested sludge). The biologically performed solubilization of phosphorus from sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>incineration</b> ash is accompanied by the release of toxic metals. Therefore a combined process to separate phosphorus from heavy metals by achieving a plant available phosphorus-enriched product and a metal depleted ash was designed. Leaching experiments were conducted in laboratory scaled leaching reactor containing a bacterial stock culture of Acidithiobacillus sp [...] Next step was the enhancement of P-recovery in combining bioleaching with simultaneous bio-P-accumulation by AEDS-population. The uptake of phosphorus in biomass reaches up to 66 % of the mobilized phosphorus by bioleaching.

Through upstream work the sources of substances released from goods may be identified before the emissions reach the end products. This thesis is a result of five studies, of which four were conducted using substance flow analyses (SFA) for silver (Ag), bismuth (Bi) and copper (Cu) reaching sewage sludge. The fifth is an SFA that explores the implications of the presence of As (from CCA-treated wood) in ashes. These studies helped fulfil the specific and overall aims of the thesis; to contribute to the general knowledge on diffuse emissions reflected in end products, by examining emissions of some heavy metals from various societal goods and the implications for end products, in this case sewage sludge and, to some extent, ashes. The results from the studies, of which four had Stockholm as a study object, show the urban flows and accumulated amounts (stocks) of the heavy metals. The largest sources of the metals Ag, Bi and Cu in sewage sludge were identified to be textiles (Ag), cosmetics (Bi) and brake linings (Cu). For As (in CCA-treated wood) and Cu updated SFAs were performed and compared with earlier studies in order to follow the development and changes in flows over time. The current use of the heavy metals studied can also be seen as a loss of resources, and as the metals should ideally be recovered {{as a part of a}} circular economy, urban and landfill mining as well as recycling are alternatives that need further exploring.

The final treatment option in The Netherlands for this waste <b>sludge</b> is usually <b>incineration.</b> A biological approach {{to reduce the amount of}} waste sludge is through predation by aquatic worms. In this paper we test the applicability of a new reactor concept for sludge reduction by the aquatic worm Lumbriculus variegatus. In this reactor concept the worms are immobilized in a carrier material. In sequencing batch experiments, the sludge breakdown in the predation reactor is compared to sludge breakdown in a blank reactor (i. e. without worms). Predation by the worms results in a distinct sludge reduction, which is almost three times higher than in the blank experiment. The worm faeces that are produced after sludge predation have a sludge volume index (SVI) that is approximately half that of the initial waste sludge. Due to the configuration of the predation reactor, waste sludge, worm faeces and worms are separated, which is beneficial to further processing.
