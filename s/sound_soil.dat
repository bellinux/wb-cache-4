These material properties were studied using a specially constructed object consisting of a piece of sisal rope, metal wire and three fixed chain links hanging in the pens. The object was considered to be not destructible (ND), hygienic (HY) and not making sound (NS). After a habituation period of 18 h treatments were applied in that the object was (or was not) made destructible with a partial cut in the rope (DE) and/or was soiled with excreta (not hygienic, NH) and/or was allowed to make a tinkling sound by releasing the chain links (SO). The three treatments were applied in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design on a commercial farm in seven replicates using seven different units containing eight pens per unit. At five moments in time, ranging from 18 h before until 1 h after treatment, a range of behaviours was recorded including the frequency-related parameter AMI (animal¿material interactions) and four intensity-related parameters. Repeated measures ANOVA's showed significant effects of time and hygiene as well as interactions between time and hygiene, between time and destructibility and between destructibility and <b>sound.</b> <b>Soiling</b> (NH) significantly decreased, and destructibility (DE) significantly increased attractiveness, while sound (SO) was not significant. Only moderate correlations between AMI and the four intensity-related parameters were found (median r = 0. 41, all P < 0. 05), indicating that frequency-related parameters alone may not suffice to determine behavioural importance for animal welfare. This study showed that it is in principle possible to study material properties independent of material type and that it is in principle possible to measure behavioural intensities on a commercial farm.

40|$|Abstract | Productive {{agriculture}} {{is dependent upon}} <b>sound</b> <b>soil</b> nutrient man-agement practices. Seventeen elements {{are known to be}} essential for plants. Over years of intensive cultivation and imbalanced fertilizer use, Indian soils have become deficient in several of these nutrients and are also impover-ished in organic matter. Yields of various crops have reached a plateau or are on the decline. This is of serious consequence given increasing popula-tion and diminishing per capita land availability. Several methods of nutrient management have been practiced on farms, however, the best option for the farmer is an integration of organic and inorganic approaches to nutrient management. This far a lot of emphasis has been placed on the conserva-tion and management of N-one of the earliest reported scarce plant nutrient. However, current studies across India have shown a gradual and alarming depletion of potassium and increase in P fixation leading to sustainability concerns for these two nutrients. Among other nutrients S, Zn and B are also reaching deficient status in Indian soils. This sustainability crisis needs to be addressed holistically. This paper explains the philosophy, strategies and practices available to various users of sustainable nutrient management. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that the soil, through its various physical, chemical, and biological processes, plays {{an essential role}} in the growth of plants. This is incorrect, however, in that, given water, air, and mineral salts, plants grow perfectly well without soil. Intensive commercial vegetable production systems are based essentially on hydroponics with the soil providing mainly physical support for the plant. This being said most crop production will continue to rely mainly on the soil as a physical, biological, and chemical environment for the plant roots with all three of these elements interacting, often in a complex way, to affect root growth and health and thereby determining the final yield of the crop.

The Need for Plant Nutrients Historically, the small farmers of the world have taken amazing steps in selecting crops, varieties, and cropping systems to fit their particular ecosystems.

Unfortunately, most GIS computer programs are too difficult for the people like soil conservation planners who usually have little knowledge of computers. To help them understand GIS and then use GIS for their planning, a user friendly interface to the GIS was created.

The bioaccessibility of AgNPs was evaluated using the Simplified Bioaccessibility Extraction Test (SBET) the ‘‘Unified BARGE Method’’ (UBM), and two simulated lung fluids (modified Gamble’s solution (MGS) and artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF)). The amount of Ag extracted by 0. 43 M and 2 M HNO 3 soil tests was < 8 % and < 50 %, respectively of {{the total amount of}} Ag added to soils suggesting that the reactivity of Ag present in the soil can be relatively low.

The climate for the selected 105 km 2 watershed varies from semi-arid sub-tropical to Mediterranean sub-humid. Land use changes were detected using aerial photographs acquired in 1953, 1978, and 2008. A total of 218 samples were collected from 40 sites in three different rainfall zones to represent different land use changes and different lengths of time since the construction of stone walls.

40|$|Standing on the {{threshold}} of a new decade, Texas agriculture is faced with three major problems. The first of these problems is the imperative need for a <b>sound</b> <b>soil</b> and water conservation program. Texas has been struggling with this problem for fifty years and has made some progress toward its solution. During the war, however, it was an all-out production of food regardless of cost, either in terms of dollars or resources. As a result, the conservation problem is more acute today than ever before. The second problem is that farm production is out of balance. Lucrative prices for oil and grain crops, plus the increasing shortage of farm labor, turned thousands of farmers from the more stable diversified farm program which had been built up during the ' 30 s. Now, they are again faced with quotas and acreage allotments. This calls for necessarily early and probably extensive readjustment of the entire agricultural production program. The third major change in the agricultural picture is the rapid industrialization of Texas during and since the war. This increase in urban population in this state means an increased market right at the farmer's door for more livestock, dairy, poultry, fruit, and vegetable production. Fortunately, the solution of these three problems is found in one answer. Pasture grass, forage crops, and legumes provide the best means of soil and water conservation and soil building. Inclusion of these crops in a diversified and balanced cropping program will solve the problem of marketing quotas and acreage allotments. Marketing through livestock will provide the abundance of these foods which is needed to meet the growing demands of Texas markets...|$|E

For low values of sand mass, the plate resonance decreases with added mass and eventually reaches a minimum without particle size dependence. After the minimum, a frequency increase is observed with additional mass that includes a particle-size effect. Analytical nondissipative continuum models for granular media capture the observed particle-size dependence qualitatively but not quantitatively. In addition, a continuum-based finite element model (FEM) of a two-layer plate is used, with the sand layer replaced by an equivalent elastic layer for evaluation of the effective properties of the layer. Given a thickness of sand layer and corresponding experimental resonance, an inverse FEM problem is solved iteratively to give the effective Young’s modulus and bending stiffness that matches the experimental frequency.

The growth in agricultural production {{has been one of}} the main national accomplishments. By 1999 China was feeding 22 % of the global human population with only 9 % of the world’s arable land and per capita food availability reached the levels of developed countries. The use of fertilizers has played a crucial role, accounting for about 50 % of the yield increase. However, rapid economic growth has led to unprecedented resource exhaustion and environmental degradation. China’s ‘grain security’ will face multiple pressures stemming from resource limitation, environmental pollution and population growth. The Chinese government regards agriculture as the primary field of development of the national economy in the 21 st century. The optimal agricultural developmental path for China is to improve the ratio of resource utilization and to protect the environment while guaranteeing the grain supply. This paper summarizes the trends in crop production and crop yields, fertilizer use and soil quality in China, and presents the approach of integrated nutrient management (INM) for improving crop productivity with efficient resource utilization and environmental protection. In the INM approach, the strategy is to emphasize the integrated use of nutrients from fertilizers, wastes and soil and environmental sources; managing nutrients according to different nutrients’ specific characteristics; and integrated nutrient management with <b>sound</b> <b>soil</b> management practices and other farming techniques. These new nutrient management systems can, on average, reduce N fertilizer inputs by 26 %, save P fertilizer inputs by 20 %, raise grain yields by 8 %, and reduce N loss by 47 % compared to conventional agricultural practice...|$|E

40|$|The vegetated {{reinforced}} soil slope (VRSS) soil bioengineering {{system is}} an earthen structure made from living, rootable, live-cut, woody plant material branches, bare root, tubling or container plant stock {{in conjunction with}} rock, geosynthetics, geogrids, and/or geocomposites (Figure 1). The VRSS system is useful for the immediate repair or prevention of deeper failures providing a structurally <b>sound</b> system with <b>soil</b> reinforcement, drainage and erosion control typically on steepened slope sites where space is limited. In the VRSS system, the living cut branches and plants are expected to grow (performing additional soil reinforcement functions via the roots and surface protection via the top growth). Live vegetation in the VRSS is typically installed from just above the baseflow elevation and up {{the face of the}} reconstructed streambank, acting principally to protect the bank through immediate mechanical soil reinforcement and confinement, drainage, and, in the toe area, with rock. The VRSS system extends below the depth of scour, typically with rock. Rock is useful in improving infiltration and supporting the riparian zone. The internal systems such as rock, live cut branches, geosynthetics, geogrids, and geocomposites can also be configured to act as drains that redirect and/or collect internal bank seepage and transport the water to the stream via a rock toe.

40|$|Land {{management}} in sub-Saharan Africa was {{the topic of}} a meeting held from 9 to 14 November 1998 in Bamako, Mali, and financed and organised by the CTA {{in collaboration with the}} Ministry of Rural Development and Water of Mali. The 72 participants represented various operators in the public and private sector from Eastern, West and Southern Africa, as well as international and regional organisations. The seminar sought to identify the main constraints to sustainable land {{management in}} the context of economic development and land tenure systems, and to propose strategies for disseminating successful experiences. The discussions were followed by a day of field visits to several villages around Bamako, thus enabling real exchanges with farmers in the Sahel. The participants emphasised that access to land should be ensured through a land tenure policy based on <b>sound</b> practices of <b>soil</b> conservation. It was stressed that farmers could only invest in such practices if they could share in economic development, and that this required improved distribution networks and access to markets. With regard to the replication of successful experiences to other provinces, countries or regions, participants pointed to the importance of decentralised responsibilities, clear definition and sharing of tasks for all stakeholders, awareness-building and education activities, as well as incentive measures.

40|$|The gut {{microbiota}} of termites plays critical {{roles in}} the symbiotic digestion of lignocellulose. While phylogenetically 'lower termites' are characterized by a unique association with cellulolytic flagellates, higher termites (family Termitidae) harbour exclusively prokaryotic communities in their dilated hindguts. Unlike the more primitive termite families, which primarily feed on wood, they have adapted {{to a variety of}} lignocellulosic food sources in different stages of humification, ranging from <b>sound</b> wood to <b>soil</b> organic matter. In this study, we comparatively analysed representatives of different taxonomic lineages and feeding groups of higher termites to identify the major drivers of bacterial community structure in the termite gut, using amplicon libraries of 16 S rRNA genes from 18 species of higher termites. In all analyses, the wood-feeding species were clearly separated from humus and soil feeders, irrespective of their taxonomic affiliation, offering compelling evidence that diet is the primary determinant of bacterial community structure. Within each diet group, however, gut communities of termites from the same subfamily were more similar than those of distantly related species. A highly resolved classification using a curated reference database revealed only few genus-level taxa whose distribution patterns indicated specificity for certain host lineages, limiting any possible cospeciation between the gut microbiota and host to short evolutionary timescales. Rather, the observed patterns in the host-specific distribution of the bacterial lineages in termite guts are best explained by diet-related differences in the availability of microhabitats and functional niches...|$|R
