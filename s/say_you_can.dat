500|$|The first single, [...] "Heroin", was {{accompanied}} {{with the most}} music videos, {{with a total of}} five for several different remixed versions of the cover. Each was a [...] "Blendo" [...] video which rapidly shifted random imagery and colours in time with the music. Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to Howard Deutch. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. [...] "We did it all on camcorder and we sort of wanted to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make your own videos, and you don't always {{have to do it in}} a very MTV way." [...] None were released for rotation on television; instead, one was included in the video album release, Cyberpunk: Shock to the System.|$|E
2500|$|We {{find out}} that Ah Ken and Xiao Feng were {{originally}} a god and goddess up in heaven, sent down to earth to find the Love Contract as punishment for being too rowdy and unloving. Ah Ken decides that if they cannot be together in life, {{it is better to}} die together, and he brings her to the ocean that had brought {{the two of them together}} so long ago and, carrying her bridal style in his arms, walks bravely into the crashing waves. However, Xiao Feng wakes up soon after. Then, time goes on (and a hermit crab scuttles across the camera) and Xiao Feng and Ah Ken get married. Dressed in their wedding glory, they <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear the friends through the whale doll. Suddenly, all of their friends run toward them and congratulate them. [...] "It's been too long since we last saw each other!" [...] they say. Everyone is very happy to see each other. Even Xiao Bai, who had died, is able to join them. The drama is over, and after so much for everyone, they are finally able to indulge in something that is 100% happiness! ...|$|E

[...] "I know there's {{some crazy}} yarn about the trees spreading fever, though every educated man knows why these epidemics return occasionally. And I know they <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell {{the noise of}} them among other trees in a gale, and I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> But even Cornwall isn't a lunatic asylum, and a tree that dines on a passing tourist--" ...|$|E

5000|$|In this context, [...] "safe" [...] {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mean that the contract will be made. But if not, it means that it is a worthwhile sacrifice against the opponents' contract. For example, if the opponents have bid to two spades, and you have a nine-card heart fit, the [...] "law" [...] <b>says</b> <b>you</b> should bid three hearts. Assuming the opponents have an eight-card spade fit, there are 17 total tricks. If the opponents can take eight tricks, LoTT <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take nine. If the opponents can take nine tricks, LoTT <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take only eight. But down one (even doubled, if not vulnerable) is a smaller negative score for you than letting the opponents make three.|$|R

30|$|Speaker 1 : One thing I {{would like}} to see change, {{remember}} back in the day if the doctor, and the parent, and the daycare provider signed, you could give them Tylenol? Now you have to go have [Medical Assistance] training. And then we took all these hours. But we never signed on because then you would have to have a nurse in your home and all that. If a child is teething, I {{would like to}} be able to give them Tylenol. I {{would like to see}} the medication [regulation] change. If the doctor <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and the parent <b>says</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and the daycare provider is willing, then you should be able to give that dose of Amoxicillin or Tylenol. You should be able to do that.|$|R
