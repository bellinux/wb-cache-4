5|$|Cases in the United Kingdom were {{previously}} inconsistent upon {{the issue of}} permitting representative <b>standing.</b> Nevertheless, it may now be confidently said that the UK courts recognize, in principle, the doctrine of representative <b>standing,</b> and will apply it in suitable cases.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, <b>standing</b> {{can be categorized}} as either private or public <b>standing.</b> Applicants must establish they have private <b>standing</b> if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative <b>standing.</b> Where private <b>standing</b> is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the <b>standing</b> required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public <b>standing</b> in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public <b>standing</b> to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have <b>standing</b> to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E

5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a <b>standing</b> peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large <b>standing</b> army provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes, and proposed that the <b>standing</b> army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a <b>standing</b> army of 15,000 men. The legislation was referred to a conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E

5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice {{it is unlikely}} that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authorityâ€”for example someone denied a passport. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have <b>standing</b> to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of <b>standing</b> since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant <b>standing</b> for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants <b>standing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has <b>standing</b> to represent identifiable individuals (associational <b>standing),</b> and cases where the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest <b>standing).</b> Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system for <b>standing.</b> An applicant should have <b>standing</b> in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord <b>standing.</b>|$|E
