In addition, any police officer may, when on duty and on the authority of a police officer not below the rank of sergeant, <b>stop,</b> <b>board</b> and search any vessel not being or having the status of a ship of war, and remain on board so long as the vessel remains within the waters of Singapore.

2500|$|Lifting of the Roxburgh Branch {{commenced}} on Friday 14 June 1968 {{with work}} trains hauled by DJ locomotives subsequently running {{all the way}} into Roxburgh. [...] This was the first time DJ locomotives had operated to Roxburgh. [...] By late June 1968 there was considerable removed material at Roxburgh yard ready for loading out by train. Hut accommodation for demolition workers, removal equipment such as bulldozers and a mobile crane on crawlers were transported to Roxburgh by a DJ hauled train on 2 July 1968. A temporary railway Hut compound was established on the Roxburgh station platform for the accommodation of some of the demolition men. [...] Mains power to the Huts, which were individually wired for electricity, was sourced from the electric power lines at Roxburgh station yard. The idea was that these temporary Huts were to be railed down to Millers Flat as the next demolition base just before the main line rail track had been fully removed from Roxburgh. At the time there was some significant concern reported in the media (and up to Ministerial level) as to why these men had been not able to use the Roxburgh Railway houses, which by now were mostly empty, rather than the expense of establishing the temporary railway workers Hut compound at Roxburgh. However, as explained by Railways at the time, this was impractical as the Huts would be needed anyway as demolition progressed further down the line and so portable accommodation was optimum and in the long run cheaper than furnishing railway houses at Roxburgh for temporary demolition gangs that would be there a few short weeks. By 19 July 1968, the yard track, main line track past the station platform [...] and turntable at Roxburgh had been removed and cleared out. [...] Men had been recruited from Winter Employment schemes and the mobile crane lifted complete track sets onto flat top wagons for transporting out. During demolition DSA class locomotives worked at the railhead shuttling empty and loaded wagons from and to the nearest exchange siding (the nearest intact station yard) on the branch whilst DJ locomotives periodically cleared out materials removed from that nearest railhead back down the branch to the Main South Line as removal progressed. Track sets were railed to either of Manuka station further down the branch for temporary storage or to Kakapuaka station south of Balclutha on the Main South Line where further Winter Employment Scheme men were employed dismantling these removed track sets. [...] By mid November 1968 removal was approaching the 40 mile peg, about five miles north of Beaumont (in the Beaumont gorge between Craig Flat and Beaumont). Work then ceased due to a labour shortage as seasonal workers went back to work in local freezing works. A weed spray train ran as far as Beaumont on Monday 11 November 1968, which by then has its all train <b>stop</b> <b>board</b> at 34 miles 37 chains, between Craigellachie and Beaumont (the line from here to the end of rails near the 40 mile peg being worked as an extended Way and Works siding). [...] Through the New Zealand summer of 1969 the line was effectively still complete to the forty mile peg, about five miles past Beaumont up the Beaumont Gorge. [...] Further back up the line, by February 1969 it was reported that the Roxburgh station was derelict without a window left in place and the goods shed was being demolished. Millers Flat station at the time though was still well preserved, {{to be used as a}} temporary hotel for a while due to the towns official one burning down.|$|E
