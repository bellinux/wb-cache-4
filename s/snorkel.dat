5|$|Local economies near major {{coral reefs}} {{benefit from an}} {{abundance}} of fish and other marine creatures as a food source. Reefs also provide recreational scuba diving and snorkeling tourism. These activities can damage coral but international projects such as Green Fins that encourage dive and <b>snorkel</b> centres to follow a Code of Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September 2006, Irwin was on {{location}} at Batt Reef, near Port Douglas, Queensland, {{taking part in}} the production of the documentary series Ocean's Deadliest. During a lull in filming caused by inclement weather, Irwin decided to <b>snorkel</b> in shallow waters while being filmed in an effort to provide footage for his daughter's television programme.|$|E
5|$|Zoologists have {{frequently}} mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed {{one after another}} of his more surprising claims, including the active camouflage of the octopus {{and the ability of}} elephants to <b>snorkel</b> with their trunks while swimming. The evolutionary zoologist Armand Leroi has taken an interest in Aristotle's biology.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it is not}} {{the favored}} <b>snorkeling</b> area in St. John, the most popular {{activity}} at Gibney Beach is <b>snorkeling.</b> [...] This is due to the accessibility of waters and the waters’ appropriate conditions for the most novice to advanced <b>snorkeling.</b> The <b>snorkeling</b> here is also popular because of the vast array of coral and fish that are visible on the fringing reef in the area. [...] In addition to the plants and animals, there is a sunken sailboat that is accessible to explore while <b>snorkeling.</b> [...] The best <b>snorkeling</b> here is during the summer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Snorkeling</b> {{with the}} Fish: This program is an hour long - surface <b>snorkeling</b> adventure. It allows guests {{to get up}} close to over 75 types of {{tropical}} fish including Puffers, Sea Turtles and Sharks.

5|$|Fossil Creek's steady flow, warmth, deep pools, {{and small}} waterfalls attract {{visitors}} who wade, swim, float, kayak, and <b>snorkel</b> in its waters. Four named hiking paths intersect the Fossil Creek corridor: the Flume–Irving, Fossil Springs, Mail, and Deadman Mesa trails. The U.S. Forest Service allows dispersed camping {{in some parts}} of the area but has made other parts, such as riparian zones, off-limits to overnight stays. Other activities in the area include wildlife viewing, photography, fishing, and visits to the remains of the Childs-Irving infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Like other lambeosaurines such as Parasaurolophus and Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus had a {{distinctive}} crest {{on the top}} of its head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest, including housing salt glands, improving the sense of smell, use as a <b>snorkel</b> or air trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of the various hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Many early {{suggestions}} {{focused on}} adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, following {{the hypothesis that}} hadrosaurids were amphibious, a common line of thought until the 1960s. Thus, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed it served as a <b>snorkel,</b> Martin Wilfarth {{that it was an}} attachment for a mobile proboscis used as a breathing tube or for food gathering, Charles M. Sternberg that it served as an airtrap to keep water out of the lungs, and Ned Colbert that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater.|$|E
50|$|Other bog <b>snorkelling</b> events take place, {{particularly}} in Wales, {{but also in}} Australia, Ireland, and Sweden. Associated events include the associated mountain bike bog <b>snorkelling,</b> where competitors must ride through the bog on specially prepared mountain bikes, and the Bog <b>Snorkelling</b> Triathlon, which consists of a 120-yard (110 metre) swim, a 19-mile (31 kilometre) bike ride and a 7.5 mile (12.1 kilometre) run).|$|R
50|$|Himmafushi {{is ideal}} for the budget {{conscious}} traveller that {{wants to have a}} relaxing holiday and see a bit of local life. <b>Snorkelling</b> tours etc can be booked. Be sure to bring some cheap reef shoes/water socks. <b>Snorkelling</b> equipment can be hired and is supplied for the tours. The bikini beach is shallow and warm - so very family friendly. <b>Snorkelling</b> is simply world class.|$|R
50|$|The German <b>snorkeling</b> badge is a badge {{awarded for}} {{proficiency}} in <b>snorkeling.</b> It {{functions as a}} preparation for scuba diving certification courses. The badge is awarded either by the DLRG or the Wasserwacht of the German Red Cross.|$|R
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve <b>snorkel</b> screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E
5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{different}} armoured combat vehicles were developed on the T-26 chassis in the 1930s. Among them were KhT-26, KhT-130 and KhT-133 flame-throwing (chemical) tanks (552, 401 and 269 vehicles were produced, respectively); T-26T artillery tractors (197 were produced); TT-26 and TU-26 remotely controlled tanks (162 teletanks of all models were produced); ST-26 bridge-laying tanks (71 were produced); SU-5 self-propelled guns (33 were produced); experimental armoured cargo/personnel carriers, reconnaissance vehicles, and many others. The majority of these vehicles were developed at the Leningrad Factory of Experimental Mechanical Engineering (from 1935 known as the Factory No. 185 named after S.M. Kirov) by talented Soviet engineers P.N. Syachentov, S.A. Ginzburg, L.S. Troyanov, N.V. Tseits, B.A. Andryhevich, M.P. Zigel and others. Various vehicle-mounted equipment was developed for the T-26, including mine-clearing attachments, inflatable pontoons and a <b>snorkel</b> system for fording water obstacles, devices for overcoming obstacles and many others. T-26 light tanks were also modified into different armoured combat vehicles in the field during wartime.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a <b>snorkel,</b> but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{anthropogenic}} disturbances on {{coral reefs}} {{in the form}} of overfishing and pollution can shift benthic community composition away from stony corals and toward macroalgae. The use of reefs for recreational <b>snorkeling</b> and diving potentially can lead to similar ecological impacts if not well-managed, but impacts of <b>snorkeling</b> on benthic organisms are not well understood. We quantified variation in benthic community structure along a gradient of <b>snorkeling</b> frequency in an intensively-visited portion of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. We determined rates of <b>snorkeling</b> in 6 water sections and rates of beach visitation in 4 adjacent land sections at Akumal Bay, Mexico. For each in-water section at 1 - 3 m depth, we also assessed the percent cover of benthic organisms including taxa of stony corals and macroalgae. Rates of recreational <b>snorkeling</b> varied from low in the southwestern to very high (> 1000 snorkelers d- 1) in the northeastern sections of the bay. Stony coral cover decreased and macroalgal cover increased significantly with levels of <b>snorkeling,</b> while trends varied among taxa for other organisms such as gorgonians, fire corals, and sea urchins. We conclude that benthic organisms appear to exhibit taxon-specific variation with levels of recreational <b>snorkeling.</b> To prevent further degradation, we recommend limitation of snorkeler visitation rates, coupled with visitor education and in-water guides to reduce reef-damaging behaviors by snorkelers in high-use areas. These types of management activities, integrated with reef monitoring and subsequent readjustment of management, have the potential to reverse the damage potentially inflicted on coral reefs by the expansion of reef-based recreational <b>snorkeling...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Akumal {{is famous}} as a {{destination}} for <b>snorkeling,</b> where visitors can swim with endangered green sea turtles, who visit the shallow bay to feed on sea grass. [...] The popularity of <b>snorkeling</b> has put environmental pressure on the fragile habitat.|$|R
5000|$|Finswimming {{which is}} often {{compared}} to sports swimming [...] differs from that sport {{in the use of}} masks, fins, <b>snorkels</b> and underwater breathing apparatus.

25|$|Sergeant Webbing—variously {{described}} as being from either B Company or D Company. He somewhat resembles <b>Snorkel,</b> except that he lacks the trademark wrinkles in Snorkel's garrison cap, and has wavy hair and thick eyebrows. He has pointy teeth. On at least two separate occasions, Webbing engaged Sgt. <b>Snorkel</b> in a cussing duel. He also attempted to one-up <b>Snorkel</b> in anthropomorphizing dogs, leading to Otto's first appearance in uniform, and was most recently seen (recognizably, but not mentioned by name) in 1983.|$|E

50|$|Any {{artificial}} propulsion device, e.g. fin, sock, glove, paddle or {{flotation device}} except a wet suit, is prohibited. <b>Snorkels,</b> however, are a gray area. Triathlon Canada, Australia Triathlon, USAT and ITU do not specifically disallow <b>snorkels.</b> British Triathlon does not list <b>snorkels</b> {{as part of}} the accepted equipment, thus they are disallowed. For safety reasons in open-water events, some federations permit special inflatable flotation devices; though activating the device will usually disqualify the swimmer, {{it can be used to}} float if the swimmer experiences difficulty.|$|R

50|$|Marine {{life can}} be {{explored}} by participating {{in a variety of}} <b>snorkeling</b> activities. There are miles of coral reefs on Staniel Cay and neighbouring islands and Cays. The waters surrounding the islands are clear and shallow, making <b>snorkeling</b> easy for first-timers, but a variety of places exist for more experienced divers. Grottos can be found around the island, including Thunderball grotto which is a natural limestone cavern which can be entered underwater or at low tide. Light enters through a vaulted ceiling and a variety of sea-life swim in the water below, including the purple parrotfish, yellowtail snappers, Angelfish and Sergeant Majors. The island is surrounded by shallow reefs within a few feet of the surface. Farther out from the islands, the waters are cluttered with thousands of shallow water sites, coral heads, and reefs. <b>Snorkeling</b> does not require the specialized technique, training and gear which means it is available from many activity providers, including hotels, lodges and resorts on and around Staniel Cay. Alternatively, local <b>snorkeling</b> guides can provide the information for independent <b>snorkeling</b> adventures.|$|R
25|$|One running gag has Sergeant <b>Snorkel</b> hanging helplessly from a {{small tree}} branch after having fallen off a cliff (first time August 16, 1956).
