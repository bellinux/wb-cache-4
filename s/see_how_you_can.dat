2500|$|.....this is not pinochle we're playing here. It's not penny-anty. This {{battle is}} {{over control of}} one of the most {{powerful}} agencies that ever existed in Washington—the NLRB. ... I just don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> justify saying that this is really not important because this is what goes on; and there's nothing particularly wrong with it. [...] Well, everything is wrong with it! Everything is wrong with it! Because ... it's becoming worse and worse.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1999, McCain said [...] "The {{only way}} to {{increase}} the yield on Social Security dollars is by allowing workers to make investment decisions for themselves; by empowering American families to invest, in most robust portfolios, {{a portion of their}} earnings for Social Security that they would otherwise pay in taxes to Social Security." [...] In January 2000, he repeated his strong support for creating partially private Social Security accounts. In 2004, he said, [...] "Without privatization, I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> possibly, over time, make sure that young Americans are able to receive Social Security benefits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wishing to {{participate}} personally {{in the war}} against Spain, McCord used his influence with President McKinley to be appointed colonel of the First Territorial Infantry. On July 1, 1898, the governor requested a leave of absence so he could serve in the army. Secretary of Interior Cornelius N. Bliss responded with, [...] "Do not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> recede your voluntary request to be commissioned as Colonel of Arizona regiment. I understand you have accepted command and {{it is important for the}} public service that your resignation as Governor be promptly forwarded to this Department." [...] McCord submitted his resignation letter on July 9, with the resignation becoming effective on August 1.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] {{said the}} princess; [...] "I have <b>seen</b> <b>how</b> big <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make {{yourself}}, now I wish to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> little <b>you</b> <b>can</b> become. Let me see you change {{yourself into a}} mouse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must ask}} you to await the {{conclusion}} of my toilet," [...] said he. [...] "Then we shall <b>see</b> <b>how</b> far <b>you</b> <b>can</b> justify such an intrusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! {{there they}} are, all right enough." [...] said Lord Antony, joyfully; [...] "off with you, my pretty Sally, and <b>see</b> <b>how</b> quick <b>you</b> <b>can</b> dish up the soup." ...|$|R
2500|$|Coretta {{transferred}} out of Antioch {{when she}} won a scholarship to the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. It was while studying singing at that school with Marie Sundelius that she met Martin Luther King, Jr. after mutual friend Mary Powell gave King her phone number after he asked about girls on the campus. Coretta {{was the only one}} remaining after Powell named two girls and King proved to not be impressed with the other. Scott initially showed little interest in meeting him, even after Powell told her that he had a promising future, but eventually relented and agreed to the meeting. King called her on the telephone and when the two met in person, Scott was surprised by how short he was. King would tell her that she had all the qualities that he was looking for in a wife, which Scott dismissed since the two had only just met. She told him [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say that. You don't even know me." [...] But King was assured and asked to see her again. She readily accepted his invitation to a weekend party.|$|E
2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E

6000|$|... "I really don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> else <b>you</b> <b>can</b> explain it," [...] Wolfenden remarked; [...] "the {{greatest}} {{men have}} had their hobbies, you know. I need not remind you of Nero's fiddle, or Drake's bowls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These things, {{as well as}} {{the dread}} of the girl {{discovering}} our disgrace, makes it necessary to act with extreme caution. So that I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> two <b>can</b> return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there's the rub o't." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Good, Confucius! [To the Archbishop] He has you there. I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{get over}} that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish I {{understood}} {{more about}} naval affairs," [...] Granet sighed. [...] "I'm a perfect ass at any one's job but my own. I can't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> deal with submarines at all. The beggars can stay {{under the water}} {{as long as they}} like, they just pop up and show their heads, and if they don't like the look of anything near, down they go again. I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get at them, any way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But everybody--everybody {{must feel}} the same way about Mr. Gerrish's behaviour? I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be so quiet about it--you and Ellen!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{said the}} Warden, [...] "that should {{depend upon the}} {{strength}} of your ground; and I understand {{you that there is}} some link wanting to establish it. Otherwise, I <b>see</b> not <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hesitate. Is it a little thing to hold a claim to an old English estate and honors?" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{general public}} uses the worda verage for {{a concept that}} mathematicians prefer to call the {{arithmetic}} mean. Fortunately, mathematicians bring more than jargon {{to a discussion of}} averages. This note discusses two questions about arithmetic means. <b>See</b> <b>how</b> well <b>you</b> <b>can</b> answer them before reading the hints and answers...|$|R
6000|$|Uncle Giles {{took her}} down stairs; {{and when they}} were in the carriage, in the dark, he seemed to be less shy: he lifted her on his knee and said, [...] "I will talk to your aunt, and we will <b>see</b> <b>how</b> soon <b>you</b> <b>can</b> come to us, my dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} another daughter," [...] assented Mrs. Corey. [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> joke about such things, Bromfield," [...] she added.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> help, {{but perhaps}} {{you had better}} know how matters are," [...] he resumed and gave the letter to Foster.|$|E

6000|$|... "Is tea ready?" [...] inquired Mrs. Kame. [...] "I'm famished." [...] And, as {{they walked}} through {{the house to the}} garden, where the table was set beside the stone seat: [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>can</b> leave this place, Honora. I've always wanted to come here, but it's even more {{beautiful}} than I thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>see,</b> Harriet, <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{take any}} {{interest}} in such a creature," [...] said Elizabeth. [...] "You know from {{the circumstances under which}} we saw him before father employed him what type of man he is, and it was further exemplified by the evidence of his relationship with that common woman of the streets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be a dear boy. You're {{the best}} sister that ever was; so I'll love all the scallywags {{you ask me}} to." ...|$|E

[...] asked sly Mrs. Jo, popping the sweeties into her little spool-bag.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>see</b> at all <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> be managing," [...] said Miss Stanley, and Ann Veronica {{hastened to}} reply, [...] "I do on very little." [...] Her mind {{went back to}} that treaty.|$|R
40|$|Make {{a list of}} the names, {{symbols and}} atomic numbers of the {{chemical}} elements. Assign the values 1 - 16 to the letters A-Z.

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{always do}} like your clothes, Tom," [...] {{returned}} the father thoughtfully, swinging his glasses, [...] "But I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> afford 'em, I can't." ...|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (still resentful). I don't <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> talk. You don't--you can't {{know about}} these things--when you've just said you had no family of your own, really.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{it would}} take me long to tell you!" [...] I couldn't help {{laughing}} at the comparative simplicity with which he asked it.
