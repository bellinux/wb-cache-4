30|$|Here {{we propose}} a simple {{mechanism}} that is respectful of Parliament and ensures a judge’s timely replacement, by simply changing the default option. Once the judge’s appointment expires, Parliament {{is required to}} make a proposal that satisfies the established quota (3 / 5 {{in the case of}} the Spanish Constitutional Court). If there is agreement, then the candidate is chosen, <b>substitutes</b> the exiting <b>judge,</b> and the process ends. This part is consistent with the current procedure. If there is no agreement, then a weighted lottery applies. Each party presents a candidate who enters a random choice mechanism with a probability weight equal to the proposing party’s share in Parliament. The weighted lottery is played and the chosen candidate will be determined by the lottery.|$|R
