5|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. That was because an entirely new class of tachometric bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the <b>setup.</b> <b>The</b> RAF was working on the Automatic Bomb Sight along these lines but development was slow and it had not been accepted for use when the war started. Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E
5|$|The latest {{proposed}} extremely large astronomical telescopes, {{such as the}} Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be {{built from}} hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference {{with the aid of}} a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces. Fig.15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10µm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test <b>setup,</b> <b>the</b> zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose the {{methodology}} for <b>the</b> <b>setup</b> analysis, which can be implemented mainly in small and medium enterprises which are not convinced to implement <b>the</b> <b>setups</b> development. <b>The</b> methodology was developed after the research which determined the problem. Companies still have difficulties with a long setup time. Many of them do nothing to decrease this time. A long setup is not a sufficient reason for companies to undertake any actions towards <b>the</b> <b>setup</b> time reduction. To encourage companies to implement SMED it is essential to make some analyses of changeovers in order to discover problems. The methodology proposed can really encourage the management to take a decision about the SMED implementation, and that was verified in a production company. <b>The</b> <b>setup</b> analysis methodology is made up of seven steps. Four of them concern a setups analysis in a chosen area of a company, such as a work stand which is a bottleneck with many <b>setups.</b> <b>The</b> goal is to convince the management to begin actions concerning <b>the</b> <b>setups</b> improvement. <b>The</b> last three steps are related to a certain <b>setup</b> and, there, <b>the</b> goal is to reduce a <b>setup</b> time and <b>the</b> risk of problems which can appear during <b>the</b> <b>setup.</b> In this paper, the tools such as SMED, Pareto analysis, statistical analysis, FMEA and other were used...|$|R

25|$|Typically, {{ellipsometry}} is {{done only}} in the reflection <b>setup.</b> <b>The</b> exact nature of the polarization change {{is determined by the}} sample's properties (thickness, complex refractive index or dielectric function tensor). Although optical techniques are inherently diffraction-limited, ellipsometry exploits phase information (polarization state), and can achieve sub-nanometer resolution. In its simplest form, the technique is applicable to thin films with thickness of less than a nanometer to several micrometers. Most models assume the sample is composed of a small number of discrete, well-defined layers that are optically homogeneous and isotropic. Violation of these assumptions requires more advanced variants of the technique (see below).|$|E

25|$|A common {{defensive}} configuration is {{to leave}} the general at its starting position, deploy one advisor and one elephant on the two points {{directly in front of}} the general, and to leave the other advisor and elephant in their starting positions, to the side of the general. In this <b>setup,</b> <b>the</b> advisor-elephant pairs support each other, and the general is immune from attacks by cannons. Losing any of the pieces makes the general vulnerable to cannon, and the setup may need to be abandoned. The defender may move advisors or elephants away from the general, or even sacrifice them intentionally, to ward off attack by a cannon.|$|E

In the event of a series split with both teams winning one game, a 10-minute mini-game period would be played; if still tied, multiple 10-minute overtime periods thereafter, until one team scores. The mini-game was played immediately following the conclusion of the second contest to determine the winner of the playoff series.|$|E

25|$|A player's {{promotion}} zone is {{the enemy}} camp, consisting of the six farthest ranks that comprise the opponent's territory at <b>setup</b> (<b>the</b> original line of the opponent's chariots and beyond).

(The general, sumo wrestler, and elephant do not promote, nor do pieces which have already promoted.) Promotion has the effect of changing how a piece moves. See the table above for what each piece promotes to. Promotion is effected by turning the piece over, revealing the name of its promoted rank.|$|E
25|$|Vactrols {{have been}} used as {{remote-controlled}} resistors for precise ground termination of Beverage and Ewe type antennae. In a typical ham radio <b>setup,</b> <b>the</b> vactrol is placed in the termination box at the farthest point of the antenna. The LDR modifies total resistance between antenna and ground (termination resistance); the operator fine-tunes this resistor from his radio shack by varying the vactrol's LED or bulb current with a potentiometer. Tuning with vactrols improves directional cardioid pattern of the antenna. According to Connelly, vactrols are superior to traditional resistors in this function. In this simple layout, the LED or bulb of the vactrol is prone to damage by voltage surges induced by lightning, and must be protected by a pair of neon lamps acting as gas dischargers.|$|E
25|$|In May 1949, Triboro Coach {{appealed to}} the police {{commissioner}} for permission to move the bus stop to the intersection.

This move was intended to be temporary, but the stop at the corner was not reinstated. At the end of April 1950, Triboro decided to shift the bus stop back to the corner, this time due to several accidents with the pillars of the Astoria elevated line. The original setup at the middle of the block was more convenient for subway riders, as the bus stop was adjacent to the station.
