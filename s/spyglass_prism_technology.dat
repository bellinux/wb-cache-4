Methods: This study evaluated the right eyes of 115 cataract patients before intraocular lens (IOL) implantation through consecutive tests using 5 devices: VERION Reference Unit, Placido-based corneal topography (OPD-Scan III), monochromatic light-emitting diodes (LenStar LS 900 and AL-Scan), and rotary <b>prism</b> <b>technology</b> (auto kerato-refractometer KR- 8800). Analyzed parameters were corneal steep and flat keratometric values (Ks and Kf) and corneal astigmatism and axis. These parameters were evaluated using the one-sample two-tailed t-test and the 95 % limits of agreement (95 % LOAs) between the devices. Results: The mean corneal cylinder value measurements were - 0. 97 ± 0. 63  D, - 0. 88 ± 0. 60  D, - 0. 90 ± 0. 69  D, - 0. 90 ± 0. 67  D, and - 0. 83 ± 0. 60  D with VERION, LenStar, AL-Scan (2. 4  mm), OPD III, and KR- 8800, respectively. Only KR- 8800 {{showed a significant}} difference from VERION in the corneal cylinder value (P< 0. 05). The mean differences in the Kf and Ks of VERION compared to those of OPD III were 0. 18 ± 0. 45  D and 0. 17 ± 0. 38  D (P< 0. 05), respectively. The 95 % LOAs of Bland–Altman analysis for the corneal astigmatism axis of the VERION with LenStar, AL-Scan (2. 4  mm), OPD III, and KR- 8800 were - 26. 25 ° to 58. 71 °, - 20. 61 ° to 47. 44 °, - 25. 03 ° to 58. 98 °, and - 27. 85 ° to 65. 17 °, respectively. Conclusion: None of the VERION parameters were significantly {{different from those of}} AL-Scan and LenStar. AL-Scan (2. 4  mm zone) was especially similar to VERION. Wide LOAs are potential contributors to axis error in patients with toric IOL implants.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{advancing the}} {{knowledge about the}} role of the labour market in the process of the technology-induced economic transformation, taking into account the variety of factors involved at micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of the economy and at different geographical scales. Empirically, the dissertation investigates the co-evolutionary dynamics of industrial restructuring and worker reallocation across and within regional labour markets induced by the diffusion of the information technology as a general purpose technology (GPT) in Sweden in the period between 1985 and 2010. The analytical framework employed in the dissertation combines the theoretical perspectives on the long-term economic development with the insights from the labour market studies on the dual role of the labour market in the process of technology-induced structural change. These two strands of research are integrated into the evolutionary model of economic change that links explicitly the microlevel processes of response to GPT-induced transformation pressures to the macro-level determinants and outcomes of these processes. The findings of this dissertation indicate that the dynamics of technological change as well as its implications for functioning of regional labour markets should be approached through the <b>prism</b> of <b>technology</b> diffusion process which unfolds in time and space. To be able to understand the technology diffusion process one should address four intertwined questions: what kind of technology is diffused, how it is diffused, when it is diffused as well as where it is diffused at different points in time. Also, the dissertation suggests that the role of the labour market in the technology-induced transformation is far from the smoothly operating mechanism of adjustment to economy-wide economic shocks, as it is often assumed in mainstream approaches to economic theorising. In that respect, the dissertation provides a reference point for studies of labour market evolution beyond the standard equilibrium approach...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{systematic}} visual distortions using virtual reality <b>technologies,</b> <b>prisms</b> or mirrors, may have therapeutic effects for patients suffering from stroke or body image identity disorders. However, there are few studies which directly investigate neural activity changes during visual feedback manipulation. In the present study we created an experimental setup for investigating the effects of systematic virtual reality-mediated visual feedback manipulation of finger movements on cortical activity. We performed tests with two healthy female subjects who performed a line-tracking task under four conditions manipulating visual feedback of their own hand. To investigate hemodynamic responses in motor areas during the line tracking task we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We predicted that viewing larger or smaller virtual movements of fingers, compared to the real movements, would affect activity in motor areas and thus the hemodynamic response. Our preliminary results showed changes in the hemodynamic responses between stimulation period and baseline. There were indications of possible differences between conditions, and also of adaptation effects within conditions. However these effects were not significant in our preliminary data and we therefore need to collect additional data to draw further conclusions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a proposal to}} bring ethics and ICT closer to students of the first courses of the primary education, supporting one in each other, following the Law “Real Decreto 126 / 2014, 28 th of February”, which establishes the basic curriculum for Primary Education. Within this Law, two of seven skills in the curriculum are established: digital skill (the third) and also social and civic skills (the fifth). Given the digital natives population who are receiving education, {{it would be a}} slightly more ambitious goal to be able to glimpse them to support one in another. In this area, for example, we find a specific subject such as “Social and Civic values” with evaluation criteria such as “Employ new technologies by developing social and civic values in safe environments”. Thanks to this gateway, we can introduce small door to the vision of computer science, through ethics, which may be transversal with all subjects of the curriculum. The suggestion of the present article is to confront teachers with a vision of technology from an outside perspective, from an ethical <b>prism,</b> once the <b>technology</b> is turned it off and the mobiles or tablets screens are converted into a mere black mirror...|$|R
40|$|This Technical Quarterly Report {{is for the}} {{reporting}} period March 31, 2002 to June 30, 2002. The report provides details of the work done on the project entitled ''Enhanced Oil Recovery with Downhole Vibration Stimulation in Osage County Oklahoma''. The project is divided into nine separate tasks. Several of the tasks are being worked on simultaneously, while other tasks are dependent on earlier tasks being completed. The vibration stimulation Well 111 -W- 27 is located in section 8 T 26 N R 6 E of the North Burbank Unit (NBU), Osage County Oklahoma. It was drilled to 3090 -feet cored, logged, cased and cemented. The rig moved off August 6, 2001. Phillips Petroleum Co. has performed several core studies on the cores recovered from the test well. Standard porosity, permeability and saturation measurements have been conducted. In addition Phillips has prepared a Core Petrology Report, detailing the lithology, stratigraphy and sedimentology for Well 111 -W 27, NBU. Phillips has also conducted the sonic stimulation core tests, the final sonic stimulation report {{has not yet been}} released. Calumet Oil Company, the operator of the NBU, began collecting both production and injection wells information to establish a baseline for the project in the pilot field test area since May 2001. The original 7 -inch Downhole Vibration Tool (DHVT) has been thoroughly tested and it has been concluded that it needs to be redesigned. An engineering firm from Fayetteville AR has been retained to assist in developing a new design for the DHVT. The project participants requested from the DOE, a no-cost extension for the project through December 31, 2002. The no-cost extension amendment to the contract was signed during this reporting period. A technical paper SPE 75254 ''Enhanced Oil Recovery with Downhole Vibration Stimulation, Osage County, Oklahoma'' was presented at the 2002 SPE/DOE Thirteenth Symposium on Improved Oil Recovery, in Tulsa OK, April 17, 2002.

40|$|Hagerstrand's minimalist {{representation}} of individual lives and opportunities as lifelines and <b>prisms</b> predates the <b>technologies</b> available to current GIScience but resonates with many emerging spatio-temporal data model describing human activity {{in space and}} time. It also offer strong synergies with the various approaches that use data sets representing the tracks of individuals in order to explore patterns in their movements and associated activities. Almost inevitably such tracking data sets utilise (x,y,t) and activity data (representing lifelines) which are sampled over time and space and are eventually embedded for analysis within a digital geospatial environment. There are clear issues of error in both the data defining the environment used for analysis and that defining the movement as sampled (x,y,t) points, and consequently specific properties of the interaction emerge which would {{be of interest to}} us. While the lifeline is {{one of a number of}} attempts to represent human (or any object's) presence in space-time the concept of the prism focuses more on interpolating where an object could be, or might be, when it is between two known points. This idea of prism is a derivative spatio-temporal construct which has a further dimension of vagueness and uncertainty attached to it. Such properties require both identification and representation. This paper explores two issues. The first is the nature of uncertainty and error in an actual or interpolated lifeline data models related to typical kinds of analysis of movement and activity within a digital {{representation of}} its embedding geography. The second examines the nature of any prism of opportunity that is inferred from partial lifeline data and then deployed in accessibility studies. Specifically it discusses how issues of spatio-temporal uncertainty in the derivation o...|$|R
40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Volume 1 is available on open access and Volume 2 is closed access for copyright reasons. Richard Hamilton was born on the 24 th February 1922, throughout his adult life {{he has been an}} artist, who has taught, who has made exhibitions, who has sought to engage with the most up to date technology, who has studied the theories and works of Marcel Duchamp and most importantly has accurately reflected the world in which he has lived. Hamilton has been broadly categorised throughout his career by two images, the small poster he designed for the This is Tomorrow exhibition and the spectre of Marcel Duchamp as the epitome of the avant-garde artist. The first secured the myth that Hamilton is the 'founding father' of Pop Art and the second that Hamilton would provide, for many, a gateway to an understanding of Duchamp. There is much more to this old style artist than these clichéd readings as I will show in the narrative of my thesis. I have chosen to discuss Hamilton in relation to four specific areas of his practice which, I believe, he has decided to focus on in order to highlight a narrowing gap between ‘fine art‘ and ‘craft‘. They are technology, book making, exhibitions and the reproducible image. The direct referencing of much of art‘s history is another aspect of his concern for the integrity of his oeuvres while he also maintains a subtle palindromic stance to wordplay, humour and politics. I will also demonstrate that the multi-elusive nature of his work is most obviously illustrated when the subject matter is mediated through a number of media producing a multitude of multifaceted images. He has been claimed by various strands of art throughout his career, modernism, post-modernism, Pop Art and neo-Dada but he is a purveyor of images that concern the modern. The modern being of today, this time and place, which he reflects back at society through a <b>prism</b> of contemporary <b>technology,</b> contemporary thinking and contemporary culture. Even when the images relate to the history of art they are purveyed using the most modern of techniques and media to create a contemporary reinterpretation of timeless imagery...|$|R
