5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and <b>steenbok</b> are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{hypotheses}} regarding the evolutionary origin {{and maintenance of}} elongation in giraffe necks. The [...] "competing browsers hypothesis" [...] was originally suggested by Charles Darwin and challenged only recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, such as kudu, <b>steenbok</b> and impala, encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to [...] high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about [...] high. There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy. However, scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels {{beyond the reach of}} other browsers, ...|$|E
500|$|The cheetah is a {{carnivore}} that prefers medium-sized prey with a {{body mass}} ranging from [...] Blesbok, duiker, Grant's gazelle, impala, reedbuck, springbok, and Thomson's gazelle {{are some of the}} common targets of the cheetah. Other prey animals include the bat-eared fox, bushbuck, kudu, hartebeest, nyala, oribi, roan antelope, <b>steenbok,</b> sable antelope, and waterbuck; they prey less frequently on African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, ostrich, warthog, wildebeest, and zebra. A study showed that a major proportion of the diet of Asiatic cheetahs consists of livestock; local species such as chinkara, desert hare, goitered gazelle, ibex, rodents, and wild sheep are also hunted. Generally, only groups of cheetahs will attempt to kill large animals such as hartebeest, although mothers with young cubs will attempt to secure a large prey all by themselves. There are no records of cheetah killing human beings. The diet of a cheetah depends on the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle, somewhat smaller than the cheetah. In contrast, in Kwa-Zulu Natal the preferred prey is the significantly larger nyala, males of which can weigh up to [...] They do, however, opt for young and adolescent targets, which make up about 50% of the cheetah diet despite constituting {{only a small portion of}} the prey population.|$|E

50|$|Carnivores are {{exceptionally}} important prey for martial eagles. Among {{these many}} mongoose {{tend to be}} well represented in their diet. Most mongoose native to savanna tend to be highly social burrowers. Most {{of these types of}} mongoose are also relatively small (probably the second smallest important martial eagle food source after korhaans) and can effectively escape quickly to the safety of their underground home, so the lighter, more nimble male martial eagle is more likely to habitually pursue them. In southern Africa, the 0.72 kg meerkat (Suricata suricatta) comprises up to at least 9.6% of prey remains (as in the Cape Province) and the 0.75 kg Cape grey mongoose (Galerella pulverulenta) comprising an average of 7.2% of prey remains in the Cape area. The largest of the social savanna-dwelling mongoose is the banded mongoose at 2.12 kg. Despite often being successful in capturing banded mongoose, in one case when a (presumably inexperienced) immature martial eagle took one to a tree, the dominant male banded mongoose of the group scaled the tree and pulled away from the eagle the still-living mongoose prey to safety. The martial eagle is a known predator of the full size range of mongoose species, from the smallest species, the 0.27 kg common dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula), to the largest, the 3.38 kg white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda). Other moderate-sized carnivores known to fall prey to martial eagles include 0.83 kg striped polecat (Ictonyx striatus) and a few species of genet, which are about twice as heavy on average as the polecat. The martial eagle, however, can be a surprisingly effective predator of carnivorans close to their own size or larger. In the Cape Province, 72 bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), which average about 4.1 kg, were found in the prey remains, 85% of which were adults. Other foxes have also been hunted, as well as both black-backed (Canis mesomelas) and golden jackals (Canis aureus). Some of the black-backed jackals that martial eagles have captured and flown off with have included “half-grown” individuals and a rare adult, averaging some 8.9 kg, may also be killed but is usually grounded prey. Despite being marginally the smallest of the 3 jackals, the black-backed is the most aggressive and predatory species, so are probably taken only in surprise blitzes. Adult domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) of up to a modest size may occasionally be killed by martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to opportunistically grab pups of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) as they emerge from their dens. A similarly impressive range of felids have been included in their prey spectrum. Adults of both domestic cats and their ancestors, the 4.65 kg African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), are known to fall prey to this species. Arguably their most impressive mammalian carnivore prey though are adults of much larger cat species such as the 10.1 kg serval (Leptailurus serval) and even the 12.7 kg caracal (Caracal caracal). Apparent predatory attacks are even attempted on big cat cubs as they are considered potential predators of lion and leopard (Panthera pardus) cubs and confirmed predators of cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs. Evidence shows, however, they rapidly abandon hunting attempts if the formidable mother lion or leopard are present. Successful predatory attacks on other relatively large carnivores have included adults of the 12.4 kg African civet (Civettictis civetta) and the 8.16 kg aardwolf (Proteles cristata).While large accipitrids from around the world are credited with attacks on (almost always young) ungulates, perhaps no other species is as accomplished in this regard as this martial eagle. Over 30 species of ungulate have been identified as prey for this species, more species than are attributed to the perhaps more powerful crowned eagles and all the world’s golden eagles, although in all 3 seldom more than 30% of the diet are comprised by ungulates in a given region. In Kruger National Park, the martial eagle is mentioned as the only bird considered as a major predator of ungulate species. A majority of the ungulate diet of martial eagles are comprised by small antelope species or the young of larger antelopes. Locally favored prey are the dik-diks, one of the smallest kind of antelope, and every known species may be vulnerable to this eagle. In Tsavo East National Park, Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) were the second most numerous prey species and it was estimated that at least 86 dik-diks are taken in the park {{over the course of the}} year by two pairs of martial eagles. At an average of 5 kg, these can provide a very fulfilling meal for an eagle family. Adults of other smaller antelope such as 4.95 kg suni (Neotragus moschatus) and 4.93 kg blue duikers (Philantomba monticola) are probably also taken with relative ease. In general, the young of other antelope are usually attacked, including newborns. Occasional ambush attacks or successful predations are reported on adults of much larger species despite young ones being rather more vulnerable, including 12.1 kg klipspringers (Oreotragus oreotragus), 11.1 kg <b>steenboks</b> (Raphicerus campestris), both species of grysbok (7.6 to 10.6 kg on average), 14.6 kg oribis (Ourebia ourebi) and perhaps up to half a dozen larger duikers, potentially weighing from 7.7 to 25 kg. One duiker dispatched via strangulation weighed an estimated 37 kg, the largest known raptorial kill for any species on the African continent. Among extant birds of prey, only wedge-tailed eagles, reportedly capable of killing sheep and female red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) weighing up to 50 kg, and golden eagles, credited with taking adult female deer of several species with weights estimated at 50 to 70 kg and capable of apparently dispatching domestic calves weighing up to 114 kg, have larger kills attributed to them. Calves, including neonatal young, of the following antelope may also be included in their prey spectrum: impala (Aepyceros melampus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus), common tsessebe (Damaliscus lunatus), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), Eudorcas gazelles, gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus), kob (Kobus kob) and mountain reedbuck (Redunca arundinum). These species can vary in weight from 2.6 kg (i.e. gazelles) to 11 kg (i.e. tsessebe) in newborns. For the newborn impala, weighing already 5.55 kg, the martial eagle is the only bird considered to be a significant predator. Additionally, piglets of warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) (of which only the martial eagle among accipitrids is similarly mentioned as a significant predator) and bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are taken.|$|R
