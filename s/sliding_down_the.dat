5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

25|$|The train's {{speed at}} the time of {{derailment}} was an estimated 65–70km/h. The F 1200 locomotive was the first to derail, <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> embankment until it came to rest on its right side on the road below. The cars between the locomotive and the dining car were completely destroyed while the dining car partially slid down the embankment towards the road, ending up at a 45° angle on the slope between the embankment and the road. The last two cars remained standing on the tracks.|$|E
25|$|Historic Jordan House in West Des Moines is {{a stately}} Victorian home built in 1850 {{and added to}} in 1870 by the first white settler in West Des Moines, James C. Jordan. Completely refurbished, this mansion was once part of the Underground Railroad and today houses 16 period rooms, a {{railroad}} museum, West Des Moines community history, and a museum dedicated to the Underground Railroad in Iowa. In 1893 Jordan's daughter Eda was <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> banister when she fell off and broke her neck. She died two days later, and her ghost is reputed to haunt the house.|$|E

25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E
25|$|The Nelson didn't operate {{during the}} winter months and {{supplies}} had to be brought in by packhorse, driving up food prices and making such luxuries as liquor hard to come by. To solve the problems caused by this isolation, the community decided to build its own sternwheeler, one that could run all year round, connecting with Bonners Ferry. That sternwheeler was the City of Ainsworth, launched on May 4, 1892. The ill-fated boat had an unlucky launch, <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ways stern first and flipping over onto her starboard side. She was soon righted by the steamer Galena and went on her maiden voyage without further incident.|$|E
25|$|The {{late night}} scenes caused {{issues with the}} cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> roof, though she {{continued}} filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold that he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days.|$|E

25|$|Today {{tourists}} {{enter the}} Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, a tunnel purportedly created around AD 820 by Caliph al-Ma'mun's workmen using a battering ram. The tunnel is cut {{straight through the}} masonry of the pyramid for approximately , then turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage. It is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in {{the ceiling of the}} Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it was the noise of that stone falling and then <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Descending Passage, which alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these stones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is usually forbidden.|$|E
25|$|In France, Avant que l'ombre... {{became the}} singer's fifth number-one album, debuting atop the French Albums Chart with nearly 150,000 (Gold) units {{sold in the}} first week. Although Farmer did not promote the album, it {{remained}} at number one for three non-consecutive weeks, alternating with Grégory Lemarchal's album, Je deviens moi. Avant que l'ombre... logged {{in more than two}} months in the top ten, and 23 consecutive weeks in the top 50 before <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> chart later in autumn, which partially resulted from the six-month difference between the release of the second and the third singles. It re-entered in the top 20 in January after an intense advertising campaign, an interview on TF1 and the concerts at Bercy. The album ultimately logged a total of 77 weeks on the album chart. In spite of a good chart trajectory, the album did not reach the sales of Farmer's previous studio albums, which were all million plus sellers in France. The album was certified Platinum, then Double platinum on 6 July 2006. It was the eighth best-selling album of 2005 in France.|$|E

500|$|Hogg and {{her younger}} {{brothers}} were rambunctious. She recalled that they particularly enjoyed <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> banisters in the Governor's Mansion. Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which Jim Hogg nailed tacks along {{the center of the}} railing to curb the activity through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible in the banister for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home. Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she [...] "never had the patience to succeed". Her mother also encouraged Hogg to learn German. Hogg and her siblings were frequently taken to the Millet Opera House in Austin to enjoy the performances.|$|E
500|$|Hard Boiled took 123 days to shoot. Although Woo {{told his}} cast {{that the film}} would be more gritty and not as stylish as his {{previous}} films, Hard Boiled became more stylish as the filming began. The tea house sequence in the film was shot before the script was written. The crew found that the tea house {{was going to be}} torn down and decided to film a scene there. Woo saw the staircase in the tea house, and thought about a scene where a character would come shooting down gun smugglers while <b>sliding</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> banister. The tea house sequence was shot in around a week's time and was choreographed by Woo and Philip Kwok. It was shot with interruptions from many local triads in the area asking for protection money, and residents complaining about the noise.|$|E
