5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create <b>something</b> <b>wonderful,</b> and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked in}} a 2013 Time Out New York {{magazine}} interview whether he would act again if a suitable film project came his way, Wilder responded, [...] "I'm tired of watching the bombing, shooting, killing, swearing and 3-D.

500|$|Juster {{says the}} book was rescued from the {{remainders}} table when Emily Maxwell wrote a strong review of it in The New Yorker. Maxwell wrote, [...] "As Pilgrim's Progress {{is concerned with the}} awakening of the sluggardly spirit, The Phantom Tollbooth is concerned with the awakening of the lazy mind." [...] Hers was far from the only positive piece; children's author Ann McGovern reviewed it for The New York Times, writing [...] "Norton Juster's amazing fantasy has <b>something</b> <b>wonderful</b> for anyone old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of Alice in Wonderland and the pointed whimsy of The Wizard of Oz". John Crosby wrote for the New York Herald Tribune, [...] "In a world which sometimes seems to have gone mad, it is refreshing to pause and consider for a moment a book for children which contains a character called 'Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.' The name of the book is The Phantom Tollbooth and it was written by a bearded elf named Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, who is the cleverest of the young neurotics". Dissenting was the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, which in March 1962 deemed the book an [...] "intensive and extensive fantasy, heavily burdened with contrivance and whimsy".|$|E

2500|$|The first section, [...] "A Miracle", {{discusses}} the popular view of Mother Teresa {{and focuses on}} the 1969 BBC documentary <b>Something</b> <b>Wonderful</b> for God which {{brought her to the}} attention of the general public and served as the basis for the book of the same title by Malcolm Muggeridge. Hitchens says that Calcutta's reputation as a place of abject poverty, [...] "a hellhole", is not deserved, but nevertheless provides a sympathetic context for Mother Teresa's work there. He quotes from conversations between Muggeridge and Mother Teresa, providing his own commentary. He quotes Muggeridge's description of [...] "the technically unaccountable light" [...] the BBC team filmed in the interior of the Home of the Dying as [...] "the first authentic photographic miracle". Hitchens contrasts this with the cameraman's statement that what Muggeridge thought was a miracle was the result of them using the latest Kodak film.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her initial}} {{days in the}} industry, Asha always played second fiddle to her elder sister. Some say that Lata had once criticised Asha's {{relationship}} with O. P. Nayyar. This widened the rift between the two sisters and O P Nayyar also {{decided that he would}} never work with Lata. O.P. Nayyar had once revealed that [...] "Asha and Lata, staying in opposite flats at Bombay's Peddar Road, shared a maid. Said maid's responsibility was to come and tell the younger sister that Lata had just recorded <b>something</b> <b>wonderful</b> for Asha to lose her vocal poise. Such was her Lata phobia that it took me some months to convince Asha that she had a voice individualistic enough to evolve a singing style all of her own." [...] Asha once said that she has worked for years to create a voice and a style that was different from Lata, so that she could carve her own niche and not be banished to live in her sister's shadow.|$|E

6000|$|And {{what is this}} other, greater impulse?

It is the pure disinterested craving of the human male to make <b>something</b> <b>wonderful,</b> out of his own head and his own self, and his own soul's faith and delight, which starts everything going. This is the prime motivity. And the motivity of sex is subsidiary to this: often directly antagonistic.|$|E
