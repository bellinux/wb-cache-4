2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{elective}} surgical procedures in animals are those that render animals incapable of reproducing. [...] Neutering in animals describes spaying or castration (also please see castration). [...] To spay (medical term: ovariectomy or ovario-hysterectomy) is to completely remove the ovaries and often the uterus of a female animal. [...] In a dog, this is accomplished through a ventral midline incision into the abdomen. In a cat, this is accomplished either by a ventral midline abdominal incision, or by a flank incision (more common in the UK). With an ovariectomy ligatures are placed on the blood vessels above and below the ovary and the organ is removed. With an ovariohysterectomy, the ligaments of the uterus and ovaries are broken down and the blood vessels are ligated and both organs are removed. [...] The body wall, subcutis, and skin are sutured. [...] To castrate (medical term: orchiectomy) is to remove the testicles of a male animal.

RESULTS: Histological features of the samples showed that PVDF and plain catgut <b>suture</b> <b>materials</b> produced more fibrous tissue (favorable response) on the fourth day in comparison with silk suture (P= 0. 02).
