Even though potential applications of cone arrays as electron emitters and other devices are very promising, understanding of their structure and formation mechanisms is still very limited compared to nanotubes and other carbon structures. Moreover, the cones have only been synthesized in a mixture with other shapes, but never as continuous arrays. It appears, however, that {{we can learn from}} nature how to produce large carbon cone arrays. We here report the first-known natural occurrence of large arrays of conical graphite crystals. These occur on the surfaces of millimeter-sized polycrystalline <b>spheroidal</b> aggregates of <b>graphite.</b> Cone heights range from less then a micron to 40 µm, which are larger than any other carbon cones reported in literature. They are also observed to dominate sample surfaces. Surface topography of the cones and petrologic relations of the samples suggest that the cones formed from a metamorphic fluid.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of {{formation of a}} metastable defect isomer of fullerene C 60 due to the Stone-Wales transformation are theoretically studied. It is demonstrated that the paths of the ”dynamic ” Stone-Wales transformation at a high (sufficient for overcoming potential barriers) temperature can differ from the two ”adiabatic ” transformation paths discussed in the literature. This behavior {{is due to the}} presence of a great near-flat segment of the potential-energy surface in the neighborhood of metastable states. Besides, the sequence of rupture and formation of interatomic bonds is other than {{that in the case of}} the adiabatic transformation. 1 Various models of fullerene growth have been proposed [1]. Because a sphere-shaped cluster C 60 is formed at a high temperature under actual operating conditions, its structure can be significantly different from the structure of ideal buckminsterfullerene with Ih icosahedral symmetry. On the ”surface ” of buckminsterfullerene, carbon atoms are arranged at the vertexes of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons, which are isolated from each other.

Two groups of parent alloys were prepared using high purity materials, i. e., Group 1 containing the spheroidizing element of Ce, Mg or Ca, while in Group 2, S was added as an anti-spheroidizing element. For discussing {{the influence of the}} cooling rate on the graphite morphology, 0. 5 g of the Group 1 samples were melted and held for 15 minutes at 1673 K in an Ar atmosphere, then cooled at 1000 K/min or 20 K/min. The results showed that perfect <b>spheroidal</b> <b>graphite</b> could not be confirmed, while irregular graphite appeared. The atmosphere was changed to Ar+ 3 %H 2 for preventing the oxidation, and the holding time was reduced to 10 minutes to prevent fading of the spheroidizing element.

Nevertheless, at the cooling rate of 20 K/min, graphite morphology was only chunky or flake in both groups.
