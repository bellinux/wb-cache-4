The Linux Version for example does not include Bluetooth and has a lower resolution <b>screen.</b> <b>Press</b> accounts suggest that there may be significant heat and speed issues compared with other netbooks. Other criticisms focus on Gigabyte's choice to ship one variant with Windows Vista Home Basic, which lacks official Tablet PC support.|$|E
50|$|The game {{takes place}} on a single non-scrolling screen. The screen shows the top down view of a grid of 143 (13 x 11) squares.

This bomb will pulse {{for a few seconds}} (allowing the player time to run away) and then explode, shooting flames horizontally and vertically. The game revolves around the idea of using these bomb blasts to destroy walls and enemies.|$|R

30|$|The {{recognised}} {{method of}} measuring angles around the knee is {{to measure the}} axis of the femur between {{the centre of the}} greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur, and the axis of the tibia between the lateral femoral epicondyle and the centre of the lateral malleolus (Jones et al., 2014). This method was used for all techniques of goniometry. At each angle, measurements were first estimated visually (VE), then measured using a short arm goniometer (SG), followed by a long arm goniometer(LG). An iPhone 7 Plus (Apple Inc., Cupertino, California) running Goniometer Pro application (5 FUF 5 CO) on iOS 10.2. 1 was used for the smartphone reading (SP). This device uses the internal inclinometer in the smartphone, registers an angle at one <b>screen</b> <b>press</b> and on movement of the phone orientation (axis of this is adjustable) measures {{the difference between the two}} angles. The final measurement was taken with the Halo Digital Goniometer (Halo Medical Devices, Sydney, Australia). Each device measures to the nearest whole degree.|$|E
40|$|To {{switch between}} call {{appearances}} and features, use the Features button or Phone button {{in the upper}} right of the Phone screen to switch between call appearances and features. Touch Features {{to move from the}} Phone screen to the Features list, or touch Phone to move from the Features list to the Phone screen. When a list item has a “Details ” button (a blue right-facing arrow), touching it shows more information about the item. For example, touching the arrow to the right of a contact name produces a detail screen showing all the numbers on file for that person. You act on objects such as a line or softkey by touching them or by touching the on-screen softkey labels. Softkey labels change according to the context. For example, touch a contact to place a call to that person, touch a line on the Phone screen to answer an incoming call, to go off hook to place a call, or to resume a call on hold.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a novel method for accelerated wear of squeegees used in screen printing and describes {{the development of}} mechanical tests which allow more in-depth measurement of squeegee properties. In this study, squeegees were abraded on the <b>screen</b> <b>press</b> {{so that they could}} be used for subsequent print tests to evaluate the effect of wear on the printed product. Squeegee wear was found to vary between different squeegee types and caused increases in ink transfer and wider printed features. In production this will lead to greater ink consumption, cost per unit and a likelihood of product failure. This also has consequences for the production of functional layers, etc., used in the construction of printed electronics. While more wear generally gave greater increases in ink deposition, the effect of wear differed, depending on the squeegee. There was a correlation between the angle of the squeegee wear and ink film thickness from a worn squeegee. An ability to resist flexing gave a high wear angle and presented a sharper edge at the squeegee/screen interface thus mitigating the effect of wear. There was also a good correlation between resistance to flexing and ink film thickness for unworn squeegees, which was more effective than a comparison based on Shore A hardness. Squeegee indentation at different force levels gave more information than a standard Shore A hardness test and the apparatus used was able to reliably measure reductions in surface hardness due to solvent absorption. Increases in ink deposition gave lower resistance in printed silver lines; however, the correlation between the amount of ink deposited and the resistance, remained the same for all levels of wear, suggesting that the wear regime designed for this study did not induce detrimental print defects such as line breakages...|$|E
