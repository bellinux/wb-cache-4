50|$|The FIB is also {{commonly}} used to prepare samples for the transmission electron microscope. The TEM requires very thin samples, typically ~100 nanometers.

The effects of three commercially available whole-blood sample preparation kits on the detection of CMV PCR products by a semiquantitative adaptation of the Digene SHARP Signal System Assay (DSSSA) in samples from volunteer blood donors was assessed. Of 101 samples from seropositive blood donors, CMV was detected in 0 (0 %) of the <b>samples</b> <b>extracted</b> with a QIAamp blood kit (QIAGEN), 1 (1 %) of the <b>samples</b> <b>extracted</b> with an Amplicor whole-blood specimen preparation kit (Roche), and 8 (8 %) of the <b>samples</b> <b>extracted</b> with an Isoquick nucleic acid extraction kit (modified {{by the addition of}} carrier tRNA) (Microprobe).

Nested PCR of selected samples confirmed the detection of CMV in the sane eight <b>samples</b> <b>extracted</b> with the modified Isoquick nucleic acid extraction kit and detected an additional nine CMV-positive samples (n = 50).

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the effects of plant extract, nicotine and caffeine on the activities of the liver metabolizing-enzyme induced by pentobarbitone. Materials and Method: Seven groups of mice were pretreated with high doses of sample extracts (0. 4 mg/g body weight <b>sample</b> <b>extract,</b> but nicotine at 0. 1 mg/g body weight) and one control group was pretreated with saline. On day 5, pentobarbitone (0. 005 ml of 8 mg/ml) was administered and the sleeping time was determined. The test was repeated but at low doses (0. 1 mg/g body weight <b>sample</b> <b>extract,</b> but nicotine at 0. 05 mg/g body weight). Results: At high doses, bitter gourd, 'tempeh', nicotine, caffeine, nicotine+bitter gourd, nicotine+'tempeh' and nicotine+caffeine induced the activities of liver metabolizing enzyme significantly compared to control. At low doses, bitter gourd, nicotine, caffeine, nicotine+bitter gourd, nicotine+'tempeh' and nicotine+caffeine induced the enzyme but 'tempeh' did not. Conclusion: The findings suggest that bitter gourd, nicotine and caffeine act as enzyme inducers, but 'tempeh' only demonstrate this ability at high dose.

40|$|Given the {{extensive}} presence of some toxic {{quaternary ammonium compound}} residues in foodstuffs arriving into the EU during 2012, the Food Authority Control of Geneva decided to implement a monitoring plan to investigate {{the presence of these}} contaminants in food: a method based on quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction and liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed for analyzing didecyldimethylammonium chloride and four benzalkonium chloride homologue residues in fruits and vegetables. An in-house method validation, based on the SANCO guidelines (Document SANCO No. 12571 / 2013), was conducted using three independent series in orange, lettuce, and avocado composite samples spiked at three levels (10, 100, 500 μg/kg). Trueness and precision were calculated by pooling all results at each concentration level to account for the variability among fruits and vegetables. To avoidmatrix effects on quantitative results, five quantification strategies were investigated: (i) solvent calibration, (ii) matrix-matched calibration prepared on samples and (iii) on <b>sample</b> <b>extract</b> aliquots, and (iv) standard addition prepared on samples and (v) on <b>sample</b> <b>extract</b> aliquots. Due to the nonlinear instrumental response for the large concentration range investigated, a quadratic calibration model was mandatory for all approaches. Solvent calibration gave very poor recoveries due to the high signal suppression caused by matrix effects. Smaller biases were observed for matrix-matched calibrations; however, these results exhibited relatively low precision. Both of the standard addition methods compensated for matrix effects and provided accurate analytical results. Due to the ease of its implementation, the matrix standard addition method, where analytes are added to <b>sample</b> <b>extract</b> aliquots, was preferred over the classical standard addition in samples. Nonlinear extrapolations appeared to be particularly effective in obtaining good results for both standard addition methods when the calibration curve was convex or very slightly concave.
