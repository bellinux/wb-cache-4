According to literature and interviews, insecurities such as increased risk of theft, loss and damage [25], privacy concerns [2] and vulnerability to criminal activity [25] form major barriers.

In order to respond to these insecurities and reassure users, a number of mechanisms can be introduced: rigorous selection process, feedback system, personal web pages or spaces, secure messaging system, <b>secure</b> <b>online</b> <b>payment</b> system and insurance [23].

40|$|The Internet {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the world’s largest mall. Consumers can shop at stores from around the globe simply by pointing and clicking on their computers. About half of all adults in the United States have made a purchase online. That’s at least 75 percent of Americans with web access. These cybershoppers spent $ 44. 8 billion online in 2000 — 148 percent more than they spent the previous year. Worldwide, online shopping is considerably greater since the United States contributes only about a third of all Internet users. 1 And cybershopping is expected to continue to grow as more households become connected to the Internet and as improvements in mobile telecommunication technology allow wireless Internet access anywhere and anytime. A byproduct of the dramatic increase in online shopping has been a heightened demand for convenient and <b>secure</b> <b>online</b> <b>payment</b> methods. If consumers had access to a Star Trek-like transporter, paying for goods and services in cyberspace would be easy. The transporter could convert their dollar bills to energy and send them through space to the appropriate e-tailer, where the bills would rematerialize upon arrival.

40|$|This {{research}} {{developed and}} evaluated the different aspects such as security, feasibility, etc. of an online domain registration {{system and a}} payment gateway for the Sri Lanka Domain Registry as a pilot project in establishing a secure e-commerce infrastructure in Sri Lanka. In doing so, {{it was able to}} formalize and stream line the procedures and guidelines of registering domains and eliminate the delays that were earlier involved in registering domains at the registry. The Internet today has become a place for people to do their day to day purchases {{as well as for the}} sale of products to a global market. The security of the information that is being exchanged in such transactions is vital. If the correct methodologies are not used, it could lead to losses to the consumers as well as heavy losses to vendors that could include damage to long built reputation. Although the Internet usage in Sri Lanka has risen dramatically since its introduction in 1995, local institutions have still not fully exploited its potential for reaching a global market, the main factor for this is the unavailability of a good <b>secure</b> <b>online</b> <b>payment</b> infrastructure in Sri Lanka. Currency regulations restrict people from using the facilities offered by such infrastructure in other countries. Many of the financial institutions in Sri Lanka are reluctant to offer such facilities because of the fear of fraudulent transactions raised by the myth that submitting sensitive information such as credit card numbers on the Internet is very insecure. As a results of the research a web based registration system was developed and implemented to handle the domain registration process and a set of guidelines were also developed to assist in the acceptance of domain names. The security of the domain registry's servers was also scrutinized to enable smooth operations of the registry. Recommendations on selecting a suitable online payment system were also made by evaluating the implementation of different mechanisms...|$|E

This paper reports research that identifies and explores key issues to enhance the diffusion of online retailing in Saudi Arabia. Despite the fact that Saudi Arabia has the largest and fastest growth of ICT marketplaces in the Arab region, e-commerce activities are not progressing at the same speed. Only very few Saudi companies, mostly medium and large companies from the manufacturing sector, are involved in e-commerce implementation. Based on qualitative data collected by conducting interviews with 16 retailers and 16 potential customers in Saudi Arabia, 7 key drivers to online retailing diffusion in Saudi Arabia are identified. These key drivers are government support, providing trustworthy and <b>secure</b> <b>online</b> <b>payments</b> options, provision of individual house mailboxes, providing high speed Internet connection at low cost, providing educational programs, the success of bricks-and-clicks model, and competitive prices.

40|$|Abstract—Electronic {{payment is}} the very {{important}} step of the electronic business system, and its security must be ensured. SSL/TLS and SET are two widely discussed means of <b>securing</b> <b>online</b> credit card <b>payments.</b> Because of implementation issues, SET has not really been adopted by e-commerce participants, whereas, {{despite the fact that}} it does not address all security issues, SSL/TLS is commonly used for Internet e-commerce security. The three-domain (3 D) security schemes, including 3 -D Secure and 3 D SET have recently been proposed as ways of improving ecommerce transaction security. Based on our research about SSL, SET, 3 D security schemes and the requirements of electronic payment, we designed a secure and efficient E-Payment protocol. The new protocol offers an extra layer of protection for cardholders and merchants. Customers are asked to enter an additional password after checkout completion to verify they are truly the cardholder; the authentication is done directly between the cardholder and card issuer using the issuer security certificate and without involving the third party (Visa...|$|R
