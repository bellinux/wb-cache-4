50|$|A major {{beneficiary}} of the invention of synthetic dyes was a document reproduction technique known as <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicating.</b> Its earliest form was invented in 1874 by Eugenio de Zuccato, a young Italian studying law in London, who called his device the Papyrograph. Zuccato’s system involved writing {{on a sheet of}} varnished paper with caustic ink, which ate through the varnish and paper fibers, leaving holes where the writing had been. This sheet - which had now become a stencil - was placed on a blank sheet of paper, and ink rolled over it so that the ink oozed through the holes, creating a duplicate on the second sheet.|$|E
50|$|The journal was {{originally}} simply typed and printed by Sciences Nat {{on a small}} <b>stencil</b> <b>duplicating</b> machine which was rotated by hand with a crank. From 1974, it was produced by photocopying on a Rank Xerox machine. In 1977, a small Gestetner duplicator was obtained. During this time, pages were simply stapled together. From 1978 the typing was done on a Varityper which made it necessary to type the whole text twice. In 1979 a more advanced offset printer allowed colours printing for the first time. In 1980, 8 colour plates were produced which placed it {{at the head of}} entomological journals worldwide judged by quality of the illustrations. From 1984, the Bulletin was printed by a professional company. Each issue had from 8 (first issue) to 60 pages (double issue 75-76). Some errors also occurred: all pages of issue 80 are marked 79. Nearly all the articles were written in French, nearly all with figures, and (after 1980) most of them with colour photos.|$|E
5000|$|Political street art was {{not common}} in Egypt {{prior to the}} 2011 revolution, however it has proliferated in public spaces in the post-revolution era. Artwork {{targeting}} the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, in particular has surged in popularity since the revolution because, according to The Christian Science Monitor, such [...] "anti-military graffiti {{is a reflection of}} Egyptian activists’ frustration with the military rulers, who they say replaced one autocracy with another." [...] Keizer has noted that, although much of his work is political in nature, much of it is also ambiguous or apolitical. The artist has said that, [...] "The whole point is that it’s up to you to think and make up your own conclusions ... And {{a lot of people here}} aren’t used to making their own conclusions — they’re used to being told what to think." [...] Keizer has been described as an Arab nationalist, and much of his artwork targets capitalism and imperialism. Kaizer's hijacking of international corporations' logos represents a critique of consumerism though the visual and textual messages depicted, in addition to his choice of the easily <b>duplicated</b> <b>stencil</b> technique that can be interpreted as an additional subversion of the invasive advertising campaigns that these companies usually conduct.|$|R
