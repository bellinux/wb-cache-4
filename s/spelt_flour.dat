The selected chemical parameters (protein, starch, ash, glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, pH, lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, calcium, iron and zinc), gluten characteristics (wet and dry gluten, extensibility of gluten and swelling of gluten) and pasting properties (pasting temperature, peak viscosity, hot paste viscosity, peak viscosity temperature and breakdown value) of <b>flours</b> were analysed. <b>Spelt</b> wheat wholemeal fl our produced in ecological system of farming differed from other commercially produced wheat fl ours mainly in ash (1. 82 %), proteins (16. 5 %), wet gluten (43. 2 % in dry matter), minerals (Ca, Fe, Zn) and organic acids content.

40|$|Spelt (Triticum aestivum L. ssp. spelta) is {{experiencing}} a renais-sance in Europe and North America, where it is used for baking, brewing, production of pasta, and self-supplied animal feed. One {{of the characteristics of}} spelt is that in comparison to modern wheat it is more resistant to harsh climatic and poor soil conditions. In contrast to wheat the hulls remain on the grain after threshing. Drawbacks are that spelt yields are quite low compared to modern wheat. The subject of the current study was to gain information about the composition of soluble sugars and their concentrations in <b>spelt</b> wholemeal and <b>flour.</b> High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for analysis. Concentrations of nine free sugars in <b>spelt</b> wholemeal and <b>flour</b> are reported. Flour cumulative free sugar concentrations were 63 % lower than in wholemeal. For comparisons, we also analyzed wholemeal of wheat. The cumulative concentration of free sugars was 27 % lower than in spelt wholemeal. However, when published data for sugar concentration ranges of wheat are taken into account, the total concentration of free sugar was not different between spelt and modern wheats. Low concentrations of xylose and stachyose were detected in spelt. Higher concentrations of fructans such as 1 -kestose and kestotetraose were detected in spelt when compared with wheat.

5000|$|First used {{to grind}} flour as a grist mill, it also {{functioned as a}} saw mill and a fulling mill [...] One of the first owners was Andrew Miller. The mill began a major process of {{modernization}} when purchased by the Brandt family in 1909, {{a time of great}} advances in milling technology in the United States. During the 20th century, roller mills were designed to extract flour from wheat in a process that was more economical than the age-old grinding of grain between two stones. Today, wheat grains are run through two rollers of different sizes that operate at varying speeds. They are then pneumatically lifted and repeatedly sent through the rollers until fully processed. The resulting flour is sifted and bagged under the name of Daisy Organic Flour. During that century of ownership, the Brandt family converted the mill power from water power to electricity and from grist mill to roller mill. Bakeries favored the flour for pretzels and pie crusts as well as the cookies. Bakeries have always favored the mill’s original product - pastry flour - for pretzels and pie crusts as well as cookies. Only pastry flour was produced by the mill during the 18th, 19th centuries because local farmers were only able to grow the varieties of soft wheat that are best suited to the climate in this area of the northeast United States. In 2002 Annville Flouring Mill was purchased by McGeary Organics in order to support the commitment of local farmers to growing organic grains.With access to national transportation systems, McGeary has been able to introduce hard-wheat flours to the mill, adding Bread Flour [...] and All-Purpose Flour [...] to the product line of the Annville Mill. Annville Flouring Mill now produces premium Daisy Organic Flours from both regional and national growers of soft and hard wheat. <b>Spelt</b> <b>flour</b> [...] was the last type of flour added to the product line of the Annville Flouring Mill. <b>Spelt</b> <b>flour</b> was first produced in the Annville Mill in 2002 in response to the rising popularity of ancient grains in the organic food world today.|$|E

The effect of different doses of <b>spelt</b> <b>flour</b> on the properties of pasta dough, semifinished and finished products was studied. Short-cut macaroni products such as vermicelli were produced on a laboratory pasta press of the type AML- 2. Soft type of dough, in which the mass fraction of moisture of all samples was 32. 5 %, was adopted in the work due to the design of the laboratory pasta press. An increasing number of wet gluten, washed from pasta dough samples with the addition of flour from spelt due to further introduced protein was defined. The quality of all of the gluten samples was characterized as good and elastic. Increased hydration of gluten ability and reducing of the critical moisture values upon drying at introduction of 20 % <b>spelt</b> <b>flour</b> was found. The low temperature mode for convective drying of pasta semi-finished products with the proposed flour additive was recommended because of its high content of active enzymes that may cause browning of products during drying. Finished products had solid flat color with a touch of milk, without dark inclusions and traces of underkneading. Boiling properties of the samples of flour from spelt were characterized as good, all the samples retained their form at 100 %, the rate of dry matter loss during cooking was maintained within the regulatory documentation requirements.

To determine rheofermentation properties Rheofermentometer Rhea F 4 was used, by means of which the dough development, the production of fermentation gases, retention ability of dough and the activity of used baking yeast were analysed. The best ability to retain formed fermentation gas had wheat flour (control) and composite flour with the addition of <b>spelt</b> <b>flour.</b> The composite flour with addition of amaranth flour showed a retention coefficient compared to the control lower by 13 %, and the composite flour with addition of buckwheat flour showed a retention coefficient compared to the control reduced by 20 %.

The biggest loaf volume (200 cm 3) and the optimal vaulting (0. 65) were found in the control and a loaf made of composite flour with addition of spelt.
