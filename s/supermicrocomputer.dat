50|$|Today, {{there are}} fewer and fewer general {{business}} computing requirements that cannot be met with off-the-shelf commodity computers. It {{is likely that the}} low-end of the <b>supermicrocomputer</b> genre will continue to be pushed upward by increasingly powerful commodity microcomputers.|$|E
5000|$|The 3B2 was {{the first}} desktop <b>supermicrocomputer</b> (1983) with a 32-bit {{microprocessor}} and UNIX. The model 300 and 400 series were uniprocessors. The 3B2 became the official [...] "porting base" [...] for UNIX System V Release 3. Later versions {{were the first to}} introduce UNIX asymmetric multiprocessing (3B2/600 Falcon) and nearly symmetrical multiprocessing (3B2/1000 Galactica). The Falcon won the highly touted US Air Force Office Automation contract, initially estimated at $1.7 billion, and the largest single computer contract the Federal government had awarded at that time. It was also the first <b>supermicrocomputer</b> to use a first-level cache memory based on virtual addresses instead of physical addresses, which made it 80% faster than the original requirements called for.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, Pelletier founded Commodity Systems, Inc., {{also known}} as CSI Data. The {{corporate}} headquarters were soon established in Boca Raton, FL. CSI strived to provide clean end-of-day market data that was checked for errors. Pelletier said [...] "If you’re testing data, {{you want it to}} be correct when you initially receive it” Pelletier was one of the first users of the Mitel SX-50 phone switching system, which he used to feed data to his customers from four Texas Instruments 990 microcomputers and one Convergent Technologies <b>supermicrocomputer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Motorola's {{success with}} the 68000 led to the MC68010, which added virtual memory support. The MC68020, {{introduced}} in 1984 added full 32-bit data and address buses. The 68020 became hugely popular in the Unix <b>supermicrocomputer</b> market, and many small companies (e.g., Altos, Charles River Data Systems, Cromemco) produced desktop-size systems. The MC68030 was introduced next, improving upon the previous design by integrating the MMU into the chip. The continued success led to the MC68040, which included an FPU for better math performance. The 68050 failed to achieve its performance goals and was not released, and the follow-up MC68060 was released into a market saturated by much faster RISC designs. The 68k family faded from use in the early 1990s.|$|E
40|$|A {{low-cost}} stand-alone interactive {{image processing}} workstation {{has been developed}} for operations on multipolarization JPL aircraft SAR data, as well as data from future spaceborne imaging radars. A recently developed data compression technique is used to reduce the data volume to 10 Mbytes, for a typical data set, so that interactive analysis may be accomplished in a timely and efficient manner on a <b>supermicrocomputer.</b> In addition to presenting a hardware description of the work station, attention {{is given to the}} software that has been developed. Three illustrative examples of data analysis are presented...|$|E
40|$|The NASA Pilot Land Data System (PLDS) {{project is}} {{intended}} to enhance the effectiveness of data processing capabilities used by researchers applying remote sensing data in land science research. Two sites in the centerminous U. S. have been selected as study areas scanned by Landsat, Nimbus and GOES instruments. The data will be analyzed by teams of researchers representing different fields of expertise. The PLDS program will explore data management, networking and communications, system access capabilities, land analysis software, special processes and overall systems engineerng. The data will be processed by researchers working interactively through remote <b>supermicrocomputer</b> workstations {{using a variety of}} operating systems and on-site software capabilities...|$|E
40|$|The PEDITOR image {{processing}} system {{was created to}} be readily transferable from one type of computer system to another. While nearly identical in function and operation to its predecessor, EDITOR, PEDITOR employs additional techniques which greatly enhance its portability. These cover system structure and processing. In order to confirm the portability of the software system, {{two different types of}} computer systems running greatly differing operating systems were used as target machines. A DEC- 20 computer running the TOPS- 20 operating system and using a Pascal Compiler was utilized for initial code development. The remaining programmers used a Motorola Corporation 68000 -based Forward Technology FT- 3000 <b>supermicrocomputer</b> running the UNIX-based XENIX operating system and using the Silicon Valley Software Pascal compiler and the XENIX C compiler for their initial code development...|$|E
