25|$|In the morning, Dan waits, {{with flowers}} ready for Imogen {{in his hotel}} bar. But before she arrives, Nicola finds him, having {{correctly}} guessed where to find him. They <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> and although a reconciliation of sorts is achieved, it becomes clear {{there is no chance}} of a future together. Unfortunately, at this moment, Imogen enters and sees Dan sitting at a table, flowers resting there, talking to another woman. Imogen leaves distraught. Ambrose tells Dan she just left, but it is too late for Dan to catch up with her, and Dan knows no way of contacting her.|$|E
2500|$|Amongst Iranian Zoroastrians, {{for whom}} the {{seasonal}} festivals have a greater significance than for their Indian co-religionists, the Visperad ceremony has undergone significant modifications in the 20th century. The ritual – which is technically an [...] "inner" [...] one requiring ritual purity – is instead celebrated as an [...] "outer" [...] ritual where ritual purity is not a requirement. Often {{there is only one}} priest instead of the two that are actually required, and the priests <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> with only a lamp or candle representing the fire, so avoiding accusations of [...] "fire worship." ...|$|E

60|$|Alas, women lie! But not Clara Durrant. A {{flawless}} mind; {{a candid}} nature; a virgin chained {{to a rock}} (somewhere off Lowndes Square) eternally pouring out tea for old men in white waistcoats, blue-eyed, looking you straight in the face, playing Bach. Of all women, Jacob honoured her most. But to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> with bread and butter, with dowagers in velvet, and never say more to Clara Durrant than Benson said to the parrot when old Miss Perry poured out tea, was an insufferable outrage upon the liberties and decencies of human nature--or words to that effect. For Jacob said nothing. Only he glared at the fire. Fanny laid down Tom Jones.|$|E
60|$|My {{sense of}} {{loneliness}} is increased during this interlude by the better social {{success of the}} botanist. I find him presently falling into conversation with two women who are accustomed to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> near our own. They wear the loose, coloured robes of soft material that are the usual wear of common adult Utopian women; they are both dark and sallow, and they affect amber and crimson in their garments. Their faces strike me as a little unintelligent, {{and there is a}} faint touch of middle-aged coquetry in their bearing that I do not like. Yet on earth we should consider them women of exceptional refinement. But the botanist evidently sees in this direction scope for the feelings that have wilted a little under my inattention, and he begins that petty intercourse of a word, of a slight civility, of vague enquiries and comparisons that leads at last to associations and confidences. Such superficial confidences, that is to say, as he finds satisfactory.|$|E

60|$|Of course, Banker {{knew nothing}} of the {{destruction}} of his band, {{and the fact that he}} had not heard from them since he left them gave him not the slightest regret. But what did astonish him beyond bounds was to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> in the Black Cat, in Paris, and see before him, dressed like the valet of a Spanish grandee, a coal-black negro who had once been his especial and particular slave and drudge, a fellow whom he had kicked and beaten and sworn at, and whom he no doubt would have shot had he stayed much longer with his lawless companions, the Rackbirds. There was no mistaking this black man. He well remembered his face, and even the tones of his voice. He had never heard him sing, but he had heard him howl, and it seemed almost impossible that he should meet him in Paris. And yet, he was sure that the man who was bellowing and bawling to the delight of the guests of the Black Cat was one of the African wretches who had been entrapped and enslaved by the Rackbirds.|$|E
60|$|The tailors <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> not on one; {{and both}} {{they and the}} shoemakers work well and cheaply. The barbers have plenty to do, shaving heads and {{cleaning}} ears; for which latter operation {{they have a great}} array of little tweezers, picks, and brushes. In the outskirts of the town are scores of carpenters and blacksmiths. The former seem chiefly to make coffins and highly painted and decorated clothes-boxes. The latter are mostly gun-makers, and bore the barrels of guns by hand out of solid bars of iron. At this tedious operation they may be seen every day, and they manage to finish off a gun with a flintlock very handsomely. All about the streets are sellers of water, vegetables, fruit, soup, and agar-agar (a jelly made of seaweed), who have many cries as unintelligible as those of London. Others carry a portable cooking-apparatus on a pole balanced by a table at the other end, and serve up a meal of shellfish, rice, and vegetables for two or three halfpence--while coolies and boatmen waiting to be hired are everywhere to be met with.|$|E
60|$|And my father, {{though he}} would try, as it were by a side wind, to get a useful spurt of work out of me, either in the garden or in the hay-field, had {{constantly}} an eye to my scholastic improvement. From my very babyhood, before those first days at Harrow, I had to take my place alongside of him as he shaved at six o'clock in the morning, and say my early rules from the Latin Grammar, or repeat the Greek alphabet; and was obliged at these early lessons to hold my head inclined towards him, {{so that in the}} event of guilty fault, {{he might be able to}} pull my hair without stopping his razor or dropping his shaving-brush. No father was ever more anxious for the education of his children, though I think none ever knew less how to go about the work. Of amusement, as far as I can remember, he never recognised the need. He allowed himself no distraction, and did not seem to think it was necessary to a child. I cannot bethink me of aught that he ever did for my gratification; but for my welfare,--for the welfare of us all,--he was willing to make any sacrifice. At this time, in the farmhouse at Harrow Weald, he could not give his time to teach me, for every hour that he was not in the fields was devoted to his monks and nuns; but he would require me to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> with Lexicon and Gradus before me. As I look back on my resolute idleness and fixed determination to make no use whatever of the books thus thrust upon me, or of the hours, and as I bear in mind the consciousness of great energy in after-life, I am in doubt whether my nature is wholly altered, or whether his plan was wholly bad. In those days he never punished me, though I think I grieved him much by my idleness; but in passion he knew not what he did, and he has knocked me down with the great folio Bible which he always used. In the old house were the two first volumes of Cooper's novel, called The Prairie, a relic--probably a dishonest relic--of some subscription to Hookham's library. Other books of the kind there was none. I wonder how many dozen times I read those two first volumes.|$|E
