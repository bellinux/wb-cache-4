5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1â€“2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, <b>sandlances,</b> and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|R
50|$|While the {{chameleon}} eye {{is unique}} in lizards, parallels exist in {{other members of the}} animal kingdom. In particular, the <b>sandlance</b> fish (Limnichthyes fasciatus) shares key vision features with the chameleon. This is because the environmental circumstances such as the need for camouflaged quick prey capture that {{led to the development of}} the chameleon eye seem to have acted on the <b>sandlance</b> fish as well. Rapid predatory attacks are made possible through the chameleon and the sandlances' striated corneal muscles allowing for corneal accommodation, a reduced power lens, and increased corneal power. A nearly complete eyelid covering and lack of head movement due to nodal separation reduce conspicuousness to prey and predators.|$|E

Newborn silver surfperch co-occur with neonate redtail surfperch along Oregon beaches; however the silver surfperch are born smaller and up to two months earlier. Stranded-decaying kelp, seagrass, invasive marsh grass as well as plankton and bacteria contribute energy and nutrients to this beach ecosystem.|$|E

50|$|The pigeon {{guillemot}} forages by itself {{or in small}} groups, diving underwater for food, usually close to shore and during the breeding season within 1 km of the colony. It forages at depths from 6 to 45 m, but it prefers depths between 15 and 20 m. The dives can range from 10 to 144 seconds, and usually average 87 seconds, with an intermission between dives lasting around 98 seconds. Dives of two to ten seconds are typical when feeding on shoals of <b>sandlance</b> at the water's surface. Smaller prey are probably consumed underwater, but larger organisms are brought to the surface to eat after capture.|$|E
50|$|Yaquina Bay {{has been}} shown to be a site for {{spawning}} and development of many species. Pacific Herring and bay goby larvae are abundant, but other larval fishes such as sculpin, anchovy, smelt, clingfishes, cod, stickleback, pipefish, prickleback, gunnels, <b>sandlance,</b> rockfish, greenlings, lumpfish, and flounder are present in the estuary. Although there are larval fish present in the estuary, the Pacific herring was found to be the only commercial species that relies on the estuary for spawning and development. Yaquina Bay also provides a nursery environment for English sole. Multiple species of juvenile salmon, including chum, coho, and chinook, also pass through Yaquina Bay during their life cycle, often transitioning from shallower to deeper waters as they grow.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{species of}} Pacific <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes personatus) {{is found in}} fairly large number in the harbor. They feed on crustaceans, {{barnacle}} larve, copepods, and chaetognaths. They in turn are the food chain and form the feed source for marine mammals, birds and other species of fish. Seals are spotted, ringed, and bearded species; spotted is seen when the sea is calm (seals and seal oil form the staple diet {{of the people who}} live on the shores of the harbor in towns like Teller). Herring, whitefish, starry flounder, pike and tomcod are netted during spring, fall and midsummer. All five salmon species are found here of which red salmon is the primary catch and they migrate inland to the Salmon Lake to breed. Chum salmon migrate to the Pilgrim River and Agiapuk River. King salmon are rare.|$|E
5000|$|A sand lance or <b>sandlance</b> is a fish {{belonging}} to the family Ammodytidae. Several species of sand lances {{are commonly known as}} [...] "sand eels", though they are not related to true eels. Another variant name is launce, and all names of the fish are references to its slender body and pointed snout. The family name (and genus name, Ammodytes) means [...] "sand burrower", which describes the sand lance's habit of burrowing into sand to avoid tidal currents. Sand lances are most commonly encountered by fishermen in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, but are found in oceans throughout the world. These fish do not have pelvic fins and do not develop swim bladders, staying true to their bottom-dwelling habit as adults. Both adult and larval sea lances primarily feed on copepods. Larval forms of this fish are perhaps the most abundant of all fish larvae in areas such as the northwest Atlantic, serving as a major food item for cod, salmon, whales and other commercially important species. As adults, sand lances are harvested commercially in some areas (primarily in Europe), leading to direct human competition with diving birds such as puffins, auks, terns, and cormorants. Some species are inshore coastal dwellers, and digging for sand lances to use as a bait fish has been a popular pastime in coastal areas of Europe and North America. Other species are deep-water dwellers, some of which have only recently been described to science, and most of which lack common names.Sand lances have chameleon-like independent eye movements.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American <b>sandlance,</b> probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, northern kingfish, and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to movements involving {{a large part}} of the visual field, the eyes of vertebrates typically show an optokinetic nystagmus, a response in which both eyes are tightly yoked. Using a comparative approach, this study sets out to establish whether fish with independent spontaneous eye movements show independent optokinetic nystagmus in each eye. Two fish with independent spontaneous eye movements, the pipefish Corythoichthyes intestinalis and the <b>sandlance</b> Limnichthyes fasciatus were compared with the butterflyfish Chaetodon rainfordi, which exhibits tightly yoked eye movements. In the butterflyfish a single whole-field stimulus elicits conjugate optokinesis, whereas the <b>sandlance</b> and pipefish show asynchronous optokinetic movements. In a split drum experiment, when both eyes were stimulated in opposite directions with different speeds, both the <b>sandlance</b> and the pipefish compensated independently with each eye. The optokinetic response in the butterflyfish showed some disconjugacy but was generally confused. When one eye was occluded, the seeing eye was capable of driving the occluded eye in both the butterflyfish and the pipefish but not in the <b>sandlance.</b> Monocular occlusion therefore unmasks a link between the two eyes in the pipefish, which is overridden when both eyes receive visual input. The <b>sandlance</b> never showed any correlation between the eyes during optokinesis in all stimulus conditions. This suggests that there are different levels of linkage between the two eyes in the oculomotor system of teleosts, depending on the visual input...|$|E
40|$|Although the Pacific <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus) {{is known}} to burrow into soft marine {{sediment}} to escape predation and conserve energy, {{few studies have examined}} its use of intertidal habitat in winter. I characterized intertidal <b>sandlance</b> habitat at a North Puget Sound beach in relation to tide height, oxygen concentration, and sediment size. The density of <b>sandlance</b> increased significantly as elevation in the intertidal decreased from 0. 00 /m 2 at 0. 61 m above mean lower low water (MLLW) to 5. 00 /m 2 at - 0. 30 m below MLLW. There were no significant differences among depths to which <b>sandlance</b> were buried at three elevations (0. 30, 0. 00, and - 0. 30 m) in the intertidal zone (mean = 5. 0 cm, range = 4. 0 - 6. 0 cm). The oxygen content of interstitial water at 0. 30 m above MLLW tended to be lower at 6. 0 cm (26. 56 mm Hg) than at 4. 0 cm (31. 84 mm Hg) in depth but did not change during a low tide cycle when sediments were exposed to air. Additionally, there was no significant interaction between time of exposure and depth on interstitial water oxygen content. The oxygen tension of interstitial water at 0. 30 m above MLLW was approximately one fifth of the saturated value (oxygen content of water in equilibrium with air) shortly after being exposed by receding tide and remained near this level until the site was reinundated with the incoming tide. This oxygen level is near the suspected anaerobic metabolism threshold for <b>sandlance.</b> Disturbances that lower interstitial oxygen levels or change the size of beach sediments could adversely affect intertidal aggregations of sandlanceQuinn "Habitat characteristics of an intertidal aggregation of Pacific <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus) at a North Puget Sound beach in Washington.

40|$|Top predators, {{particularly}} seabirds, {{have repeatedly}} been suggested {{as indicators of}} marine ecosystem status. One region currently under pressure from human fisheries and climate change is the North Sea. Standardized seabird monitoring data have been collected on the Isle of May, an important seabird colony in the northwestern North Sea, over the last 10 â€“ 20 years. Over this period oceanographic conditions have varied markedly, and between 1990 and 1999 a major industrial fishery for <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes marinus), the main prey of most seabird species, was prosecuted nearby. <b>Sandlance</b> fishing grounds close to seabird colonies down {{the east coast of}} the UK were closed in 2000 in an attempt to improve foraging opportunities for breeding seabirds, particularly black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). Initially this closure seemed to be beneficial for kittiwakes with breeding success recovering to pre-fishery levels. However, despite the ban continuing, kittiwakes and many other seabird species in the North Sea suffered severe breeding failures in 2004. In this paper, we test the predictive power of four previously established correlations between kittiwake breeding success and climatic/trophic variables to explain the observed breeding success at the Isle of May in 2004. During the breeding season, kittiwakes at this colony switch from feeding on 1 + group to 0 group <b>sandlance,</b> and results up until 2003 indicated that availability of both age classes had a positive effect on kittiwake breeding success. The low breeding success of kittiwakes in 2004 was consistent with the late appearance and small body size of 0 group <b>sandlance,</b> but at odds with the two variables likely to operate via 1 group availability (lagged winter sea surface temperature and larval <b>sandlance</b> cohort strength in 2003). The reason for the discrepancy is currently unknown, but analysis of 1 group <b>sandlance</b> body composition indicated that lipid content in 2004 was extremely low, and thus fish eaten by kittiwakes during pre-breeding and early incubation were likely to be of poor quality. Monitoring of reproductive success of kittiwakes, although useful, was clearly not sufficient to tease apart the complex causation underlying the 2004 event. Monitoring programs such as this, therefore, need to be complemented by detailed research to identify the mechanisms involved, and to attribute and predict the effects of natural and human-induced environmental change...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Trends in the {{composition}} of nestling thick-billed murre diets were analyzed for the period 1980 â€“ 2002 on the basis of observations of food delivered to nestlings at two breeding colonies in northern Hudson Bay. The incidence of arctic cod, sculpins, and benthic Zoarcidae decreased and the incidence of capelin and <b>sandlance</b> increased over the period considered. Arctic cod fell from a mean of 43 % of deliveries in the mid- 1980 s to 15 % in the late 1990 s; benthic species (zoarcids and sculpins) fell from 36 % to 15 %, while capelin increased from 15 % to 50 % over the same period. July ice cover in Hudson Bay approximately halved during 1981 â€“ 99. We suggest that the observed changes in diet composition reflect changes in the relative abundance of the fish species involved and that the decline in arctic cod and increase in capelin and <b>sandlance</b> were associated with a general warming of Hudson Bay waters, the result of ongoing climate change in the region...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{comparative}} study of eye movement behaviour of teleost fish from 5 families with diverse visual specialisations and oculomotor function. In chapter 3 I compared basic oculomotor parameters in three species of fish from the families Creediidae, Syngnathidae and Pinguipedidae, that show asynchronous eye movements and a fovea. All three species showed a close correlation between their specific retinal specialisation, oculomotor range and the lifestyles and feeding habits. Direction of gaze was correlated in the two independently moving eyes in both sandperch (Pinguipedidae) and pipefish (Syngnathidae) {{but not in the}} <b>sandlance</b> (Creediidae). Properties of spontaneous and fixational fast eye movements (saccades) in the species studied show many similarities to those found in other vertebrates. The apparent independence of the two eyes in the teleosts studied seem to set them apart from many other vertebrates, where eye movements are largely correlated with respect to each other. The results presented in chapter 4, however, reveal a regular switching of saccadic activity between {{the left and the right}} eye in <b>sandlance,</b> pipefish and sandperch, suggesting that the two eyes are in some way correlated. Since saccades are often a motor correlate of attention this finding suggests that these teleosts with asynchronous eye movements may show periodic shifts of attention while observing their environment. In chapter 5 the correlation between the two eyes was also tested during optokinetic nystagmus. This basic response shown by all animals stabilises the gaze against rotational head movements and translation. In most vertebrates the optokinetic response is tightly yoked in both eyes. This is also the case for the butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae) which shows strong yoking of the eyes during spontaneous eye movements. However some capacity for independent optokinesis in the two eyes was observed. Both <b>sandlance</b> and pipefish are capable of following two conflicting stimuli independently. However monocular occlusion in the pipefish unmasks a link between the two eyes, which is overridden when both eyes receive visual input. The <b>sandlance</b> never showed any correlation between eyes during optokinesis, even during monocular stimulation. This suggests that there are different levels of linkage between the two eyes in the oculomotor system of teleosts, depending on the visual input. One of the main functions of the oculomotor system in vertebrates and most invertebrates is to keep the image of the world relatively still on the retina. As shown in chapter 6 the <b>sandlance</b> breaks this universal rule of image stabilisation by showing large postsaccadic drifting eye movements as part of its normal oculomotor behaviour. In these animals, up to 40 % of spontaneous saccades are followed by a drifting movement, either binocularly or in one eye only. The drifts are large and are always directed towards the most relaxed position of the eye, indicating that this form of eye movement is not visually driven. However the eye is visually responsive and saccades and an optokinetic response can be elicited during a drift. The drifting speed and the known acuity of the <b>sandlance</b> eye suggest that, during the drift, the image quality is not degraded. Several advantages of this unusual oculomotor behaviour can be related to the unusual optics and lifestyle of the <b>sandlance.</b> A unique modification of the eye muscles of billfish (Xiphiidae) maintains the eye and brain above ambient temperature; however the function of this adaptation and its effect on the oculomotor system is unknown. Chapter 7 aims to provide an insight into the visual abilities of billfish derived from anatomical observations of their retinal structure. The observations help explain the effect the increased retinal temperature might have for vision and eye movements. The blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) shows a well developed temporal area centralis and no visual streak, suggesting that a functional oculomotor system is required in this fish. A convergence of cones to ganglion cells at a ratio of at least 5 : 1 is present even in the area of highest acuity. The finding of two cone types suggest that the animal is capable of wavelength discrimination. Regional differences in size and composition of photoreceptors between dorsal and ventral retina potentially affect colour vision and sensitivity. The anatomical results suggest that sensitivity and spatial summation are of high priority to billfish. The possible function of the warm retina for increasing temporal resolution is discussed. These findings show the adaptability of the oculomotor system to suit the needs of different teleost lifestyles. However most of the parameters established for the oculomotor system of higher vertebrates also hold for teleosts...|$|E
40|$|The {{eyes of the}} <b>sandlance,</b> Limnichthyes fasciatus (Creediidae. Teleostei) move {{independently}} and possess a refractive cornea, a convexiclivate fovea and a non-spherical lens giving rise to a wide separation of the nodal point from the axis of rotation of the eye much {{like that of a}} chameleon. To investigate this apparent convergence of the visual optics in these phylogenetically disparate species, we examine feeding behaviour and accommodation in the <b>sandlance</b> with special reference to the possibility that sandlances use accommodation as a depth cue to judge strike length. Frame-by-frame analysis of over 2000 strikes show a 100 % success rate. Explosive strikes are completed in 50 ms over prey distances of four body lengths. Close-up video confirms that successful strikes can be initiated monocularly (both normally and after monocular occlusion) showing that binocular cues are not necessary to judge the length of a strike. Additional means of judging prey distance may also be derived from parallax information generated by rotation of the eye as suggested for chameleons. Using photorefraction on anaesthetised sandlances, accommodative changes were induced with acetylcholine and found to range between 120 D and 180 D at a speed of 600 - 720 D s(- 1). The large range of accommodation (25 % of the total power) is also thought to be mediated by corneal accommodation where the contraction of a unique cornealis muscle acts to change the corneal curvatures...|$|E

40|$|Diet {{composition}} of grey seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Gulf) {{and around the}} coast of Newfoundland, Canada, was examined using identification of otoliths recovered from digestive tracts. Prey were recovered from 632 animals. Twenty-nine different prey taxa were identified. Grey seals sampled in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence fed mainly on capelin, mackerel, wolffish and lumpfish during the spring, but consumed more cod, <b>sandlance</b> and winter flounder during late summer. Overall, the southern Gulf diet was more diverse, with <b>sandlance,</b> Atlantic cod, cunner, white hake and Atlantic herring dominating the diet. Capelin and winter flounder were the dominant prey in grey seals sampled from {{the east coast of}} Newfoundland, while Atlantic cod, flatfish and capelin were the most important prey from the south coast. Animals consumed prey with an average length of 20. 4 cm (Range 4. 2 - 99. 2 cm). Capelin were the shortest prey (Mean = 13. 9 cm, SE = 0. 08, N = 1126), while wolffish were the longest with the largest fish having an estimated length of 99. 2 cm (Mean = 59. 4, SE = 2. 8, N = 63). In the early 1990 s most cod fisheries in Atlantic Canada were closed because of the collapse of the stocks. Since then they have shown limited sign of recovery. Diet samples from the west coast of Newfoundland indicate a decline in the contribution of cod to the diet from the pre-collapse to the postcollapse period, while samples from the southern Gulf indicate little change in the contribution of cod. </div...|$|E
40|$|The {{breeding}} {{biology and}} food habits of Rhinoceros Auklets, Cerorhinca monocerata, were studied on Teuri Island (44 Â° 252 Ì† 7 N, 141 Â° 192 Ì† 7 E), Hokkaido in 1984 and 1985. Though {{the onset of}} breeding in 1984 was delayed by snow cover, hatching success in 1984 {{was similar to that}} in 1985. However, chick survival, chick growth and fledging weight were better in 1985 than in 1984. The better chick conditions characterizing 1985 correlated with the larger food loads and more frequent feedings by parents in that year in comparison with those in the preceding year. Major food items brought to chicks by parents consisted of small pelagic fishes such as Japan Sea greenling, Pleurogrammus azonus, <b>sandlance,</b> Ammodytes personatus, sardine, Sardinops melanosticta, Pacific saury, Cololabis saira, and Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi...|$|E

40|$|Three {{methods for}} {{sampling}} the diets of Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica chicks were compared and evaluated. Prey-carrying puffins were captured in mist-nets, or observed with a telescope or with unaided eyes. Prey samples collected in mist-nets yielded higher proportions of gravid capelin Mallotus villosus than did samples obtained visually. Telescopic samples produced higher {{estimates of the}} numbers of larval fish landed by puffins (larval fishes are often lost when food-laden birds are caught in mist-nets), and yielded underestimates of the lengths of male capelin. Slight correction factors made the 3 prey sampling methods comparable. Visual sampling procedures had the advantages of creating less disturbance and allowing puffins to deliver food to chicks. Use of telescopic sampling is, however, dependent on colony topography. Forage fishes, heavily dominated by 2 -yr-old capelin, made up 88 % and 98 % of the frequency and mass, respectively, of the prey delivered to puffin chicks. Small prey (larval capelin and <b>sandlance</b> Ammodytes spp., hake Urophycis tenuis, crustaceans) were most commonly fed to young chicks. Gravid and male capelin {{tended to be more}} commonly ted to chicks midway through the nestling period, a time of rapid growth. Spent female and immature capelin were fed more commonly to older chicks. The lengths of gravid capelin tended to increase through the nestling period. Gravid and spent female and male capelin and <b>sandlance</b> fed to puffin chicks were shorter in 1992 than in 1993 or 1994. Successful puffin chicks on Great Island, Newfoundland, Canada, were fed an average of 1105 (SD = 435) prey items weighing 2812 g (SD = 579) equivalent to 12506 kJ (SD = 2391). Extrapolation of these findings suggests that the population of Atlantic puffins in Newfoundland consumes about 8000 + t of forage fishes, mostly 2 -yr-old female capelin during a breeding season. Data on age-class and gender status of prey harvests by marine birds will provide needed input in energetics and trophic models...|$|E
40|$|Food {{consumption}} rate and {{growth rate of}} the adult walleye pollock were measured at different temperatures (2 - 7, 4 - 10 and 9 - 15 Â°C), body sizes (33 - 35, 35 - 39 and 39 - 45 cm) and foods (juvenile walleye pollock, squid and <b>sandlance).</b> 1. The amount of daily intake indicated peaks at intervals of 5 days. 2. The efficiency of assimilation was almost constant for range of temperature and body size, and for each food item adapted in these experiments. However, the efficiency of dissimilation increased {{with the increase in}} temperature. 3. An empirical linear equation was established on the relationship between daily feeding rate (R) and daily growth rate (G) at 2 - 7 Â°C: G= 0. 3370 R- 0. 225. 4. Body weight and condition factor increased linearly with increase of ration, but body length increased asymptotically. 5.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2001 The {{diet and}} feeding {{behavior}} of maturing sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were investigated {{during the final}} marine phase of the spawning migration, prior to reentering natal streams. The stomach contents of commercially caught sockeye salmon, migrating within the nearshore waters of the Kodiak Archipelago during 1998 and 1999, were examined to determine the level of feeding activity and taxa of dominant prey items. Samples were collected throughout {{the majority of the}} migration (early June to late August) from areas known to be used principally as migration corridors, and from areas proximate to several natal streams. Dominant prey of sockeye salmon were decapod larvae, Pacific <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus), and the pteropod Limacina helicina. Feeding activity levels and dominant prey taxa varied both between areas and within areas over time. Feeding activity levels for the population appear to gradually diminish, rather than abruptly ceasing, as sockeye approach their natal streams to spawn...|$|E
40|$|I {{compared}} Atlantic Puffin chick {{diet and}} reproductive {{performance at the}} Gannet Islands, Labrador during 1996 - 98 to that recorded 1) in a similar study undertaken during 1981 - 1983 at the Gannet Islands prior {{to a decline in}} capelin abundance, and 2) at Gull Island, Witless Bay, Newfoundland where capelin were abundant. I hypothesized that chick diet quality and breeding parameters would be dramatically lower at the Gannet Islands in the 1990 s. During 1996 - 1998 at the Gannet Islands, puffin chick diet biomass comprised 3 to 25 % capelin and only in 1996 was breeding success dramatically lower (by 40 %) than any other study colony or year. Chick mass growth rate, and peak and fledging mass were lower in the 1990 s than 1980 s yet similar to that at Gull Island. <b>Sandlance</b> was the main alternate prey and was significantly higher in lipid, protein and energy density than capelin at both colonies. Atlantic Puffins exhibited behavioural plasticity with respect to foraging and reproduction in a temporally and spatially highly variable environment...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 20, 2014 - Sept. 20, 2014 In the last decade, the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem has experienced a trend of increased severity of upwelling-driven coastal hypoxia. This thesis strove to examine the potential upper trophic level impacts of moderate and severe hypoxia in the CCLME. Initially I conducted a literature review of Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii) diet in the regions of Oregon and Washington. Thirteen papers were reviewed which detailed harbor seal foraging studies in Washington, Oregon and the Columbia River from 1931 until 2012. 148 prey species or genera were described in harbor seal diet in Oregon, Washington and the Columbia River. Accordingly, I created energetic individual-based models of harbor seal spatial foraging behavior in response to hypoxia-related habitat compression for three predominant prey species, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), English sole (Parophyrs vetulus) and Pacific <b>sandlance</b> (Ammodytes hexapterus). The model was composed of three submodels which simulated hypoxia and spatial foraging, foraging energetics, and dive mechanics. Hypoxia was scaled from 0 {{to a level of}} 1, which represented a severe inner-shelf hypoxic or anoxic event in which up to 80...|$|E
