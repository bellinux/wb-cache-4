In 1999, Beckinsale appeared opposite Claire Danes in Brokedown Palace, a drama about two teenage Americans forced {{to deal with}} the Thai justice system on a post-graduation trip abroad. A then 26-year-old Beckinsale played a teenager. Danes had hoped to become friends with Beckinsale during the shoot but found her [...] "complicated" [...] and [...] "prickly." [...] McCarthy said the leads [...] "confirm their status as two of the young actresses on the scene today most worth watching," [...] finding Beckinsale [...] "very effective at getting across layered character traits and emotions." [...] "Danes and Beckinsale are exceptionally talented young actresses," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Thomas,</b> but [...] "unfortunately, the script's seriously underdeveloped context defeats their considerable efforts at every turn." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt that Beckinsale's character [...] "never comes into focus." [...] The film was a box office failure.|$|E
500|$|Frank Provo of GameSpot {{reviewed}} the Wii Virtual Console release in 2007, citing the excellent graphics, sound, and general {{intensity of the}} game. He noted initial difficulty adjusting to the controls and game design. However, once accustomed, he said, [...] "you start totally feeling {{what it must be}} like to be an army of one trading firepower with some of the universe's largest, most elaborate creatures. That's a great feeling." [...] Lucas M. Thomas of IGN noted the game's many similarities to Gunstar Heroes and recommended Alien Soldier to those who enjoyed it. [...] "Alien Soldier is a long-lost piece of Treasure's action gaming legacy," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Thomas.</b> [...] "It's got the fast-firing, high-energy, overly-explosive intensity that fans of the company have come to expect." [...] Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life described the graphics and animation as some of the best on the Mega Drive. He found the game difficult, but still enjoyable for fans of the run and gun genre. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer described the game as [...] "manically-paced" [...] and [...] "bizarrely creative" [...] while also providing a disclaimer that it's [...] "really hectic and difficult if you're not into this sort of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Betty Cortina of People magazine, Dreaming of You {{marked a}} shift that abrogated the singer being marketed {{as part of}} her band and billed Selena as an American solo artist in [...] "the most {{fundamental}} way for her". From 1989, Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla became Selena's principal music producer and songwriter, and remained so throughout her career. Because Quintanilla III was working on the singer's follow-up recording to Amor Prohibido (1994), he could not produce the crossover album. He was asked to meet with several producers in New York and choose one who would best [...] "fit with Selena's style". Dreaming of You was the first album Selena's family did not produce. They had decided to step down before the recording sessions and allow professional pop producers to work with her. Quintanilla III and Selena flew to Nashville, Tennessee, and met with Keith Thomas, who had prepared the instrumental parts for the song called [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] but had not yet completed the vocal parts, so he sang it for them. Selena and Quintanilla III immediately liked it; Quintanilla III said he wanted Selena to include it on her album. [...] Recording sessions began in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Selena had to return later when Thomas could provide additional vocals. Selena and her husband Chris Pérez arrived at the studio on March 24, 1995 to finish recording the song. In a 2002 interview, Pérez <b>said</b> <b>Thomas</b> provided Selena with a cassette of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] and said she had the song [...] "on loop" [...] and she [...] "must have heard it a hundred times". He believed it had an [...] "effect on her" [...] because [...] "she went into the studio the next day to actually do the recording and just was nailing things left and right and [...] was letting her do her thing and I mean it was an incredible thing to watch".|$|E
