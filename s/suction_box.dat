50|$|Two large rolls {{typically}} {{form the}} ends of the drainage section, which is called the drainage table. The breast roll is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre. At {{the other end of the}} drainage table is the suction (couch) roll. The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5 mm diameter. The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary <b>suction</b> <b>box,</b> normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine. Vacuum is pulled on the <b>suction</b> <b>box,</b> which draws water from the web into the <b>suction</b> <b>box.</b> From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.|$|E
50|$|Simple press rolls can be rolls with grooved or blind drilled surface. More {{advanced}} press rolls are suction rolls. These are rolls with perforated {{shell and}} cover.

Through optimal hydraulic design of pumping system it is possible to generate better flow conditions for pump, to reduce hydraulic losses both in <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> and discharge passage and improve pumping system efficiency. Guiding principles and evaluation indexes for optimal hydraulic design of pumping system was proposed, and a case study was given to illustrate the effect of optimal design on the pumping system performances. The time-averaged three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations were closed by RNG turbulence model and SIMPLEC arithmetic was adopted to couple pressure and velocity fields. Computed results indicate that with the given water level data and within the limitations of civil construction dimensions, the flow conditions of pump in terms of bias angle and distribution uniformity of axial velocity are effectively improved through optimal design, and hydraulic losses of <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> and discharge passage are decreased by 0. 115 m and the pumping system efficiency are improved by 2. 02 %.

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{motives of}} the research undertaken here are twofold: to obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} the dewatering mechanisms at the forming section of a papermaking machine and to develop numerical models that describe the flow through forming fabrics. More comprehensive knowledge of dewatering in the forming section allows suggestions to be made for improvements that reduce the amount of energy used in the process without affecting the quality of the end product.   The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions: How and why does rewetting occur at the high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes?</b> How does the structure of the forming fabric affect dewatering at the forming section? Is it possible to create accurate numerical models for forming fabrics, and can these be used to predict the dewatering behaviour of new types of fabrics?   Laboratory and pilot studies simulating high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> were performed together with numerical modelling of the flow of air and water through both the forming fabric and the paper sheet.   The conclusion drawn from the pilot study is that rewetting significantly lowers the dryness of the paper sheet exiting the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes.</b> The phenomenon is extremely rapid and is most likely driven by capillary forces. The high speed at which this rewetting occurs makes it difficult to impede by placing the <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> closer to the couch pick-up: the solution is more likely to be the use of new and improved designs of the forming fabric. The structure of the forming fabric has been shown to affect the dewatering rate at certain conditions of vacuum dewatering, and can possibly be connected partly to the fact that fibres penetrate the surface of the fabric to varying degrees and partly to the flow resistance of the different fabric structures. Numerical models of high accuracy can be constructed and used to predetermine how new fabric designs would affect dewatering at the forming section.   This thesis quantifies aspects of dewatering such as rewetting and the influence of the forming fabric. Understanding these dewatering aspects further provides for the potential enhancement of energy efficiency in the forming section, and thereby the entire papermaking process. The forming fabric can play an important role in improving energy efficiency: rewetting after the high vacuum <b>suction</b> <b>boxes</b> occurs more rapidly than was previously known, so its design might be the only possible way of impeding it. The forming fabric can also improve the rate of dewatering: it is therefore likely that its design will be important in the next stage of developing energy efficiency and thereby play a part in achieving a more sustainable future.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies on <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> dewatering, three mechanisms were identified that determine the dry {{content of a}} web, viz. web compression, displacement of water by air and rewetting. In the present work, {{the relative importance of}} the three mechanisms was investigated through direct measurement of the web deformation, the dry content changes during and after the suction pulse, the air flow through the fibre network and the saturation of the web after the suction pulse. Suction pressure, suction time and rewetting time were varied. The experiments were done with chemical and mechanical pulp webs of various grammages. It was found that a large web deformation took place during the suction pulse, particularly at its beginning. Compression dewatering was found to be the most dominant dewatering mechanism. Displacement dewatering started after most of the web compression had occurred. Its contribution to the increase in dry content was most pronounced for higher suction pressures, longer suction times and for chemical pulp webs. A surprisingly large expansion of the web was observed immediately after the suction pulse. This expansion was the effect of rewetting. This rewetting strongly reduced the dry content of the web if the web had not been immediately separated from the forming fabric {{at the end of the}} suction pulse. Under the conditions studied, the decrease in dry content amounted to the order of 3 to 6 %. Rewetting was smaller for longer suction times and higher suction pressures. A considerable air flow through the web occurred under these conditions. This air flow apparently moved water from the forming fabric into the <b>suction</b> <b>box,</b> thus making less water available for rewetting. Rewetting for mechanical pulp webs was more pronounced and took place faster than for chemical pulps. The use of a membrane on top of the web during <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> dewatering proved to be advantageous for reducing the air flow through the web. However, under the conditions investigated, the dry content could not be improved. Although the web compression was increased when using a membrane, especially at a higher suction pressure, rewetting after the suction pulse had an even larger negative impact on the dry content, which, as a result, was lower.

40|$|Lecturepg. 109 This paper {{describes}} the successful application of cavitation flow visualization to redesign the impeller of an 8. 5 -MW (11, 400 hp) high energy double suction single stage boiler feedpump. Dual {{purpose of the}} investigation was to develop an impeller/pump case combination showing significantly less cavitation at the impeller leading-edges than the original design, and realize specific rate objectives for meeting new duty points to eliminate high pressure throttling over the discharge valve. New impeller designs were tested in a full scale model test pump running at reduced speed, which was equipped with an acrylic viewing window for direct observation of the impeller blade cavitation. Elements of the experimental effort included determination {{of the effect of}} impeller (vane) design changes, along with the effect of <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> changes introduced at the splitter vanes. Initially, a total of four alternative impeller designs were considered, form which potentially best design was selected and tuned to specification. The new impeller design developed typically had sharp elliptic leading-edges to overcome the cavitation problem. Compared with the original design, in which impellers were replaced/repaired after less than one year of operation, the new impeller lifetime was calculated to be improved by at least a factor of eight, on the basis of cavitation bubble length. The NPSH required for the new design proved to be much better than for the original design, and, additionally the efficiency was established to be improved by one to two percent. Furthermore, a <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> splitter vane modification has led to less (cavitation) bubble activity in the eye area...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{it has been}} corroborated that rewetting occurs after suction boxes and couch rolls. A certain amount of water is left in the forming fabric after the suction zone, resulting in external rewetting which decreases the dry content of the web with 3 - 5 % - units. In the present work different super absorbents with high absorption capacity were used with the intension to absorb the water left in the forming fabric after a suction pulse before it flowed back into the web. First the possibility of reducing rewetting was investigated in laboratory scale. A super absorbent was placed underneath the forming fabric and the web in a laboratory <b>suction</b> <b>box</b> during a suction pulse. A number of different absorbents were tested and several of them did significantly reduce the rewetting of the web. In some trials the reached dry content did not decrease at all after the suction pulse. Second the idea was verified in pilot scale. The rewetting was unfortunately not reduced in the same extent in the pilot trials as in the laboratory trials. But with the proposed justifications of the method it could be proved to work in also pilot scale. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the author advanced a proposal on {{the method of}} fish transportation through a piping without using any fish pump. In this system based on these suggestions, a fish hold is closed and suppose {{it to be a}} large <b>suction</b> strainer <b>box.</b> When a pump draw up fishes together with water, the fishes can be intercepted by a screen plate, and only water will be discharged from the fish hold through the pump. Therefore, the pump need not passing any fish, and so, every type of pump can be useful for this purpose. The experiments performed with model or living fishes, shows that the fish body is not damaged at all, and the pump handling is quite simple. Generally, a mass produced pump has merits of low cost, small size and high efficiency. This method is now practicable to lift mackerel from a purse net into the fish hold. And, a further application of this method, will enable to establish a technique of netless fishing. ...|$|R

40|$|During papermaking, the {{internal}} {{structure of the}} fibrenetwork constituting the paper is to a dominating extentdetermined in the forming zone of the paper machine. Thisthesis is aimed at studying the pressure distribution in bladeforming sections, which is commonly {{considered to be a}} keyquantity of the process. Previous work has provided insight into the physics ofdifferent devices employed in blade forming. However, there hasbeen a lack of models enabling studies of the effects of theinteraction between different components on the pressuredistribution. In the thesis, a model is presented for a genericblade forming section consisting of three blades. The positionsof two of the blades are fix, and in between them is located asuction box. The third blade is applied by a prescribed forceto the opposing wire, in a position facing the <b>suction</b> <b>box.</b> Themodel admits the study of the interaction between the pulsesfrom the different blades in the blade/counterbladeconfiguration, and between the pulses and one-sidedsuction. The wires are modelled as tensioned and perfectly flexibleEuler-Bernoulli beams of negligible mass. The suspension istreated like an inviscid fluid. Consideration is taken to theinfluence of fibre deposition on the permeability of thefabrics. By assuming the ratio between the length scales in thethickness direction and the machine direction to be small, aquasi one-dimensional model is obtained. For maximum flexibility, the model domain is divided intomodules. Each module is solved individually using a finitedifference based discretisation. The solutions for thedifferent modules are matched with each other iteratively. A comparison with published results for a single bladeindicates that the model can be used to obtain qualitativelycorrect predictions of the pressure distribution. New resultsinclude a series of calculations showing the non-trivialinteraction between the pressure pulses when the blades arepositioned successively closer together, the effects of suctionon the pressure pulse generated by a blade applied to theopposing wire, and how blades of modest curvature do notnecessarily stay in contact with the fabric along their fullwidth and the implication of this on the pressure gradient.
