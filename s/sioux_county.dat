40|$|Two Clovis {{projectile}} point finds {{are reported}} from the Panhandle of Nebraska (Dawes and <b>Sioux</b> <b>Counties).</b> Both are surface finds and both bear resemblance to finds in Arizona and Oklahoma. Two recent Clovis projectile point finds from the Panhandle of Nebraska warrent description. The artifacts {{are in the}} possession discoverer, Mr. William (Bill) Hudson of Crawford, Nebraska. Both artifacts are surface finds in local areas of bad land topography in Dawes and <b>Sioux</b> <b>Counties.</b> The rarity of Occurrence of this distinctive projectile point in Nebraska, whether surface find or not, makes the discoveries of importance. To my knowledge (Agenbroad, 1971), there are no occurrences of Clovis projectile points, in situ, in stratified sites within the state. At least all published records are a surface finds or recovered from sand screening operations in gravel pits. The significance of Clovis projectile points as time and cultural markers makes record of their occurrence important regardless {{of the nature of}} the find. The two Panhandle points include one complete point and one basal fragment (Fig. 1). The metric data (in mm unless stated otherwise) for the two points are as follows: data for the complete point are given first, that for the basal fragment follow in parentheses: maximum width 29 (33), weight in grams 37. 6 (-), maximum thickness 9 (5), maximum length 106 (-), distance from base to point of maximum thickness 53 (41), base width 26 (31), depth of basal concavity 5 (6), flute scar 0. 30, R. 29 (0. 22, R. 37), lateral grind L(29) R 37, L 31, R(39). Both points are of agate. Comparison of the metric data for these specimens and that for points recovered at classic sites (e. g., Lehncr Ranch, Naco I and II, Murray Springs, Escapule. Arizona; Dent, Colorado; Clovis, New Mexico; and Domebo. Oklahoma) indicate that the Nebraska points readily fall within the range of values for points from classic sites. The greatest affinities of the Nebraska points are with those of the Arizona and Oklahoma sites...|$|R
