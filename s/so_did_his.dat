5|$|Nikephoros was {{the father}} of Bardas Phokas the Elder and Leo Phokas the Elder, both of whom became Domestics of the Schools. <b>So</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> grandsons through Bardas, Nikephoros and Leo Phokas the Younger, with the first {{becoming}} emperor as Nikephoros II in 963–969. Both Leo and Nikephoros II scored major successes against the Arabs, with Nikephoros in particular leading the recovery of Crete, Cyprus, Cilicia and Antioch.|$|E
5|$|A snow {{called the}} Unity {{was added to}} the fleet, and used as a tender, but was {{abandoned}} during an encounter with a man of war named the Mermaid. As Low's success increased in the Caribbean, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> notoriety. Eventually, a bounty was placed on his head, and Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up with Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln {{campaign}} began cultivating {{a nationwide}} teen and young adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which {{it used to}} generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties. As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> supporters. People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|The Gestapo's {{transfer}} to Himmler was {{a prelude to}} the Night of the Long Knives, in {{which most of the}} SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed. The SS and Gestapo carried out most of the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an independent elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS now became his actual rank, equivalent to the rank of field marshal in the army (his previous rank was Obergruppenführer). As Himmler's position and authority grew, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> de facto rank.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{eleventh}} century BC, Mari became part of Hana whose king Tukulti-Mer took the title king of Mari and rebelled against Assyria, causing the Assyrian king Ashur-bel-kala to attack the city. Mari came firmly under the authority of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and was assigned {{in the first half of}} the 8th century BC to a certain Nergal-Erish to govern under the authority of king Adad-Nirari III (reigned 810–783 BC). In c. 760 BC, Shamash-Risha-Usur, an autonomous governor ruling parts of the upper middle Euphrates under the nominal authority of Ashur-dan III, styled himself the governor of the lands of Suhu and Mari, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> son Ninurta-Kudurri-Usur. However, by that time, Mari was known to be located in the so-called Land of Laqe, making it unlikely that the Usur family actually controlled it, and suggesting that the title was employed out of historical reasons. The city continued as a small settlement until the Hellenistic period before disappearing from records.|$|E
50|$|Goethe's {{methodology}} {{is based}} on mutual and intimate interaction of observer and observed; and, what is perceived evolves over time.

5|$|Rockefeller's {{charitable}} giving began {{with his first}} job as a clerk at age 16, when he gave six percent of his earnings to charity, as recorded in his personal ledger. By {{the time he was}} twenty, his charity exceeded ten percent of his income. Much of his giving was church-related. His church was later affiliated with the Northern Baptist Convention, which formed from American Baptists in the North with ties to their historic missions to establish schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the American Civil War. Rockefeller attended Baptist churches every Sunday; when traveling he would often attend services at African-American Baptist congregations, leaving a substantial donation. As Rockefeller's wealth grew, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> giving, primarily to educational and public health causes, but also for basic science and the arts. He was advised primarily by Frederick Taylor Gates after 1891, and, after 1897, also by his son.|$|E

25|$|Born as Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, Lagrange was of Italian and French descent.

25|$|Toulmin {{was born}} in London, England on 30 April 1740 to Caleb Toulmin and Mary Skinner, {{daughter}} of Thomas Skinner. At age eight, on 11 November 1748, Toulmin was admitted to St. Paul's School in London. As he grew, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> nonconformist views.

25|$|Armstrong {{was largely}} {{accepted}} into white society, both {{on stage and}} off, a privilege reserved for very few African-American public figures, and usually those of either exceptional talent or fair skin tone. As his fame grew, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> access to the finer things in life usually denied to African-Americans, even famous ones. It was a power and privilege that he enjoyed, although he was {{very careful not to}} flaunt it with fellow performers of color, and privately, he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians.|$|E

25|$|He {{received}} {{support from}} Afghan Muslims who accepted his sovereignty, Punjabi Mussalmans who fought under his banner against Afghan forces of Nadir Shah and later of Azim Khan. His court reflected a secular pattern, his prime Minister Dhian Singh was a Dogra, his foreign Minister Fakir Azizuddin was a Mulsim, his finance Minister Dina Nath was a Brahmin, artillery commanders such as Mian Ghausa, Sarffaraz Khan were Muslims.

25|$|In 1879, Smith {{arrived in}} Denver {{for the first}} time. By 1882, he had {{successfully}} built {{the first of his}} empires.

By 1887, he was reputedly involved with most of the criminal bunko activities in the city.

The next year Tateo Kishimoto was elected mayor of Nago and tried to find compromises regarding the relocation. <b>So</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> successor Yoshikazu Shimabukuro, {{at a time when the}} Prefecture Governor, Masahide Ota, was opposed to the Henoko relocation.

25|$|White's varsity career started inauspiciously, {{and it was}} {{not until}} the ninth game of his sophomore season that he earned a {{starting}} role. His playing time increased and <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> productivity. Although he deferred to teammates more than should have, White still managed to average 9.4points per game (ppg) for the season. The following year as a junior(1949–50), White exploded onto the national scene. He averaged over 22ppg, was named a Consensus Second Team All-American, was named the New York Metropolitan Area's top player by receiving the coveted Haggerty Award, and led the Blackbirds to a berth in the 1950 National Invitation Tournament. On February 28,1950, White set still-standing LIU single game records of 63points and 27field goals made against John Marshall College.|$|E
25|$|On April 10, 1887, Dixon {{moved to}} the Second Baptist Church in Raleigh, North Carolina. His {{popularity}} rose quickly, and before long he was offered a position at the Dudley Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts.

Additionally, he was offered a possible honorary doctorate from the university. Dixon himself rejected the offer, but he sang high praises about a relative unknown who Dixon believed deserved the honor, his old friend Woodrow Wilson.

25|$|Roger Smyth was {{the first}} of Trevor’s two Ph.D. {{students}} and Trevor always spoke enthusiastically about their work together, which spanned many years. Roger was employed as a civil servant in the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services, and <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> Mathematics outside of his working hours. Apart from the fact that Trevor got on very well with Roger, it suited Trevor to have Roger among his Northern Ireland friends and informants on political matters. In a different way, Alastair Gillespie was well placed in Edinburgh where there were rugby matches to attend every now and again, while the Cork connection with Gerard was a different kind of overlap of interests. By the way, the collaboration with Rien Kaashoek did not seem to have any similar coincidence but they did travel often between Dublin and Amsterdam to collaborate. Rainer Nagel of Tubingen was also a close contact of Trevor’s but not a co-author.|$|E
