5|$|After the British army {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans in 1917-1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed {{its role as}} an important town in the District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested {{due to lack of}} people strong enough to work in the fields. The new British regime began a program of sealing open wells, improving drainage and distributing quinine across Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim, increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, <b>still</b> <b>all</b> Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.|$|E

To compound the misery, Gloucestershire lost half a point for a slow over rate, and the result seemed to cement them {{near the bottom of}} the Division 1 table, as they lost contact with Middlesex and Sussex to settle in eighth place.|$|E

25|$|With {{the series}} square after England's close {{win in the}} second match at Edgbaston in Birmingham, neither side could secure the series win after the third Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, so there was <b>still</b> <b>all</b> to play for. The match began with England winning the toss, and {{choosing}} to bat first, thus giving Shane Warne {{a chance to become}} the first man to take 600 Test wickets in England's first innings, and he did so by getting Marcus Trescothick out caught behind by Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist when he mistimed a sweep shot, earning Warne a standing ovation from the Old Trafford faithful.|$|E
25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but <b>still</b> <b>all</b> actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E
25|$|England then {{proceeded}} to send the game into a nailbiter – English wickets fell quickly as Shane Warne took four wickets (including those of Marcus Trescothick (27), Michael Vaughan (0) and Andrew Strauss (23)). Brett Lee dismissed Ian Bell (3) and at 57 for 4 England were in trouble. Andrew Flintoff (26) and Kevin Pietersen (23) then steadied the ship with an invaluable partnership of 46 before both fell in quick succession to Lee. Despite Geraint Jones (3) being dismissed cheaply, the partnership of Ashley Giles (7) and Matthew Hoggard (8) guided the English home. Man of the match honours went to Andrew Flintoff, but more importantly this gave the English a crucial 2–1 lead heading back to London for the fifth and final Test, ensuring {{that they could not}} lose the series.

25|$|Reading's {{first game}} of November was an away trip to Nottingham Forest which the lost 1–0 after a 75th strike from Marcus Tudgay, this ended an 8-game unbeaten run. On the 6th, Reading hosted Birmingham City, and thanks to a 75th strike from Noel Hunt, won the game 1–0. 19 November saw Reading host Cardiff City at the Madjeski Stadium. Cardiff took the lead through a 2nd-minute goal from Peter Whittingham, while Mark Hudson made it 2–0 in the 70th minute. Reading pulled one goal back in the 77th through Jimmy Kebe but {{could not find a}} second, losing the game 1–2. The {{following}} weekend Reading travelled to Ipswich Town.

Reading managed to <b>still</b> <b>all</b> 3 points with 2 goals in stoppage time thanks to Alex Pearce in the 91st and Noel Hunt 93rd.
