Kinesin- 5 may function only by binding, cross-linking, and sliding adjacent spindle microtubules (MTs), or, alternatively, it may bind to a stable “spindle matrix” to generate mitotic movements. We created transgenic Drosophila melanogaster expressing fluorescent kinesin- 5, KLP 61 F-GFP, in a klp 61 f mutant background, where it rescues mitosis and viability. KLP 61 F-GFP localizes to interpolar MT bundles, half spindles, and asters, and is enriched around spindle poles.

We compared pheromone measurements from traditional hindgut extractions of female southem pine beetlcs with those obtained by aerating individuals till they died. Aerations showed greater total pheromone production than hindgut extractions, but coefficients of variation (CV) remained high (60 - 182 %) regardless of collection tech-nique.

40|$|Military personnel’s {{equipment}} {{has become}} heavier {{in recent years}} in order to provide improved combat protection. These encumbered personnel are required to wear a lifejacket for operations over water. Yet only limited published research has been identified that addresses the adequacy and efficiency of lifejackets to protect heavily encumbered military personnel from drowning. The research presented in this thesis investigates a buoyancy system, known as the multi purpose lifejacket concept that combines an inflatable lifejacket with additional buoyancy placed lower on the body in order to adequately support encumbered military personnel in the water. A comparison study has been conducted on yoke and bib lifejackets to investigate the effects of temperature and pressure on lifejacket volume, and the expected mouth freeboard tolerances of good and poor fitting lifejackets. The thesis also considers the effect that the shape of the bladder around the head has on face-plane angle and mouth freeboard. These both impact on head tilt angle. Positive head tilt was expected to improve the survival prospects in water. <b>Static</b> <b>pool</b> experiments with the two buoyancy systems have indicated how much load can be supported. This work was reinforced with wave tank experiments to determine the water ingress into a manikin’s mouth under various load and sea conditions, resulting in recommendations for suitable mouth freeboard clearances. This study identified that the particular bib lifejacket supported additional load more effectively than the yoke lifejacket investigated, when used in conjunction with buoyancy worn on the thighs. Computer models were developed to gain an understanding of the buoyancy relationships and what effect the centre of buoyancy had on supporting the encumbered load. An investigation of the three most relevant standards for this study suggested that the ISO standard best addresses the aspects of encumbered military personnel from drowning.

40|$|As {{the result}} of recent {{advances}} {{in the business of}} e-learning there has been a growing interest in e-learning standards, particularly SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model). SCORM is a reference model that integrates a collection of e-learning resource standards and specifications. In a SCORM compliant courseware, content and the pedagogic approach to be taken are predefined by the course author. As a consequence, users are unable to learn according to their preferences, and implicitly they will all encounter the same learning experience. Recent attempts to personalise learning in SCORM often resulted in either modifying SCORM or substituting its course sequencing mechanism with Adaptive Hypermedia techniques. Nonetheless, SCORM is a widely-used solution to interoperability problems with e-learning resources and can realise not only content sharing and reusability but also a consistent sequencing of course content across different systems and tools. For these reasons, this thesis focuses on supplementing SCORM sequencing rather than redefining it. The novelty of this work is that it builds an adaptive environment around the existing SCORM, without extending or modifying SCORM itself. The work integrates Adaptive Hypermedia principles into the SCORM Run-Time Environment as an independent service to support the environment with learning materials that are preferable to both teachers (primary materials of their choice) and students (supplementary materials that are pre-selected to suit some aspects of their user models to assist their understanding of the primary materials). This SCORM-complementing approach can also enable the SCORM Run-Time Environment to include on-demand external resources into the environment in order to address SCORM’s limitation of <b>static</b> <b>pool</b> of learning resources. The novel contribution of this work is the design of an authoring architecture which enables the automatic generation of a concept map and consequently links to alternative learning resources, and a run-time service oriented architecture which delivers these alternative resources, alongside the SCORM defined resources, according to a dynamic user model.

40|$|Rockster-MER is an {{autonomous}} perception capability that was uploaded to the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity in December 2009. This software provides the vision front end {{for a larger}} software system known as AEGIS (Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science), which was recently named 2011 NASA Software of the Year. As {{the first step in}} AEGIS, Rockster-MER analyzes an image captured by the rover, and detects and automatically identifies the boundary contours of rocks and regions of outcrop present in the scene. This initial segmentation step reduces the data volume from millions of pixels into hundreds (or fewer) of rock contours. Subsequent stages of AEGIS then prioritize the best rocks according to scientist- defined preferences and take high-resolution, follow-up observations. Rockster-MER has performed robustly from the outset on the Mars surface under challenging conditions. Rockster-MER is a specially adapted, embedded version of the original Rockster algorithm ("Rock Segmentation Through Edge Regrouping," (NPO- 44417) Software Tech Briefs, September 2008, p. 25). Although the new version performs the same basic task as the original code, the software has been (1) significantly upgraded to overcome the severe onboard re source limitations (CPU, memory, power, time) and (2) "bulletproofed" through code reviews and extensive testing and profiling to avoid the occurrence of faults. Because of the limited computational power of the RAD 6000 flight processor on Opportunity (roughly two orders of magnitude slower than a modern workstation), the algorithm was heavily tuned to improve its speed. Several functional elements of the original algorithm were removed {{as a result of an}} extensive cost/benefit analysis conducted on a large set of archived rover images. The algorithm was also required to operate below a stringent 4 MB high-water memory ceiling; hence, numerous tricks and strategies were introduced to reduce the memory footprint. Local filtering operations were re-coded to operate on horizontal data stripes across the image. Data types were reduced to smaller sizes where possible. Binary- valued intermediate results were squeezed into a more compact, one-bit-per-pixel representation through bit packing and bit manipulation macros. An estimated 16 -fold reduction in memory footprint relative to the original Rockster algorithm was achieved. The resulting memory footprint is less than four times the base image size. Also, memory allocation calls were modified to draw from a <b>static</b> <b>pool</b> and consolidated to reduce memory management overhead and fragmentation. Rockster-MER has now been run onboard Opportunity numerous times as part of AEGIS with exceptional performance. Sample results are available on the AEGIS website at [URL]...|$|E

Finally, the strong competition phase is glassy, dominated by uninvadable state and noise-induced transitions.

In this study, the δ 2 H and δ 18 O of precipitation, lake water, groundwater, plant xylem water and plant leaf water were measured across different plant species, seasons and plant habitats {{in the vicinity of}} Lake Chala. We found that plants rely mostly on water from the short rains falling from October to December (northeastern monsoon), as these recharge the soil after the long dry season. This plant-available, <b>static</b> water <b>pool</b> is only slightly replenished by the long rains falling from February to May (southeastern monsoon), in agreement with the two water worlds hypothesis, according to which plants rely on a <b>static</b> water <b>pool</b> while a mobile water pool recharges the groundwater. Spatial variability in water resource use exists in the study region, with plants at the lakeshore relying on a water source admixed with lake water.

Our observations have important implications for the interpretation of δ 2 H of plant leaf wax n -alkanes (δ 2 H wax) from paleohydrological records in tropical East Africa, given that the temporal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation is not reflected in xylem water and that leaf water deuterium enrichment is a key factor in shaping δ 2 H wax.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{design for a}} kettle reboiler is dependent on fitness for purpose while reducing costs. Thus, accurate information concerning two-phase flow behaviour within it is important. Experimental and numerical studies {{have been carried out}} in this research to gain a more detailed understanding of the phenomena associated with two-phase flow in a thin-slice kettle reboiler. The kettle reboiler contained 241 electrically heated tubes arranged as 17 rows of 17 columns in an in-line layout with an outside diameter of 19 mm and a pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1. 34. The working fluids used in this investigation were pentane and the refrigerant R 113. They were boiled at atmospheric pressure at uniform heat fluxes in the range of 10 to 40 kW/m 2. The patterns of flow inside the kettle reboiler were investigated experimentally using ordinary and high speed cameras. Visual observation of the flow patterns showed that the flow in the tube bundle was two-dimensional at heat fluxes of 20 kW/m 2 and above. The quantity of foam and recirculation above the tube bundle were found to depend on both the heat flux and the working fluid used. Observations of the two-phase flow pattern in the shell indicated that the movement of fluid from the centre column of the bundle was affected by the down flow into the top of the tube bundle. Two flow patterns in the tube bundle were identified: bubbly and intermittent. At low heat fluxes, bubbly flow dominated, then, with increasing heat flux, bubble coalescence {{led to the development of}} vapour slugs and intermittent flow was observed. Pressure drop measurements were made in three columns within the tube bundle. The results showed that at heat fluxes below 20 kW/m 2, the pressure drop remained nearly constant and equal to the all-liquid value. At a heat flux of 20 kW/m 2 and above, the pressure drop was found to increasingly fall below the all-liquid value as the bundle row number increased. This effect was especially evident in the centre of the bundle. A change in the flow pattern caused the pressure distribution up the tube bundle to change from roughly constant to decaying with height. Based on a number of assumptions, the two-fluid model has been applied. The two-fluid model’s drag coefficient and tube resistance were deduced from a one-dimensional model. The two-fluid model predictions show good agreement with the experimental results for the pressure distribution and flow distribution. Grid sizes of 10, 8 and 4 mm for the bundle and the pool were considered. It was found that the predicted bundle results were not affected by changing the grid size. However, in the pool region, a small grid size was needed. A grid size of 10 mm was used in the bundle while 4 mm was used in the pool. The pool velocity predictions compared well with measured values available in the open literature. The results indicated that the bundle flow is not significantly affected by the pool flow. This allows the two-fluid model to be further refined: simplifying it and reducing the computational time. A bundle-only two fluid model has been developed to accurately predict two-phase flow behaviour in the kettle reboiler tube bundle. Information available from earlier studies has been used to develop this model because of the difficulties associated with measuring the void fraction and velocities within the tube bundle. The model uses two different boundary conditions: (1) static liquid pressure in the pool and (2) variation of pressure in the pool based on the flow pattern transition. The results predicted by the model have been compared with experimental data and with one and two-fluid models at different heat fluxes. Boundary condition (1) was found to be in good agreement with experimental data and the one and two-fluid models at a heat flux of 10 kW/m 2. This was because the transition flow pattern was not achieved and the bundle was surrounded by a <b>static</b> <b>pool.</b> Boundary condition (2) is based on the Kutateladze number (Ku), which sets the transition point from bubbly to intermittent flow at a certain height in the bundle. For Ku ≤ 1. 09, the bundle flow would be surrounded by liquid, and if Ku > 1. 09, the bundle flow would be surrounded by two-phase flow. At heat fluxes of 20 kW/m 2 and above, boundary condition (2) has been found to be in good agreement with experimental data and the values predicted from the one and two-fluid models for liquid velocities, vertical mass flux and void fraction. The bundle-only model accurately predicts the trend line of constant and decaying pressure drop measured at low and high heat fluxes, respectively, and the observed flow phenomena in the kettle reboiler. The key feature of the model presented is that it allows two-phase flow in the kettle reboiler to be simulated by only modelling the tube bundle. Thus the model is simplified and less computational time is required. A central column model was developed using the minimum pressure gradient approach. The predicted results from this model were compared with experimental data and the values predicted by the two-fluid model and the bundle-only model. Reasonable agreement was obtained indicating that the flow distribution may be linked to the minimum pressure gradient...|$|E
40|$|Two {{optical sensors}} {{developed}} in UW-Madison labs were evaluated for their potential to characterize rocket engine exhaust plumes and liquid oxygen (LOX) fluid properties. The plume sensor {{is based on}} wavelength-agile absorption spectroscopy A device called a chirped white pulse emitter (CWPE) is used to generate the wavelength agile light, scanning, for example, 1340 - 1560 nm every microsecond. Properties of the gases in the rocket plume (for example temperature and water mole fraction) can be monitored using these wavelength scans. We have performed preliminary tests in static gas cells, a laboratory GOX/GH 2 thrust chamber, and a solid-fuel hybrid thrust chamber, and these initial tests demonstrate {{the potential of the}} CWPE for monitoring rocket plumes. The LOX sensor uses an alternative to wavelength agile sensing: two independent, fixed-wavelength lasers are combined into a single fiber. One laser is absorbed by LOX and the other not: by monitoring the differential transmission the LOX concentration in cryogenic feed lines can be inferred. The sensor was successful in interrogating <b>static</b> LOX <b>pools</b> in laboratory tests. Even in ice- and bubble-laden cryogenic fluids, LOX concentrations were measured to better than 1 % with a 3 microsec time constant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) are {{evolving}} toward processor pool-based {{architecture that}} employs a hierarchical on-chip network for inter-processor and intraprocessor pool communication. This letter presents a systematic exploration method of the cascaded bus matrix-based on-chip network design for processor pool-based MPSoCs. It uses an evolutionary algorithm to find optimal architectures {{in terms of}} on-chip area while satisfying a given performance constraint. Since simulation is too time-consuming to evaluate the performance of complex on-chip networks during architecture exploration, we propose to prune the design space efficiently using two novel static analysis techniques: 1) bandwidth analysis considering task execution dependences, and 2) memory contention analysis for accurate performance estimation. Thanks to fast and accurate evaluation by the proposed analysis techniques, we achieved {{an order of magnitude}} speed improvement for the architecture exploration without performance loss, compared with a simulation-based approach. Index Terms—Communication architecture exploration, MP-SoC, processor <b>pool,</b> <b>static</b> performance analysis. I...|$|R
40|$|The static {{solution}} at the {{new building}} mountain hotel The thesis deals with design and <b>static</b> calculation of <b>pool</b> tank, which is supported by columns and walls. Pool tank is designed as swimming pool with plan dimension 25 x 10 meters and with changing depth from 1, 2 to 1, 8 meters. The support of pool tank is in distance 5, 02 x 5, 05 meters. The adjacent ceiling {{is placed on the}} walls of tank and separates pool and technical areas. The calculations of inner forces were realized by computational programm for two models a) without decline of supports, and model b) with decline of supports. The design of reinforcement is performed for the bottom and walls of tank. The deformations modeling was made at {{the other part of the}} thesis. All results were evaluated and summarized at the conclusion. Drawing documentation was made subsequently...|$|R
40|$|The {{second and}} third {{generation}} of immigrants have been the centre of a lively debate about the economic integration of immigrants into their host societies, {{but there is little}} empirical evidence on the German case. In this study I comprehensively portray the labour market outcomes of second generation immigrants in Germany. Special attention is attributed to observable heterogeneity in terms of country of origin and unobservable heterogeneity in terms of parental human capital, neighbourhood effects, and mixed marriage background. <b>Pooled,</b> <b>static</b> and dynamic panel data models, and a decomposition analysis are used to estimate and explain the average differences in hourly wages and unemployment probabilities separately for men and women. The results suggest that the second generation cannot be considered as one homogeneous group: some groups perform better, equally or worse than comparable German natives. Also, relative outcomes in wages depend mainly on observable characteristics, whereas relative unemployment risks are mainly driven by unobservable factors...|$|R
40|$|The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) {{is one of}} {{the core}} {{technologies}} to form the future networks. As WSN consisting of several sink nodes and sensor nodes, while it have many advantages, such as the compact size and the low cost, corresponding constraints on resources can result. The greatest challenge among all is that distinguishing and revoking compromised sensors. Traditional techniques are used for keys pre-distributed among the sinks and sensors for pair wise key establishment and authentication. But this is not that much effective to provide authentication and due to this reason nodes are compromised. To overcome above mentioned problem, new framework was designed. The basic work in it is that to allow a three-tier general framework, use of any pair wise key pre-distribution scheme. The scheme requires two separate polynomial pools: the mobile polynomial <b>pool</b> and the <b>static</b> polynomial <b>pool.</b> Keys from this pool are used to strengthened the authentication mechanism between sink and node. For enhancing this, one way chain applied on pre-distributed password. This process has low computational cost and will increase the network resilience. In this process, there is possibility of actual data compromise and sink will not get requested data. Thereby employed, message digests to achieve data integrity by applying complex math on data to ensure that this data has not been tampered with on route to its final destination. Through detailed analysis, we will show that integrity of whole framework improves and assures the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle...|$|R
