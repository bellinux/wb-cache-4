500|$|The {{garden warbler}} feeds mainly on insects in the {{breeding}} season, although other small invertebrates such as spiders are also eaten. It picks its prey off leaves and twigs, sometimes hovering to do so. It normally forages {{at less than}} [...] above the ground. After nesting, there is a genetically controlled switch to a fruit diet, although insects are still consumed while the birds fatten prior to migration; birds gain weight more rapidly from a diet containing both fruit and insects than either alone. Berries and other <b>soft</b> <b>fruit</b> are preferred, and figs are particularly important for birds preparing to migrate. This predilection {{gives rise to the}} Italian beccafico (fig pecker) and Portuguese felosa-das-figueiras (fig-tree warbler) as names for this species. On this diet a bird can gain weight quickly and the liver increases the rate at which it produces fatty acids for storage in adipose tissue.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called bletting. Some, such as the early-ripening varieties [...] "pieper" [...] and [...] "NC21"(also known as [...] "supersweet"), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch—these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited [...] "yates", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and <b>soft</b> <b>fruit</b> can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The {{same goes for the}} Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki), where early frost can severely damage a fruit crop.|$|E
2500|$|Brussels waffles are {{prepared}} with an egg-white-leavened or yeast-leavened batter, traditionally an ale yeast; occasionally {{both types of}} leavening are used together. They are lighter, crisper and have larger pockets compared to other European waffle varieties, and are easy to differentiate from Liège Waffles by their rectangular sides. In Belgium, most waffles are served warm by street vendors and dusted with confectioner's sugar, though in tourist areas they might be topped with whipped cream, <b>soft</b> <b>fruit</b> or chocolate spread. Variants of the Brussels waffles – with whipped and folded egg whites cooked in large rectangular forms – date from the 18th century. However, the oldest recognized reference to [...] "Gaufres de Bruxelles" [...] (Brussels Waffles) by name is attributed from 1842/43 to Florian Dacher, a Swiss baker in Ghent, Belgium, who had previously worked under pastry chefs in central Brussels. Philippe Cauderlier would later publish Dacher's recipe in the 1874 edition of his recipe book [...] "La Pâtisserie et la Confiture". Maximilien Consael, another Ghent chef, had claimed to have invented the waffles in 1839, though there's no written record of him either naming or selling the waffles until his participation in the 1856 Brussels Fair. It {{should be noted that}} neither man created the recipe; they simply popularized and formalized an existing recipe as the Brussels waffle.|$|E

Numa, his yellow-green eyes round and burning with {{concentrated}} hate, glared up at the dancing figure above him. Low growls vibrated his heavy jowls and his great rage transmitted to his sinuous tail a sharp, whiplike motion; but realizing from past experience the futility of long distance argument with the ape-man, he turned presently and struck off into the tangled vegetation which hid him from the view of his tormentor. With a final scream of jungle invective and an apelike grimace at his departing foe, Tarzan continued along his way.|$|E

40|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>fruits</b> are {{economically}} important crops {{for many}} areas worldwide and {{are sensitive to}} {{a large number of}} arthropod pests, including several Tephritidae flies. Since <b>soft</b> <b>fruits</b> are consumed by a broad array of consumers, high safety standards are required to improve health requirements. In particular, develop of new eco-friendly strategies to control tephritid pests is recommended. Behavioral ecology in Tephritidae is widely investigated, but little is known about their pre-courtship and mating behavior. Here we focused on reviewing current knowledge about sexual communication in tephritids infesting <b>soft</b> <b>fruits</b> (TISF). Firstly, we reviewed lek dynamics and male-male aggression in TISF occurring in precourtship behaviors. Thus, mating behavior sequences were examined, with special reference to physical (visual, vibrational and acoustical) and chemical cues (sex pheromones and parapheromones) leading mating dynamics. Lastly, current and potential IPM applications to control TISF are delineated, specially focusing to improvement of monitoring, to sterile insect technique and “lure and kill” tools, including improvement of male annihilation technique with the application of sprayable specialized pheromones and lures...|$|R
