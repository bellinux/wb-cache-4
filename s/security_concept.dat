5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks <b>security</b> <b>concept</b> was {{that they did not}} know who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. {{government}} was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source. Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{traditional}} security paradigm humanitarian intervention is contentious. As discussed above, {{the traditional}} security paradigm places {{emphasis on the}} notion of states. Hence, the principles of state sovereignty and non-intervention that are paramount in the traditional security paradigm make it difficult to justify the intervention of other states in internal disputes. Through the development of clear principles based on the human <b>security</b> <b>concept,</b> there has been a step forward in the development of clear rules of when humanitarian intervention can occur and the obligations of states that intervene in the internal disputes of a state.|$|E

This sentiments was apparent during the [...] "March 1" [...] incident, in which Kurdish origin representatives prevented Turkey's participation to 2003 invasion of Iraq. Turkey with its Kurdish population is sensitive to the short term and long term problems of Iraqi Kurds.|$|E

40|$|How {{does the}} European Union {{respond to a}} rapidly {{changing}} security environment that is increasingly characterised by challenges cutting across the traditional divide between internal and external security? This paper traces the emergence of comprehensive <b>security</b> <b>concepts</b> at the EU level and their subsequent translation into organizational practices. It puts forward a research strategy to analyse whether, how {{and to what extent}} the new post-Cold War <b>security</b> <b>concepts</b> have had an impact on traditional ways of providing security in Europe. Complementing current research on European security policies, the paper focuses on their organizational underpinnings to study the governance of complex security issues in the EU. Building on institutionalist theories of organizational change, the paper contends that the dynamics of organizational innovation within the European security architecture lead to outcomes that differ from the comprehensive <b>security</b> <b>concepts</b> developed at the political level. A brief analysis of recent developments in the EU’s counter-terrorism architecture illustrates the complex dynamics of innovation in the European system of security governance...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of understanding {{in the discipline}} of security science is just beginning. As the academic research on defining the domain of security science continues, so does the {{development of}} learning security-related concepts {{in the understanding of}} the knowledge structure. This study has considered a methodology for the portrayal of knowledge structures in the domain of electronic security and its associated concepts. It seeks to examine the understanding of novice learners’ perceptions of electronic <b>security</b> <b>concepts</b> through the knowledge structure approach. The multi-dimensional scaling technique has been applied to dissimilarity measures on a selection of concepts from the domain of electronic <b>security.</b> These <b>concepts</b> were considered as key ideas in the learning of electronic security. The formal knowledge structure for electronic <b>security</b> <b>concepts</b> was mapped for an expert group that was most familiar with the understanding of this domain of security science. In addition, two student groups from the Singapore Institute of Technical Education participated in the study, and produced concept maps for the same electronic <b>security</b> <b>concepts.</b> The structures of the novice groups when compared to the expert group lacked the definition of clusters of related concepts, and were interpreted as lacking the understanding of experts in this knowledge domain...|$|R
