25|$|In February and March 1968, the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam was aggressively {{trying to}} regain the {{strategic}} initiative in South Vietnam after the Tet Offensive, and the <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation</b> against the 48th NLF Battalion thought to be located in Sơn Mỹ became {{a small part of}} America's grand strategy. Task Force Barker (TF Barker), a battalion-sized ad hoc unit of 11th Brigade, was to be employed for the job. It was formed in January 1968, composed of three rifle companies of the 11th Brigade, including Company C from the 20th Infantry, led by Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Frank A. Barker. Sơn Mỹ village was included in the area of operations of TF Barker codenamed Muscatine AO. (Muscatine County, Iowa was the home county of the 23rd Division's commander, Major General (MG) Samuel W. Koster.) In February 1968, TF Barker had already tried to secure Sơn Mỹ, with limited success. After that, the village area began to be called Pinkville by TF Barker troops.|$|E
500|$|On 5 November 1 RAR {{began the}} routine <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation,</b> {{inserting}} by helicopter {{south of the}} Song Dong Nai at 08:00, while the US 1/503rd Battalion was inserted onto LZ King north-west of the Song Dong Nai and Song Be rivers at 11:00. The operation started badly for the Australians and Americans with the fly-in delayed. Despite a lengthy preparation by fire, a large Viet Cong force had been observed {{in the vicinity of}} LZ Queen prior to the insertion of the lead Australian rifle company—D Company under the command of Captain Peter Rothwell. The escorting helicopter gunships began taking small arms fire as they attempted to provide suppressing fire and Rothwell made the decision to activate the alternate landing zone to the north-east, LZ Princess. D Company was subsequently inserted safely and swept back to LZ Queen, securing it {{for the remainder of the}} battalion. By mid-morning 1 RAR occupied LZ Queen, with the 105mm L5 pack howitzers of 105 Field Battery also flying-in to provide direct support. Augmenting the Australian gunners, the US 3/319 Artillery Battalion and 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery occupied FSB Ace [...] further south.|$|E
500|$|By late-1965 the {{junction}} of the Song Be and Song Dong Nai rivers had become a major communist staging area for men, equipment, and supplies for units based around Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Communist communications and resupply routes between War Zone C and D also met the Ho Chi Minh Trail in this area. Westmoreland planned to use the US 173rd Airborne Brigade to keep the Viet Cong off balance and to target their base areas, and consequently a <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation</b> codenamed [...] "Operation Hump" [...] was planned. Operation Hump marked the half-way point in the twelve-month tour of duty of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade and was named accordingly. The concept of operations envisioned 1 RAR and 1st Battalion, US 503rd Infantry Regiment being inserted by helicopter during an airmobile operation into War Zone D, in an area about [...] north-east of the US airbase at Bien Hoa. The Australian and American area of operations (AO) was to be separated by the Song Dong Nai, with 1 RAR to deploy into a landing zone (LZ) to the south, while the US 1/503rd Battalion would conduct a helicopter assault onto a LZ northwest of the Song Dong Nai and Song Be. Meanwhile, the US 173rd Airborne Brigade's second battalion—2nd Battalion, US 503rd Infantry Regiment—would be left to defend Bien Hoa airbase.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the terror}} was {{undertaken}} by Flying Patrols; cavalry units, consisting of 10 to 80 soldiers aged 15 to 20, under the absolute authority of an experienced adult leader. The detachments, specialiced in <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operations</b> were Death Squads similar to German Sturmbattalions and Russian Assault units organized during World War I.|$|R
5000|$|Designated Task Group 22.14, Mosley {{and sister}} escorts, , Menges, and [...] trained off Block Island before {{steaming}} to Casco Bay on 4 March. The next day, they sailed {{to seek out}} and destroy an enemy submarine reported off Newfoundland, north of Flemish Cap. They made first contact on 13 March, and during the next 5 days carried out persistent <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operations.</b> On 18 March in waters west of treacherous Sable Island, day-long hedgehog and depth charge attacks brought [...] "air bubbles, wreckage, and large quantities of oil" [...] to the surface. A violent underwater explosion at 1622 {{marked the end of}} , and the hunter killer group returned to Casco Bay on 20 March.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operation}} {{ended on}} November 11, 1968. Although {{the series of}} <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operations</b> was claimed to be against known PAVN troops, several operations became controversial, as evidence indicated that rather than fighting troops of the PAVN, the soldiers under the Americal Division were engaging in the [...] "mass murder" [...] of civilian populations, the most well-known being Operation Son My, otherwise known as the My Lai massacre, where several hundred civilians were estimated to have been killed. Major General Koster, {{who was in charge}} of the Americal Division at the time, came under suspicion for not investigating thoroughly into the events of the massacre. The Peers Commission, which was charged with investigating the events that occurred at My Lai, found that several similar events had occurred in many villages in that area, carried out by troops of the Americal Division, under the heading of Wheeler/Wallowa.|$|R
2500|$|Colin Powell, then a 31-year-old Army major {{serving as}} an {{assistant}} chief of staff of operations for the Americal Division, was charged with investigating the letter, which did not specifically refer to Mỹ Lai, as Glen had limited knowledge of the events there. In his report, Powell wrote, [...] "In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between Americal Division soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." [...] Powell's handling of the assignment was later characterized by some observers as [...] "whitewashing" [...] the atrocities of Mỹ Lai. In May 2004, Powell, then United States Secretary of State, told CNN's Larry King, [...] "I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored." [...] Indeed, in 1966, the so called Bình Hòa massacre at the hands of South Korean troops already occurred in Quảng Ngãi Province; in February 1968, in neighboring Quảng Nam province, during a similar to Muscatine counterinsurgency <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation,</b> the Phong Nhị and Phong Nhất massacre and the purported Hà My massacre were committed by South Korean Marines. As for the U.S. military, seven months prior to the My Lai Massacre, on Robert McNamara's order, the Inspector General of the U.S. Defense Department investigated press coverage of alleged atrocities committed in South Vietnam. In August 1967, the 200-page report [...] "Alleged Atrocities by U.S. Military Forces in South Vietnam" [...] was completed. It concluded that many American troops did not fully understand the Geneva Conventions. No action was taken, however.|$|E

Captain Mohana Chandran a/l Velayuthan (200402), {{an officer of}} this Regiment was KIA during <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation</b> in the Kinta Forest Reserve in Perak, Malaysia. He was posthumously awarded the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa (SP).|$|E
50|$|Besides {{unconventional}} warfare and training operations, the Khmer Special Forces were also engaged on some notable combat operations {{in support of}} FANK regular troops. The first true combat assignment of the Khmer Special Forces occurred in May 1972, when they participated in a <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation</b> alongside Army units around Phnom Penh to clear its northern outskirts of Khmer Rouge and NVA light artillery teams, who were harassing the quarters of the Cambodian capital with 122mm rocket and 75mm recoilless rifle fire.|$|E
5|$|Based in Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province, the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) {{was part}} of US II Field Force, Vietnam (IIFFV), under the overall command of Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand. By early 1968, 1 ATF had been {{reinforced}} and was at full strength with three infantry battalions supported by armour, artillery, aviation and engineers, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group (1 ALSG) based {{at the port of}} Vung Tau. Commanded by Brigadier Ron Hughes, 1 ATF had continued to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy, and while the war had become a series of large-scale <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operations</b> in a war of attrition for the Americans, the Australians had largely pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign despite the differences between Australian and American methods at times producing friction between the allies. Regardless, 1 ATF was also available for deployment elsewhere in the III Corps Tactical Zone and with the province coming progressively under control throughout 1967, the Australians would increasingly spend a significant period of time conducting operations further afield.|$|R
5000|$|Iwo Jima {{landed the}} {{rotation}} troops at Okinawa, then came off Qui Nhon, 10 September 1965, {{to cover the}} landing of the Army's 1st Air Cavalry Division. She had supported three amphibious assault search-and-destroy raids along the coast by 1 October, when she steamed to southern waters, remaining in stand-by status for possible evacuation of U.S. nationals in revolt-torn Indonesia. Eight days later, she sailed for Danang for a helicopter squadron exchange, thence to Subic Bay where she was relieved by [...] Following a visit to Yokosuka, she departed 1 November for return to San Diego, arriving 17 November 1965. Several months later, she again joined the 7th Fleet Amphibious Ready Group, a fast-moving assault force that had completed more than 20 <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operations</b> along the South Vietnamese coast between March 1965 and September 1966. One of these missions hit only 3 {{miles south of the}} demilitarized zone to search out and decimate a regiment of the North Vietnam Army's 342B Division, which had infiltrated South Vietnam through the neutral zone.|$|R
5|$|On September 29, Hay ordered Colonel George E. Newman—commander of the 1st Brigade—to {{place the}} 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, in the {{northern}} portion of Long Nguyen. On the next day, Colonel Frank E. Blazey, commander of the 3rd Brigade, was ordered to deploy the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment to the southern half of the area. In {{the early stages of}} Shenandoah II, U.S. forces only made a few contacts with the Viet Cong. On October 2, a South Vietnamese unit operating east of Highway 13 near Chon Thanh made significant contact with a large Viet Cong formation and absorbed heavy casualties. Enemy documents obtained by the South Vietnamese indicated they had clashed with a battalion-sized unit from the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment, sent to attack Chon Thanh in order to cover the movement of the 271st Regiment into the Long Nguyen area. Early in October, Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment had arrived in Long Nguyen but they could not obtain their much-needed food supplies, as a result of allied <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operations</b> which had created significant food shortages for Viet Cong units in the region.|$|R
50|$|The {{combined}} Korean navy of 53 ships {{under the}} commands of Yi Sun-sin and Yi Ok-gi was {{carrying out a}} <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation</b> because the Japanese troops on land were advancing into the Jeolla Province. The Jeolla Province was the only Korean territory to be untouched by a major military action, and served as home for the three commanders and the only active Korean naval force. The Korean navy considered it best to destroy naval support for the Japanese to reduce {{the effectiveness of the}} enemy ground troops.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1900s, few {{wanted to}} {{remember}} the old trail. In the War of 1812, the event from which the Trace had gotten its English name, the northward thrust of Edwards's troop of Illinois rangers had been conducted with a brutality that was taken for granted by the successful frontiersmen at the time. Edwards and his men had conducted a <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation,</b> destroying and burning every Native property they could find - including homes and villages led by Kickapoo {{who had tried to}} live in peace with the United States. [...] Furthermore, almost all of the Trace had physically disappeared. Its sodded ruts had been paved over with asphalt, plowed up as loamy farmland, or buried under later engineering projects.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 August 1965, Iwo Jima steamed out of Subic Bay for Vung Tau, Republic of Vietnam, {{to join in}} Operation Starlight, {{a five-day}} <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operation</b> that {{eradicated}} some 600 Viet Cong. The successful Navy-Marine Corps amphibious operation, backed by gunfire support from the cruiser [...] and two destroyers, {{came to a close}} late on 24 August. Iwo Jimas evacuation and surgical teams kept the American casualties down to a very low percentage. During transit back to Subic Bay, she learned the Frank Knox had been refloated, good news for the crew who had put in so many hard and long hours at Pratas Reef. She landed her Marine Special Landing Force at Chu Lai on 1/2 September, embarked 800 Marines of a rotation draft, and sailed for Buckner Bay.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Viet Cong {{began their}} third general {{offensive}} {{for the year}} on 17 August 1968, attacking dozens of towns and military installations throughout South Vietnam with rockets and mortars, including Saigon. As part of the allied response the Australians were deployed to defend Ba Ria, the provincial capital, while during 20–23 August, B and C Company, 1 RAR with a troop of Centurion tanks were involved in intense urban fighting while supporting South Vietnamese forces to clear a company-sized force from D445 VC Battalion occupying Long Dien. At least 17 Viet Cong were killed during the fighting, while Australian casualties included six wounded. During the next three weeks, all three Australian battalions were deployed on <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operations,</b> yet the Viet Cong successfully eluded them. Continuing until 30 September, the renewed offensive lacked {{the scale of the}} previous attacks and again resulted in heavy communist casualties, failing to produce lasting military gains and contributing to an overall decline in Viet Cong and North Vietnamese combat power in the south. Yet such failures were neither final nor decisive and Hanoi seemed to increasingly hold the upper hand. The war continued regardless, while allied military strategic objectives were increasingly coming into question. In late-1968 1 ATF was again deployed outside its base in Phouc Tuy, operating against suspected communist bases in the May Tao and Hat Dich areas as part of Operation Goodwood. The operation led to sustained fighting during a 78-day sweep between December 1968 and February 1969 and later became known as the Battle of Hat Dich.|$|R
2500|$|On May 5, {{the third}} phase of the {{operation}} started as airborne troops boarded on C-130 transport aircraft, jumped off and stormed the militant-held valley of Swat.

Militant fighters were holed up in the emerald mines and in the main town of Swat district, Mingora. The emerald mines were secured by the Army's 50th Airborne division by May 7, but the militants were still holding their positions in Mingora and on a strategic hilltop overlooking the town. Meanwhile, on May 7, in Lower Dir, which was previously declared clear of the Taliban by the military, militants overran a paramilitary fort, killing three paramilitary soldiers and capturing 10 policemen. On the midnight of May 10, additional airborne troops with small teams of Pakistan Navy SEALs jumped off from C-130 transport aircraft, and attacked a Taliban hidden training camp at Banai Baba in Shangla district, which is just east from Swat. In the fighting at Banai Baba the military reported killing 150 militants for the loss of two soldiers. At {{the same time as the}} fighting in Shangla, some sporadic fighting was still continuing in Lower Dir where, over four days, 109 more militants were killed. Also, further west, in the Mohmand agency, a group of 300 militants attacked a military outpost; in the fighting that ensued 26 militants were killed and 14 soldiers were wounded. On May 12, Pakistani SSG commandos were inserted by helicopters into the Piochar area, a rear-support base for the militants in the northern part of the Swat valley, to conduct <b>search-and-destroy</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
