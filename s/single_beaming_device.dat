40|$|Here, we {{investigate}} the dynamical sensitivity of electrostatic torsional type microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) on the optical properties of interacting materials.

The bifurcation curves and the phase portraits of the actuation dynamics have been analyzed to compare the sensitivity of a <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> torsional <b>device</b> operating between materials with conductivities that differ by several orders of magnitude. It is shown that the range of stable operation of torsional MEMS against stiction instabilities can increase by decreasing the conductivity of interacting materials. Moreover, the introduction of controlled dissipation, corresponding to a finite quality factor, in an otherwise unstable torsional system, could alter an unstable motion towards stiction to dissipative stable motion.

40|$|Australia is {{custodian}} {{to a large}} marine jurisdiction with associated seabed habitats {{that need}} to be managed for multiple use purposes. Mapping seabed habitats or their surrogates is a fundamental first step in this process, with methods that can map large areas of seabed such as multibeam swath mapping sonars representing attractive tools. A methodology of optimally mapping the seabed is presented using a swath mapper in conjunction with biophysical, geophysical and video/photographic devices. A Simrad EM 1002 swath mapper was used in April 2000 to map selected sites on the shelf and upper slope. The swath mapper produced three data products (being, bathymetry, backscatter and sun illuminated bathymetry imagery) that were visually inspected to target the variety of substrate types. Limitations in the imagery were observed due to instrument frequency, beamwidth, pulse length, depth and across track resolution as well as changing oceanographic and weather conditions. The biophysical, geophysical and video/photographic sampling was targeted on the contrasting features in the imagery. The video/photographic sampling proved the best tool for understanding the backscatter images and their relation to geological and biological attributes. The swath mapper proved (not surprisingly) to be an invaluable tool for undertaking investigations of the seabed, providing higher resolution bathymetry and backscatter than our existing <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> <b>devices.</b> A significant advantage for habitat mapping was the reduction in time consuming direct and visual sampling by mapping out seabed regions of like character.

40|$|This three-year long {{research}} {{involved an}} insight {{investigation of the}} morphodynamics of three artificial coarse-grained beaches at Marina di Pisa, Italy, to best define the processes, such as sediment transport, beach profile evolution, and volume displacement, acting on {{an environment that is}} somewhat neglected in the literature. Marina di Pisa is a small, seaside village, located just west of the city of Pisa along the southernmost sector of the Ligurian Sea coast, whose shoreline experienced severe erosion processes during the last 150 years. The previously existing sandy beach was thoroughly wiped out, which prompted the local authorities to set up a long series of protection structures, and eventually gravel and pebble replenishments. The beaches where the fieldworks took place are just the sites of three huge beach fills carried out in 2006. The ensuing artificial coarse-grained beaches (named Cella 6, Cella 7, and Barbarossa) are composed of 30 -to- 90 mm marble pebbles, and are characterized by a similar project configuration. The twin beaches Cella 6 and Cella 7 differ from Barbarossa in length (240 m as opposed to 110 m) and {{in the presence of a}} submerged breakwater 50 m off the coastline, whereas Barbarossa is devoid of any offshore structure. The fieldworks involved primarily the investigation of transport tendencies and pathways of the coarse sediment along these beaches by means of a rapidly developing tracing technology, the Radio Frequency Identification. The RFID technique enables to detect pebbles previously coupled to small, passive transponders. The limit of the technology was constituted by the inefficacy of the underwater detection of the tracers, but this shortcoming has been here overcome by the employment of low frequency radio signals, which allow a fine transmission of the signal even underwater. Along with the sediment transport patterns, the evolution of the beach profile was assessed in a two-year long span of time. The subaerial topographic surveys were performed by means of an accurate RTK-GPS instrument, while the sea floor morphology was investigated by the employment of an echo-sounder <b>Single</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>device.</b> The data collected during these surveys were further processed to obtain reckoning of the sediment volumes that play a major role in the evolution of the beaches relative to the changing sea weather conditions. The results of the research might be spent to expand the comprehension of coarse-grained beaches to begin with. In addition, providing an in-depth definition of the morphodynamic processes governing this kind of beach, they might be useful to improve and optimize coarse replenishments, which are progressively more common as a form of protection from coastal erosion, and to back up studies on ancient gravelly shorelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{deflection}} of a chevron actuator strongly {{depends on}} the length and {{the angle of the}} beams; a larger deflection is produced if a smaller angle is used. The drawback {{is that it is a}} <b>single</b> <b>beam</b> like <b>device.</b> To deliver a larger displacement, even longer beams are required for chevron actuators. This is problematical in term of fabrication and operation, as the long beams easily buckle or stick to the substrate. Therefore the beam length of a chevron device is limited, typically to a 200 Pm long, which in-turn limits the amount of the displacement and applications. In our new type of device, instead of using a <b>single</b> long <b>beam,</b> the arm is folded into a number of chevron sections to become a planar spring-like actuator as shown in Fig. 1. b. (2 chevrons with 1 linkage bar are defined as 1 ring). An insulating beam with a very low thermal expansion coefficient is used to form a cross-linkage thereby constraining the displacement in the x-direction. As the actuator is heated up under bias, the thermal expansion of the active material leads to a displacement in the y-direction only. A new type of Microspring (P-spring) electrothermal actuator consisting of multi-chevron structures was proposed. Finite element analysis was used to model the device performance, and the results compared with that of chevron thermal actuator. The simulation showed that the P-spring actuator can deliver a much large deflection than that of chevron actuator. The deflection is proportional to the number of chevron structures linked together. By linking more chevron structures, this P-spring can deliver a larger displacement than any other thermal actuators. The device has a much smaller footage than that of a single chevron device for a similar amount of deflection. Electroplated Ni thin film and SiO 2 were used as active and linkage materials to fabricate the P-spring actuator...|$|R
