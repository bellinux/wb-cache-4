5|$|Most {{methods that}} {{separate}} neptunium ions exploit the differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of neptunium (from +3 to +6 or sometimes even +7) in solution. Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|For decades, the {{commercial}} technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, {{a process that}} was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866.

5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. <b>Solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

5|$|Separation of the 3+ {{actinides}} {{can also}} be achieved by <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase.

5|$|Technetium can {{catalyse}} {{the destruction}} of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies.

5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|High thorium {{concentrations}} {{are needed}} in nuclear applications; particularly, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture cross-sections must be very low (for example, gadolinium concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> procedures involving selective complexation of Th4+ is used.

5|$|Before mendelevium's discovery, Seaborg and Katz {{predicted}} {{that it should}} be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts. Cation-exchange and <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, fermium. Mendelevium can form coordination complexes with 1,2-cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid (DCTA).|$|E
5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction,</b> with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being buffered acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E

5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply.

The nickel matte is further processed with the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of cobalt and nickel.

High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction,</b> and ion exchange.

The aqueous-based hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) extraction, technique was tested using C- 14 -PAHs in soils and compared, against indigenous microbial mineralization (a measure of bioaccessibility) of C- 14 -phenanthrene in the presence of pyrene or benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P),over a range of concentrations (0, 5, 10, or 50 mg kg(- 1)), and aged for 0, 25, 50, and 100 d in four soils. At each time point, the total loss, extractability, and, mineralization of C- 14 -phenanthrene was measured in each of the soils. The presence of the other PAHs had little effect on the behavior of C- 14 -phenanthrene in any of the soils. Comparisons. between the amounts of C- 14 -phenanthrene extracted using, HPCD and mineralized were made and showed that there was a correlation (1 : 1). This study demonstrates that HPCD extraction is able to predict the microbial accessibility fraction of (14) C-phenanthrene in the presence of other PAHs in a range, of soils, further supporting the applicability of this technique. ...|$|R

The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The <b>solvent</b> <b>extraction</b> then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals.
