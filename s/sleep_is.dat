5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly squeaking, {{shuffling}} position and seen hanging out the bottom of the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts Birth by <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> a prequel to the series, {{released}} for the PlayStation Portable in Japan on January 9, 2010, and in North America on September 7, 2010 {{with additional}} content. The game is set {{ten years before}} {{the events of the}} first Kingdom Hearts game, revealing the origins of the villain, Xehanort. It consists of four scenarios, three of which focus on one of the game's three protagonists, Terra, Ventus and Aqua. The game was re-released exclusively in Japan under the title Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix on January 20, 2011 with the content from the English versions as well as new features, such as an additional fifth scenario.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E
50|$|After the {{invention}} of the EEG, the stages of <b>sleep</b> <b>were</b> determined in 1936 by Harvey and Loomis, the first descriptions of delta and theta waves were made by Walter and Dovey, and REM <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1953. <b>Sleep</b> apnea <b>was</b> identified in 1965. In 1970, the first clinical <b>sleep</b> laboratory <b>was</b> developed at Stanford. The first actigraphy device was made in 1978 by Krupke, and continuous positive airway pressure therapy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty were created in 1981.|$|R

5|$|Birth by <b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> a prequel to {{the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, taking place ten years prior. Like the other games in the series, the player {{progresses}} through a collection of various worlds, based on various locales from the Disney animated features canon: Dwarf Woodlands from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Enchanted Dominion from Sleeping Beauty, Castle of Dreams from Cinderella, Olympus Coliseum from Hercules, Deep Space from Lilo & Stitch, Neverland from Peter Pan and Mysterious Tower from Fantasia. The game also features various new worlds specially created for the series by Square Enix such as the Land of Departure and Radiant Garden. Disney Town, which is the town that surrounds the castle grounds of Disney Castle, serves as the game's minigame world. Worlds such as Destiny Islands and Castle Oblivion also appear {{in the form of}} cutscenes, while the 100 Acre Wood from the Winnie the Pooh franchise, which had appeared in most other games of the series, only appears as a Command Board in Birth by Sleep. The staff first chose the worlds based on the game's scenario, leading to the inclusion of Princesses' worlds. They then added the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space to add variety to the game, while Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{studies of}} KLS show varying results {{based on the}} amount of time the patient is observed. Slow wave <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> often reduced at the {{beginning}} of episodes, and REM <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> reduced near the end. Conversely, REM <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> often normal at the beginning, and slow wave <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> often normal by the conclusion. Stage two non-rapid eye movement <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> often interrupted during KLS. Studies also show that stage one and three non-rapid eye movement sleep become more efficient when the episodes end. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test has yielded inconsistent results when given to KLS patients. In many cases, hours are spent in a withdrawn sleep-like state while awake during episodes. Most sleep studies have been performed while subject are near the end of their episodes. Some patients experience brief insomnia and become very happy and talkative after the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{the longer}} an {{organism}} is awake, {{the more it}} feels a need to sleep ("sleep debt"). This driver of <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> referred to as Process S. The balance between sleeping and waking is regulated by a process called homeostasis. Induced or perceived lack of <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> commonly called sleep deprivation.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess sleep and circadian regulation in an astronaut. <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> recorded polygraphically on tape as was body temperature. Daytime alertness was subjectively rated by a mood questionnaire. For a comparison, the same parameters were measured during a baseline period preceding the flight. The circa- dian rhythms of body temperature and alertness {{were found to be}} de- layed in space compared to baseline. This could mark a phase shift or the transition to a circadian state of free-run. <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> shorter and more disturbed. The structure of <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> significanly altered.

30|$|Conclusions: With this two step-approach of {{assessing}} sleep in ICU practice, we determined that 7 out of 10 ICU patients experienced adequate sleep. However, the mean NRS <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> {{just at the}} cut-off value of sufficient <b>sleep</b> which <b>was</b> determined earlier. No differences between specific patients groups <b>were</b> found. <b>Sleep</b> quality and depth of <b>sleep</b> <b>were</b> the most important themes for insufficient sleep measured with the RCSQ.|$|R

25|$|While {{the precise}} {{function}} of REM <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> not well understood, several theories have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> quickly reversible, {{as opposed}} to {{hibernation}} or coma, and sleep deprivation is followed by longer or deeper rebound sleep.|$|E
25|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> a normal stage of sleep characterized by rapid {{movements of the}} eyes. REM <b>sleep</b> <b>is</b> classified into two categories: tonic and phasic. The phenomenon of REM sleep and its association with dreaming was discovered by Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman with assistance from William C. Dement, a medical student at the time, in 1952 during their tenures at the University of Chicago. Kleitman and Aserinsky's seminal article was published September 10, 1953.|$|E
40|$|The {{circadian}} {{timing system}} has been implicated in age-related changes in sleep structure, timing and consolidation in humans. We investigated the circadian regulation of sleep in 13 older {{men and women and}} 11 young men by forced desynchrony of polysomnographically recorded sleep episodes (total, 482; 9 h 20 min each) and the circadian rhythms of plasma melatonin and core body temperature. Stage 4 <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> reduced in older people. Overall levels of rapid eye movement (REM) <b>sleep</b> <b>were</b> not significantly affected by age. The latencies to REM <b>sleep</b> <b>were</b> shorter in older people when sleep coincided with the melatonin rhythm. REM <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> increased {{in the first quarter of}} the sleep episode and the increase of REM sleep in the course of <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> diminished in older people. Sleep propensity co-varied with the circadian rhythms of body temperature and plasma melatonin in both age groups. <b>Sleep</b> latencies <b>were</b> longest just before the onset of melatonin secretion and short <b>sleep</b> latencies <b>were</b> observed close to the temperature nadir. In older people <b>sleep</b> latencies <b>were</b> longer close to the crest of the melatonin rhythm. In older people <b>sleep</b> duration <b>was</b> reduced at all circadian phases and sleep consolidation deteriorated more rapidly during the course of sleep, especially when the second half of the sleep episode occurred after the crest of the melatonin rhythm. The data demonstrate age-related decrements in sleep consolidation and increased susceptibility to circadian phase misalignment in older people. These changes, and the associated internal phase advance of the propensity to awaken from <b>sleep,</b> appear to <b>be</b> related to the interaction between a reduction in the homeostatic drive for sleep and a reduced strength of the circadian signal promoting sleep in the early morning...|$|R
40|$|The {{sleep of}} 10 volunteers {{with an average}} age of 57 years was {{recorded}} electrophysiologically before, during, and after nitrazepam 5 mg nightly for 10 weeks. <b>Sleep</b> <b>was</b> longer and less broken on the drug and no tolerance was obvious after two months' use. Withdrawal of the drug, however, caused <b>sleep</b> to <b>be</b> temporarily worse than before the drug had <b>been</b> taken. Slow-wave <b>sleep</b> <b>was</b> reduced by nitrazepam, but the accompanying secretion of growth hormone was not impaired...|$|R

25|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>is</b> a {{naturally}} recurring state characterized by reduced or absent consciousness and proceeds in cycles of {{rapid eye movement}} (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The normal order of sleep stages is N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM. Sleep stages are characterized by spectral content of EEG: for instance, stage N1 refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves (common in the awake state) to theta waves, whereas stage N3 (deep or slow-wave <b>sleep)</b> <b>is</b> characterized {{by the presence of}} delta waves.|$|E
