One quarter of patients suffering from acute critical illness such as severe trauma, sepsis, myocardial infarction (MI) or post cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) develop severe hemostatic aberrations and coagulopathy, which are associated with excess mortality. Despite the different types of injurious “hit”, acutely critically ill patients share several phenotypic features that may be driven by the shock. This response, mounted by the body to various life-threatening conditions, is relatively homogenous and most likely evolutionarily adapted. We propose that shock-induced sympatho-adrenal hyperactivation is a critical driver of endothelial cell and glycocalyx damage (endotheliopathy) in acute critical illness, with the overall aim of ensuring organ perfusion through an injured microvasculature. We have investigated more than 3000 patients suffering from different types of acute critical illness (severe trauma, sepsis, MI and PCAS) and have found a potential unifying pathologic link between sympatho-adrenal hyperactivation, endotheliopathy, and poor outcome. We entitled this proposed disease entity, shock-induced endotheliopathy (SHINE). Here we review the literature and discuss the pathophysiology of SHINE. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

However, as the amount of Supplemental Information has grown, it has become increasingly difficult for authors, reviewers, and readers to navigate due to the volume of information and the lack of defined structure and limits. To address these problems, we are introducing these guidelines, which we believe will make Supplemental Information more useful and accessible to readers. These guidelines aim to define the scope of data presented in Supplemental Information and to provide a structure that integrates Supplemental Information with information presented in the main article, linking the two more constructively. In general, Supplemental Information is limited to data and other materials that directly support the main conclusions of a paper but are considered additional or secondary support for the main conclusions, or cannot be included in the main paper for reasons such as space or file format restrictions. Supplemental Information <b>should</b> <b>be</b> within the conceptual scope of the main paper and not extend beyond it. The quality and presentation of Supplemental Information <b>should</b> <b>be</b> on <b>par</b> with that in the main paper and is subject to the same scientific standards.

40|$|Shortage of {{teachers}} in medical colleges: Possible remedial measures I read with interest the articles on shortage {{of teachers}} in medical colleges in India by Dr Ananthakrishnan, and Dr Jain and colleagues. 1, 2 I suggest below some remedial measures. While the attrition of teachers is usually at the senior level, the intake is at a junior level. Hence, {{it is necessary for}} the government to take measures to retain teachers at the senior level in medical colleges. This would ensure the availability of experienced and quality teachers to continue with high academic standards. Enhanced recruitment at the junior levels will not make up for the deficiency at the senior levels, some of which is contributed to by superannuation. To retain sufficient teachers at the senior level the age for superannuation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> increased to 70 years. Also, senior teachers who have superannuated could be recalled/re-employed till the age of 70 years. To make up for the scarcity of teaching staff at the junior level, those with DNB qualifications, and MSc and PhD degrees could be recruited. But teachers with a DNB qualification <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> on <b>par</b> with those holding MD/MS degrees but at a rank junior. Similarly, teachers holding non-medical MSc/PhD degrees <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given a rank junior to those with DNB qualifications. This degree-based differentiation in the rank of teachers will ensure a long term rational and justifiable solution...|$|R

He cannot give a clear or definite explanation to what actually satisfy him to the maximum extent, Therefore satisfying a customer to the full extent is a difficult task for the marketer. But once you come to know the pulse of your customer you can track their needs and see to that they get full satisfaction. For that marketers have to understand the expectations of customers even before he try to explain his need in detail...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} {{investigation}} in the present work {{is the relationship between}} information structure and some linguistic phenomena that have been traditionally studied as part of a modularly encapsulated ‘narrow syntax’. Our fundamental aim is to show that all those explanations specifically built on a static notion of (narrow) syntax result inadequate both empirically and conceptually. Hence they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> abandoned. Such <b>pars</b> destruens will <b>be</b> complemented by the progressive introduction of a model of syntax which instead exhibits a structural integration with information structure, without any rigid encapsulation. Our starting point will be the definition of ‘extraction out of a domain’. The necessity of the concepts topic and focus, hierarchically reinterpreted in a cyclic theory of the syntax and the semantics/pragmatics, shall emerge strongly. The main theoretical result which will be reached is the following generalization: the more topical is a domain, the more opaque it results. We will subsequently examine the different phenomenologies in island extraction, arriving at the conclusion that both the type of extraction and the type of extractee influence grammaticality in a predictable way. In particular, an increase in the value of topicality associated to the...|$|R
