40|$|Abstract: The Eulerian Chemistry-Transport Model BelEUROS {{was used}} to {{calculate}} the concentrations of airborne PM 10 and PM 2. 5 over Europe. Both primary as well as <b>secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> in the respirable size-range was taken into account. Especially PM 2. 5 aerosols are often formed in the atmosphere from gaseous precursor compounds. Comprehensive computer codes for the calculation of gas phase chemical reactions and thermodynamic equilibria between compounds in the gas-phase and the particulate phase had been implemented into the BelEUROS-model. Calculated concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 are compared to observations, including both the spatial and daily, temporal distribution of particulate matter in Belgium for certain monitoring locations and periods. The concentrations of the secondary compounds ammonium, nitrate and sulfate have also been compared to observed values. BeIEUROS was found to reproduce the observed concentrations rather well. The model was applied to assess the contribution of emissions derived from the sector agriculture in Flanders, the northern part of Belgium, to PM 10 - and PM 2. 5 -concentrations. The results demonstrate the importance of ammonia emissions in the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter.</b> Hence, future European emission abatement policy should consider more the role of ammonia in the formation of secondary particle...|$|E

Secondary POM generated by photooxidation of toluene using a continuous-flow reactor and an 8 cubic meter indoor smog chamber was collected, and then extracted with acetonitrile.

The majority of the products, including methylnitrophenols and methylnitrocatechols, were isotopically depleted by 5 to 6 permil compared to the initial isotope ratio for toluene, whereas the isotope ratio for 4 _nitrophenol remained {{the same as the}} initial isotope ratio for toluene. Based on the reaction mechanisms postulated in literature, stable carbon isotope ratios of these products were calculated. Comparison of the observed isotope ratios with the predicted implies that a reaction channel of methylhydroxycyclohexadienyl radical with NO 2 is a possible production pathway for the particulate phenolic compounds.

Cost considerations are essential information for policy purposes, and costs can be divided among environmental targets if co-benefits of measures can be identified.

The increase in animal stocking and in the price of chemical fertilizers encourage farmers to use animal manure and slurry as an option to reduce the use of commercial fertilizers.

40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> organic <b>matter</b> (POM) {{formed in}} a flow reactor by the OH-radical-induced {{reactions}} of toluene was collected on quartz fiber filters, and its stable carbon isotope ratio was analyzed by off-line combustion and subsequent dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The toluene consumption in these experiments ranged from 7 % to 29 %. The stable carbon isotope composition (δ 13 C) {{of the secondary}} POM was {{in the range of}} − 32. 2 ‰ to − 32. 9 ‰ (VPDB scale), with some indication for a slight dependence on the extent of toluene consumption. These measured δ 13 C values were, on average, 5. 8 ‰ lighter than those of the parent toluene. Those observations are slightly lower than the δ 13 C values of the sum of all toluene oxidation products (from − 31. 6 ‰ to − 32. 3 ‰) that are predicted using the kinetic isotope effect for the reaction of toluene with OH-radical under these reaction conditions and the initial δ 13 C of the parent toluene. Therefore, mass balance dictates that the fractionation between gas-phase and particle-phase products is small. On average, the particle-phase products are 0. 6 ‰± 0. 2 ‰ lighter than the gas-phase products. This is in agreement with the concept that the initial reaction of toluene with the OH-radical is the slowest step in the reaction sequence resulting in POM formation...|$|R

These preliminary data suggest that ammonium bisulfate in realistic concentrations and exposure durations as a model compound for the secondary fraction of ambient PM 10 exerts no pulmonary effects in normal healthy mice and in a mouse model of mild asthma.

40|$|Atmospheric ammonia is a {{precursor}} for <b>secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> formation, which harms {{human health and}} contributes to acidification and eutrophication. Under the 2012 Gothenburg Protocol, 2005 emissions must be cut by 6 % by 2020. In the UK, 83 % of total emissions originate from agricultural practices such as fertiliser use and rearing of livestock, with emissions that are spatially extensive and variable in nature. Such fugitive emissions make resolving and tracking of individual site performance challenging. The Directional Passive Air quality Sampler (DPAS) was trialled at Whim Bog, an experimental site with a wind-controlled artificial release of ammonia, in combination with CEH-developed ammonia samplers. Whilst saturation issues were identified, two DPAS-MANDE (Mini Annular Denuder) systems, when deployed in parallel, displayed an average relative deviation of 15 % (2 – 54 %) across all 12 directions, with the directions exposed to the ammonia source showing ∼ 5 % difference.

40|$|Environmental chamber ("smog chamber") {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production from dilute emissions from two medium-duty diesel vehicles (MDDVs) and three heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) under urban-like conditions. Some of the vehicles were equipped with emission control aftertreatment devices including diesel particulate filters (DPF), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC). Experiments were also performed with different fuels (100 % biodiesel and low-, medium- or high-aromatic ultralow sulfur diesel) and driving cycles (Unified Cycle, Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, and creep+idle). During normal operation, vehicles with a catalyzed DPF emitted very little primary <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (PM). Furthermore, photo-oxidation of dilute emissions from these vehicles produced essentially no SOA (below detection limit). However, significant primary PM emissions and SOA production were measured during active DPF regeneration experiments. Nevertheless, under reasonable assumptions about DPF regeneration frequency, the contribution of regeneration emissions to the total vehicle emissions is negligible, reducing PM trapping efficiency by less than 2 %. Therefore, catalyzed DPFs appear to be very effective in reducing both primary and <b>secondary</b> fine <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> from diesel vehicles. For both MDDVs and HDDVs without aftertreatment substantial SOA formed in the smog chamber – with the emissions from some vehicles generating twice as much SOA as primary organic aerosol after three hours of oxidation at typical urban VOC : NO x ratios (3 : 1). Comprehensive organic gas speciation was performed on these emissions, but {{less than half of}} the measured SOA could be explained by traditional (speciated) SOA precursors. The remainder presumably originates from the large fraction (~ 30 %) of the non-methane organic gas emissions that could not be speciated using traditional one-dimensional gas-chromatography. The unspeciated organics – likely comprising less volatile species, such as intermediate volatility organic compounds – appear to be important SOA precursors; we estimate that the effective SOA yield (defined as the ratio of SOA mass to reacted precursor mass) was 9 ± 6 % if both speciated SOA precursors and unspeciated organics are included in the analysis. SOA production from creep+idle operation was 3 – 4 times larger than SOA production from the same vehicle operated over the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS).

40|$|This {{report is}} written in Swedish {{and focus on the}} Port of Gothenburg’s and the trade {{association}} Ports of Sweden’s views on future handling of scrubber generated wastes. This report has been fulfilled because of the new rules from IMO, concerning maximum sulphur content in the marine fuels, which will come into force in SECA during 2015. Many of the petroleum based marine fuels contain high levels of sulphur that can be harmful for both human and the environment. e. g. acidification and <b>secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter.</b> Acidification means that the pH value decreases in soils and lakes, which affect the ecosystem. <b>Secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> can cause human health issues such as early death. IMO MARPOL Annex VI was introduces in 1997 and revised in 2008 with amendments that entered into force in 2010. Annex VI contains the permissible limits of sulphur in marine fuels and emission into the air. Due to the revision of Annex VI in 2008 the European commission presented a proposal of amendment of the sulphur directive. The revised Annex VI from 2008 and the proposal of amendment states that all equivalent substitutes for low sulphur fuel that can provide the same positive environment impact is allowed to be used in SECA. One of the substitutes recommended by European Union is the use of an exhaust gas cleaning technology, i. e. scrubber. There are different types of scrubbers; wet and dry. To reduce the sulphur dioxide from the exhaust the wet scrubber uses either untreated seawater in an open system or caustic soda treated freshwater in a closed system. The open system is dependent on the oceans alkalinity. A closed system can be used in all kinds of waters, however, waste are generated and has to be taking care of in port. A dry scrubber uses pellets and generates a solid waste that also has to be handled in port. A semi-structured interview with the Port of Gothenburg and Ports of Sweden has been performed to fulfil the purpose of the report. The conclusion of the report is that the Port of Gothenburg, the industry and employers' organization Ports of Sweden believes that they have the possibility to receive waste from scrubbers. However, today they have not made any investigations to support this statement. Also both organizations have incomplete knowledge concerning the current amount of waste generated by using different scrubbers and the characteristics of the waste...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} the health impacts of particulate pollution and the important role ammonia (NH 3) emissions play in the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (PM) has spawned a great deal of new research into ammonia emissions. Major sources of NH 3 emissions include livestock operations, fertilizer use, waste management, mobile sources, industrial point sources, and various biological sources including human respiration, wild animals, and soil microbial processes. For each of these source categories there remain large uncertainties in the magnitude of emissions, the diurnal and seasonal variation, and the spatial distribution. Uncertainty in NH 3 emissions is a key source of uncertainty in the formation of sulfate and nitrate aerosols. Thus, development of improved NH 3 emissions inventories is essential for modeling the formation of fine PM, regional haze, and for developing effective plans to mitigate visibility impairment at National Parks, Forests and Wilderness Areas.

40|$|Ambient {{concentrations}} of pollutants are correlated with emissions, but the contribution to {{ambient air quality}} of on-road mobile sources is not necessarily equal to their contribution to regional emissions. This is true for several reasons such as the distribution of other pollution sources and regional topology, as well as meteorology. In this paper, using a dataset from a travel demand model for the Sacramento metropolitan area for 2005, regional vehicle emissions are disaggregated into hourly, gridded emission inventories, and transportation- related concentrations are estimated using an atmospheric dispersion model. Contributions of on-road motor vehicles to urban air pollution are then identified at a regional scale. The contributions to ambient concentrations are slightly higher than emission fractions that transportation accounts for in the region, reflecting that relative to other major pollution sources, mobile sources {{tend to have a}} close proximity to air quality monitors in urban areas. The contribution results indicate that the impact of mobile sources on PM 10 is not negligible, and mobile sources have a significant influence on both NOx and VOC pollution that subsequently results in <b>secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> and ozone formation.

Conversion to croplands has also led to a widespread increase in ozone dry deposition velocity. Together these changes in biosphere–atmosphere exchange have led to a 14  % global mean increase in biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) surface concentrations, a doubling of surface aerosol nitrate concentrations, and local changes in surface ozone of up to 8. 5  ppb. We assess a global mean LUC-DRF of + 0. 017, − 0. 071, and − 0. 01  W m − 2 for BSOA, nitrate, and tropospheric ozone, respectively.

Pending regulations for older power plants need information about any potential public health benefits of emission reductions, which can be estimated by combining emissions information, disper-sion modeling, and epidemiologic evidence. In this ar-ticle, we develop an analytical modeling framework that can evaluate health benefits of emission controls, and we apply our model to two power plants in Massachu-setts.

When we combine concentration reductions with current health evidence, our central estimate is that the secondary PM reductions from these two power plants would avert 70 deaths per year in a population of 33 million individuals. Although benefit estimates could differ substantially with differ-ent interpretations of the health literature, parametric perturbations within CALPUFF and other simple model changes have relatively small impacts from an aggregate risk perspective.

40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) in air is {{of major}} health and {{environmental}} concern, i. e. contribution to the greenhouse effect when NH 3 is converted to nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in the atmosphere. Another important concern for ammonia in the atmosphere, is the possible conversion to <b>secondary</b> fine <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> {{in the presence of}} SOx or NOx. The main sources of NH 3 in air are waste and food processing industries as well as animal livestock production. The increase in environmental litigation, coupled with rising environmental awareness and a focus on quality of life, has resulted in an increase in the investigation and implementation of new technologies for the treatment of ammonia. In addition, existing methods are cost intensive, unreliable or complex and difficult to control. In this research, a novel biochemical ammonia removing process has been developed and operated for 300 days. This process involves a sequence of biological, physical and chemical processes initiated by the dissolution of the introduced ammonia into the water of the filter system to make the ammonium available for biological degradation (nitrification). A spontaneous reaction of the intermediate nitrification product, nitrite, and ammonium to nitrogen takes place as soon as both compounds are present. This reaction is known to be catalysed by zeolite (clinoptilolite). Water from the discharged moisture of the filter system was condensed on top of the reactor by employing a novel moisture control mechanism. The clean condensate percolated by gravity through the reactor bed and forced the accumulated compounds {{to the bottom of the}} reactor. This led to a gradient distribution of compounds across the reactor depth with the highest concentrations at the bottom (140 mM ammonium, 1 M nitrite and 350 mM nitrate), favouring the chemical reaction of NH 4 + + NO 2...|$|R

We also investigate the influence of assumptions made regarding the exposure-response functions used in these calculations since PM of different origin are expected to have different health impacts. According to the results road traffic makes important contributions to the external health cost both on a local and a regional scale compared to other sources. This is in part due to emissions being released in close proximity to where people live but also because of the amount of pollutants emitted. Although non-exhaust PM makes a large contribution to local population exposure within Stockholm the external health cost is relatively small which is due to other health impact being relevant for this emission source. Residential heating also makes an important contribution to exposure and external health cost on a local scale while power plants have a large influence regionally.

Within these projects, CITYDELTA and EURODELTA, the fate of air quality at the scale of European cities or that of the European continent was studied using several models. In this article {{we focus on the}} results of EURODELTA. The predictive skill of the ensemble of models is described for ozone, nitrogen dioxide and secondary inorganic compounds, and the uncertainty in air quality modelling is examined through the model ensemble spread of concentrations. For ozone daily maxima the ensemble spread origin differs from one region to another. In the neighbourbood of cities or in mountainous areas the spread of predicted values does not span the range of observed data, due to poorly resolved emissions or complex-terrain meteorology. By contrast in Atlantic and North Sea coastal areas the spread of predicted values is found to be larger than the observations. This is attributed to large differences in the boundary conditions used in the different models. For NO 2 daily averages the ensemble spread is generally too small compared with observations. This is because models miss highest values occurring in stagnant meteorology in stable boundary layers near cities. For <b>secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> compounds the simulated concentration spread is more balanced, observations falling nearly equiprobably within the ensemble, and the spread originates both from meteorology and aerosol chemistry and thermodynamics...|$|E

DMS {{is important for}} the formation of non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO 42 −) aerosols and <b>secondary</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> over oceans and thus, significantly influence global climate. The mechanism of DMS oxidation has accordingly been investigated in several different model studies in the past. However, these studies had restricted oxidation mechanisms that mostly underrepresented important aqueous-phase chemical processes. These neglected but highly effective processes strongly impact direct product yields of DMS oxidation, thereby affecting the climatic influence of aerosols. To address these shortfalls, an extensive multiphase DMS chemistry mechanism, the Chemical Aqueous Phase Radical Mechanism DMS Module 1. 0, was developed and used in detailed model investigations of multiphase DMS chemistry in the marine boundary layer. The performed model studies confirmed the importance of aqueous-phase chemistry for the fate of DMS and its oxidation products. Aqueous-phase processes significantly reduce the yield of sulfur dioxide and increase that of methyl sulfonic acid (MSA), which is needed to close the gap between modeled and measured MSA concentrations. Finally, the simulations imply that multiphase DMS oxidation produces equal amounts of MSA and sulfate, a result that has significant implications for nss-SO 42 − aerosol formation, cloud condensation nuclei concentration, and cloud albedo over oceans. Our findings show the deficiencies of parameterizations currently used in higher-scale models, which only treat gas-phase chemistry. Overall, this study shows that treatment of DMS chemistry in both gas and aqueous phases is essential to improve the accuracy of model predictions...|$|E
