Influence of temperature on strength and elasticity modulus of granite appeared until at higher temperatures (above 500 Â°C) and more noticeable changes of physical properties were observed for <b>shock</b> <b>tempering</b> specimens...|$|E

When I saw {{you a couple of}} days ago I knew in an instant that you were my affinity. But for years I had been looking for a woman almost your exact opposite. You are dark. Three days ago I couldn't have imagined myself marrying anyone who was not fair. Your eyes are grey. Three days ago my preference for blue eyes was a byword. You have a <b>shocking</b> <b>temper.</b> Three days ago--' ...|$|R
60|$|That night passed {{very ill}} for the love-lorn George. Angela's {{vigorous}} and imaginative expression of her entire loathing of him had pierced even the thick hide of his self-conceit, {{and left him}} sore as a whipped hound, altogether too sore to sleep. When Lady Bellamy arrived on the following morning, she found him marching {{up and down the}} dining-room, in the worst of his bad tempers, and that was a very <b>shocking</b> <b>temper</b> indeed. His light blue eyes were angry and bloodshot, his general appearance slovenly to the last degree, and a red spot burned upon each sallow cheek.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{turned back}} {{again from the}} door. To {{describe}} Tommie was a labor of love. [...] "He {{is the most beautiful}} dog in the world!" [...] the girl began, with kindling eyes. [...] "He has the most exquisite white curly hair and two light brown patches on his back--and, oh! such lovely dark eyes! They call him a Scotch terrier. When he is well his appetite is truly wonderful--nothing comes amiss to him, sir, from pate de foie gras to potatoes. He has his enemies, poor dear, though you wouldn't think it. People who won't put up with being bitten by him (what <b>shocking</b> <b>tempers</b> one does meet with, to be sure!) call him a mongrel. Isn't it a shame? Please come in and see him, sir; my Lady will be tired of waiting." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{were talking}} after dinner in that cozy {{moment when the}} {{conversation}} has ripened, just before the coffee, into mocking guesses and laughing suggestions. The thing they were talking of was something that would have held them apart if less happily timed and placed, but then and there it drew these together in what most of them felt a charming and flattering intimacy. Not all of them {{took part in the}} talk, and of those who did, none perhaps assumed to talk with authority or finality. At first they spoke of the subject as it, forbearing to name it, as if the name of it would convey an unpleasant <b>shock,</b> out of <b>temper</b> with the general feeling.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} empirical analysis of automatic fiscal stabilizers, such as the income tax and unemployment insurance benefits. Using the modern theory of consumption behavior, we identify several channels [...] insurance effects, wealth effects and liquidity constraints- -through which the optimal reaction of household consumption plans to aggregate income <b>shocks</b> is <b>tempered</b> by the automatic fiscal stabilizers. In addition we identify a cash flow channel for investment. The empirical importance of automatic stabilizers is addressed in several ways. We estimate elasticities of the various federal taxes {{with respect to their}} tax bases and responses of certain components of federal spending to changes in the unemployment rate. Such estimates are useful for analysts who forecast federal revenues and spending; the estimates also allow high- employment or cyclically-adjusted federal tax receipts and expenditures to be estimated. Using frequency domain techniques, we confirm that the relationships found in the time domain are strong at the business cycle frequencies. Using the FRB/US macro-econometric model of the United States economy, the automatic fiscal stabilizers are found to play a modest role at damping the short-run effect of aggregate demand shocks on real GDP, reducing the "multiplier" by about 10 percent. Very little stabilization is provided {{in the case of an}} aggregate supply shock. Economic stabilization; Business cycles...|$|R
