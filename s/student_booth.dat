50|$|The tape {{recorders}} in use after the early 1970s {{in the language}} laboratory were more complex {{than those in the}} home, being capable of multitracking and electronic remote control. As a result, they often had several motors and relays, complex transistorised circuitry and needed a variety of voltages to run. They had lots of rubber parts such as idlers and drive belts which would perish and wear out. Bulbs in the control panels were also in continual need of replacement. Since the <b>student</b> <b>booth</b> tapes were not normally changed from one class to the next but were recorded over each time, these would eventually wear, and shed their oxide on the tape heads leading to poor sound and tangling.|$|E

40|$|How do {{differences}} in prior conceptual knowledge affect {{the nature and}} rate of learning? To answer this question, we built a computational model of learning, called SimStudent, and conducted a controlled simulation study to investigate how learning a complex skill changes when the system is given “weak ” domain-general vs. “strong ” domain-specific prior knowledge. We measured SimStudent’s learning outcomes as the rate of learning, the accuracy of learned skills (test scores), and the fit to the pattern of errors made by real students. We found that when the “weak ” prior knowledge is given, not only the accuracy of learned skills decreases, but also the learning rate significantly slows down. The accuracy of predicting student errors increased significantly – namely, SimStudent with the weak prior knowledge made the same errors that real students commonly make. These modeling results help explain empirical results connecting prior knowledge and <b>student</b> learning (<b>Booth</b> & Koedinger, 2008) ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{collective}} {{originated in}} 1969 with University of Chicago <b>student</b> Heather <b>Booth,</b> who helped her friend's sister find an abortion provider. The founders of Jane initially focused {{their attention on}} providing women access to competent physicians willing to provide abortion services. They found a physician they called [...] "Mike" [...] {{who was willing to}} work with them. After creating a close relationship with Mike they found out that he actually wasn't really a physician and some Jane activists have characterized him as a [...] "con man." [...] However, many of the techniques he used were safe and effective. The women of Jane then decided to cut out the middleman and perform the abortions themselves. Mike taught the women his technique, and from then on the women performed the abortions themselves. The women were taught several methods, such as the cannula method for early stage abortions, and the super coil method used in later stage abortions which caused the women to miscarry, but the most widely used was the D&C (dilation and curettage) method. The D&C method involved the opening of the cervix and the insertion of a curette that was used to scrape the walls of the uterus to extract the fetus and placenta.|$|R
40|$|Hub Central {{is an area}} of 10, 500 {{square metres}} that has built its own unique {{community}} that embraces diverse interaction and supports the first year experience. Students were used in the co-creation of a space that has been designed to promote academic achievement by enhancing the student experience. By reflecting on their own needs, roles and contributions, a space has been delivered that is multifunctional, allows repurposing and fosters students developing their own approaches to interaction. A space largely with a philosophy of self management by students and filled with staff that are student centric has resulted in a community with an overall heightened sense of awareness and empathy towards the goals of their peers. The Hub includes 11 bookable student project rooms, 13 <b>student</b> projects <b>booths,</b> 290 fixed <b>student</b> computers, training rooms, Wi-Fi, a student kitchen, 3 commercial food outlets, a general store, the Maths Learning, PASS and Writing Centres and Student and IT Support Services operating extended hours (8 am to 10 pm weekdays, 10 am to 5 pm weekends). The collocation of all this has provided a greater feeling of belonging and encouraged the students to interact in diverse groups beyond the classroom. The paper aims to provide real world examples to encourage discussion of how ‘space’ can be designed and utilised for fostering a sense of belonging for first year students. Hedley Reberge...|$|R
