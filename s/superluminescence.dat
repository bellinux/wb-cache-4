50|$|Amplified {{spontaneous}} emission (ASE) or <b>superluminescence</b> is light, produced by {{spontaneous emission}}, {{that has been}} optically amplified {{by the process of}} stimulated emission in a gain medium. It is inherent in the field of random lasers.|$|E
50|$|A superluminescent diode (SLED or SLD) is an edge-emitting {{semiconductor}} {{light source}} based on <b>superluminescence.</b> It combines the high power and brightness of laser diodes with the low coherence of conventional light-emitting diodes. Its emission band is 5-100 nm wide.|$|E
50|$|Nitrogen lasers {{can operate}} within a {{resonator}} cavity,but {{due to the}} typical gain of 2 every 20 mm they more often operateon <b>superluminescence</b> alone;though {{it is common to}} put a mirror at one end such that the output is emitted from the opposite end.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 Dr. Gerard A. Alphonse at RCA Laboratories (now SRI International), {{invented the}} superluminescent diode. This light source was {{developed}} as a key component in the next generations of fibre optic gyroscopes, low coherence tomography for medical imaging, and external cavity tunable lasers with applications to fiber-optic communications. In 1989 the technology was transferred to GE-RCA in Canada, which became a division of EG&G. Superluminescent light emitting diodes are also called sometimes superluminescent diodes, <b>superluminescence</b> diodes or superluminescent LEDs.|$|E
50|$|The total optical power {{emitted by}} an SLED {{depends on the}} {{injected}} current (bias). Unlike laser diodes, the output intensity does not exhibit a sharp threshold but it gradually increases with current. A soft knee in the power vs. current curve defines a transition between a regime dominated by spontaneous emission (typical for surface emitting LEDs) {{and one that is}} dominated by amplified spontaneous emission (i.e. <b>superluminescence).</b> Even if the output power is based on spontaneous emission it has to be noted that the amplification mechanism affects the polarization state of the emitted radiation in a way which is related to the SLED structure and on the operating conditions.|$|E
50|$|The first HeNe lasers emitted {{infrared}} at 1.15 μm, {{and were}} the first gas lasers. However, a laser that operated at visible wavelengths was much more in demand, {{and a number of}} other neon transitions were investigated to identify ones in which a population inversion can be achieved. The 633 nm line was found to have the highest gain in the visible spectrum, making this the wavelength of choice for most HeNe lasers. However other visible as well as infrared stimulated emission wavelengths are possible, and by using mirror coatings with their peak reflectance at these other wavelengths, HeNe lasers could be engineered to employ those transitions; this includes visible lasers appearing red, orange, yellow, and green. Stimulated emissions are known from over 100 μm in the far infrared to 540 nm in the visible. Because visible transitions have somewhat lower gain, these lasers generally have lower output efficiencies and are more costly. The 3.39 μm transition has a very high gain but is prevented from use in an ordinary HeNe laser (of a different intended wavelength) because the cavity and mirrors are lossy at that wavelength. However in high power HeNe lasers having a particularly long cavity, <b>superluminescence</b> at 3.39 μm can become a nuisance, robbing power from the stimulated emission medium, often requiring additional suppression. The best-known and most widely used HeNe laser operates at a wavelength of 632.8 nm, in the red part of the visible spectrum. It was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1962, 18 months after the pioneering demonstration at the same laboratory of the first continuous infrared HeNe gas laser in December 1960.|$|E

40|$|We report {{nonlinear}} optical {{investigation of}} green emission GaInN/GaN multi-quantum structures grown along c- and m-axes on sapphire and bulk GaN substrates, respectively. Under intense pulsed photo excitation, we observed strong <b>superluminescence</b> near the lasing condition in c-plane grown quantum well structures with full width at half maximum of 6 nm. The <b>superluminescence</b> couples {{out of the}} edge of the sample in a mode pattern consistent with gain in a high mode of the waveguide. The wavelength of the <b>superluminescence</b> is 474 nm. The threshold intensity of <b>superluminescence</b> was found to be 156 kW/cm 2. Increasing pump intensity leads to a strong photoluminescence blueshift as large as 380 meV in samples grown along the c-axis on sapphire substrate, while under the same excitation conditions, the blue shift for the m-axis grown structure on bulk GaN substrate is less than 10 meV. The large emission blueshift is hereby attributed to the internal piezoelectric field in the c-axis grown structure. Its absence in the m-axis structure could enable low threshold current visible laser diodes...|$|E

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} experimentally that the intrinsic modulation response of injection lasers {{can be modified}} by reducing mirror reflectivities, which leads to suppression of relaxation oscillation resonance and a reduction of nonlinear distortions up to multi-GHz frequencies. A totally flat response with a 3 -dB bandwidth of 5 GHz was obtained using antireflection coated buried heterostructure lasers fabricated on a semi-insulating substrate. Harmonic distortions were below 40 dB within the entire 3 -dB bandwidth. These results are in accord with theoretical predictions based on an analysis which include the effects of <b>superluminescence</b> in the laser cavity...|$|E

To achieve high power <b>superluminescence,</b> we utilize an ultrastrong coupling QC laser design, and employ a cavity {{formed by the}} combination of a 17 degrees tilted cleaved facet and a wet etched rounded and sloped facet to introduce additional mirror loss. For pulsed mode operation, a 8 mm long and 15 mu m wide device achieves similar to 1. 3 mW peak power at 300 K and a 25 mu m wide device with Si 3 N 4 anti-reflection coated rounded facet achieves similar to 10. 2 mW peak optical output power at 250 K.

40|$|International audienceThe {{spectra of}} {{spontaneous}} and stimulated luminescence of Lu(2) O(3) : Eu (7 at %) nanopowders at different optical pumping intensities have been investigated. The obtained results-changes {{in the shape}} of the red luminescence spectra and in the lifetime of the (5) D(0) excited state of Eu(3 +) ions-indicate the onset of <b>superluminescence</b> with an increase in the excitation power. It has been found that an increase in the optical pumping intensity leads to a decrease in the luminescence decay time of the Lu(2) O(3) : Eu (7 at %) phosphor in the stimulated luminescence regime and to an increase in the quantum efficiency of red luminescence with a maximum at 611 nm...|$|E
40|$|We propose and {{investigate}} a high power <b>superluminescence</b> diode (SLD) as a pulsed seed source for a highly dynamic and versatile pulse fiber amplifier system. The SLD provides, contrary to conventional Fabry-P,rot laser diodes, a smooth and broad output spectrum which {{is independent of}} the input pulse parameters. The output pulses from the SLD are as short as 10 ns with up to 150 mW peak power. Moreover, the pulses can be directly shaped by modulating the injection current of the SLD. Pulse shaping in an amplifier configuration is demonstrated without the observation of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) due to the provided spectral bandwidth of 10 nm FWHM. Further spectral shaping was realized with a band pass filter in the amplifier chain...|$|E

40|$|The {{homogeneity}} test of glass plates in a Fizeau interferometer requires {{the measurement of}} the glass sample in reflected {{as well as in}} transmitted light. For the measurement in transmitted light, the sample has to be inserted into the ray path of a Fizeau or Twyman-Green interferometer, which leads to a nested cavity setup. To separate the interference signals from the different cavities, we illuminate a Fizeau interferometer with an adaptive frequency comb. In this way, rigid glass plates can be measured, and linear variations in the homogeneity can also be detected. The adaptive frequency comb is provided by a variable Fabry-Perot filter under broadband illumination from a <b>superluminescence</b> diode. Compared to approaches using a two-beam interferometer as a filter for the broadband light source, the visibility of the fringe system is considerably higher.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Typical {{power outputs}} of commercially {{available}} diode lasers {{are on the}} order of 5 milliwatts. This thesis discusses the growth, processing and fabrication of high power (lOO's of milliwatts) diode lasers. Devices were grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). The MOCVD diode lasers demonstrated room temperature laser operation with peak output powers of 450 mW/facet pulsed mode. The MBE diode lasers demonstrated room temperature pulsed laser operation of 110 mW/facet. The dynamics of the quantum well structure were studied. The carrier concentration, threshold current density and coatings were modeled. It was demonstrated through transmission line analogies that, depending on the thickness of the high reflective coating, the result would be a high output power diode laser or a superluminescent device. The MBE device was coated with a high power coating resulting in a peak power of 450 mW. The MOCVD device was used to study the <b>superluminescence</b> resulting from specific coatings...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{optoelectronic}} threshold effects arising under intensive stimulated radiative recombina­tion of hot dense electron-hole plasma (EHP) {{in a thin}} (~ 1 um) epitaxial layer of GaAs has been revealed. These effects' build-up and decay time intervals are of ~ 10 ps or less at room temperature (which {{makes it possible to}} modulate the optical and electrical properties of semiconductor heterostructures and devices with a frequency of ~ 100 GHz). These effects are observed when the stimulated recombination emission appears in picoseconds. The emission intensity can be as high as ~ 108 W/cm 2 and the EHP concentration can change several times by magnitude. The revealed class of optoelectronic effects has its origin in strong mutual influence between the stimulated emission and dynamical processes in dense EHP. The acquired knowledge of somewhat uncommon mechanism of changes of EHP concentration and temperature, of in­tensity and spectrum of stimulated emission, of the gain, transparency, band-gap width, etc. can be used for successful construction of semiconductor high-speed powerful optoelectronic devices (such as semi­conductor lasers and <b>superluminescence</b> diodes, semiconductor light-wave converters, modulators of the optical transparency and photoconductivity 7...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} studies {{focusing}} on the III-nitride deep-ultraviolet (DUV) edge-emitting laser and vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) based on metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) are elaborated. Transverse electric (TE) -dominant DUV edge-emitting lasing with a low threshold was demonstrated on the bulk AlN substrate. DUV surface <b>superluminescence</b> was achieved from the AlGaN heterostructure on the sapphire substrate. Furthermore, the temperature dependence study indicated that the high temperature growth did not necessarily lead to the AlN/sapphire template with better material quality. Based on that, the optimized recipe was developed to grow the high quality AlN/sapphire template {{without the use of}} high temperature, epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO), and pulse atomic layer epitaxy (PALE) methods. Thus the recipe is simple which can be transferred to most of the III-nitride MOCVDs. In addition, state-of-the-art optically-pumped edge-emitting DUV lasers with record-low thresholds and record-short wavelengths were demonstrated on the optimized AlN/sapphire templates. The first optical polarization switching of DUV lasing on any given substrate was observed. Moreover, the growth of single-phase wurtzite BAlN layers with high-B contents and large thicknesses were demonstrated for the distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) application. These works have notable significance in the pursuit of electrically-pumped DUV edge-emitting and surface-emitting laser diodes (LDs). Ph. D...|$|E
