40|$|Abstract—Heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} (HSPGs) are potent regulators of vascular remodeling and repair. Heparanase is {{the major}} enzyme capable of degrading heparan sulfate in mammalian cells. Here we examined the role of heparanase in controlling arterial <b>structure,</b> <b>mechanics,</b> and remodeling. In vitro studies supported that heparanase expression in endothelial cells serves as a negative regulator of endothelial inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) proliferation. Arterial structure and remodeling to injury were also modified by heparanase expression. Transgenic mice overexpressing heparanase had increased arterial thickness, cellular density, and mechanical compliance. Endovascular stenting studies in Zucker rats demonstrated increased heparanase expression in the neointima of obese, hyperlipidemic rats in comparison to lean rats. The extent of heparanase expression within the neointima strongly correlated with the neointimal thickness following injury. To test the effects of heparanase overexpression on arterial repair, we developed a novel murine model of stent injury using small diameter self-expanding stents. Using this model, we found that increased neointimal formation and macrophage recruitment occurs in transgenic mice overexpressing heparanase. Taken together, these results support a role for heparanase in the regulation of arterial <b>structure,</b> <b>mechanics,</b> and repair. (Circ Res. 2009; 104 : 380 - 387.)

Methods: In this cross-sectional and descriptive-analytic study, organization {{structure and}} organizational creation questionnaires were filled out by hospital managers. According to the statistical consultation and due to limited target population, the entire study population was considered as sample. Thus, the sample size in this study was 84 (12 hospitals and every hospital, n= 7). For data analysis, SPSS 14 was used and Spearman correlation coefficient and t-test were used. Results: Results showed that there is a negative association between centralization and complexity with organizational creation and its dimensions. Also there was a negative association between formalization and 4 organizational creation dimensions: reception change, accepting ambiguity, abet new view and less control outside (p= 0. 001).

Taking advantage of the availability of the exact solution, we compare the accuracy and other numerical properties of the eigenvalue method with those of existing numerical schemes. The comparsion shows that, overall, the eigenvalue method appears to be fairly attractive. Furthermore, only a few dominant eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors need to be computed and retained to yield reasonably high accuracy.

40|$|The {{collagen}} molecule, {{which is}} the building block of collagen fibrils, is a triple helix of two ? 1 (I) chains and one ? 2 (I) chain. However, in the severe mouse model of osteogenesis imperfecta (OIM), deletion of the COL 1 A 2 gene results in the substitution of the ? 2 (I) chain by one ? 1 (I) chain. As this substitution severely impairs the <b>structure</b> and <b>mechanics</b> of collagen-rich tissues at the tissue and organ level, the main {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how the <b>structure</b> and <b>mechanics</b> are altered in OIM collagen fibrils. Comparing results from atomic force microscopy imaging and cantilever-based nanoindentation on collagen fibrils from OIM and wild-type (WT) animals, we found a 33 % lower indentation modulus in OIM when air-dried (bound water present) and an almost fivefold higher indentation modulus in OIM collagen fibrils when fully hydrated (bound and unbound water present) in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) compared with WT collagen fibrils. These mechanical changes were accompanied by an impaired swelling upon hydration within PBS. Our experimental and atomistic simulation results show how the <b>structure</b> and <b>mechanics</b> are altered at the individual collagen fibril level as a result of collagen gene mutation in OIM.
