40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of a design methodology for vehicle safety design to comply with the different side impact crash regulations that are used around the world. The main differences of each side impact tests and potential influences on vehicle design were identified. Door intrusion velocity, door trim component stiffness and <b>seat</b> <b>airbag</b> were selected as three design variables. Sled test finite element models based on the Heidelberg buck sled test set-up were developed to investigate the sensitivity of three design factors to the occupant injury in both moving deformable barrier test and oblique pole test load conditions. Occupant injury response variations were assessed at different levels of the design factors. From the simulation results, for moving deformable barrier test, there is a balance between limiting the thorax injury and abdominal injury. For the Oblique pole test, the simulation results show that the padding system development may be more effective than the vehicle structure enhancement. Design guidelines that would enable vehicles to comply with different side impact tests were extracted based on the simulation results...|$|E

50|$|Laredo: The Laredo {{served as}} the {{entry-level}} Grand Cherokee model. It offered a plentiful array of features, including an A/M-F/M radio with single-disc CD player (later, an auxiliary audio input jack was also added), seventeen-inch alloy wheels, power windows, door locks, side mirrors, and driver's seat, lumbar support, keyless entry with security system, cloth seating surfaces, tinted windows, and six speakers. Features such as leather seating surfaces, heated front <b>seats,</b> side <b>airbags,</b> a Boston Acoustics premium sound system, a navigation system and a CD and MP3 changer, {{as well as a}} CD/MP3/Cassette combo could be added to further enhance this model.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{features}} {{included a}} new, more powerful 3.0-litre straight six 7M-GE engine producing [...] at 6,000 rpm and 185 lb-ft (250 Nm) at 4,400 rpm. As with the powertrain, most other mechanicals were modified versions {{of those in}} the Supra, most notably the new double-wishbone rear suspension. Standard equipment included power windows and locks, cruise control, a tilt-telescoping steering wheel, and a four-speed automatic transmission. Options included antilock brakes, a power driver's seat, leather upholstery, power moonroof, and a CD player. Cressidas of this generation sold in North America featured motorized automatic <b>seat</b> belts; <b>airbags</b> were never offered.|$|R
25|$|In an {{interview}} with retired GM board member Tom Everhart, the film points out that GM killed the EV1 to focus on more immediately profitable enterprises such as its Hummer and truck brands, instead of preparing for future challenges. Ralph Nader, in a brief appearance, points out that auto makers usually only respond to government regulation {{when it comes to}} important advances whether <b>seat</b> belts, <b>airbags,</b> catalytic converters, mileage requirements or, by implication, hybrid/electric cars. The film suggests Toyota supported the production of Toyota Prius hybrid in part as a response to Bill Clinton's Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and other U.S. Government pressure that was later dropped.|$|R
50|$|The Ford EcoSport comes {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} features, including the latest Ford SYNC driver connect system, a unique voice command system co-developed with Microsoft. Advanced climate control and a centrally mounted LCD screen with SYNC controls are also included. Safety features include <b>Airbags,</b> <b>Seat</b> belts, anti-lock brakes (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP), electric power-assisted steering (EPAS) with Hill Launch Assist and rear parking sensors.|$|R
50|$|It {{is based}} on the Mégane Renault Sport 230 F1 Team R26, but it is 123 kg lighter. Weight {{reduction}} is achieved via the removal of the rear seats and <b>seat</b> belts, passenger <b>airbag</b> and curtain airbags (the driver's airbag remains), climate control (air conditioning remains as standard), rear wash/wipe and heated rear window, front fog lamps, headlamp washers, radio/CD player and most of the soundproofing.|$|R
5000|$|The Audi A4 {{offers many}} {{standard}} safety features, including Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) with {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS), side <b>airbags</b> in the <b>seats,</b> 'sideguard' curtain <b>airbags,</b> and its optional quattro four-wheel drive system. It also received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) [...] "Top Safety Pick For 2007". EuroNCAP crash test results from the B6 apply to the B7 model.|$|R
50|$|Data {{obtained}} from a crash simulation indicate the capability of the car body or guard rail structure to protect the vehicle occupants during a collision (and also pedestrians hit by a car) against injury. Important results are the deformations (for example, steering wheel intrusions) of the occupant space (driver, passengers) and the decelerations (for example, head acceleration) felt by them, which must fall below threshold values fixed in legal car safety regulations. To model real crash tests, today's crash simulations include virtual models of crash test dummies and of passive safety devices (<b>seat</b> belts, <b>airbags,</b> shock absorbing dash boards, etc.). Guide rail tests evaluate vehicle deceleration and rollover potential, as well as penetration of the barrier by vehicles.|$|R
