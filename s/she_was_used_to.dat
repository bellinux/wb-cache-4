5|$|The Soviets {{acquired}} the ship on 30 June 1922 and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> transport coal to Kronstadt. Barha No. 1 {{was transferred to}} the Baltic Fleet on 7 August 1925 for use as a coal hulk. She was renamed KP-3 on 1 January 1932, K-41999 on 12 July 1943 and VSN-491000 on 16 May 1949. The ship was discarded in the late 1950s, but was apparently not scrapped until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks later, on May 7, the Adelaide was {{chartered}} by the U.S. Navy {{and attached}} to the Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In that role, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> transport Federal troops in support of operations in North Carolina's Outer Banks, directed against the Confederate-held forts guarding Hatteras Inlet. Later that year, the Adelaide was returned to the Baltimore Steam Packet Company.|$|E
5|$|Ariadne {{served with}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet {{for the majority of}} her career. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> patrol the Heligoland Bight. On 28 August, the British Royal Navy attacked the patrol line, and in the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, a pair of battlecruisers attacked and sank Ariadne. Some 200 of her crew were killed in the battle; only 59 survivors were pulled from the sea.|$|E

5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump {{the water out of}} her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> lay {{mines in}} the North Sea, to provide gunfire support to ground troops, {{and as a}} convoy escort and {{training}} ship for cadets. She participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway in April 1940, Her wartime career ended in Kiel in April 1945, when British bombers badly damaged the ship {{while she was in}} dock for repairs. Her crew ran her aground to prevent her from sinking, and ultimately blew her up with demolition charges to prevent the Allies from capturing her in May. The wreck was eventually scrapped in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Nürnberg {{took part in}} the {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War without major incident. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> lay defensive minefields off the German coast. She was thereafter used to escort offensive mine-layers in the North Sea until she was torpedoed by a British submarine in December 1939. She was thereafter used as a training ship in the Baltic Sea for {{most of the rest of}} the war, apart from a short deployment to Norway from November 1942 to April 1943. In January 1945, she was assigned to mine-laying duties in the Skaggerak, but severe shortages of fuel permitted only one such operation.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} of the Great White Fleet ships, Kearsarge was modernized on her return. She was {{decommissioned}} at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 4 September 1909, and the modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of US$675,000. The ship received cage masts, new water-tube boilers, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders. She was recommissioned on 23 June 1915, and operated along the Atlantic coast. On 17 September she left Philadelphia to land a detachment of US Marines at Veracruz, Mexico, remaining there from 28 September 1915 to 5 January 1916. She then carried the Marines to New Orleans, Louisiana, before joining the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia on 4 February. Until the United States joined World War I, she trained naval militia from Massachusetts and Maine. During the war <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> train Armed Guard crews and naval engineers during cruises along the Atlantic seaboard. On 18 August 1918 Kearsarge rescued 26 survivors of the Norwegian barque Nordhav which had been sunk by , bringing them to Boston.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned in mid-1942, Musashi was {{modified}} {{to serve as}} the flagship of the Combined Fleet, and {{spent the rest of the}} year working up. The ship was transferred to Truk in early 1943 and sortied several times that year with the fleet in unsuccessful searches for American forces. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> transfer forces and equipment between Japan and various occupied islands several times in 1944. Torpedoed in early 1944 by an American submarine, Musashi was forced to return to Japan for repairs, during which the navy greatly augmented her anti-aircraft armament. She was present during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June, but did not come in contact with American surface forces. Musashi was sunk by an estimated 19 torpedo and 17 bomb hits from American carrier-based aircraft on 24 October 1944 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Over half of her crew was rescued. Her wreck was located in March 2015 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and his team of researchers.|$|E
50|$|As a {{physician}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> educate her patients {{as well as}} teach and train healthcare personnel. She thus initiated HealtheFoundation, a distance computer-based training program for healthcare workers {{in the developing world}} who are involved in the treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients. A first pilot of the program was shown at the International AIDS Conference in Barcelona in 2002.From that moment on, things proceeded quickly. From a one-woman idea HealtheFoundation became a leading educational organization on HIV healthcare.|$|R

5|$|Dvenadsat Apostolov {{was built}} by the Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 21 August 1889, {{launched}} on 13 September 1890, and sailed to Sevastopol for fitting out on 11 May 1892. She joined the fleet on 17 June 1893, {{but she was not}} fully ready for service until 1894. In 1895 <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> test a new system of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P. Ygrumov and also to evaluate the proper dimensions for anti-torpedo nets and their booms. For this last test torpedoes were fired at the ship with the anti-torpedo nets deployed. One gun, of an unknown calibre, burst in 1903, killing one man and wounding two others.|$|E
5|$|Following her commissioning, Nürnberg {{participated in}} the {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War; she completed her patrols without major incident and returned to Germany in mid-1937. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> lay defensive minefields off the German coast in the North Sea. She was thereafter used to escort offensive mine-layers in the North Sea until she was torpedoed by the British submarine Salmon on 13 December 1939. After repairs were completed in early 1940, Nürnberg returned to active duty as a training ship in the Baltic Sea. She performed this role {{for most of the}} rest of the war, apart from a short deployment to Norway from November 1942 to April 1943.

5|$|Griffin saw {{no action}} in the Japanese Indian Ocean raid in April, but was escorting convoys {{for most of her}} time in the Indian Ocean. In June she {{returned}} to the Mediterranean to escort another convoy to Malta in Operation Vigorous. Beginning in November 1942, she was converted to an escort destroyer in the United Kingdom and was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy on 1 March 1943. The ship, now renamed HMCS Ottawa, was assigned to escort convoys in the North Atlantic until she was transferred in May 1944 to protect the forces involved with the Normandy Landings. Working with other destroyers, Ottawa sank three German submarines off the French coast before she returned to Canada for a lengthy refit. After the end of the European war in May 1945 <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> bring Canadian troops until she was paid off in October 1945. Ottawa was sold for scrap in August 1946.|$|E

5|$|Louisiana {{primarily}} operated {{along the}} east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean during her career. In 190809, she took part in the world cruise of the Great White Fleet. A pair of trips to European waters took place in 1910 and 1911. From 1913, she began to become involved in the Mexican Revolution, as the US Navy began to send ships to protect American interests in the country. This activity culminated in the US occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. During World War I, Louisiana was employed as a training ship before serving as a convoy escort in late 1918. After the war ended that year, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> ferry American soldiers back from France. With this work completed, she was decommissioned in October 1920 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Sulhamstead Abbots, Nagle's {{family home}} in Berkshire, {{was used as a}} {{hospital}} during the First World War. There she met James Nagle, a native of Ireland who had emigrated to Canada but returned to serve with the King's Royal Rifle Corps and then had been sent to Sulhamstead Abbots to recuperate. Against her parents' wishes the couple were married on 1 July 1916, resulting in them threatening to disinherit her. The early days of Nagle's marriage were hard; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> a wealthy lifestyle– her family money came from her father's successful business, Maypole Dairies– but her parents offered the couple no financial assistance. Nagle always worked hard and subsidised their income by making cream teas, cleaning windows and scrubbing toilets. The couple had two children, a son, David, and a daughter, Patricia.|$|E
5|$|From 1958 to 1960, opinion {{within the}} Australian {{military}} swung between reactivating Sydney as a fast troop transport ship and disposing of her. The Australian Army saw {{the need for}} such a vessel, particularly if war broke out in Southeast Asia: Australian forces would need to be rapidly deployed to the conflict, and sealift {{was the only way to}} effectively move the required number of personnel, equipment, and vehicles. However, the RAN did not want the cost of converting and maintaining Sydney coming from their share of the defence budget, as they felt there was no further use for her. As both strategic airlift and sealift with other naval or civilian vessels were unfeasible, Sydney was reactivated and converted into a fast troop transport ship during 1961 and 1962. All of her aircraft operating equipment was removed, her hangar was converted into accommodation and storage, and her armament was reduced to four single-mounted 40mm Bofors. Sydney was recommissioned as a Fast Troop Transport on 7 March 1962, given the pennant number A214, and assigned back to the training squadron. From April 1962 onwards, Sydney was used to train the ship's company and Army personnel for the troop transport role, while supplementing the RAN's regular training needs. The troopship first saw full use in her new role in August 1963, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> support an amphibious landing at Hervey Bay, Queensland during Exercise Carbine.|$|E
