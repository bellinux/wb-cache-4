40|$|The {{influence}} of the choice of <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> material on the iron loss in a high speed, high power permanent magnet generator, which is interfaced to a DC link via a simple bridge rectifier, is investigated. The rating of the generator is representative of machines which would be employed in 'more-electric' ships and for embedded power generation. It is shown that the iron loss can be reduced considerably by employing 6. 5 % SiFe laminations rather than 3 % SiFe. It is also shown that, due to the high harmonic content in the phase current waveforms, the iron loss density can vary widely over the <b>stator</b> <b>lamination...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flux-switching {{permanent}} magnet (FSPM) machine is {{consist of a}} salient rotor and a salient stator with windings and magnets. Adding <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> bridge in segmented stator can simplify stator assembly significantly, which will be beneficial to manufacture and popularize the FSPM machine. Due to the doubly salient structure, the cogging torque in FSPM is larger than other traditional PM motors. In this paper, cogging torque of FSPM with <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> bridge is analyzed, and a novel short magnet (SM) structure is proposed to reduce the cogging torque by shortening the magnets. The simulation results indicate that shortening magnets reasonably can reduce the cogging torque {{at the cost of}} little output torque loss...|$|E

The particular benefit of this process technology {{lies in the fact}} that the winding machine produces a completely winded assembly group when adequate electrical slot fill factors are employed. If, however, the use of single teeth requires joining and interconnecting operations, all interconnecting measures of the coil sections of one phase may be executed by the winding machine for the <b>stator</b> <b>laminations.</b> In this case, the electric slot fill factor may amount up to 45%. Since manufacturing a functioning stator merely requires a small effort, the negative impact on the electric fill factor is gladly accepted. In order to be able to use various additional functions of the winding machine, the end plates are often designed in a way which allows e.g. the taking on of cutting terminal contacts. In addition, winding space restrictions and laying ducts for the connecting wires of a phase may be integrated.The material costs are also low due to the small number of individual components. In combination with the modest costs of the means of production, <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> constitute a practical solution. Three essential basic concepts frequently come to the fore when dealing with the design of <b>stator</b> <b>laminations.</b> <b>Stator</b> <b>laminations</b> for concentrated winding are divided into the following main groups.|$|R
5000|$|Basically, {{there is}} also a variety of {{different}} ways of insulation for outside slotted <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> as it is for inside slotted stator laminations: ...|$|R
50|$|Outside slotted <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> may be {{processed}} with the needle-winding technique, the flyer-winding technique and the linear-winding technique. The {{selection of the}} process depends on the desired number of turns in the winding and the intended fill factors. Consequently, flyer-winding is particularly used if a thin wire and thus high numbers of windings are expected in combination with a medium and high voltage application. Therefore, it is typically used with “white goods”, such as e.g. household applications, or in general domestic engineering with an operating voltage of 230 V. In the case of stators with less windings and a lower mass, {{it is common to}} process outside slotted <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> using the needle-winding technique or the linear winding technique.|$|R

It is found that the modulation of the salient rotor to PM and armature reaction fields in SFPM machines is similar to that of the iron pieces to those fields in the magnetic gear and magnetically geared machine. The magnetic gearing effect is analyzed in SFPM machines with different stator/rotor pole combinations, winding configurations, and <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> segment types by a simple magnetomotive force-permeance model, and validated by finite-element (FE) analysis.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between a permanent magnet synchronous motor and an asynchronous motor is the rotor.

40|$|Permanent magnet {{synchronous}} motors (PMSMs) are exceptionally promising {{thanks to}} their many advantages compared {{with other types of}} electrical machines. Indeed, PMSMs are characterized by their important torque density, light weight, high air gap flux density, high acceleration, high efficiency and strong power-to-weight ratio. A surface-mounted PMSM (SPMSM) is used in this work. The SPMSM is built using a 2 D finite element method (FEM). Cogging torque, torque ripples and back-EMF are examined during the design process in order to obtain sinusoidal back-EMF and to minimise torque ripples which are one of the major problems with PMSMs. Two procedures are used to reduce the cogging torque of SPMSM: the effect of slot opening and the influence of skewing the <b>stator</b> <b>laminations.</b> Cogging torque factor tc and the torque ripples factor tr have been calculated to compare the two configurations (open slots and closed slots). Then, the configuration with closed slots is utilised with skewing the <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> for different angle 0 °, 10 ° and 15 °...|$|R
40|$|A new {{arrangement}} for the <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> of electric motors is presented which improves machine cooling. The arrangement is illustrated with static and dynamic {{comparisons between the}} new and the old arrangements of a 4 -phase switched reluctance motor. The <b>stator</b> <b>laminations,</b> all of one design, are designed to provide either radially or axially oriented external cooling fins when stacked. The effective increase in heat dissipative surface area increases the full load output capacity, for a given copper winding temperature rise above ambient. The static test, with the rotor held stationary and a DC current fed to all phases, shows that for the same temperature increase of the copper parts above the ambient, the RMS phase current can be increased. When the motor is mechanically loaded, keeping the speed constant such that windage and friction losses are fixed, an improvement in the efficiency has been obtained for a given copper temperature rise.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present {{comparative}} analysis of several configurations of the switched reluctance motor (SRM) for an in-wheel drive for a heavy-duty automotive series hybrid system. The SRM motor is regarded as one of the primary candidates for possible replacement of the permanent magnet (PM) motor. Design/methodology/approach – Three SRMs of 10 / 8, 12 / 10 and 12 / 8 configurations have been analysed, where the last two motors had the <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> profile taken from the existing PM motor. The analysis is performed using magnetostatic FEM and transient modelling techniques. Findings – The maximum developed electromagnetic torque of the two analysed motors of 12 / 10 and 12 / 8 SRM configurations with the <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> profile taken from the existing PM motor is limited due to saturation of the stator yoke. Both motor configurations are capable to provide the specified power within the same outer dimensions due to extended speed in the field-weakening region and position independent starting torque. A redesigned stator results in substantial increase in torque developed by the machine and, consequently, ability to provide similar torque-speed performance as the existing PM motor, at cost of increased copper loss at the low-speed regime. Originality/value – The paper proposes several structures of SRMs for the in-wheel drive for a heavy-duty automotive series hybrid system converted from the present expensive PM machine, having the same power density. The 2 ̆ 2 bottleneck 2 ̆ 2 of the direct conversion of the PM machine into the SRM is highlighted...|$|E
50|$|For {{segmented}} stator coils, {{a distinction}} is made between T-segments and plugged engine coils. The latter may be bodiless or winded onto a coil body and subsequently {{be transferred to}} a T-segment or directly to the <b>stator</b> <b>laminations,</b> depending on the application. Contingent on the expected contact points, there are three different options {{for the production of}} T-segments.For one, there is the classic single T-segment with the disadvantage of having a high number of contact points. In addition, there is the phase winded T-segment with a reduced number of contact points. Finally, there is also the winding of so-called pole chains with a drastically reduced number of contact points.|$|R

Mentioned metal sheets are very hard which leads to higher demands on cutting blades. The optimal method chosen, as based on studies of relevant literature, was ion nitriding which provides increase in surface hardness to 64 HRC. Increase in surface hardness while also preserving the toughness of the core was further confirmed by an experimental measurement of hardness, which was measured on two samples.

40|$|Rim driven {{thrusters}} with structurally integrated brushless PM motors are now {{an established}} technology with an increasing range of applications. In these thrusters, the stator {{of the motor}} is housed within the thruster duct, and the rotor forms a ring around {{the tips of the}} propeller. Such high pole number motors tend to be very thin radialy, have very small length to diameter ratios, and have relatively large airgaps to accommodate corrosion protection layers on the surfaces of the rotor and stator. The relatively large diameter <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> of such machines tend therefore to have very thin back of core and narrow teeth, which make them expensive and difficult to manufacture. This paper proposes an alternative potentially lower cost motor topology featuring a slotless <b>stator</b> whose <b>laminations</b> are manufactured from a single strip of steel that is edge wound into a spiral (like a “slinky ” and then fitted over the windings that are preformed on the outside surface of a non-conducting former. The former is also part of the sealed housing that protects the stator from corrosion in seawater. The paper discusses the design optimisation of such a motor using analytical and finite element analysis (FEA), describes a demonstrator motor and reports experimental and FEA results. ...|$|R

Therefore automotive alternator performance becomes increasingly important {{to meet the}} requirements. Many proposed methods have suggested adding magnets or regulation control to increase alternator efficiency and output. However, this creates a significant additional cost. During the <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> process, the magnetic property of the stator deteriorates mainly due to stamping and slinky process for an alternator. To maximize the alternator performance, heat treatment of the stator core was performed and magnetic properties were compared to find the optimal condition.

The effect of the phase advance angle between the back electromotive force, and the phase current on rotor eddy current power loss is investigated. Both magnet flux tooth ripple and magnetomotive force harmonics are considered in the analytical calculation of rotor loss; the harmonics of the magnet tooth ripple flux and armature reaction flux are added vectorially. Good agreement between analytical and FEA results is observed when the <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> are assumed to have a linear BH curve.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple procedure for acoustic noise reduction in {{switched reluctance motor}} (SRMs). Radial forces between rotor and stator teeth cause a vibration of <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> and windings. The vibrations lead to acoustic noise. The radial forces can {{be determined by the}} two-dimensional finite element method (FEM). The magnitude of the acoustic noise at any operating speed is calculated by an analytical mode which depends on the radial forces and circumferential deflection. The calculation, simulation and measurement results are useful to improve stator and rotor poles with acoustic noise reduction. Moreover, {{it is important for the}} SRM to avoid the mechanical resonant frequency. If the electric frequency equals mechanical resonant frequency, the vibration and acoustic noise is extremely high and destroys the mechanical structure of the high speed motor...|$|R

Three motors were designed with different interior permanent magnet rotor configurations with the same <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> and were analyzed using a combination FEA dq -axis circuit model. The results show that the performance characteristics affected by the rotor configuration were synchronous and reluctance torque production, torque ripple, efficiency and parameter variation. The V-shaped rotor configuration produced the most torque at 70 Nm. The Flat rotor configuration had the second highest torque production at 67 Nm. The Radial rotor configuration had the highest efficiency but had the highest torque ripple. The parameter variation had an effect on the reluctance torque production capabilities of each rotor configuration due to the saturation in the machines...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{noise in}} the {{switched}} reluctance motor (SRM) is caused primarily by the deformation of the <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> stack. Acoustic noise is most severe when the periodic excitation of the SRM phases excites a natural vibration mode of the stack. The natural vibration modes and frequencies of a four-phase, 8 / 6 SRM are examined. Structural finite element analysis is used to compute the natural modes and frequencies. Impulse tests on the stator stack verify the calculations and show which modes are excited. Heuristic arguments are developed to predict the operating conditions that will excite the natural modes. Measurement of vibration while the machine is under load shows which operating conditions excite the natural modes and verifies the predictions. An approximate formula is derived to predict {{the frequency of the}} fundamental vibration mode in terms of lamination dimensions and material properties. The formula is validated by comparison with finite element calculations for several laminations, and hence is shown to be useful in design trade-off studies...|$|E
40|$|Copyright 2007 IEEEA new {{magnetic}} circuit model is presented for an interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machine, using a machine with three-phase distributed stator windings and three layers of flux barriers in the rotor {{as an example}} topology. The model accounts for: i) the effects of cross-coupled magnetic saturation caused by the salient rotor; ii) variation of magnetic saturation levels in the iron rotor bridges that are key elements of the unitary rotor laminations; iii) the effects of <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> slots on the airgap mmf distribution; and iv) the local variation of airgap permeance due to the stator slotting and the relative position of the rotor {{with respect to the}} stator. As a result of these features, the new model is capable of significantly improving the accuracy of electromagnetic performance predictions for aggressively-designed IPM machines compared to previously-available {{magnetic circuit}} models.

This paper compares several kinds of machines with the same <b>stator</b> <b>lamination</b> but with different numbers of phases; three-, five-, and seven-phase PM machines are considered. Several winding configurations are compared, changing the number of poles but maintaining {{the same number of}} slots.

In some cases, the contact can occur due to internal or external transient effects including sudden mass loss and base excitation due to external loads, even when the magnetic bearings are operative. When the contact occurs, the system enters a highly nonlinear state and controllers, which are designed to deal with synchronous vibrations, may not cope with this new situation and worsen the rotor response.

40|$|Magnetic bearing systems {{incorporate}} auxiliary bearings {{to prevent}} physical interaction between rotor and <b>stator</b> <b>laminations.</b> Rotor/auxiliary bearing contacts may occur when a magnetic bearing still retains a full control capability. To actively return the rotor to a non-contacting state {{it is essential}} to determine the manner in which contact events affect the rotor vibration signals used for position control. An analytical procedure is used to assess the nature of rotor contact modes under idealized contacts. Non-linearities arising from contact and magnetic bearing forces are then included in simulation studies involving rigid and flexible rotors to predict rotor response and evaluate rotor synchronous vibration components. An experimental flexible rotor/magnetic bearing facility is also used to validate the predictions. It is shown that changes in synchronous vibration amplitude and phase induced by contact events causes existing controllers to be ineffective in attenuating rotor displacements. These findings are used in Part 2 of the paper as a foundation for the design of new controllers that are able to recover rotor position control under a range of contact cases...|$|R
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) offer contact-free and frictionless {{support of}} rotating machinery. However, {{because of their}} limited force capacity, they have to incorporate retainer bearings to protect the rotor and <b>stator</b> <b>laminations</b> against high-amplitude vibration levels. Efficient modeling of contact dynamics {{is important for the}} design of adaptive controllers to prevent contact. If, however, contact does occur, it is necessary to recover the rotor position with minimum damage and without shutting down the system. This paper utilizes constrained Lagrangian equations of motion to develop a computationally efficient method to model contact dynamics. The method does not require a direct physical modeling of contact forces, although the contact forces are automatically evaluated from the constraint conditions, and it can be applied to multicontact cases. Furthermore, the technique is capable of detecting and simulating the destructive backward whirl rolling motion. A model reduction technique is introduced to improve the computational efficiency. This is demonstrated by comparing numerical predictions with experimental results, obtained for a 2 -m-long flexible rotor supported by two magnetic bearings...|$|R
