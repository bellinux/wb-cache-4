5|$|Tatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4, 1942. His {{stay there}} was {{probably}} short, for his wife recorded that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed. Tatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife, now pregnant with their second child, {{where he would be}} assigned, but <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> he studied maps of the North Pacific area. At one point, he remarked to Taeko {{that he was going to}} an area where he might meet some of his former classmates from California.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Casson's uncle, Isambard Owen, {{vice-chancellor}} at University of Bristol, {{promised her}} a place studying medicine {{if she could}} be formally matriculated to the university. She struggled with her Latin exams for two years, but eventually passed them and registered to study medicine on 1 October 1913 {{at the age of}} 32. She graduated with her Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1919, and took on a role at the West Hertfordshire Hospital in Hemel Hempstead. There <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> patients in the women's wards were enjoying using artistic talents, and decided that such pursuits were important to treatment. She realised that these pursuits were not only keeping the patients occupied but also helping them gain self-esteem and work through their issues.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of taking}} clear stands on issues, Kelley creates {{scenarios}} meant to challenge audience preconceptions. For example, {{an episode of}} Ally McBeal dealt with a female employee who sued for sexual harassment because <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> other prettier women were being promoted. There was deliberately no clear point of view.|$|E

25|$|Always an {{independent}} person, Irene {{was thrilled to}} receive a sports car from her father, one of the gifts he had been presented with. Irene's happiness was short-lived; {{when she opened the}} hood of the automobile, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the car was sporting in appearance only, having an ordinary car's engine. She asked her father for permission to turn the vehicle into a true racing-type auto, which Prince Bernhard refused to allow.|$|E
25|$|In a BBC {{documentary}} about Purce, More Ways than One: The Mystic Spiral, she described how through contemplating the patterns in water <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> when flow encounters resistance, first it rotates, then these rotary patterns become individual eddies which separate out as independent forms. This {{observation of the}} form creating principal of flow, resistance, and rotation, became the basis of her research from 1968 to 1974 on {{the form of the}} spiral and the theme of the labyrinth in nature, science, art, psychology and sacred traditions.|$|E
25|$|In November 2007, a {{graduate}} student named S. A. Smith brought an apparent case of wholesale academic misuse of unlicensed content to public attention. <b>She</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> a video used by Dembski in his lecture was identical to The Inner Life of the Cell animation created by Harvard University and XVIVO Scientific Animation. The audio track giving a scientific explanation was stripped off and the video was used with an alternative narration. The matter {{was brought to the}} attention of Harvard and XVIVO. David Bolinsky, creator of the video, wrote that Dembski was warned about using the video without permission.|$|E

25|$|While {{working with}} the WSPU, Lucy Burns met Alice Paul at a London police station. Both women {{had been arrested for}} demonstrating, and Alice Paul {{introduced}} herself when <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> Lucy Burns was wearing an American flag pin on her lapel. The women discussed their suffrage experiences in the United Kingdom and the American women's movement. Burns and Paul bonded over their frustration with the inactivity and ineffective leadership of the American suffrage movement by Anna Howard Shaw. Their similar passions and fearlessness in the face of opposition made them quickly become good friends. Both women were passionate about activism, and the feminist struggle for equality in the UK inspired Burns and Paul to continue the fight in the United States in 1912.|$|E
25|$|According to the woman, {{another car}} pulled over {{and tried to}} help Bermúdez Zacarías by telling a nearby {{security}} officer to call the police. The eyewitness then made a U-turn and followed the alleged assassins in her car. Tho two men went into hiding in an abandoned lot a few blocks away. <b>She</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the lot was gated, {{and returned to the}} crime scene to see if any police officers had arrived. When the first policemen arrived, she reportedly told them that she saw two men walk into an abandoned lot. A third policemen went to inspect the lot, but came back to the murder scene after not seeing anything suspicious. The eyewitness complained to the press that the policemen were slow to act and may not have checked the abandoned lot thoroughly since she said there were several large bushes where the two men may have been hiding. A few days after her confession, the eyewitness stated that she was harassed by people who were presumably armed outside her home and in a vehicle.|$|E
500|$|Rathbun's brownie {{customers}} were mostly gay men. [...] When they first began {{coming down with}} AIDS in the early 1980s, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> cannabis helped them with the wasting syndrome; she also found this to be true of cancer patients. [...] People donated cannabis to Rathbun and she began baking brownies in the hundreds and distributing them to sick people free of charge. [...] Rathbun's monthly $650 Social Security check helped her to purchase baking supplies.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{marks the}} return of Ruth Evershed since her {{departure}} halfway through series five. Actress Nicola Walker left the series to raise her baby. When Walker was asked to return, she took [...] "about half a second to say yes." [...] Upon returning, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the Grid set changed since her initial departure. Because there was media coverage reporting Walker's return, the producers believed that the shock of her return would be hindered somewhat, but also believed only the [...] "die hard" [...] fans of the series would be aware of it. Ace Bhatti, who portrayed the episode's primary antagonist Amish Mani, was cast because the producers were impressed by his highly convincing and relaxed acting style, which they felt would establish {{his role in the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, {{the song}} is an [...] "advertisement {{for the rest of}} the album." [...] Chris Williams of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "flirty duet". Ben Thompson of The Guardian said: [...] "It has a hard to escape sense that all {{concerned}} are going through the motions [...] – effortlessly, sometimes brilliantly." [...] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe believed that {{the song is}} [...] "chart-topper for its sheer star power as well as instant musical allure, and on the eve of Madonna's 50th birthday [...] '4 Minutes' feels a lot like an icon's can't-miss gift to herself." [...] However, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "shift in the power structure [...] more blatant than on '4 Minutes', where Madonna sounds like a featured guest trying to keep pace with Timbaland's colossal beats and Timberlake's nimble melody." [...] Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post complimented the song for being busy and brassy. She commented: [...] "ropelled by a detonative marching-band beat [...] it's one of the most thrilling things Madonna has done in this decade." ...|$|E
500|$|Feminist writer Susan Bordo gave a {{negative}} {{review of the}} video, saying that the leering and pathetic men in the cubicles and Madonna's escape with the boy is [...] "cynically and mechanically tacked on [...] a way of claiming trendy status for what is just cheesecake– or, perhaps, pornography". MTV also had some reservations initially before airing the video, which was later resolved after a meeting with Warner Officials. However socio-critic Mary Harron in her book McRock: Pop as Commodity said that the underlying message in the video is that though Madonna sells sexuality, she is free. There is no overt representation of anything besides friendship with the boy. Their escape together avoids Madonna the sexual overtones {{that would have been}} stronger if she would have escaped with an adult male. This, according to author Richard Dienst, seems to suggest a repudiation of the adult labor of the stage in favor of childhood, androgyny, authenticity and nomadic play. The video is also acclaimed for reviving and re-creating the hard glamor of the studio-era of Hollywood stars and also for representing women as the dominant sex. Author Donn Welton pointed out that the usual power relationship between the [...] "voyeuristic male gaze and object" [...] is destabilized by the portrayal of the male patrons of the peep show as leering and pathetic. At the same time, the portrayal of Madonna as [...] "porno queen object" [...] is deconstructed by the escape {{at the end of the}} video. Maura Johnston from Rolling Stone found influences of the work of Italian film director Federico Fellini and American musical theater chroeographer Bob Fosse. Johnston added, [...] "'Open Your Heart' was gorgeous, from the paintings of art deco artist Tamara de Lempicka on the club exterior, to the colorfully cold cast of characters." [...] <b>She</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> at one point in the video, Madonna titled her head to re-create the Herb Ritts shot album cover for True Blue.|$|E

500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. <b>She</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E
2500|$|Enterobacteria phage λ (lambda phage, {{coliphage}} λ) is {{a bacterial}} virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E. coli). [...] It {{was discovered by}} Esther Lederberg in 1950 when <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> streaks of mixtures of two E. coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was [...] "nibbled and plaqued". The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.|$|E
2500|$|Jacqueline Noonan was {{practicing}} as a pediatric cardiologist at the University of Iowa when <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{children with a}} rare type of heart defect, valvular pulmonary stenosis, often had a characteristic physical appearance, with short stature, webbed neck, wide spaced eyes, and low-set ears. [...] Both boys and girls were affected. [...] These characteristics were sometimes seen running in families but were not associated with gross chromosomal abnormalities. [...] She studied 833 patients at the congenital heart disease clinic, looking for other congenital abnormalities, and in 1963 presented a paper: [...] "Associated non-cardiac malformations in children with congenital heart disease". This described 9 children who in addition to congenital heart disease had characteristic facial features, chest deformities and short stature.|$|E

2500|$|Michele Hernandez {{suggested}} {{that almost all}} admissions essays were weak, cliche-ridden, and [...] "not worth reading". The staff gets thousands of essays and have to wade through most of them. When she worked as an admissions director at Dartmouth, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> most essays were only read for three minutes. Some too-common essay types were the [...] "outward bound" [...] essay about how a person discovered their inner grit while hiking tough mountains, or the [...] "community service" [...] essay about how a student discovered, while working among disadvantaged peoples, that [...] "all persons were the same". Admissions officers seek to learn how a person thinks, {{what kind of person}} they are, and their level of intellectual promise. Essays are generally important only in borderline cases.|$|E
2500|$|Riko Tachibana {{was born}} in Tokyo on November 10, 1984. Tachibana is tall for a Japanese woman, {{reportedly}} standing 172cm (nearly 5' 8") in early publicity, though her height was later reported to be 168cm (5' 6"). Tachibana was not comfortable with her above-average size, saying, [...] "I {{used to have a}} real inferiority complex about my height. I always thought guys liked little girls better." [...] Tachibana's inferiority complex began to dwindle as <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> many men were attracted to her because of her height, wanting her to baby them. For example, when she was in a relationship with a high-level salaryman in his 30s, he asked her to pat his head while he lay in her lap, and tell him, [...] "Good boy, good boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{photographic}} curator Maya Benton {{began to}} catalog Vishniac's negatives for the archive of the International Center of Photography, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that,</b> {{in his book}} A Vanished World, Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and wrote captions that were {{not supported by the}} material. In the final spread of the book, for example, there is a photo of a man peering through a metal door; on the opposite page a small boy points with his finger to his eye. Vishiniac's caption reads: [...] "The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1935-1938." [...] At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: [...] "The pogromshchiki" [...] (pogrom lynch mob) [...] "are coming. But the iron door was no protection." [...] Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book [...] "almost certainly did not happen".|$|E

By this time, Edward has become noticeably antagonistic to his wife’s belief (perhaps spurred on by jealousy). Her plans are to tell the world, after which she believes that all the world's musicians will want to come and meet her cat. Edward thinks that her plans will make the two of them look like fools.|$|R
