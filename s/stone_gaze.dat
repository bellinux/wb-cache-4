60|$|Straight {{back to that}} {{baffling}} portal {{he dragged}} me, again taking up his position facing the blank <b>stone,</b> <b>gazing</b> straight at its shining surface. For an hour I worked {{to solve the mystery}} of the combination that would open the way before me.|$|R

60|$|Little Marianne was a {{delicate}} child, and her frolic {{did not last}} long. As the ascent became steeper, her breath grew shorter, and she toiled on in a resolute uncomplaining manner after his long, vigorous steps, till he looked round, and seeing her panting far behind, turned to help her, lead her, and carry her, till the top was achieved, {{and the little girl}} stood on the topmost <b>stone,</b> <b>gazing</b> round at the broad sunny landscape, with the soft green meadows, the harvest fields, the woods in their gorgeous autumn raiment, and the moorland on the other side, with its other peaks and cairns, brown with withered bracken, and shadowed in moving patches by the floating clouds. The exhilarating wind brought a colour into her pale cheeks, and her flossy curls were blowing over her face.|$|R
60|$|I {{think it}} was then that Freydisa returned; at least, I recall her tall form {{standing}} near the <b>stone</b> of sacrifice, <b>gazing</b> at us both, a strange smile on her face.|$|R
60|$|Then Babbie went away. The boy {{watched her}} across the hill. He climbed the Standing <b>Stone</b> and <b>gazed</b> after her until she was but a {{coloured}} ribbon among the broom. When she disappeared into Windyghoul he ran home, joyfully, and told his father what a good day's work he had done. Rob struck him for a fool for taking a gypsy's word, and warned him against speaking {{of the woman in}} Thrums.|$|R
60|$|Three or four {{strokes of}} the paddle drove the canoe {{out into the}} stream, and after that, {{all he had to}} do was to hold her straight. This was, however, not {{particularly}} easy, for the mad rush of water deflected by the boulders swung her here and there, and the channel was studded with foam-lapped masses of <b>stone.</b> <b>Gazing</b> forward, intent and strung-up, he checked her now and then with a feathering backstroke of the paddle, while the boulders flashed up toward her out of the spray, and the pines ashore reeled by. The foam stood high about the hollowed, upswept bow, and at times boiled a handbreadth above the depressed waist, but, while the canoe swept on like a toboggan, none came in. There was more than a spice of risk in it, and Ida, who knew what the result would be if her companion's nerve momentarily deserted him, now and then glanced over her shoulder. When she did so, he smiled reassuringly, leaning forward with wet hands clenched hard on the flashing paddle. She felt that he was to be relied on.|$|R
50|$|In {{her teenage}} years, Medusa learns of Stheno's murder from Euryale. Furious at the gods, Medusa decides to ascend Mount Olympus {{to get her}} revenge, without Euryale's knowledge. Upon arrival at the Temple of Athena, Medusa is met by Poseidon, who {{proceeds}} to overcome and subsequently rape her. Athena witnesses the act and curses Medusa, causing all mortals to turn to <b>stone</b> upon <b>gazing</b> at the Gorgon. Medusa returns to the caverns below, traumatised by the horrors that have befallen her.|$|R
60|$|While Glynn carried ashore some biscuit, {{which was}} the only thing in the boat they could eat without cooking, Ailie broke off some {{branches}} from the low bushes that covered the little rocky islet, and spread them out on a flat rock for a couch; this done, she stood {{on the top of a}} large <b>stone</b> and <b>gazed</b> round upon the calm surface of the beautiful lake, in the dark depths of which the stars twinkled as if there were another sky down there.|$|R
50|$|Perseus then flew to Seriphos, {{where his}} mother {{was about to be}} forced into {{marriage}} with the king. King Polydectes was turned into <b>stone</b> by the <b>gaze</b> of Medusa's head. Then Perseus gave the Gorgon's head to Athena, who placed it on her shield, the Aegis.|$|R
50|$|Euryale and {{her sister}} Stheno were immortal, whereas Medusa was mortal. In some {{versions}} of mythology, Euryale also {{had the ability to}} turn anyone to <b>stone</b> with her <b>gaze.</b> In many stories, Euryale is noted for her bellowing cries, particularly in the tale of Medusa's death at Perseus' hands.|$|R
60|$|There was {{an awkward}} silence for a moment, while all eyes turned curiously upon Louise, who served {{this side of the}} triangle. The girl {{appeared}} turned to <b>stone</b> as she <b>gazed</b> down at the gems. Mershone laughed disagreeably and picked up the recovered treasure, which Diana ran forward and seized.|$|R
5000|$|Oume Gōketsuji (Gōketsuji Oume) - Oume, {{like her}} younger sister Otane, is a superhuman. To master her mysterious attacks, she {{confined}} herself to the mountains. Moreover, she has an eerie and unearthly presence about her and it is rumored that she can turn her opponents to <b>stone</b> just by <b>gazing</b> into their eyes.|$|R
60|$|Chris {{lay on his}} back, {{his head}} propped by the bare jutting wall of <b>stone,</b> his <b>gaze</b> attentively {{directed}} across the canyon to the opposing tree-covered slope. There was a sound of crashing through underbrush, the ringing of steel-shod hoofs on stone, and an occasional and mossy descent of a dislodged boulder that bounded from the hill and fetched up with a final splash in the torrent that rushed over a wild chaos of rocks beneath him. Now and again he caught glimpses, framed in green foliage, of the golden brown of Lute's corduroy riding-habit and of the bay horse that moved beneath her.|$|R
60|$|Taking {{possession}} {{of an empty}} cell, George Foster {{sat down on the}} <b>stone</b> floor and <b>gazed</b> at the wretched creatures around him, many of whom were devouring their black bread with ravenous haste. The poor youth could hardly believe his eyes, and it was some time before he could convince himself that the whole thing was not a dream but a terrible reality.|$|R

60|$|To {{shake off}} these gloomy feelings, {{so as to}} be able to make some plans for the future, Neangir left the house and walked briskly about the city till {{darkness}} had fallen. He then retraced his steps and was just crossing the threshold when he saw something at his feet sparkling in the moonlight. He picked it up, and discovered it to be a gold watch shining with precious <b>stones.</b> He <b>gazed</b> up and down the street to see if there was anyone about to whom it might belong, but there was not a creature visible. So he put it in his sash, by the side of a silver watch which he had bought from the Jew that morning.|$|R
60|$|A clear shadow slanted {{across the}} porch, {{the door of}} the church stood open, and after pausing for a moment on its flagstones, I went in. It was empty. <b>Stone</b> faces <b>gazed</b> sightlessly from its walls. Two red {{sanctuary}} lamps hung like faint rubies in the distant chancel. I dragged out a cushion and sat down under the font. The thin, cloudy fragrance that hung in the gloom of the coloured windows stole in through my nostrils, drugged my senses. Propping my chin on my hands, I looked up through the air into the dark roof. A pendulum ticked slowly from on high. Quiet began to steal over me--long centuries of solitude had filled this vacancy as with a dream.|$|R
60|$|Galazi {{sat on the}} lap of the <b>stone</b> Witch, <b>gazing</b> {{towards the}} wide plains below, that were yet white with the moon, though the night grew towards the morning. Greysnout whined at his side, and Deathgrip thrust his muzzle into his hand; but Galazi took no heed, for he was {{brooding}} on the fall of Umslopogaas from the man {{that he had been}} {{to the level of a}} woman's slave, and on the breaking up of the People of the Axe, because of the coming of Nada. For all the women and the children were gone to this Feast of Women, and would not return for long, and it seemed to Galazi that many of the men had slipped away also, as though they smelt some danger from afar.|$|R
50|$|While the cockatrice {{is often}} cited as having a <b>stoning</b> touch or <b>gaze,</b> pyrolisks rely on their own special gaze which causes any who meet it to burst into flame, along with any nearby source of fire. Pyrolisks {{themselves}} are immune to all sources of fire. Unlike the cockatrice, which has an animal intelligence and {{is considered to be}} of neutral alignment, the pyrolisk has a somewhat increased intelligence, and is an actively evil creature. While it normally detests all creatures, its mortal enemy is the phoenix.|$|R
60|$|Here Rima, at a {{distance}} of a few yards from me, remained standing still for some minutes, as if to give me time to recover my breath; and I was right glad to sit down on a stone to rest. Finally she walked slowly to the centre of the level area, which was about two acres in extent; rising, I followed her and, climbing on to a huge block of <b>stone,</b> began <b>gazing</b> at the wide prospect spread out before me. The day was windless and bright, with only a few white clouds floating at a great height above and casting travelling shadows over that wild, broken country, where forest, marsh, and savannah were only distinguishable by their different colours, like the greys and greens and yellows on a map. At a great distance the circle of the horizon was broken here and there by mountains, but the hills in our neighbourhood were all beneath our feet.|$|R
60|$|They {{sat down}} on a stone to watch the birds, and {{whenever}} one flying lower than the others came pretty near them Martin gazed delightedly at it, and wished it would come still nearer so that he might see it better. Then the woman stood up on the <b>stone,</b> and, <b>gazing</b> skywards and throwing up her arms, she uttered a long call, and the birds began to come lower and lower down, still sweeping round in wide circles, and by and by one came quite down and pitched on a stone a few yards from them. Then another came and lighted on another stone, then another, and others followed, until they were all round him in scores, sitting on the rocks, great brown birds with black bars on their wings and tails, and buff-coloured breasts with rust-red spots and stripes. It was a wonderful sight, those eagle-like hawks, with their blue hooked beaks and deep-set dark piercing eyes, sitting in numbers on the rocks, and others and still others dropping down from the sky to increase the gathering.|$|R
60|$|He {{determined}} to take sanctuary in Westminster Abbey, so he again went thither in an omnibus, and {{finding that the}} doors were not open for morning service, he paid his twopence, and went in as a sightseer. It {{occurred to him that}} he had no definite place of rest for the day, and that he should be absolutely worn out before his interview if he attempted to walk about from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M., so he sat himself down on a <b>stone</b> step, and <b>gazed</b> up at the figure of William Pitt, who looks as though he had just entered the church {{for the first time in}} his life and was anything but pleased at finding himself there.|$|R
50|$|Jax-Ur {{would later}} redeem himself {{somewhat}} by helping Superman defeat Black Zero, the alien saboteur who ensured Krypton's destruction under {{the orders of}} the Pirate Empire. It is shown he has a code of honor, as Kryptonian criminals swear by a master criminal who escaped a prison to help each other. Struck by a red kryptonite bullet that Black Zero had created, Jax-Ur began mutating {{through a series of}} serpentine forms, until he became a Medusa-like creature, and turned Black Zero to <b>stone</b> with his <b>gaze</b> before the villain could destroy Metropolis in revenge for Superman foiling his plan to destroy Earth. Jax-Ur then shattered Black Zero's body, avenging Krypton, and willingly returned to the Phantom Zone.|$|R

But a few minutes later she made a sudden dash for one of the doors, opened it and darted out, followed by her husband. He caught her by the fur coat, and begged and implored her not to go, for if she did she would certainly never return. She said nothing, but let her arms fall backwards, and suddenly bending herself forward, she slipped out of the coat, leaving it in her husband's hands. He, poor man, seemed turned to <b>stone</b> as he <b>gazed</b> after her hurrying away from him, and calling {{at the top of her}} voice, as she ran: ...|$|R
25|$|In Greek mythology snakes {{are often}} {{associated}} with deadly and dangerous antagonists, {{but this is not}} to say that snakes are symbolic of evil; in fact, snakes are a chthonic symbol, roughly translated as 'earthbound'. The nine-headed Lernaean Hydra that Hercules defeated and the three Gorgon sisters are children of Gaia, the earth. Medusa was one of the three Gorgon sisters who Perseus defeated. Medusa is described as a hideous mortal, with snakes instead of hair and the power to turn men to <b>stone</b> with her <b>gaze.</b> After killing her, Perseus gave her head to Athena who fixed it to her shield called the Aegis. The Titans are also depicted in art with snakes instead of legs and feet for the same reason—they are children of Gaia and Uranus, so they are bound to the earth.|$|R
6000|$|What {{to make of}} all this, {{of course}} I knew not. Here was art undoubtedly--that did not {{surprise}} me--all roads, in the ordinary sense, are works of art; nor can I {{say that there was}} much to wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might have been done here--with such natural [...] "capabilities" [...] (as they have it in the books on Landscape Gardening)--with very little labor and expense. No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy <b>stones</b> and <b>gaze</b> up and down this fairy--like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the other. There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines. The same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity. It was a piece of [...] "composition," [...] in which the most fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.|$|R
60|$|All at once {{an object}} {{darker than the}} <b>stones</b> arrested Joan's <b>gaze.</b> There was a man sitting {{on the far side}} of the little ravine. Instantly she {{recognized}} Jim Cleve. He was looking at the little window--at her. Joan believed he was there for just that purpose. Making sure that no one else was near to see, she put out her hand and waved it. Jim gave a guarded perceptible sign that he had observed her action, and almost directly got up and left. Joan needed no more than that to tell her how Jim's idea of communicating with her corresponded with her own. That night she would talk with him and she was thrilled through. The secrecy, the peril, somehow lent this prospect a sweetness, a zest, a delicious fear. Indeed, she was not only responding to love, but to daring, to defiance, to a wilder nameless element born of her environment and the needs of the hour.|$|R
50|$|A dragon is {{a legendary}} creature, {{typically}} with snake-like or reptilian traits, in the myths of both European and Chinese cultures, with counterparts in Japan, Korea and other East Asian countries.The (genuine) plesiosaur Woolungasaurus {{is named after}} the Woolunga, a mythical reptile of Australia.

50|$|In Egyptian history, {{the snake}} {{occupies}} a primary role with the Nile cobra adorning {{the crown of}} the pharaoh in ancient times.

50|$|In {{the present}} day, Black Zero came to Earth, {{threatening}} {{to destroy it}} as he did Krypton. In desperation, Superman released Jax-Ur, a prisoner of the Phantom Zone, who wished to avenge Krypton's destruction. As he launched a devastatingly powerful missile toward Earth, Black Zero attacked Jax-Ur with a red Kryptonite bullet, causing his body to mutate wildly into several serpent-like forms. This proved to be Black Zero's undoing; While Superman saved the Earth from the missile, Jax-Ur transformed into a Medusa-like form, turning Black Zero to <b>stone</b> with his <b>gaze.</b> Black Zero's body was then shattered by Jax-Ur, in recompense {{for what he had}} done to Krypton. This story suggests that were it not for something none of them knew, Jor-El would have been wrong and the Science Council right. E. Nelson Bridwell hypothesized that what Black Zero had noticed was the Green Lantern Tomar Re's attempts to prevent the destruction (as seen in Superman (vol. 1) #257 (1972)), meaning the two sets of interference canceled each other out, and Jor-El was right.|$|R

On his return to Earth, Sorrow killed his wife by accident in his haste to remove his mask so she could see that it was him, and kidnaps Sandy, blaming him for his disfigurement and taking him to a theatre. Newly formed superhero team the [...] "Seven Shadows"—consisting of Dr. Nowhere, Jake Justice, the Shard, Man-At-Arms, Lodestar, the Scarab, and the Veil—attempted to stop Sorrow but {{with the exception of the}} Scarab they were all killed by Sorrow's gaze. The Scarab requested the aid of the Justice Society, who arrived as the King of Tears was materializing. The entity the Spectre reduced the monster to actual tears, which were contained and stored by the Green Lantern. Defeated, Sorrow fled. Later he helped remove a tumour from Black Adam's brain, causing him to join Sorrow to repay the debt. Sorrow somehow gained access to the Rock of Eternity and turns the wizard Shazam to <b>stone</b> with his <b>gaze.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The ship {{came within}} half a league of this creek, {{and sent her}} long boat with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very well known); but I did not observe it, till the boat was almost on shore; {{and it was too}} late to seek another hiding-place. The seamen at their landing {{observed}} my canoe, and rummaging it all over, easily conjectured that the owner could not be far off. Four of them, well armed, searched every cranny and lurking-hole, till at last they found me flat on my face behind the <b>stone.</b> They <b>gazed</b> awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth dress; my coat made of skins, my wooden-soled shoes, and my furred stockings; whence, however, they concluded, I was not a native of the place, who all go naked. One of the seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise, and asked who I was. I understood that language very well, and getting upon my feet, said, “I was a poor Yahoo banished from the Houyhnhnms, and desired they would please to let me depart.” They admired to hear me answer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a European; but were at a loss to know what I meant by Yahoos and Houyhnhnms; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in speaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse. I trembled all the while betwixt fear and hatred. I again desired leave to depart, and was gently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know, “what country I was of? whence I came?” with many other questions. I told them “I was born in England, whence I came about five years ago, and then their country and ours were at peace. I therefore hoped they would not treat me as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but was a poor Yahoo seeking some desolate place where to pass the remainder of his unfortunate life.” ...|$|R
60|$|The night set in gusty and tempestuous, and {{the moon}} was all girt with ragged clouds. The wind blew in melancholy gusts, sobbing and sighing over the moor, and setting all the gorse bushes agroaning. From time to time a little sputter of rain pattered up against the window-pane. I sat until near midnight, glancing over the {{fragment}} on immortality by Iamblichus, the Alexandrian platonist, of whom the Emperor Julian {{said that he was}} posterior to Plato in time but not in genius. At last, shutting up my book, I opened my door and took a last look at the dreary fell and still more dreary sky. As I protruded my head, a swoop of wind caught me and sent the red ashes of my pipe sparkling and dancing through the darkness. At the same moment the moon shone brilliantly out from between two clouds and I saw, sitting on the hillside, not two hundred yards from my door, the man who called himself the surgeon of Gaster Fell. He was squatted among the heather, his elbows upon his knees, and his chin resting upon his hands, as motionless as a <b>stone,</b> with his <b>gaze</b> fixed steadily upon the door of my dwelling.|$|R
