5|$|Following {{the release}} of Terminator 3 in 2003, {{producers}} Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar contracted Nick Stahl and Claire Danes to return as John Connor and Kate Brewster in another film. Director Jonathan Mostow helped develop the script, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and was set to begin production in 2005 after completing another film. It was known by then that Arnold Schwarzenegger's role would be limited, as he had assumed office as Governor of California. The producers sought to have Warner Bros. finance the picture as they did for Terminator 3. In 2005, Stahl <b>said</b> <b>John</b> and Kate would be recast as the story jumped forward in time. By 2006, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (a successor to Orion Pictures and current owners of the Hemdale Film Corporation library, distributor and producer of the original film, respectively) was set to distribute the fourth film {{as part of the}} new CEO Harry Sloan's scheme to make the studio a viable Hollywood player.|$|E

25|$|Sometime around 9:15 PM, police {{officers}} {{burst into the}} Lakeview Tavern and ordered the 10 staff and customers to lie on the floor. More police burst into the bar, and forced the seven men and three women into the basement. The officers fired repeatedly into the ceiling, and shot tear gas into the basement before locking the staff and customers in. Eyewitnesses <b>said</b> <b>John</b> Pegues, a tavern patron, {{was shot in the}} leg by police at this time, which an official chronology later said occurred at 9:30 PM. Patrolman Anthony Sherbinski, who rushed to the second floor to fire at snipers from the second floor window, was shot and wounded by return fire at the same time. The bar staff and patrons were not released from the basement until 10:15 PM. All the individuals were roughly handled by police, with most of the men being pistol-whipped. All ten were taken to the Fifth District Police station and locked up. Pegues was not given medical attention until 5:00 AM.|$|E

500|$|Criticisms against Opus Dei have {{prompted}} Catholic scholars and writers like Piers Paul Read and Vittorio Messori to call Opus Dei {{a sign of}} contradiction, {{in reference to the}} biblical quote of Jesus as a [...] "sign that is spoken against". <b>Said</b> <b>John</b> Carmel Heenan, Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster: [...] "One of the proofs of God's favor is to be a sign of contradiction. Almost all founders of societies in the Church have suffered. Monsignor Escrivá de Balaguer is no exception. Opus Dei has been attacked and its motives misunderstood.

The duo were signed under an older contract that specified the label pay for sessions ("As a folk duo, how much could recording costs be?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>John</b> Simon). Simon & Garfunkel took advantage of this indulgence, hiring viola and brass players, as well as percussionists. When the viola players arrived, the duo were so intrigued with the sound of the musicians tuning their instruments before recording that they spent nearly all night (at Columbia's expense) trying to find the random sound.|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} putting {{together}} All the Way... A Decade of Song was laborious for all involved, from balancing {{the number of}} hits and new songs to ensuring {{that each of the}} latest tracks showed a new side of Dion.

[...] "We wanted to make sure we had some new sounds and {{that we were able to}} go to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number. But we had so many great songs coming in that we ended up recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 7, 2009, Walter O'Malley was {{inducted}} into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame along with two other Dodger icons: slugger Steve Garvey and announcer Vin Scully. [...] "Over the years, we have learned more of his decade-long quest to build a new stadium in Brooklyn and about how those efforts were thwarted by city officials. Perhaps this induction will inspire fans who themselves started new lives outside the borough to reconsider their thoughts about Walter O’Malley", <b>said</b> <b>John</b> Mooney, curator of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. [...] "He privately built one of baseball's more beautiful ballparks, Dodger Stadium, and set attendance records annually. While New York is the home of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, it seeks to honor inductees whose impact was and is national." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Michael O'Donoghue said, [...] "I don't {{write for}} felt". In a 1977 {{interview}} for Playboy, O'Donoghue called The Land of Gorch characters [...] "fucking Muppets" [...] and [...] "little hairy facecloths". Saturday Night Live writer Alan Zweibel said the writers drew straws {{to decide who}} would draft that week's Muppet routine. Zweibel said {{that in addition to}} himself, other writers who disliked working on scripts for The Land of Gorch included Michael O'Donoghue, Al Franken, and Tom Davis. Zweibel had personal disagreements with Jim Henson, who disapproved a few storylines. Henson's associate Jerry Juhl <b>said</b> <b>John</b> Belushi hated having the Muppets on the show. Juhl said they went through virtually every writer on the program trying to find one who would write sketches both parties could agree with.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Gary Oldman was {{originally}} approached {{to provide the}} voice of General Grievous; however, complications arose during contract negotiations after Oldman learned the film was to be made outside of the Screen Actors Guild, {{of which he is}} a member. He backed out of the role rather than violate the union's rules. Matthew Wood, who ultimately voiced Grievous, disputed this story at Celebration III, held in Indianapolis. According to him, Oldman is a friend of producer Rick McCallum, and thus recorded an audition as a favor to him, but was not chosen. Wood, who was also the supervising sound editor, {{was in charge of the}} auditions and submitted his audition anonymously in the midst of 30 others, under the initials [...] "A.S." [...] for Alan Smithee. Days later, he received a phone call asking for the full name to the initials [...] "A.S."

500|$|When {{the shoot}} ended, Abrams gave the cast small boxes {{containing}} little telescopes, which {{allowed them to}} read the name of each constellation it was pointed at. [...] "I think he just wanted {{each of us to}} look at the stars a little differently," [...] <b>said</b> <b>John</b> Cho. After the shoot, Abrams cut out some scenes of Kirk and Spock as children, including seeing the latter as a baby, as well as a subplot involving Nero being imprisoned by the Klingons and his escape: this explanation for his absence during Kirk's life confused many to whom Abrams screened the film. Other scenes cut out explained that the teenage Kirk stole his stepfather's antique car because he had forced him to clean it before an auction; and that the Orion he seduced at the Academy worked in the operations division. Afterwards, she agrees to open the e-mail containing his patch that allows him to pass the Kobayashi Maru test.|$|E

According to WSMV-TV, a protester stated he was assaulted by three Scientology security guards while on public property, [...] away from the Scientology building. The Church of Scientology had previously informed the security guards that the protesters were [...] "dangerous people". A protester was issued three citations by the Scientology security guards, but these were all dismissed by the district attorney. On May 8, 2009, WSMV-TV reported that [...] "laws {{appear to have been}} broken" [...] {{in the manner in which}} the Scientology security guards handled the protesters. The Scientology security guards were not clearly identified as off-duty police officers, and permits for the Scientology event attended by the Anonymous protesters were for the wrong day.

500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' <b>said</b> <b>John</b> Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E
500|$|In an {{open letter}} to his {{constituents}} dated October 8, 1861, Breckinridge maintained that the Union no longer existed and that Kentucky should be free to choose her own course; he defended his sympathy to the Southern cause and denounced the Unionist state legislature, declaring, [...] "I exchange with proud satisfaction a term of six years in the Senate of the United States for the musket of a soldier." [...] He was indicted for treason in U.S. federal district court in Frankfort on November 6, 1861, having officially enlisted in the Confederate army days earlier. On December 2, 1861, he was declared a traitor by the United States Senate. A resolution stating [...] "Whereas John C.

500|$|John Dudley was {{the eldest}} of three sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount Lisle. His father was attainted and executed for high treason in 1510, having been arrested immediately after Henry VIII's accession because the new King needed scapegoats for his predecessor's unpopular financial policies. In 1512 the seven-year-old John became the ward of Sir Edward Guildford and was taken into his household. At the same time Edmund Dudley's attainder was lifted and John Dudley was restored [...] "in name and blood". The King was hoping for the good services [...] "which the <b>said</b> <b>John</b> Dudley is likely to do". At about age 15 John Dudley probably went with his guardian to the Pale of Calais to serve there for the next years. He took part in Cardinal Wolsey's diplomatic voyages of 1521 and 1527, and was knighted by Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk during his first major military experience, the 1523 invasion of France. In 1524 Dudley became a Knight of the Body, and from 1534 {{he was responsible for}} the King's body armour as Master of the Tower Armoury. Being [...] "the most skilful of his generation, both on foot and on horseback", he excelled in wrestling, archery, and the tournaments of the royal court, as a French report stated as late as 1546.|$|E
