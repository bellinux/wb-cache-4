5|$|Manuel made serious {{tactical}} errors, such as {{failing to}} properly scout out the route ahead. These failings {{caused him to}} lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass. The Byzantines were too dispersed, and were surrounded. The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both {{during and after the}} battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he was never the <b>same</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
5|$|At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul {{announced}} his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said {{that each of}} them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing {{either of the two}} main parties' candidates (McCain– Republican Party, or Obama– Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the <b>same</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

25|$|All {{of these}} points may be partly correct in themselves, but they leave {{unanswered}} {{the question of}} why Beck acted like he did. A possible explanation is that he needed to repair his reputation: He was a politician and had during the First War of Schleswig 15 years earlier been passed over for promotion for criticism by Colonel Læssøe, and would probably suffer the <b>same</b> <b>again,</b> for in February during the battle of Sankelmark he left his unit while it was in battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} commercial {{failure of}} the novel has been suggested as pivotal in Herbert's later career – {{it was clear to}} him that novel-writing was not likely to prove financially rewarding, which helped focus his efforts on light journalism and set the tone for most of his later writings. He would not write anything quite the <b>same</b> <b>again</b> – The House by the River (1920), a crime novel, retains something of the simple style, but begins to introduce elements of humour not found in The Secret Battle.|$|E

25|$|Lumbering became {{important}} to the local economy of Monckton Township by the 1840s and {{in the latter part}} of that same decade, Joseph Salter arrived from Saint John and built a major shipyard at The Bend. Within a few years, over 1000 workers were employed at the shipyard and the sleepy community that had formerly been The Bend would never be the <b>same</b> <b>again.</b> The Bend developed a service based economy to support the shipyard and gradually began to acquire all of the amenities of a growing town. In particular, as the economy strengthened, an important financial institution (the Westmorland Bank) opened and this in turn was able to finance further expansion of the shipbuilding industry.|$|E
25|$|The Phillies {{had scored}} in the 1st inning in each game of the World Series in Philadelphia, and {{essentially}} did the <b>same</b> <b>again</b> as Jayson Werth singled on a pop up that scored a run {{in the bottom of}} the 6th inning to give the Phillies a 3–2 lead. Rocco Baldelli kept the Rays in it with a solo home run in the 7th inning to tie the game again. Pedro Feliz would answer that home run with an RBI single that ended up being the game winner, as Phillies closer Brad Lidge would strike out Eric Hinske in the 9th inning to end the game. The Philadelphia Phillies had defeated the Rays four games to one to win their second World Series title, and first since , and the first championship for the city of Philadelphia since the 76ers swept the 1983 NBA Finals. Cole Hamels was named MVP of the series.|$|E
25|$|On Friday 26 January Sydney {{played their}} first leg home final against the Queensland Roar {{in front of}} a crowd of 23,450 at the Sydney Football Stadium. The match which was {{supposed}} to be played up at Queensland's home ground Suncorp Stadium but it was moved to Sydney because of a concert by the '80s band The Police. Recent matches against the roar, had all been mostly uneventful affairs, including a 0–0 draw a couple of weeks beforehand, and it was the <b>same</b> <b>again.</b> Both sides had few chances during the 1st half, but Queensland's Brazilian import Reinaldo missed a golden opportunity when he air-swinged a cross in the opening 10minutes. Sydney's best chance came in the 2nd half when Alex Brosque made a break, got around defender Andrew Packer and only had to slot the ball past the keeper but ended up booting the ball over the crossbar, and into the disappointed 'cove' supporters.|$|E

25|$|New South Wales was {{the strongest}} state the MCC would meet on the tour, winning the Sheffield Shield 14 times in 16 seasons between 1948–49 and 1961–62 and nearly 60,000 people {{came to see the}} champions take on the touring team {{over the course of the}} four day match. New South Wales were led by the {{flamboyant}} Keith Miller who won the toss and put the visitors in to bat, much to Len Hutton's annoyance as he wanted to do the <b>same.</b> <b>Again</b> he had to rescue the innings, making 102 and only receiving support from the baby-faced Colin Cowdrey who had yet to make a century in the County Championship, but made a sweetly timed 110 as they added 163 together. No other batsman exceeded 11 and the team was out for 252. Miller rotated his bowlers and the wickets were shared by Pat Crawford (3/51) whose drag allowed him to bowl a yard down the wicket, Alan Davidson (3/41), bowling with a shoulder injury, and the Chinamen of John Treanor (3/64). Young Billy Watson, playing in his second First Class match raced to 155 and with the help of his captain's 86 took New South Wales past the MCC score three wickets down. From there wickets fell steadily to Frank Tyson 4/98 and Alec Bedser 4/117, who was suffering from a rash, and they were all out for 382. To try out potential openers Hutton put Vic Wilson and Cowdrey in first. Wilson was out for a duck, but Cowdrey made another hundred (103), but only Hutton himself (87), batting at number 6, gave him any help. The MCC were out for 327, Cowdrey and Hutton making 402 of the 577 runs scored, the other 9 batsmen making 117 in two innings. Even Miller saw that 198 for victory in 75 minutes was impossible and sent in his young players for batting practice and Cowdrey went for 38 runs off 3 overs doing bowling impressions of Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and others, but Peter Loader took 2/14 before the gamed ended with New South Wales on 78/2.|$|E

Several months later, after moving back to Jakarta Aristo's first screenplay, a 90-page work titled Tak Pernah Kembali Sama (Never Been the <b>Same</b> <b>Again),</b> was read by director Rudy Soedjarwo. Soedjarwo gave the film several critiques, which drove Aristo to improve his writing.|$|E

500|$|... "Change" [...] is a steady, midtempo pop ballad. Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy {{described}} the song as [...] "a gentle, sweeping lament". According to the digital sheet music published by Universal Music Publishing, [...] "Change" [...] was composed {{in the key}} of D minor using common time. The tempo of the song moves at 85 beats per minute. A soulful track, it follows the group's conventional style of balladry, although is more uptempo than their other ballads. Group member Berrabah sings the lead vocals on the song. It contains anthemic melodies backed by a powerful 1980s guitar lick, and incorporates the group's harmonies into keys and sweeping effects. The song's lyrics are about the experiences of change and ultimately never being the <b>same</b> <b>again,</b> but the need to remain strong in the process.|$|E
500|$|Though Sarmiento is {{well known}} historically, {{he was not a}} popular president. [...] Indeed, Rock judges that [...] "by and large his {{administration}} was a disappointment". [...] During his presidency, Argentina conducted an unpopular war against Paraguay; at the same time, people were displeased with him for not fighting for the Straits of Magellan from Chile. [...] Although he increased productivity, he increased expenditures, which also negatively affected his popularity. [...] In addition, the arrival of a large influx of European immigrants was blamed for the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Buenos Aires and the risk of civil war. [...] Moreover, Sarmiento's presidency was further marked by ongoing rivalry between Buenos Aires and the provinces. [...] In the war against Paraguay, Sarmiento's adopted son was killed. Sarmiento suffered from immense grief and was thought to never have been the <b>same</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

By this time, Capper had been lying in her own urine and feces for several days and was placed in a bath {{containing}} concentrated disinfectant and scrubbed with a stiff brush with sufficient force to remove skin. Pook then used pliers to extract two of her teeth, which police later found at his house [...] "like some kind of macabre trophy." [...] Dudson said: [...] "I was stood at the doorway with Jeanie [...] and Bernie [...] Cliff [...] took her gag off. He told her to open her mouth. He said: 'Right, I'm going to rip your teeth out'. He started hitting her teeth with the pliers. He got the pliers on and started pulling it out. But it just snapped and chipped. Then he hit them a few more times. He put the pliers on again and really, really pulled. He pulled Suzanne's head forward until there was a snap and he had the tooth in the pliers.

500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the <b>same</b> <b>again.</b> That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara's {{first major}} film role {{was that of}} Mary Yellen in Jamaica Inn (1939), {{directed}} by Alfred Hitchcock and co-starring Laughton. O'Hara portrayed the innkeeper's niece, an orphan who goes {{to live with her}} aunt and uncle at a Cornish tavern, a heroine which she describes as [...] "torn between the love of her family and her love for a lawman in disguise". Laughton insisted that she change her name to the shorter [...] "O'Mara" [...] or [...] "O'Hara", and she eventually decided on the latter after expressing contempt at both. [...] When she said [...] "I like Maureen Fitzsimons and I want to keep it", Laughton replied with, [...] "Very well, you're Maureen O'Hara." [...] (O'Hara would later say that [...] "nobody would ever get [...] straight.") [...] O'Hara noted that Laughton had always wanted a daughter of his own, and treated her as such, and she later stated that Laughton's death in 1962 was like losing a parent. She worked well under Hitchcock, professing to have [...] "never experienced the strange feeling of detachment with Hitchcock that many other actors claimed to have felt while working with him." [...] On the contrary, Laughton was engaged in a bitter battle with Hitchcock throughout the production and resented many of Hitchcock's ideas, including changing the nature of the villain from the novel. Though Jamaica Inn is generally seen by critics and the director himself as one of his weakest films, O'Hara was praised, with one critic stating [...] "the newcomer, Maureen O'Hara is charming to look at and distinct promise as an actress". Seeing the film was an eyeopener for O'Hara and change in self-perception, having always seen herself as a tomboy and realizing that on screen she was a woman of great beauty to others. When she returned to Ireland briefly after the film was completed it dawned on her that life would never be the <b>same</b> <b>again,</b> and she was hurt when she attempted to make pleasant conversation to some local girls and they rejected her advances, considering her to be very arrogant.|$|E
