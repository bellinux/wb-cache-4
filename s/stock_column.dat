40|$|The total nominal {{return on}} <b>stocks</b> (<b>column</b> 1 in the table) {{is the sum}} of the average {{dividend}} yield and capital gains, or price appreciation (columns 2 and 3, respectively). Annualized after-inflation (“real”) total returns on U. S. stocks—obtained by subtracting column 5 from column 1 —were 7. 5 percent between 1926 and 1997. For comparison, annual real total returns on short-term government securities were only 0. 6 over this period. What returns should investors expect from stocks in the future? Relatively high long-term returns on stocks in the past do not necessarily portend high future returns—particularly now. The dividend yield on the S&P 500 index was 1. 2 percent in April 1999, the lowest ever recorded and far below either the 4. 6 percent average for the period 1926 - 1997 or the 5. ...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{possibility}} to combine column generation and Lagrangian relaxation {{has been known for}} quite some time, it has only recently been exploited in algorithms. In this paper, we discuss ways of combining these techniques. We focus on solving the LP relaxation of the Dantzig-Wolfe master problem. In a first approach we apply Lagrangian relaxation directly to this extended formulation, i. e. no simplex method is used. In a second one, we use Lagrangian relaxation to generate new columns, that is Lagrangian relaxation is applied to the compact for-mulation. We will illustrate the ideas behind these algorithms with an application in Lot-sizing. To show the wide applicability of these techniques, we also discuss applications in integrated vehicle and crew scheduling, plant location and cutting <b>stock</b> problems. <b>column</b> generation;Lagrangean relaxation;cutting <b>stock</b> problem;lotsizing;vehicle and crew scheduling...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} column 2, the {{coefficient}} of IO_FOR_COMMON_HIGH is negative and significant at the 1 % level, while IO_FOR_CIVIL_HIGH is insignificant.

The coefficient of IO_FOR_COMMON_LOW is negative but insignificant, while that of IO_FOR_CIVIL_LOW is positive and significant at the 1 % level. This indicates that low-stake foreign institutions from civil-law countries even increase <b>stock</b> return comovement. <b>Column</b> 3 reports the similar results when we use the anti-self-dealing index to measure a country’s investor protection.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{earlier studies}} have found that firms with higher stock {{liquidity}} experience less severe expropriation problems while using China’s split-share structure reform (SSSR) as an exogenous shock (Li et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012). 17 The share reform aligns the interests of the controlling shareholder and minority shareholders to some extent as it converts the non-tradable shares held by the controlling shareholder into freely tradable shares. It is possible that the shares of the non-family-chair firms are less liquid in the stock market compared with those of family-chair firms. To address this issue, we examine the impact of a non-family chair on firm performance using a subsample of firms that experience SSSR and compare the changes in performance for both types of firms. We use a time window of 3 years before and after the reform, and we define the dummy variable, Finish, equal to 1 for years when the share reform is completed (and 0 otherwise). We predict that the interaction variable (NFChair×Finish) would be significantly positive if our results were caused by <b>stock</b> illiquidity. <b>Column</b> 8 shows the results of the difference-in-difference test. The coefficient of NFChair retains its sign and significance, while NFChair×Finish is not statistically significant. Therefore, the difference in stock liquidity is not a major concern.|$|R
40|$|Chlorophyll α {{concentration}} in water column under the Antarctic fast ice was measured at five stations (10 - 675 m depths) near Syowa Station (69 ° 00 ′S, 39 ° 35 ′E) {{for the period}} of 13 months from January 1982 to January 1983. High chlorophyll α concentrations were seen between December and March, while peaks were observed in late January. Maximum concentration was 11. 30 mg chl. α/m^ 3. During four months of the austral summer, a rapid increase of chlorophyll α was observed in late January. This phenomenon seemed to be caused by a slight increase of temperature (>- 1. 73 ℃) and a slight decrease of salinity (< 34. 15).

He began to watch the <b>Stock</b> Exchange <b>columns</b> of the paper with new interest. Next day {{everything}} was up a little, and Macalister wrote {{to say that he}} had had to pay two and a quarter for the shares. He said that the market was firm. But {{in a day or two}} there was a set-back. The news that came from South Africa was less reassuring, and Philip with anxiety saw that his shares had fallen to two; but Macalister was optimistic, the Boers couldn't hold out much longer, and he was willing to bet a top-hat that Roberts would march into Johannesburg before the middle of April. At the account Philip had to pay out nearly forty pounds. It worried him considerably, but he felt that the only course was to hold on: in his circumstances the loss was too great for him to pocket. For two or three weeks nothing happened; the Boers would not understand that they were beaten and nothing remained for them but to surrender: in fact they had one or two small successes, and Philip's shares fell half a crown more. It became evident that the war was not finished. There was a lot of selling. When Macalister saw Philip he was pessimistic.|$|R
40|$|We {{address a}} variant of the {{classical}} knapsack problem in which an upper bound is imposed on the number of items that can be selected. This problem arises in the solution of real-life cutting <b>stock</b> problems by <b>column</b> generation, and may be used to separate cover inequalities with small support within cutting plane approaches to integer linear programs. We focus our attention on approximation algorithms for the problem, describing a linear-storage Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) and a dynamic-programming based Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS). The main ideas contained in our PTAS are used to derive PTAS for the knapsack problem and its multidimensional generalization which improve on the previously proposed PTAS. We finally illustrate better PTAS and FPTAS for the subset sum case of the problem in which profits and weights coincide. 1 Introduction The classical Knapsack Problem (KP) is defined by a set N := f 1; : : :; ng of items, each having a positive i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the fate of}} ice algae released from sea ice, we investigated the abundance, species composition, and sinking flux of diatoms {{in the water column}} under fast ice near Syowa Station, Antarctica during the summer of 2005 / 2006. The diatom assemblage in the water column consisted of chain-forming planktonic species, in contrast to the under-ice assemblage dominated by pennate species reported from this site in the past; this dissimilarity suggests the presence of an unconsolidated platelet ice layer under the congelation ice, within which planktonic species can bloom. Among the dominant diatoms, Porosira pseudodenticulata and Pseudo-nitzschia cf. turgiduloides were dominant in the water column, and their water <b>column</b> <b>stocks</b> were higher than their mass sedimentation. These species apparently maintain their populations in the surface layer, as their production remains in the water column. In contrast, Fragilariopsis kerguelensis and Thalassiosira australis were scarce in the water column but rich in the flux, indicating active sinking and export of their production to the benthic ecosystem. This distinction in buoyancy control and sinking characteristics of the dominant diatoms on release from the fast ice influences the diatom species composition and carbon flow under the ice...|$|R
40|$|Acetabular {{revision}} of failed cages or rings may be facilitated by previously placed bone graft, enabling {{the use of}} highly porous cementless hemispheric cups. We retrospectively reviewed all 15 patients who had conversion of failed antiprotrusion cages (10 patients) or roof rings (five patients) to cementless cups. All patients had restoration of bone <b>stock</b> (three major <b>column,</b> eight morselized, four combined bone grafts) performed in conjunction with their index cage or ring reconstruction arthroplasty. The minimum followup was 24  months (average, 48. 3  months; range, 24 – 72  months). Failure was defined as radiographic cup migration. In 12 of the 15 patients, there was no radiographic change in cup position at the last followup or symptoms indicative of loosening. The average Harris hip scores improved from 31 (range, 15 – 48) to 69 (range, 56 – 87) at latest followup. Cup failure occurred in three patients. In two patients, the failed cups were revised; the third patient refused additional surgery. Our experience suggests treatment of failed cages by highly porous cementless cups is a reasonable option. However, we recommend patients be followed closely to detect cup migration, which can occur until satisfactory bony ingrowth occurs...|$|R

40|$|Besides mixing, the {{dissolved}} barium distribution i the oceanic {{water column}} is controlled {{to a significant}} extent also by particle-solute interaction. In vitro uptake experiments involving diatom cultures suggest hat passive uptake prevails over active uptake. The overall effect of these processes i that barium behaves as a non-limiting nutrient element with ratios of dissolved over particulate concentrations varying between 100 and 1000. Uptake of barium by plankton particles eventually results {{in the formation of}} barium sulphate (baryte). There is increasing evidence that this baryte formation is closely linked with the formation of micro-environments composed of detrital organic matter, in which BaSO 4 saturation is eventually reached during the process of bacterial decay (Bishop, 1988; Dehairs et al., 1980). This mechanism sets the link between oceanic baryte and oceanic productivity and as a result oceanic baryte is now increasingly recognised to represent a good proxy for palaeoproductivity (Francois eta /., 1995). Using an extensive data set obtained mainly from the Southern Ocean we investigated the different main processes affecting the oceanic barium cycle. For particulate barium in surface waters regional variability can be important and this is clearly associated with variation of planktonic production and biomass uch as occurring, for instance, across the Polar Front Zone (PFZ). We observed that on a time scale of approximately three weeks water <b>column</b> <b>stocks</b> of micro-crystalline baryte co-vary with seasonal change in surface water productivity (Dehairs et al. 1997). This phase lag of about hree weeks is consistent with the time lapse required for baryte to be formed during in vitro experiments using decaying detritus from a diatom culture. This proces...|$|R

Bacterial remineralization was investigated during the SAZ-Sense cruise (January-February 2007) in the Subantarctic (SAZ) and Polar Front Zones (PFZ) of the Southern Ocean south of Tasmania, by combining bacterial biomass (BB) and bacterial production (BP) measurements in the epipelagic (0 - 100 m) and mesopelagic (100 - 700 m) water column. Bacterial carbon demand (BCD) was assessed using different conversion factors and growth efficiencies and was confronted to primary production and carbon export flux estimates. Surface layer bacterial biomass and production were higher in SAZ waters east of Tasmania (SAZ-East) compared to SAZ waters west of Tasmania (SAZ-West), while values at the PF were similar to those for the SAZ-West. At the PF, subsurface maximum values of bacterial production were observed. Bacterial parameters followed chla and dissolved organic carbon distributions. Bacterial abundance, biomass and production drastically decreased below 100 - 200 m. However, depth-integrated biomass and activity rates revealed that the mesopelagic zone contributed significantly to the upper 700 m water <b>column</b> <b>stocks</b> (41 - 68 % for BB) and rates (10 - 74 % for BP). Highest and lowest contributions of mesopelagic BP to epi-plus mesopelagic water column BP were observed at the PF and in the SAZ-East, respectively. Results show that the SAZ-East region had a poor carbon sequestration efficiency compared to the SAZ-West and the PFZ. Despite some uncertainties in carbon flux estimations and discrepancies between methods the present study highlights the importance of studying bacterial dynamics in the twilight zone because of their significant role in shaping the carbon fluxes through the water column...|$|R
