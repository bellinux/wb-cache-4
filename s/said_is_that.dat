500|$|On 22 August 1485, Richard met the outnumbered {{forces of}} Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard rode a white courser. The size of Richard's army has been {{estimated}} at 8,000, Henry's at 5,000, but exact numbers are not known; all that can be <b>said</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Royal army 'substantially' outnumbered Tudor's. The traditional view of the king's famous cries of [...] "Treason!" [...] before falling was that during the battle Richard was abandoned by Lord Stanley (made Earl of Derby in October), Sir William Stanley, and Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland. However, the role of Northumberland is unclear; his position was with the reserve—behind the king's line—and he could not easily have moved forward without a general royal advance, which did not take place. Indeed, the physical confines behind the crest of Ambion Hill, combined with a difficulty of communications, probably physically hampered any attempt he made to join the fray. Despite appearing [...] "a pillar of the Ricardian regime", and his previous loyalty to Edward IV, Lord Stanley's wife, Lady Margaret Beaufort, was Henry Tudor's mother, and Stanley's inaction, combined with his brother's entering the battle on Tudor's behalf was fundamental to Richard's defeat. The death of John Howard, Duke of Norfolk, his close companion, {{may have had a}} demoralising effect on Richard and his men. Either way, Richard led a cavalry charge deep into the enemy ranks in an attempt to end the battle quickly by striking at Henry Tudor himself.|$|E
2500|$|He also {{sponsored}} a bill, [...] which became law that the TSA ensures that military personnel {{were treated with}} respect while traveling on orders or while wearing their uniforms. [...] “The bill’s intent, he <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the military personnel {{would be able to}} go through security with the same ease as registered flyers.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{moral of}} the Barnum Demonstration", Birnbaum has <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Self-validation is no validation. Do not be fooled by a psychic, quack psychotherapist, or a phony faith healer who uses this trick on you! Be skeptical and ask for proof. Keep your money in your wallet, your wallet in your pocket, and your hand on your wallet." ...|$|E

2500|$|The exact date of {{the battle}} is uncertain, other than it {{happened}} before the Battle of Aldy Charrish, which documentary evidence dates to either July 1487 or June 1486. The date most commonly cited for events at Tarbat is 1486, but all that can be [...] <b>said</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was probably {{some time in the}} 1480s.|$|E
2500|$|Scott Foy of Dread Central wrote, [...] "They've {{basically}} recycled {{the first}} film but dumbed it and dulled it down considerably, doing away with the paranoia and sense of desolation that gave the original some spark in favor of logic gaps and tedious predictability. ... The best that can be <b>said</b> ... <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most of the production values and make-up effects are top notch for a direct-to-DVD production. Too bad they didn't put as much work into crafting the screenplay." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the June 2007 {{issue of}} GQ magazine, Sheffield (a Detroit Tiger at the time) was quoted {{saying that there}} are more Latin {{baseball}} players than African-American players because Latinos are easier to control. [...] "What I <b>said</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you're going to see more black faces, but there ain't no English going to be coming out. ... (It's about) being able to tell (Latin players) what to do — being able to control them.... Where I'm from, you can't control us." [...] He continued [...] "They have more to lose than we do. You can send them back across the island. You can't send us back. We're already here." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) {{wrote that}} in an {{interview}} Grist acknowledged he crossed through Russian lines without authorization on his own initiative to determine the facts, which ultimately cost him his OSCE job. He {{was forced to resign}} from the OSCE immediately after the war. WSJ adds Grist remains [...] "scathing" [...] about Georgian actions before and during the war, but says that some of his comments have been overinterpreted and quotes Grist saying [...] "I have never said there was no provocation by the South Ossetians." [...] "What I have <b>said</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the response from the Georgian authorities was absolutely disproportionate," [...] said Ryan Grist.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{no claim}} that Eleanor invented courtly love, {{since it was}} a concept that had begun to grow before Eleanor's court arose. [...] All that can be <b>said</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> her court at Poitiers was most likely a {{catalyst}} for the increased popularity of courtly love literature in the Western European regions. Amy Kelly, in her article, [...] "Eleanor of Aquitaine and her Courts of Love," [...] gives a very plausible description of the origins of the rules of Eleanor's court: [...] "In the Poitevin code, man is the property, the very thing of woman; whereas a precisely contrary state of things existed in the adjacent realms of the two kings from whom the reigning duchess of Aquitaine was estranged." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, the 2003 {{season was}} also spotted with {{controversy}} involving Singh surrounding the year's {{event at the}} Bank of America Colonial. LPGA star Annika Sörenstam {{became the first woman}} to play at a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam [...] "didn't belong" [...] on the men's tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her. What he actually <b>said</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he would not be paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion's pool. Singh later clarified, [...] "There are guys out there trying to make a living. It's not a ladies' tour. If she wants to play, she should—or any other woman for that matter—if they want to play the man's tour, they should qualify and play like everybody else." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ultimately, {{the problem}} with [...] "designed for use", he <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the manufacturer, not the seller, {{determined}} that. Were the ordinance to prescribe criminal penalties, that aspect alone {{would be enough to}} invalidate it, he added in a footnote.|$|R
2500|$|They did slapstick, reeled off old {{vaudeville}} jokes, and did {{whatever else}} popped into their heads. The audience laughed. This success {{led to a}} series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York's Copacabana. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both <b>said,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they ignored the audience and played to each other. The team made its TV debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network's The Ed Sullivan Show (then called [...] "The Toast Of The Town) on June 20, 1948, with composers Rodgers and Hammerstein also appearing. [...] Hoping to improve their act, the two hired young comedy writers Norman Lear and Ed Simmons to write their bits. With the assistance of both Lear and Simmons, the two would take their act beyond nightclubs.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of the Redvers family before Richard. In his Baronage of England (1675–6), William Dugdale wrongly {{identified}} Richard de Redvers with Richard the son of Baldwin FitzGilbert (also known as Baldwin de Meules) who was sheriff of Devon under William the Conqueror. This error was still being repeated in the late 19th century. In around 1890 The Complete Peerage advanced the alternative theory that Richard de Redvers {{was the son of}} William de Vernon, but later research has cast doubt on this too, suggesting that all that can be <b>said</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his father may have been Baldwin, one of three brothers named Redvers in Normandy in 1060; the other brothers being William, and Richard, who died in that year. Similarly nothing is known of Richard's early life. The Norman poet Wace, writing c.1170, mentions a [...] "sire de Reviers" [...] as one of those who accompanied William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings, but it is not known if this was Richard de Reviers.|$|E
2500|$|The protests {{captured}} the attention of the world and gained extensive global media coverage. Student leader Joshua Wong featured on the cover of Time magazine during the week of his 18th birthday, and the movement was written about, also as a cover story, the following week. While the local pan-democrats and the majority of the Western press supported the protesters' aspirations for universal suffrage, Martin Jacques, writing for The Guardian, argued that the PRC had [...] "overwhelmingly honoured its commitment to the principle of one country, two systems". He believed that the reason for the unrest is [...] "the growing sense of dislocation among a section of Hong Kong's population" [...] since 1997. Tim Summers, in an op-ed for CNN, said that the protests were fuelled by dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong government, but the catalyst was the decision of the NPCSC. Criticising politicians' and the media's interpretation of the agreements and undertakings of the PRC, Summers said [...] "all the Joint Declaration <b>said</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the chief executive will be 'appointed by the central people's government {{on the basis of the}} results of elections or consultations to be held locally [...]' Britain's role as co-signatory of that agreement gives it no legal basis for complaint on this particular point, and the lack of democracy for the executive branch before 1997 leaves it little moral high ground either." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of the Adana Inscription, little can be derived from sources other than Philostratus. [...] As James Francis put it, [...] "the most that can be <b>said</b> ... <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Apollonius {{appears to have been a}} wandering ascetic/philosopher/wonderworker of a type common to the eastern part of the early empire." [...] What we can safely assume is that he was indeed a Pythagorean and as such, in conformity with the Pythagorean tradition, opposed animal sacrifice, and lived on a frugal, strictly vegetarian diet. [...] A minimalist view is that he spent his entire life in the cities of his native Asia Minor (Turkey) and of northern Syria, in particular his home town of Tyana, Ephesus, Aegae, and Antioch, though the letters suggest wider travels, and there seems no reason to deny that, like many wandering philosophers, he at least visited Rome. [...] As for his philosophical convictions, we have an interesting, probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (On sacrifices), in which he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving nous (intellect), because he himself is pure nous, and nous is the greatest faculty of humankind.|$|E
