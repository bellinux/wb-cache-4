However, this instantaneous observation {{is not enough to}} explain other aspects (nucleation density, metastability level, etc.) that are in relation with the system evolution. Evolutionary variables must be introduced to account for experiments in systems of this kind. In this paper a parameter, the <b>supersaturation</b> <b>rate,</b> is quantified from experimental data of supersaturation evolution.

The experimental testing of both mass-transfer and pH evolution is the background to establish rigorous hypotheses. From these data, the actual distribution of free ions, ionic associations and supersaturation throughout the gel collumn may be found. In the case of nucleation of strontianite and witherite crystals, although the critical supersaturation conditions remain necessary, a second concept, the "equality range" of the reagent concentrations, has to be introdud to account for observations. With these dual conditions, the behaviour of the described gel-diffusion system is correctly reproduced. The significance of pH evolution is also experimentauy shown.

The overall charge-neutral zwitterionic hydrogel effectively recruited oppositely charged precursor ions while overcame excessive swelling exhibited by anionic and cationic hydrogels under physiological conditions, resulting in denser and structurally well-integrated mineralized composites. Further controls over the size, content, and spatial distribution of the mineral domains within the zwitterionic hydrogel are accomplished by facile adjustments of hydrogel crosslinking densities and the <b>supersaturation</b> <b>rate</b> governing heterogeneous mineral nucleation and growth.

Dilatometric and calorimetric curves present at ~ 500 °C an important effect related to the ? (Ag-rich) phase formation and consequently the matrix β (Cu-rich) depletion. The nucleation and growth of the precipitated phase show cells formation at initial grain boundaries; a fine lamellar structure is detected by SEM and TEM and consists of alternate lamellar of the α (Ag-rich) and β (Cu-rich) -solid solutions. Cellular precipitation leads to the simultaneous appearance of two diffraction peaks and occurs apparently according to the Fournelle and Clark’s mechanism. Obtained results give an Avrami exponent n = 2. 0 ± 0. 2 in agreement with an interfacial controlled process having an activation energy Ea equals to 99 ± 7 kJ/mol obtained from anisothermal analysis by using different isoconversion methods.

Among lake trout reared from eggs at chronic Delta P levels of 10 - 80 mm Hg, growth decreased and mortality increased 60 - 80 d after the swim-up stage.

40|$|Drug {{re-engineering}} is {{an effective}} method for engineering existing products in alternative dosage forms and with enhanced pharmacokinetics. Insulin {{for the management of}} diabetic symptoms is an ideal candidate for re-engineering. Current subcutaneous therapy results in low patient compliance and is ineffective in meeting the physiological need for post-prandial insulin. Implementation of dose titration for more efficient blood-glucose management is also inconvenient and uncomfortable. Inhaled insulin is presented as a superior alternative to current therapy. The lungs offer excellent access to the circulatory system. Aerosols suspended in inspired air may deposit on lung epithelia and be available for systemic absorption. To evade the defense mechanism of the human respiratory tract, particle sizes have traditionally been minimized to achieve necessary aerosol performance. Recent developments indicate that more efficient performance augmentation may also be achieved by decreasing the bulk density of powders and modifying surface characteristics. Light and fluffy powders with rough surfaces experience much higher drag forces within an airstream. The Atomized Rapid Injection for Solvent Extraction (ARISE) process is a unique precipitation platform devised by incorporating a rapid injection technique for energetic solution delivery into supercritical fluid (SCF) media to effect recovery of previously dissolved pharmaceutical compounds. The quasi-instantaneous delivery of solutions alleviates the drawbacks of the use of capillary nozzles or micro-orifices, gradual elution and mixing controlled precipitation kinetics in existing SCF precipitation techniques. Most importantly, the energetic release of solution into SCF media effects supersaturation over a much larger spatial volume and promotes the homogeneous precipitation of low bulk density powders. ARISE processed insulin powders displayed characteristics that were highly influenced by anti-solvent conditions and powders of different qualities were obtained as a function of anti-solvent pressures. At lower anti-solvent pressures, powders of narrow particle size distribution were achieved, an indication of homogeneous supersaturation levels within processing. Span, the index of size distribution was as low as 0. 991. At higher anti-solvent pressures, <b>supersaturation</b> <b>rates</b> were increased while mixing efficiencies decreased, resulting in powders of wider size distribution, and powder bulk densities as low as 0. 01 g/ml.

Here, general criteria that allow for coding fabrics of calcite composing stalagmites and flowstones is provided. Being based on known models of fabric development, the coding ascribes sequential numbers to each fabric, which reflect climaterelated parameters, such as changes in drip rate variability, bio-mediation or diagenetic modifications. Acronyms are proposed for Columnar types, Dendritic, Micrite, Microsparite and Mosaic fabrics, whose use could then render possible comparison of calcite fabrics in stalagmites and flowstones from diverse latitudinal and altitudinal settings. The climatic and environmental significance of similarities in the geochemical signals and trends analysed in coeval stalagmites and flowstones (or differences in the signals and trends) will be more robust when compared with fabric time series. This is particularly true where, such as in the Holocene, changes in geochemical values may be subtle, yet fabrics may show changes related to variations in <b>supersaturation,</b> drip <b>rate</b> or input of detrital particles or organic compounds.

The objective of the current work {{was to develop a}} crystallization process for the {{production of}} respirable microparticles of salmeterol xinafoate (SX) with a controlled particle size distribution (PSD). Solvation of SX in aqueous poly(ethylene glycol) 400 (PEG 400) was investigated using HPLC and FTIR. SX was crystallized from PEG 400 solutions by the addition of water under a variety of conditions of <b>supersaturation,</b> addition <b>rate</b> of antisolvent and stirring speed. The crystals were filtered, dried at 50 degrees C and their PSDs were determined by laser diffraction. A logarithmic increase in solubility of SX was observed with increasing concentration of PEG 400 in water enabling the aqueous antisolvent crystallization of SX from PEG. Similar to antisolvent crystallization from conventional solvents, a 2 (4) factorial study showed the particle size to decrease with increasing supersaturation. The PSD also depended on the balance of meso- and micromixing determined by the crystallization conditions. In particular a high addition rate (200 g min(- 1)) and low stirrer speed (400 rpm) minimized the median diameter (2. 54 +/- 0. 40 mu m) and produced a narrow PSD (90 % < 8. 67 +/- 0. 77 mu m) of SX particles.

The ordering of opal-CT takes place in the solid state, whereas the conversion of opal-CT takes place through dissolution-reprecipitation involving the aqueous phase. It is proposed that the rate of conversion of opal-CT to quartz is controlled by diffusion of defects out of a disordered surface layer formed on the crystallizing quartz.

The model ions are Calcium Oxalate ions, and the dimensionless supersaturation is 2. 5. In this research project, an optical setup for determining shear induced agglomeration rate constants has been improved. A Couette-flow device is used to generate a constant shear flow. In order to determine the particle size and number concentration, a non-intrusive, optical system is used. The optical setup is based on a CCD camera, to record enlarged images, and a pulsed laser, to illuminate the suspension. The use of the laser results in images that consist of speckles. A computer algorithm is developed to remove the speckles. Subsequently, the particle size and number is obtained. Determining the agglomeration rate constant by means of the increase of the particle size proves to be inaccurate. Measuring the decrease of the particle number concentration in time gives good results, suitable for determining the agglomeration rate constant.

At 40 oC, saturated solutions with solvent water contents from 35 to 65 % w/w show a phase separation into two liquid layers. The metastable zone width for primary nucleation is substantial, but is much narrower for secondary nucleation. None the less, growth rates in this narrow secondary metastable zone are still significant and this region, with care, can be used for non-nucleating seeded batch crystallizations. Crystal growth rates were found to be first order with <b>supersaturation,</b> with growth <b>rate</b> constants increasing with temperature [activation energy = 23. 4 (± 50 %) kJ/mol] and within the accuracy of measurement not changing with the solvent water content...|$|R
