25|$|For safety {{reasons the}} modules were {{organised}} {{so that the}} most dangerous operations were distant from the personnel areas. The conversion from oil to gas broke this <b>safety</b> <b>concept,</b> {{with the result that}} sensitive areas were brought together; for example, the gas compression next to the control room, which {{played a role in the}} accident. It produced crude oil and natural gas from 24 wells for delivery to the Flotta oil terminal on Orkney and to other installations by three separate pipelines. At the time of the disaster, Piper was one of the heaviest platforms (along with Magnus and Brae B) operating in the North Sea.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the early}} {{adoption}} of ISO 26262 by the automotive industry, managing functional {{safety in the}} early phases of system development remains a challenge. One key problem is how to efficiently keep safety assurance artifacts up-to-date considering the recurrent requirements changes during the system's lifecycle. Here, {{there is a real}} demand for means to support the creation, modification, and reuse of safety assurance documents, like the <b>Safety</b> <b>Concepts</b> described in ISO 26262. One major aspect of this challenge is inconsistency between <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> and system architecture. Usually created by different teams at different times and in different contexts of the development environment, these artifacts are often completely disassociated. This becomes even more evident when system maintenance is necessary; in this case, the inconsistencies result in intensive efforts to update the <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> impacted by the changes, and, consequently, significantly decrease the efficiency and efficacy of safety assurance. To overcome this challenge, we propose a model-based formalization approach for specifying <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> that allows creating precise traces to architectural elements while specifying <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> using natural language. We observed that our approach minimize the inconsistencies between safety models and architecture models, and offers basis to perform automated completeness and consistency checks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Product line {{engineering}} is applied in many engineering do-mains. It {{is used to}} save development time by reusing system compo-nents in an organized way. While developing safety critical systems this approach {{is complicated by the}} fact, that <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> on higher ab-straction levels need to be fulfilled by the different variants of the system. This typical leads to the creation of individual <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> for each variant or the analysis of the fulfillment of the <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> by all variants, both very costly efforts. In this paper we present an approach to enable multiple variants to use one common functional safety con-cept, while having different technical implementations at the low level. We specify safety properties such as potential faults and failure propa-gation as well as independence assumptions on them for the functional components as well as for technical ones. This information is used to create constraints for the variability models allowing only to configure safe variants. We focus on detecting the violation of independence as-sumption due to allocation decisions that are typically mainly driven by functional needs, disregarding safety properties. An implementation based on the tool pure::variants and the SAFE framework is presented that creates variants based on EAST-ADL and AUTOSAR...|$|R

40|$|Global {{advances}} in patient safety have been {{hampered by the}} lack of a uniform classification of patient <b>safety</b> <b>concepts.</b> This is a significant barrier to developing strategies to reduce risk, performing evidence-based research and evaluating existing healthcare policies relevant to patient safety. Since 2005, the World Health Organizationâ€™s World Alliance for Patient Safety has undertaken the Project to Develop an International Classification for Patient Safety (ICPS) to devise a classification which transforms patient safety information collected from disparate systems into a common format to facilitate aggregation, analysis and learning across disciplines, borders and time. A drafting group, comprised of experts from the fields of patient safety, classification theory, health informatics, consumer/patient advocacy, law and medicine, identified and defined key patient <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> and developed an internationally agreed conceptual framework for the ICPS based upon existing patient safety classifications. The conceptual framework was iteratively improved through technical expert meetings and a two-stage web-based modified Delph...|$|R
40|$|These are the {{proceedings}} of the 6 th International Probabilistic Workshop, formerly known as Dresden Probabilistic Symposium or International Probabilistic Symposium. The workshop was held twice in Dresden, then it moved to Vienna, Berlin, Ghent and finally to Darmstadt in 2008. All of the conference cities feature some specialities. However, Darmstadt features a very special property: The element number 110 was named Darmstadtium after Darmstadt: There are only very few cities worldwide after which a chemical element is named. The high element number 110 of Darmstadtium indicates, that much research is still required and carried out. This is also true for the issue of probabilistic <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> in engineering. Although the history of probabilistic <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> can be traced back nearly 90 years, for the practical applications {{a long way to go}} still remains. This is not a disadvantage. Just as research chemists strive to discover new element properties, with the application of new probabilistic techniques we may advance the properties of structures substantially.

40|$|Fault {{injection}} testing approaches {{assess the}} reliability of execution environments for critical software. They support the early testing of <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> that mitigate the impact of hardware failures on software behavior. The growing use of platform software for embedded systems raises the need to verify <b>safety</b> <b>concepts</b> that execute on top of operating systems and middleware platforms. Current fault injection techniques consider the resulting software stack as one black box and attempt to test the reaction of all components {{in the context of}} faults. This leads to very high software complexity and consequently requires a very high number of fault injection experiments. Testing the software components, such as control functions, operating systems, and middleware, individually would lead to a significant reduction of the number of experiments required. In this paper, we illustrate our novel approach for fault injection testing, which considers the components of a software stack, enables re-use of previously collected evidences, allows focusing testing on highly critical parts of the control software, and significantly lowers the number of experiments required...|$|R
