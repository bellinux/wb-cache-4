25|$|A device which {{produces}} converging or diverging light rays due to refraction {{is known as}} a lens. Lenses are characterized by their focal length: a converging lens has positive focal length, while a diverging lens has negative focal length. Smaller focal length indicates that the lens has a stronger converging or diverging effect. The focal length of a <b>simple</b> <b>lens</b> in air is given by the lensmaker's equation.|$|E
25|$|A lens is a {{transmissive}} {{optical device}} that focuses or disperses a light beam {{by means of}} refraction. A <b>simple</b> <b>lens</b> consists of {{a single piece of}} transparent material, while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or moulded to a desired shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.|$|E
25|$|The ocelli {{of insects}} bear a <b>simple</b> <b>lens,</b> but their focal point always lies behind the retina; {{consequently}} {{they can never}} form a sharp image. Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image across the whole retina, and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush {{the information to the}} brain. Focusing the image would also cause the sun's image to be focused on a few receptors, with the possibility of damage under the intense light; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are subject}} to the optical aberrations {{discussed}} above. In many cases these aberrations can be compensated for to a great extent by using a combination of <b>simple</b> <b>lenses</b> with complementary aberrations. A compound lens is a collection of <b>simple</b> <b>lenses</b> of different shapes and made of materials of different refractive indices, arranged one after the other with a common axis.|$|R

5000|$|Elements are the {{individual}} lenses, which {{may come as}} <b>simple</b> <b>lenses</b> or [...] "singlets" [...] and cemented doublets or (rarely) triplets. When lenses are cemented together in pairs or triples, the combined elements are called groups (of lenses).|$|R
25|$|The idea of {{an image}} tube was first {{proposed}} by G. Holst and H. De Boer (Netherlands) in 1928 , but early attempts to create one were not successful. It was not until 1934 that Holst, working for Philips, created the first successful infrared converter tube. This tube consisted of a photocathode in proximity to a fluorescent screen. Using a <b>simple</b> <b>lens,</b> an image {{was focused on the}} photocathode and a potential difference of several thousand volts was maintained across the tube, causing electrons dislodged from the photocathode by photons to strike the fluorescent screen. This caused the screen to light up with the image of the object focused onto the screen, however the image was non-inverting. With this image converter type tube, it was possible to view infrared light in real time, for the first time.|$|E

50|$|In optics, a <b>simple</b> <b>lens</b> or singlet lens is a lens {{consisting}} of a single simple element. Typical examples include a magnifying glass or a lens {{in a pair of}} simple reading glasses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are prone}} to aberrations, {{especially}} chromatic aberration. They cannot be used for precise imaging and make poor camera lenses. They are commonly used for laser applications, however, where the beams are both monochromatic (minimizing chromatic aberration) and narrow (minimizing spherical aberration).|$|R
25|$|More complex are {{aspheric}} lenses. These are lenses {{where one}} or both surfaces have a shape that is neither spherical nor cylindrical. The more complicated shapes allow such lenses to form images with less aberration than standard <b>simple</b> <b>lenses,</b> but they are more difficult and expensive to produce.|$|R
50|$|Cylindrical: A {{cylindrical}} Fresnel lens {{is equivalent}} to a <b>simple</b> cylindrical <b>lens,</b> using straight segments with circular cross-section, focusing light on a single line. This type produces a sharp image, although not quite as clear as the equivalent <b>simple</b> cylindrical <b>lens</b> due to diffraction {{at the edges of}} the ridges.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to a telephoto lens, for any given focal length a <b>simple</b> <b>lens</b> of non-telephoto design is constructed from one lens (which can, to minimize aberrations, consist of several elements to form an achromatic lens). To focus on an object at infinity, the distance from this single lens to focal plane of the camera (where the sensor or film is respectively) has to be adjusted to this focal length. For example, given a focal length of 500 mm, the distance between lens and focal plane is 500 mm. The farther the focal length is increased, the more the physical length of such a <b>simple</b> <b>lens</b> makes it unwieldy.|$|E
50|$|Lensbaby {{is a line}} {{of camera}} lenses for SLR cameras that combine a <b>simple</b> <b>lens</b> with a bellows or ball and socket {{mechanism}} for use in special-effect photography. A lensbaby can give effects normally associated with view cameras. The lenses are for use in selective focus photography and bokeh effects.|$|E

50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{it consists}} of an outer case with mirrors at each end set {{parallel to each other}} at a 45° angle. This form of periscope, with the addition of two <b>simple</b> <b>lenses,</b> served for observation purposes in the trenches during World War I. Military personnel also use periscopes in some gun turrets and in armoured vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Spherical: A spherical Fresnel lens is {{equivalent}} to a <b>simple</b> spherical <b>lens,</b> using ring-shaped segments that are each {{a portion of a}} sphere, that all focus light on a single point. This type of lens produces a sharp image, although not quite as clear as the equivalent <b>simple</b> spherical <b>lens</b> due to diffraction {{at the edges of the}} ridges.|$|R
50|$|Commonly, a {{microscope}} objective {{is used to}} collect the object wave front. However, as the microscope objective is only used to collect light and not to form an image, it may {{be replaced by a}} <b>simple</b> <b>lens.</b> If a slightly lower optical resolution is acceptable, the microscope objective may be entirely removed.|$|E
50|$|Some cameras with fixed lenses {{have been}} made using a <b>simple</b> <b>lens,</b> usually a {{meniscus}} lens with the convex face facing outward. In such examples the lens aperture is made small {{and in some cases}} (such as the Kodak Brownie 127 camera), the film plane is curved to reduce the impact of aberrations.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{versions}} of Königs can use improved glass, or add more lenses, grouped into various combinations of doublets and singlets. The most typical adaptation {{is to add}} a positive, concave-convex <b>simple</b> <b>lens</b> before the doublet, with the concave face towards the light source and the convex surface facing the doublet. Modern improvements typically have fields of view of 60°−70°.|$|E
5000|$|In optics, a doublet {{is a type}} of lens made up of two <b>simple</b> <b>lenses</b> paired together. Such an {{arrangement}} allows more optical surfaces, thicknesses, and formulations, especially as the space between lenses may be considered an [...] "element." [...] With additional degrees of freedom, optical designers have more latitude to correct more optical aberrations more thoroughly.|$|R
50|$|Despite the name, {{they are}} in fact always fully {{functional}} and capable of taking photographs, albeit with optical aberrations due to the limitations of the <b>simple</b> <b>lenses.</b> From the 1990s onward there has been interest in the artistic use of such cameras, both those designed for children such as the Diana, and others originally intended as mass-market consumer cameras such as the Lomo LC-A, Lubitel, and Holga.|$|R

50|$|In {{photography}} and videography, a lens adapter is {{a device that}} {{enables the use of}} camera and lens combinations from otherwise incompatible systems. The most <b>simple</b> <b>lens</b> adapter designs, passive lens adapters provide a secure physical connection between the camera and the lens. Some passive adapters may include a mechanism for manual iris control. So called, active lens adapters will include electronic connections, enabling communication between the lens and the camera.|$|E
50|$|The Fresnel lens {{reduces the}} amount of {{material}} required compared to a conventional lens by dividing the lens into a set of concentric annular sections. An ideal Fresnel lens would have infinitely many such sections. In each section, the overall thickness is decreased compared to an equivalent <b>simple</b> <b>lens.</b> This effectively divides the continuous surface of a standard lens into a set of surfaces of the same curvature, with stepwise discontinuities between them.|$|E
50|$|The {{optical axis}} is an {{imaginary}} line {{that defines the}} path along which light propagates through the system, up to first approximation. For a system composed of <b>simple</b> <b>lenses</b> and mirrors, the axis passes {{through the center of}} curvature of each surface, and coincides with the axis of rotational symmetry. The optical axis is often coincident with the system's mechanical axis, but not always, {{as in the case of}} off-axis optical systems.|$|R

40|$|Imaging {{systems that}} exploit arrays of photodetectors in {{curvilinear}} layouts are attractive {{due to their}} ability to match the strongly nonplanar image surfaces (i. e., Petzval surfaces) that form with <b>simple</b> <b>lenses,</b> thereby creating new design options. Recent work has yielded significant progress in the realization of such “eyeball” cameras, including examples of fully functional silicon devices capable of collecting realistic images. Although these systems provide advantages compared to those with conventional, planar designs, their fixed detector curvature renders them incompatible with changes in the Petzval surface that accompany variable zoom achieved with <b>simple</b> <b>lenses.</b> This paper describes a class of digital imaging device that overcomes this limitation, through the use of photodetector arrays on thin elastomeric membranes, capable of reversible deformation into hemispherical shapes with radii of curvature that can be adjusted dynamically, via hydraulics. Combining this type of detector with a similarly tunable, fluidic plano-convex lens yields a hemispherical camera with variable zoom and excellent imaging characteristics. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies of the mechanics and optics reveal all underlying principles of operation. This type of technology could be useful for night-vision surveillance, endoscopic imaging, and other areas that require compact cameras with simple zoom optics and wide-angle fields of view...|$|R
5000|$|Doublets {{can come}} in many forms, though most {{commercial}} doublets are achromats, which are optimized to reduce chromatic aberration while also reducing spherical aberration and other optical aberrations. The lenses are made from glasses with different refractive indices and different amounts of dispersion. Often one element is made from crown glass and the other from flint glass. This combination produces a better image than a <b>simple</b> <b>lens.</b> Some Trilobites, which are now extinct, had natural doublet lenses in their eyes. [...] Apochromats can also be made as doublets.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1700s, small, easily {{portable}} box-form units {{equipped with a}} <b>simple</b> <b>lens,</b> an internal mirror, and a ground glass screen had become popular among affluent amateurs for making sketches of landscapes and architecture. The camera was pointed at the scene and steadied, a sheet of thin paper was placed {{on top of the}} ground glass, then a pencil or pen could be used to trace over the image projected from within. The beautiful but fugitive little light-paintings on the screen inspired several people to seek some way of capturing them more completely and effectively—and automatically—by means of chemistry.|$|E

The greenhouse would consist of a thick skin providing thermal insulation, with small transparent windows to admit sunlight.

50|$|Zemax is {{an optical}} design {{program that is}} used to design and analyze imaging systems such as camera lenses, as well as {{illumination}} systems. It works by ray tracing—modelling the propagation of rays through an optical system. It can model the effect of optical elements such as <b>simple</b> <b>lenses,</b> aspheric lenses, gradient-index lenses, mirrors, and diffractive optical elements, and can produce standard analysis diagrams such as spot diagrams and ray-fan plots. Zemax can also model the effect of optical coatings on the surfaces of components. It includes a library of stock commercial lenses. Zemax can perform standard sequential ray tracing through optical elements, non-sequential ray tracing for analysis of stray light, and physical optics beam propagation. It also has tolerancing capability, to allow analysis of the effect of manufacturing defects and assembly errors.|$|R
