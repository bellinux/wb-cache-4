5|$|The next day, Black finds a {{group of}} obelisks in the woods. He is about to examine one when Beebe appears, chased by dogs. The Old Man also arrives, and Black asks him to call off his dogs. The Old Man denies the dogs are his, but they retreat regardless. Black then sees that the obelisks all bear an ouroboros, {{the symbol of the}} Millennium Group. He visits the Old Man's home, where the two speak about the Group and its symbolism, and the coming millennium. The Old Man then brings Black to a {{clearing}} full of the wild dogs, where the latter realizes they are embodiments of the evil in the world. He approaches them as stands his ground, being struck by several visions as he does so. The Old Man then explains that the world's balance between good and evil is being lost as the millennium approaches, and that Beebe's home, built on sacred ground, {{is one of the many}} <b>small</b> <b>things</b> upsetting this balance.|$|E

When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even <b>small</b> <b>things</b> like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E
5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of <b>small</b> <b>things</b> used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E

The debut novel of Arundhati Roy, The God of <b>Small</b> <b>Things</b> (1997), also has themes surrounding the caste system across religions.

25|$|According to her {{original}} afterword to Aqua volume 2, Kozue Amano's goal {{in writing the}} series was to have readers find happiness in <b>small</b> <b>things</b> and so not focus on their failures. In another afterword, she stated that writing Aria has forced her {{to pay attention to}} the four seasons and that she hopes the series shows her appreciation for them. Amano developed a 24 month calendar system for Aqua, based on Mars's real orbital period of 668.6 local days (see Timekeeping on Mars), making every season 6 months long; Amano marked the passage of time and the seasons throughout the series through such means as Akari explicitly telling her correspondent the time of year and depicting seasonal observances such as fireworks at the end of summer (Aqua volume 2, Navigation 9 and Aria volume 4, Navigation 20), New Year's Eve (Aria volume 2, Navigation 9), or birthdays of characters (Aria volume 10, Navigation 46).|$|E

Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode, particularly the characters Tom and Ann.

Shakira's vocal range spans from E3 to B4. The song contains instrumentation from the bandoneón, which is played at a [...] "breakneck speed," [...] and also features a [...] "twanging" [...] guitar solo. Lyrically, [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] is dramatic and humorous in approach and focuses on an angered Shakira ordering her love interest to choose between her and his other leading lady; it was said to be a feminist anthem and a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train". It contains a line in which Shakira asserts to her lover that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/ That’s why in front of your eyes I'm invisible/ But you gotta know <b>small</b> <b>things</b> also count," [...] which a critic commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers."

500|$|Between 2008 and 2011 Lancashire narrated the BBC One series Lark Rise to Candleford, {{a costume}} drama based on Flora Thompson's memoir of her Oxfordshire {{childhood}} in the 1880s. In April, {{she appeared in}} the opening episode of the 2008 series [...] of Doctor Who, as [...] "an enigmatic and powerful businesswoman" [...] who Lancashire described as a [...] "warped Mary Poppins". She was amongst a number of high-profile actors the series' executive producer Russell T Davies secured for the fourth series of the science-fiction drama {{as part of his}} intention to make it [...] "bigger and blowsier". In 2009, Lancashire starred in the BBC One musical drama series All the <b>Small</b> <b>Things.</b> She played Esther Caddick, a full-time mother who starts a choir after her husband leaves her for a more glamorous woman. In July that year the actress was made a honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Huddersfield. Following this, she reunited with director Coky Giedroyc, who had directed her in Oliver Twist, for a 2009 television adaptation of Emily Brontë's 1847 novel Wuthering Heights in which she played housekeeper Nelly Dean. In 2010 Lancashire portrayed Rosemary Nicholls, mother of a murder victim, in the three-part BBC drama Five Daughters; a depiction of the Ipswich serial murders {{from the perspective of the}} victims and their families. Though the pair never met, Lancashire felt it important to receive Nicholls consent before filming, and was later [...] "humbled" [...] and [...] "relieved" [...] to receive a feedback letter thanking her for her portrayal.

It's all there: the suits, the setting, and the bong-water video effects". Jordan Sargent of Spin said that Mars wasn't trying to hide the Michael Jackson influence on the video, writing [...] "new low-def makes obvious — compare it next to, say, the video for [...] "Rock with You"". Similarly, Robbie Daw, from the Idolator website, drew {{attention to the fact that}} the song and dance had already been seen during the performance on Billboard Music Awards in May, since [...] "Mars and his band seem to have recreated that very same performance for this clip". He also wrote that the video was [...] "still a fun three minutes to sit through", mainly because [...] "Bruno mimics MJ's [...] "Rock With You" [...] moves so deftly". According to Joseph Atilano of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, [...] "everything from the choreography, stage lighting, and so on, serve as a heartfelt ode to that era". He wrote [...] "visually, the music video is tricked out with set pieces such as a disco ball and vintage stage lights.

TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the <b>small</b> <b>things</b> this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film."
