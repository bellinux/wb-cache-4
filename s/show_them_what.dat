5|$|The team worked {{alongside}} {{artists and}} DJ's for incorporation of songs into the game. Neil stated they brought to artists and DJ's working prototypes {{of the game}} and hardware to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> the sampled music and final mixes sounded like, garnering interest from these groups. This led to securing of rights from several groups for their songs, though this did occur late in the development process. Mixing with celebrity DJ's was performed either though electronic communications, or at FreeStyleGames' studios or the homes or studios of the DJ's themselves; the team outlined the goals {{of the game and}} requested mixes that emphasized the gameplay featured, but avoided hampering the creativity of the artists.|$|E

25|$|Marton and Canutt filmed {{the entire}} chariot {{sequence}} with stunt doubles in long shot, edited the footage together, {{and showed the}} footage to Zimbalist, Wyler, and Heston to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> the race should look like and to indicate where close-up shots with Heston and Boyd should go. Seven thousand extras were hired to cheer in the stands. Economic conditions in Italy were poor at the time, and as shooting for the chariot scene wound down only 1,500 extras were needed on any given day. On June 6, more than 3,000 people seeking work were turned away. The crowd rioted, throwing stones and assaulting the set's gates until police arrived and dispersed them. Dynamite charges were used to show the chariot wheels and axles splintering {{from the effects of}} Messala's barbed-wheel attacks. Three lifelike dummies were placed at key points in the race to give the appearance of men being run over by chariots.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 Copenhagen-based Danish {{urban design}} {{consultant}} Jan Gehl {{was hired by}} the New York City Department of Transportation to re-imagine New York City streets by introducing designs to improve life for pedestrians and cyclists. In this connection, Gehl took NYC planning chief Amanda Burden and transportation czar Janette Sadik-Khan on a bike trip around Copenhagen to <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> could be done for New York. Former British transport minister Andrew Adonis has also cycled the streets of Copenhagen in search of inspiration. As a result of Russian president Dmitri Medvedev's favorable impressions of Copenhagen's biking system during his visit to Denmark, 14 city bikes were sent to St Petersburg at the beginning of June 2010 where they will be available to citizens on an experimental basis. Medvedev believes the city bike approach could reduce traffic congestion in the city. The Danish pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai had been specially designed by BIG Architects. It allowed visitors to gain experience of cycling in Copenhagen by taking one of its 300 city bikes along the cycle paths which were incorporated throughout the structure. and city has since signed its first sister cities agreement with Beijing with a major goal of the cooperation being to provide inspiration to Beijing on how it can reintroduce the bicycle as a major mode of transport in the city.|$|E

2500|$|MTV praised Perry's vocals, though {{felt the}} lyrics were [...] "clunky". Slant Magazine {{stated that the}} song is [...] "not an {{actively}} painful listen. Sure, the would-be inspirational lyrics ('Baby you're a firework/Come on <b>show</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> you're worth') are nonsensical, ... but the chorus gains some momentum and the song would work well enough in a club setting that you could forgive its otherwise glaring weaknesses." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic chose [...] "Firework" [...] among the top tracks on the album, Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song five out of five stars, calling it [...] "a straight up self-empowerment anthem wrapped in a Coldplay-on-poppers club banger from the Stargate team."
