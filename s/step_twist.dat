40|$|Abstract. Skewing {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods to reduce the cogging torque of {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors. This technique may cause manufacturing troubles such as impossible automatic slot filling due to skewing stator slot. One method to overcome this problem is to use the <b>step</b> <b>twisted</b> stator structure with shifted slot opening. Compared to other methods of skewing, in the presented method, the stator slots are still straight slots and the skewing effect is implemented by shifting slot openings coupled with a <b>step</b> <b>twisted</b> stator design. This paper discusses the use of the <b>step</b> <b>twisted</b> stator structure with shifted slot opening and the associated effects on machine performance. We address the cogging torque, average torque, torque ripple, and back-EMF and its total harmonic distortion (THD). We examine the results using finite element analysis (FEA) ...|$|R

The kata consists of kicks, punches, sweeps, strikes and blocks. Body movement in various kata includes <b>stepping,</b> <b>twisting,</b> turning, dropping to the ground, and jumping. In Shotokan, kata is a performance or a demonstration, with every technique potentially a killing blow (ikken hisatsu)—while paying particular attention to form and timing (rhythm). As the karateka grows older, more emphasis is placed on the health benefits of practicing kata, promoting fitness while keeping the body soft, supple, and agile.|$|R

Also, microhardness measurements showed that the sample has fairly good homogeneity through both axial and radial directions.

40|$|AbstractThe twist {{flexibility}} of DNA {{is central to}} its many biological functions. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations in combination with an umbrella sampling restraining potential have been employed to study induced twist deformations in DNA. Simulations allowed us to extract free energy profiles for twist deformations and were performed on six DNA dodecamer duplexes to cover all 10 possible DNA basepair steps. The shape of the free energy curves was similar for all duplexes. The calculated twist deformability was in good agreement with experiment and showed only modest variation for the complete duplexes. However, {{the response of the}} various basepair <b>steps</b> on <b>twist</b> stress was highly nonuniform. In particular, pyrimidine/purine steps were much more flexible than purine/purine steps followed by purine/pyrimidine steps. It was also possible to extract correlations of twist changes and other helical as well as global parameters of the DNA molecules. Twist deformations were found to significantly alter the local as well as global shape of the DNA modulating the accessibility for proteins and other ligands. Severe untwisting of DNA below an average of 25 ° per basepair step resulted in the onset of a global structural transition with a significantly smaller twist {{at one end of the}} DNA compared to the other...|$|R

40|$|We have {{constructed}} the potential energy surfaces for all unique tetramers, hexamers and octamers in double helical DNA, {{as a function}} of the two principal degrees of freedom, slide and shift at the central step. From these potential energy maps, we have calculated a database of structural and flexibility properties for each of these sequences. These properties include: the values of each of the six <b>step</b> parameters (<b>twist</b> roll, tilt, rise, slide and shift), for each step of the sequence; flexibility measures for both decrease and increase in each property value from the minimum energy conformation for the central step; and the deviation from the path of a hypothetical straight octamer. In an analysis of structural change {{as a function of}} sequence length, we observe that almost all DNA tends to B-DNA and becomes less flexible. A more detailed analysis of octamer properties has allowed us to determine the structural preferences of particular sequence elements. GGC and GCC sequences tend to confer bistability, low stability and a predisposition to A-form DNA, whereas AA steps strongly prefer B-DNA and inhibit A-structures. There is no correlation between flexibility and intrinsic curvature, but bent DNA is less stable than straight. The most difficult deformation is undertwisting. The TA step stands out as the most flexible sequence element with respect to decreasing twist and increasing roll. However, as with the structural properties, this behavior is highly context-dependent and some TA steps are very straight...|$|R

A structural model and an aeroelastic model are provided and a computer program has been developed and tested in this research. In the structural model, second-order backward Euler method is used to discretize the nonlinear intrinsic formulation for the dynamics of rotating blades in time. Newton method is used to solve the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations. The solution describes the displacement field, stress and strain field at each time <b>step</b> of <b>twist</b> composite hingeless or articulated rotor blades under the action of arbitrary external loads. Results are validated by experimental data and other numerical simulation work for various conditions. Then the aerodynamic model implemented via the GENUVP code is integrated with the structural model to form an aeroelastic simulation. The aeroelastic analysis is realized in time domain by exchanging information with two interfaces and performing consecutive aerodynamic and structural time steps. In the aeroelastic analysis, the steady state of a fixed wing at different flight speeds have been obtained and {{results are consistent with}} other methods. The time response of the active twist rotor (ATR) prototype blade in hover has also been examined. The twist response of ATR blade due to applied piezoelectric actuation is obtained and the result compared with published results. A good qualitative agreement between the present aeroelastic solution and reference results was obtained. However, quantitative discrepancies were encountered that strongly suggest that further improvements on the coupling between the two codes are needed. For all the aeroelastic test cases using the GENUVP code, no sub-iterations within a time step was used. A study considering a simple quasi-steady aerodynamics indicated that a sub-iteration in each time step may be critical to the accuracy of the final aeroelastic result.

(ii) We show that the large class of asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau 3 -folds built from semi-Fano 3 -folds (a subclass of weak Fano 3 -folds) can be used as components in the twisted connected sum construction. (iii) We construct many new topological types of compact G 2 -manifolds by applying the twisted connected sum to asymptotically Calabi-Yau 3 -folds of semi-Fano type studied in [18]. (iv) We obtain much more precise topological information about twisted connected sum G 2 -manifolds; one application is the determination for the first time of the diffeo-morphism type of many compact G 2 -manifolds. (v) We describe “geometric transitions ” between G 2 -metrics on different 7 -manifolds mim-icking “flopping ” behaviour among semi-Fano 3 -folds and “conifold transitions ” between Fano and semi-Fano 3 -folds. (vi) We construct many G 2 -manifolds that contain rigid compact associative 3 -folds. (vii) We prove that many smooth 2 -connected 7 -manifolds can be realised as twisted con-nected sums in numerous ways; by varying the building blocks matched we can vary the number of rigid associative 3 -folds constructed therein. The latter result leads to speculation that the moduli space of G 2 -metrics on a given 7 -manifold may consist of many different connected components, and opens up many further questions for future study. For instance, the higher-dimensional gauge theory invariants pro-posed by Donaldson may provide ways to detect G 2 -metrics on a given 7 -manifold that are not deformation equivalent. 1...|$|R
