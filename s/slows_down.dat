5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and <b>slows</b> <b>down</b> the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E

Three plasma components, electrons, ions and dust particles, can have different kappa-parameter. We derive the deceleration factor (the velocity moment equation) and the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> time of a test particle, and numerically study the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> properties of an electron beam, a proton beam and a dust particle beam, respectively, in the kappa-distributed dusty plasma. We show that the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> properties of particle beams depend strongly on the kappa-parameters of the plasma components, and the dust component plays a dominant role in the <b>slowing</b> <b>down.</b> And the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> also depends on mass and charge of the dust particles in the dusty plasma.

40|$|BACKGROUND: 2 ̆ 7 <b>Slowing</b> <b>down</b> {{when you}} should 2 ̆ 7 has been {{described}} as marking the transition from 2 ̆ 7 automatic 2 ̆ 7 to 2 ̆ 7 effortful 2 ̆ 7 functioning in professional practice. The ability to 2 ̆ 7 <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 is hypothesized as an important factor in expert judgment. This study explored the nature of the 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 phenomenon intraoperatively and its link to surgical judgment. METHODS: Twenty-eight surgeons across different surgical specialties were interviewed from four hospitals affiliated with a large urban university. In grounded theory tradition, data were collected and analyzed in an iterative design, using a constant comparative approach. Emergent themes were identified and a conceptual framework was developed. RESULTS: Surgeons recognized the 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 phenomenon acknowledging its link to judgment and described two main initiators. Proactively planned 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 moments were anticipated preoperatively from operation-specific (tying superior thyroid vessels) or patient-specific (imaging abnormality) factors. Surgeons also described situationally responsive 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 moments to unexpected events (encountering an adherent tumor). Surgeons described several influencing factors on the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> phenomenon (fatigue, confidence). CONCLUSIONS: This framework for 2 ̆ 7 <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> 2 ̆ 7 assists in making tangible the previously elusive construct of surgical judgment, providing a vocabulary for considering the events surrounding these critical moments in surgery, essential for teaching, self-reflection, and patient safety...|$|R

5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism <b>slows</b> <b>down,</b> its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E

For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism <b>slows</b> <b>down</b> and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E

40|$|Shafieloo ea al. firstly {{proposed}} {{the possibility that}} the current cosmic acceleration (CA) is <b>slowing</b> <b>down.</b> However, this is rather counterintuitive because a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA cannot be accommodated in most mainstream cosmological models. In this work, by exploring the evolutionary trajectories of dark energy equation of state w(z) and deceleration parameter q(z), we present a comprehensive investigation on the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> of CA from both the theoretical and the observational sides. For the theoretical side, we study the impact of different w(z) by using six parametrization models, and then discuss the effects of spatial curvature. For the observational side, we investigate the effects of different type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), different baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and different cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, respectively. We find that (1) The evolution of CA are insensitive to the specific form of w(z); in contrast, a non-flat Universe more favors a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA than a flat Universe. (2) SNLS 3 SNe Ia datasets favor a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA at 1 σ confidence level, while JLA SNe Ia samples prefer an eternal CA; in contrast, the effects of different BAO data are negligible. (3) Compared with CMB distance prior data, full CMB data more favor a <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> CA. (4) Due to the low significance, the <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> of CA is still a theoretical possibility that cannot be confirmed by the current observations.

5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually <b>slows</b> <b>down</b> before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
