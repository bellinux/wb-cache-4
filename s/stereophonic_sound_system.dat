5000|$|The {{replacement}} of the relatively fragile thermionic valve (vacuum tube) by the smaller, lighter-weight, cooler-running, less expensive, more robust, and less power-hungry transistor also accelerated the sale of consumer high-fidelity [...] "hi-fi" [...] <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> from the 1960s onward. In the 1950s, most record players were monophonic and had relatively low sound quality. Few consumers could afford high-quality <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>systems.</b> In the 1960s, American manufacturers introduced {{a new generation of}} [...] "modular" [...] hi-fi components [...] - [...] separate turntables, pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, both combined as integrated amplifiers, tape recorders, and other ancillary equipment like the graphic equaliser, which could be connected together to create a complete home <b>sound</b> <b>system.</b> These developments were rapidly taken up by major Japanese electronics companies, which soon flooded the world market with relatively affordable, high-quality transistorized audio components. By the 1980s, corporations like Sony had become world leaders in the music recording and playback industry.|$|R
5000|$|Some well-equipped theaters have [...] "interlock" [...] {{projectors}} {{which allow}} {{two or more}} projectors and sound units to be run in unison by connecting them electronically or mechanically. This set up {{can be used to}} project two prints in sync (for dual-projector 3-D) or to [...] "interlock" [...] one or more sound tracks to a single film. Sound interlocks were used for <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>systems</b> before the advent of magnetic film prints. Fantasound (developed by RCA in 1940 for Disney's Fantasia) was an early interlock system. Likewise, early stereophonic films such as This Is Cinerama and House of Wax utilized a separate, magnetic oxide-coated film to reproduce up to six or more tracks of <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound.</b> Datasat Digital Entertainment, purchaser of DTS's cinema division in May 2008, uses a time code printed on and read off of the film to synchronize with a CD-ROM in the sound track, allowing multi-channel soundtracks or foreign language tracks. This is not considered a projector interlock, however.This practice is most common with blockbuster movies. Muvico Theaters, Regal Entertainment Group, Pacific Theatres and AMC Theatres are some theaters that interlock films.|$|R

50|$|Control {{grouping}} poses difficult problems, {{especially in}} systems where a given operating parameter {{may be affected}} by multiple control groups. For example, in a <b>stereophonic</b> multiway <b>sound</b> <b>system,</b> the gain of the left-channel high-frequency amplifier may be affected by settings of master controls for (a) overall high-frequency level, (b) left-channel level, and (c) overall level of the entire system. In such systems, machine intelligence is required to manage cumulative settings effects that lead to overrange or underrange parameter values. The AES70 grouping mechanism provides a basis for such management, for one or many devices.|$|R

5000|$|Introduced as a [...] "directional sound system" [...] {{rather than}} a true <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>system,</b> Perspecta did not use {{discretely}} recorded sound signals. Instead, three sub-audible tones at 30 Hz, 35 Hz, and 40 Hz are mixed appropriately and embedded in a monaural optical soundtrack, {{in addition to the}} audible sound. When run through a Perspecta integrator, depending on whenever each tone is present, the audio is fed into a left (30 Hz), center (35 Hz) and right (40 Hz) speaker. Unlike true stereophonic sound, which would be described as discrete tracks running in synchronization in time and phase, Perspecta merely panned a mono mix across various channels. Because of this, only isolated dialog or sound effects could be mixed to be directional. Mixed sound effects, dialog and music could not be suitably mixed. Aside from panning, Perspecta controlled gain levels for each channel through the amplitude of each control signal.|$|E

50|$|The Fox Theater, {{located at}} 2022 14th Street in {{downtown}} Boulder, {{was destroyed by}} fire on April 18, 1960. In July of that year, the Fox Intermountain Amusement Corporation applied for a permit to remodel the subject building into a movie theater. They had been denied a permit to erect a 373 sq ft marquee, but reapplied for a 230 sq ft marquee. A sign permit application was filed for the Fox Theatre by Boulder Sign Ideas in January 1961. The plans included the “Fox” sign, {{as well as the}} lighted marquee. The marquee was 42’ 8” wide, 5’ tall, and 51/2’ wide at the base. The new Fox Theatre was opened on July 7, 1961. Present at the formal opening was the president of Fox Inter-Mountain Theatres, Robert Selig. Besides the sign and metal screen covering the front façade, another alteration to the building at this time was the installation of a 36 x 18’ screen which was “designed to accommodate all sizes of motion pictures, including the spectacular cinemascope process, developed by 20th Century Fox.” The Theatre was designed by Mel Glatz, Fox construction engineer, and assisted by Les Newkirk, the manager of Fox Theatres in Boulder. There were 500 seats for persons, with the arrangement assuring “each patron spacious leg room between the American Bodiform chairs.” A <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>system,</b> new lobby with concession stand, specially built cooling system, and new rest rooms rounded out the changes to the building. For the opening night, only one show was scheduled, but afterwards it operated on continuous showings beginning at 1:30pm.|$|E

[...] Early on, she rebelled against her traditional values and followed her brother Brigadier Jerry in DJing. She was repeatedly dissuaded by her father to not DJ and pursue Christian music. When she was a teenager, she got into Dancehall. She was the only girl to show up to dance. The family norms did not appeal to her and she ran away from home for months at a time. Nancy followed DJ Junior Chalice around Jamaica and in St. Thomas was given a chance by him to DJ. She is quoted from an interview as saying, [...] " [...] Me never nervous again after that. That was 15. When I was 16 I say, “Alright, I go step up me thing.”. In 1980, producer Winston Riley was the first to take her into the studio, resulting in her first single, [...] "Papa Dean" [...] for his Techniques label. Russell-Myers went on to perform at Reggae Sunsplash, making her the first female deejay ever to perform there, and she is also the first female Jamaican deejay to tour internationally. She had further success with singles such as [...] "One Two", [...] "Money Can't Buy Me Love", [...] "Transport Connection" [...] and [...] "Bam Bam". Her debut album, One Two was released in 1982.

50|$|Telepresence {{refers to}} a set of {{technologies}} which allow a person to feel as if they were present, to give the appearance that they were present, or to have an effect, at a location other than their true location. Telepresence requires that the senses of the user, or users, are provided with such stimuli as to give the feeling of being in that other location. Additionally, the user(s) may be given the ability to affect the remote location. In this case, the user's position, movements, actions, voice, etc. may be sensed, transmitted and duplicated in the remote location to bring about this effect. Therefore, information may be traveling in both directions between the user and the remote location. Critical the creating an in-person experience is the presence of high-definition video perfectly synchronized with <b>stereophonic</b> <b>sound.</b> A minimum <b>system</b> usually includes visual feedback. Ideally, the entire field of view of the user is filled {{with a view of the}} remote location, and the viewpoint corresponds to the movement and orientation of the user's head. In this way, it differs from television or cinema, where the viewpoint is out of the control of the viewer.|$|R
