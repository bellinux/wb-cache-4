[...] The barons stood with the remaining dismounted knights at the centre of the line around the standard. [...] Their left is thought to have straddled the road, with its flank protected by a marsh; it is not known if the low ground to the east of the ridge was similarly boggy, or if the English formation extended that far.|$|E

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{model has been}} proposed to predict <b>solids</b> <b>formation</b> in the SRS evaporators from measured feed compositions using a commercially available software package, the Geochemist's Workbench (GWB). In support of this work, researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have performed experiments to evaluate <b>solids</b> <b>formation</b> under evaporator-like conditions in the laboratory. The purpose of this report is to compare these experimental results to the calculated results from GWB. Researchers at PNNL conducted experiments to evaluate the thermodynamic boundary between the precipitation of the deleterious sodium aluminosilicate gel (NASgel) and the field of benign potential precipitation of aluminum hydroxide formation. Several solutions were prepared and held at several temperatures to evaluate <b>solids</b> <b>formation</b> over various periods of time. Observed solids compared well to GWB calculations. Researchers at ORNL prepared several mixtures of simulated SRS Tank 43 (high aluminum) and DWPF recycle (high silicon) solutions. These solutions were then evaporated, and precipitated solids were examined by XRD. Again, there was good agreement between observations and GWB calculations. No NASgel was identified, and none was predicted to form. Researchers at ORNL also prepared several high caustic solutions, additional mixtures of simulated SRS Tank 43 and DWPF solutions, and simulated 3 H evaporator feed. Solids deposition on stainless steel coupons with and without evaporation was examined. Because these solids were not rigorously characterized, direct comparison to GWB calculations is not appropriate. However, {{it should be noted}} that NASgel was not predicted by GWB to form, and no NASgel was identified in these experiments. Overall, the experimental observations validate the GWB calculational results, showing that GWB is an appropriate tool for use in SRS evaporator modeling and control...|$|R

40|$|Low {{solubility}} of SiO 2 and its {{occurrence in}} geothermal {{waters in the}} form of ionic, colloidal and suspended state are the main cause of the solid deposit occurrence. Certain chemical types of silica, under the influence of Fe 2 +, Al 3 +, F−, OH- ions and other micro-constituents, and due to significantly decreased solubility of SiO 2, stimulate nucleation, particle growth and <b>solid</b> deposit <b>formation.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} inhibit the process of nucleation and <b>solid</b> deposit <b>formation</b> by adding originally designed inhibitor {{in the form of}} an emulsion, when the total concentration of the present and added colloidal SiO 2 is beyond the solubility limit (120 mg/dm 3).

40|$|During FY 2001, {{tank farm}} {{operations}} at Hanford and the Savannah River Site (SRS) {{continued to be}} negatively impacted by the unintended <b>formation</b> of <b>solids.</b> At Hanford, the primary <b>solids</b> <b>formation</b> problem involves a series of plugged pipes and pumps during the saltwell pumping activities of the interim stabilization program. For example, transfers of tank S- 102 waste were suspended due to a plugged pipeline or a mechanical problem with the transfer pump. The replacement pump then failed within 2 weeks. In contrast, since full-scale waste remediation activities such as vitrification were initiated, the SRS has encountered {{a wider range of}} problems due to unwanted solids. The 2 H evaporator system was shut down because of the formation of aluminosilicate deposits with enriched uranium in the evaporator pot. While high concentrations of aluminum are expected in the tank waste due to previous canyon operations, the primary source of silicon is the recycle stream from the vitrifier. While <b>solids</b> <b>formation</b> can be expected when waste streams are combined, the formation of the aluminosilicate deposits required an elevated temperature within the evaporator. The shutdown of the 2 H evaporator led to a severe shortage of tank space. Therefore, the SRS tank farm was forced to transfer highly concentrated waste, which led to a plugged transfer pump in tank 32. For each of the proposed cesium removal technologies for the SRS, unwanted <b>solids</b> <b>formation</b> occurred during the large laboratory-scale tests prior to the final selection of the solvent extraction process. It can be expected that further problems will be encountered as more unit operations of the remediation effort are deployed and as more waste streams are combined. Since these problems have already led to costly schedule delays, the tank farm operators at both sites have identified the prevention of <b>solids</b> <b>formation</b> as a high-priority need. In response to this need, the Tank Focus Area has assembled a team of researchers of researchers from AEA Technology, Florida International University (FIU), Fluor Hanford, Mississippi State University (MSU), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) to evaluate various aspects of the waste preparation and transport chemistry. The majority of this effort was focused on saltcake dissolution and saltwell pumping. The results of the AEA Technology, FIU, and MSU studies of saltcake dissolution and slurry transfers for Hanford are discussed in detail in a companion report prepared by T. D. Welch in 2001 (ORNIJTM- 2001097). Staff members at Fluor Hanford have continued to conduct saltcake dissolution tests on actual tank waste (documented in reports prepared by D. L. Herting in 2000 and 2001). It should be noted that full-scale saltcake dissolution at Hanford is scheduled to begin in FY 2002. While the Hanford effort is focused on the transfer of waste from one tank to another, the objective of the SRTC study is the formation of aluminosilicates at elevated temperatures, which are present in the waste evaporator...|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} the suddenness of the attack, the {{discipline}} of the legionaries was unshaken, {{and as soon as}} their officers found that the walls were already lost they formed their men in a solid body to resist the attack.

The weight and impetus of the charge was irresistible. The Roman cohort was broken, and a deadly hand to hand struggle commenced. But here the numbers and the greatly superior height and strength of the Britons were decisive, and before many minutes had passed the last Roman had been cut down, the scene of the battle being lighted up by the flames of Huntingdon.|$|E

Never was a more sudden change in the fate of a great battle. The French cause had appeared absolutely lost; one wing and their centre were routed; their reserves had suffered heavily, and were on the point of giving way. Humanly speaking, the battle seemed hopelessly lost, and yet in ten minutes victory had been converted into defeat, and the right and left wings of the Spanish army had ceased to exist as collected bodies.

Beric bade them by the next morning provide themselves with spears six feet longer. Britons were more accustomed to fight with javelin than with spear, and the latter weapons were shorter and lighter than those of the Romans. Beric felt that the advantage should be the other way, for the small shields carried by the Britons were inferior as defensive weapons to those of the Romans, and to preserve the balance it was necessary therefore to have longer spears; the more so since the Britons were taller, and far more powerful men than their foes, and should therefore be able, with practice, to use longer weapons.|$|E
