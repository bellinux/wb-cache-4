Callaghan re-interpret {{the role}} of the Bohm model and its notion of quantum {{potential}} in the framework of Clifford algebra, taking account of recent advances that include the work of David Hestenes on spacetime algebra. They show how, within a nested hierarchy of Clifford algebras , for each Clifford algebra an element of a minimal left ideal [...] and an element of a right ideal representing its Clifford conjugation [...] can be constructed, and from it the Clifford density element (CDE) , an element of the Clifford algebra which is isomorphic to the <b>standard</b> <b>density</b> matrix but independent of any specific representation. On this basis, bilinear invariants can be formed which represent properties of the system. Hiley and Callaghan distinguish bilinear invariants of a first kind, of which each stands for the expectation value of an element [...] of the algebra which can be formed as , and bilinear invariants of a second kind which are constructed with derivatives and represent momentum and energy. Using these terms, they reconstruct the results of quantum mechanics without depending on a particular representation in terms of a wave function nor requiring reference to an external Hilbert space. Consistent with earlier results, the quantum potential of a non-relativistic particle with spin (Pauli particle) is shown to have an additional spin-dependent term, and the momentum of a relativistic particle with spin (Dirac particle) is shown to consist in a linear motion and a rotational part. The two dynamical equations governing the time evolution are re-interpreted as conservation equations. One of them stands for the conservation of energy; the other stands for the conservation of probability and of spin. The quantum potential plays {{the role of}} an internal energy which ensures the conservation of total energy.|$|E

The measurements were done into a scheme of experimental design {{in order to find}} possible sources of variability in the hydrostatic weighing system of the national <b>density</b> <b>standard.</b> The design factors checked were: days after the water is produced, positions of the solid <b>density</b> <b>standards</b> at the hydrostatic weighing system and the spheres used. The variable of interest for the scheme of experimental design was the difference between the water density measured using the solid <b>density</b> <b>standards</b> and the water density calculated by the formula of M.

In short, antiprotons would react inside the nucleus of uranium, causing a release of energy that breaks the nucleus apart as in conventional nuclear reactions. Even a small number of such reactions can start the chain reaction that would otherwise require a much larger volume of fuel to sustain. Whereas the [...] "normal" [...] critical mass for plutonium is about 11.8 kilograms (for a sphere at <b>standard</b> <b>density),</b> with antimatter catalyzed reactions this could be well under one gram.|$|E
5000|$|Ratings {{found in}} {{centrifugal}} fan performance tables and curves {{are based on}} standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM). Fan manufacturers define standard air as clean, dry air with a density of 0.075 pounds mass per cubic foot, with the atmospheric pressure at sea level of 29.92 inches of mercury and a temperature of 70°F. Selecting a centrifugal fan to operate at conditions other than standard air requires adjustment to both static pressure and brake horsepower. The volume of air will not be affected in a given system because a fan will move {{the same amount of}} air regardless of the air density. [...] If a centrifugal fan is to operate at a non-standard density, then corrections must be made to static pressure and brake horsepower. At higher than standard elevation, usually sea level, and higher than standard temperature (70°F), air density is lower than <b>standard</b> <b>density</b> (0.075 pounds per cubic foot). Centrifugal fans that are specified for continuous operation at higher temperatures need to be selected taking into account air density corrections. Again, a centrifugal fan is a constant volume device that will move the same amount of air at two different temperatures.|$|E
