At the same time, CompactPCI Serial does not need bridges, switched fabrics, or special backplanes.The <b>star</b> <b>connection</b> by standard includes PCI Express, SATA/SAS, and USB.|$|E

50|$|A Dahlander motor {{achieves}} different speeds {{by switching}} {{the configuration of}} the electrical windings, indirectly adding or removing poles and thus varying the rotor speed. The poles can be varied at a ratio of 1:2 and thus the speed can be varied at 2:1. Normally, the electrical configuration of windings is varied from a Delta connection (Δ) to a double <b>star</b> <b>connection</b> (YY) configuration in order to change the speed of the motor for constant torque applications, such as the hoists in cranes. Star connections (Y) varied to double star connections (YY) are used for quadratic torque applications, such as pumps.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{operating}} capabilities of STATCOMs based on Modular Multilevel Cascaded Converters (MMCC) using star and delta connections, with {{special attention to}} unbalanced load compensation. Zero sequence voltage for <b>star</b> <b>connection,</b> and zero sequence current for delta, need {{to be applied to}} overcome the phase cluster DC-voltage unbalance. Expressions are derived for both zero sequence elements as functions of the degree of load unbalance defined as the ratio of negative to positive sequence load current. They show that the zero sequence voltage in <b>star</b> <b>connection</b> reaches a very high level as the degree of load unbalance increases, making the MMCC DC-link voltage too high for correct functioning. However the delta connected MMCC can cope with the high level of load current unbalance. Experimental results are presented to validate this analysis...|$|E

40|$|Induction {{machines}} {{are the most}} commonly used industrial drives for variety of applications. It has been estimated that induction motors consumes approximately 50 of all the electric energy generated. Further in the area of renewable energy sources such as wind or bio-mass energy induction machines have been found suitable for functioning as generators. In this context it may be mentioned that a star-delta switching is common for the starting of three-phase induction motor. Now it is proposed to use this star-delta switching for energy conservation of induction machines i. e. at times of reduced loads the machine switched back to <b>star</b> <b>connection.</b> Using a three-phase 400 V 50 Hz 4 -pole induction machine it has been demonstrated that the star-delta switching of stator winding of three-phase induction machine motor generator operations reconnected in star at suitable reduced loads with a switching arrangement can result in improved efficiency and power factor as compared to a fixed delta or <b>star</b> <b>connection.</b> The predetermined values along with the experimental results have also been presented in this report. A simulation program has been developed for the predetermination of performance of the three-phase induction machine using exact equivalent circuit. A case study on a 250 kW 400 V 4 -pole three-phase induction machine operated with different load cycles reveals the significant real and reactive power savings that could be obtained in the present proposal...|$|E
