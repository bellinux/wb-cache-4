5|$|The fort was <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> the {{geologist}} Thomas Sopwith in the 19th {{century and}} the historian R.G.

Among finds at the fort are altars with inscriptions to Hercules by the 6th Legion of the Roman army (normally stationed at York) and to Apollo by the fort's garrison of auxiliaries, the 2nd Cohort of Nervians. Other finds include a midden containing shoes; coins, fragments of Samian pottery, beads, nails, and a bronze handle shaped like a dolphin.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{of these}} two Indian trails later became the Chicago Road.

5|$|The suburb was {{originally}} three low lying islands that {{were covered in}} shell grit and saltbush and surrounded by mangrove and samphire swamps. Fishermen had established huts on the islands by 1865 and by 1873 there were 13 huts and a boathouse recorded when the area was <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> Thomas Evans. By the 1890s people were visiting the islands attracted to the supposed curative properties of the mangrove mud, using the beach for bathing and fishing for crabs.|$|E
5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} {{the construction of}} a large number of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. In diameter it measures 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 inches) across. Around thirty small gritstones remain as part of the circle, which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Although {{maintained}} {{as part of}} the Tooele County road network, {{the portion}} of the cut-off designated Federal Aid Route 2654 is <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to measure traffic volumes. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, UDOT calculated between 240 and 250vehicles used the cut-off near its western terminus. By comparison, traffic on the parallel I-80 between the Nevada state line and Leppy Pass Road (the Bonneville Speedway exit, and the end of Federal Aid Route 2654 on the cut-off) ranges between 6,765 and 7,345vehicles per day.|$|E

5|$|Charles I was a {{connoisseur}} of art, and paid {{greater attention to}} the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending to replace it with a classical statue.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake {{is named}} after Benjamin Harvey, {{a member of the}} Sons of Liberty and among the first {{settlers}} of the Wyoming Valley. Harvey inadvertently discovered the lake in 1781, while returning home after being held as a prisoner of war in Fort Niagara. The first resident {{in the vicinity of the}} lake was Matthew Scouten, who arrived in the early 1790s, but the first settlers were the Worthingtons, who arrived in 1806. The lake was first <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> Christopher Hurlbert in 1794, and the first person of European descent to explore the lake by canoe was Andrew Bennett, in 1800.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea {{has been}} the site of {{extensive}} archaeological research since the 1980s. Approximately 27percent of the Science Reserve had been <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> 2000, identifying 76shrines, 4adze manufacturing workshops, 3other markers, 1positively identified burial site, and 4possible burial sites. By 2009, {{the total number of}} identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano's upper flanks is ongoing. It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano's summit along what may be an ancient snow line, are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea. Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial.|$|E

5|$|The Basingstoke {{committee}} then investigated {{a link to}} the Andover Canal, but in December 1792, interest switched back to a {{link with}} the Itchen. A meeting was held in Southampton, which was chaired by the mayor and included James D'Arcy on the committee. It became part of a much grander scheme to link Bristol to Salisbury, and onwards to London, but although most of this soon died away, the Itchen to Basingstoke link was still being considered in 1796, by which time it was called the London and Southampton Ports Junction Canal. Two routes were <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> different engineers, one costing £127,000 and the other £157,566.|$|E
5|$|The Marquesses of Bute {{acquired}} the castle in 1776. John Stuart, the first marquess, {{took steps to}} protect the ruins. His great-grandson John Crichton-Stuart, the third marquess, was immensely rich {{as the result of}} the family's holdings in the South Wales coalfields and was passionately interested in the medieval period. He had the site fully <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> the architect William Frame, and reroofed the great hall in the 1870s. The marquess began a process of buying back leasehold properties around the castle with the intent of clearing back the town houses that had been built up to the edge of the site.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} {{example of the}} country’s economic evolution is the international financial services industry based in London. Within this sector aviation services are seen as critically important for both businesses and their clients, even {{in the era of}} video-conferencing. London’s air transport services are widely regarded within the London business community <b>surveyed</b> <b>by</b> the OEF to provide a competitive advantage over the rest of Europe, and expansion of airport capacity in the South East has significant support. Whilst these economic contributions are not disputed by environmental groups, they are not considered as sufficient justification to support further growth in air transport services which would primarily service increased demand for leisure travel rather than a business travel market which is already well served.|$|E
