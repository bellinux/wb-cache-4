On January 20, 1997, Parker's wife heard a crashing sound from the living room, and when she heard no response to her calls, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> to find him slumped over in his chair.

25|$|By {{the time}} he made his last film, Querelle (1982), Fassbinder was using drugs and alcohol {{as a way to}} assist his unrelenting schedule. On the night of 9–10 June 1982, Wolf Gremm, {{director}} of the film Kamikaze 1989 (1982), which starred Fassbinder, was staying in his apartment. Early that evening, Fassbinder retired to his bedroom. He was working on notes for a future film, Rosa L, based on the life of Polish-German revolutionary socialist Rosa Luxemburg. Fassbinder was watching television while reading when, shortly after 1 a.m., he {{received a phone call from}} his friend and assistant Harry Baer. At 3:30 a.m, when Juliane Lorenz arrived home, she heard the noise of the television in Fassbinder's room, but she could not hear him snoring. Though not allowed to enter the room uninvited, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and discovered his lifeless body with a cigarette still between his lips. A thin ribbon of blood trickled from one nostril.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} The Mikado, Bond met Lewis Ransome, a young civil {{engineer}} from a wealthy Quaker family. [...] He {{had just returned from}} America, and the two compared travel experiences. Ransome admitted to Bond that, after watching The Mikado, he had mentioned to his sister that he [...] "liked the little one with the big sash best. So next day when she saw a photograph of you in a shop window <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and bought it. She gave it to me and I have it now." [...] Thus, despite Bond's aversion to romance, began a long friendship that led, twelve years later, to Bond's second marriage. Ransome, several years younger than Bond, proposed marriage on many occasions {{over the course of the}} relationship, but Bond told him that she would not marry while she continued on the stage. Over the years, the two spent many of Bond's days off (Sundays) relaxing together in the country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "she is lofty {{because she}} has {{elevated}} ideas. <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> for reform; and for pretty much all kinds, from what I have heard." ...|$|R

500|$|After the {{original}} version of [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was released, Carey's official website premiered two other versions of the song, the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix" [...] and the [...] "Pulse Club Remix". While the song's initial release was tepidly received by critics, reviewers were more favorable towards the remixes. The remixes only feature Carey and eliminate the extensive rap verses with which many critics took issue. According to Carey's manager, Randy Jackson, three versions of the song were released in order to monopolize all radio formats and cater to multiple audiences. In an interview with Billboard, Jackson expressed how they would remind Carey's fans of her earlier remixes, which she would always re-do her vocals: [...] "The vintage throwback mix will remind fans of remixes she did years ago, and she's {{had a lot of}} Billboard No. 1 dance hits as well. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> and re-sang the vocals, knowing that the two verses on this first version of this single with Meek and Ross were going to be hip-hop verses where people were rapping. We wanted to have something for all of her fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryant {{became the}} butt of jokes on {{television}} shows and film, even by former colleague Bob Hope. Everywhere <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> {{the days after the}} vote she was met with noisy protests: Norfolk, Virginia—where demonstrators interrupted her presentation so forcefully she began crying—Chicago, and dozens of other cities. The Ku Klux Klan appeared at one of Bryant's appearances in Huntington, West Virginia claiming they were there to protect her. She attracted the largest gay demonstration in Canadian history when she appeared at a Toronto religious performance. Though she performed and spoke only at revivals and other religious shows, audiences were often less than half the expected number, and many would leave when she came on stage. In Houston Bryant was invited to perform for the Texas State Bar Association two weeks after the Dade County vote. With no cohesive political community, a few gay organizers invited people to protest her appearance at the Hyatt Regency. An organizer estimated for police that 500people might participate, but guessed because no gay community had responded to a cause before; police prepared for that number. However, thousands of people swarmed around the hotel chanting loudly enough to drown Bryant's performance; a conservative estimate of the participants' numbers was 2,000. The audience inside could not hear Bryant, and at one point attorneys working with the American Civil Liberties Union walked out and joined the protesters. One of the organizers said that he had never seen so many gay people in one place before, and then made a speech thanking Bryant: [...] "If God in his infinite wisdom had not created Anita Bryant, we would have had to invent her". He claimed the protest had the same result in Houston as the Stonewall riots.|$|E
2500|$|Following the war, General Canby was {{retained}} {{by the army}} as one of only ten brigadier generals and served as military commander of various districts throughout the South. In an 1873 newspaper article, Mrs. Lew Wallace (née Susan Arnold Elston) would recall that Louisa practiced charity, tending to give things away to the needy wherever <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> the South, endearing herself to the local populace, but at some cost to her household. [...] "I can hardly keep anything, {{there is so much}} suffering about us," [...] Louisa wrote Wallace from New Orleans. She sometimes pleaded the case of someone in need to her husband if she thought he might help. Mrs. Wallace also said that Louisa was far more sociable than her husband and that she, rather than he, would arranged for any gatherings at the Canby residence.|$|E
