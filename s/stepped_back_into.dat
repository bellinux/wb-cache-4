5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
25|$|On November 27, 1945, Johnson finally <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> {{the ring}} with Joe Jeanette. The 67-year-old Johnson squared off against the 66-year-old Jeanette in an {{exhibition}} held at a New York City rally to sell war bonds. Fellow former colored heavyweight champ Harry Wills also participated in the exhibition.|$|E
25|$|After the Lahore {{session of}} the Congress in 1929, Nehru {{gradually}} emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement. Gandhi <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a more spiritual role. Although Gandhi did not officially designate Nehru his political heir until 1942, the country {{as early as the}} mid-1930s saw in Nehru the natural successor to Gandhi.|$|E

25|$|WWF {{eventually}} surpassed its arch-rival WCW. With {{its business}} steadily declining and a corporate takeover of {{its parent company}} (Time Warner) by America Online, WCW was put up for sale and purchased by Vince McMahon in 2001, once again making WWF the single-largest wrestling company in North America. Bret Hart's entry into WCW had been hailed {{at the time as}} a major coup for the company, but it subsequently failed to utilize his popular appeal. Hart's active wrestling career ended in 2000 after he suffered a serious concussion during a match with Goldberg. After dropping the WWF title to Austin at WrestleMania XIV in 1998, Michaels was forced into retirement for four years due to a serious back injury. After a long period of rehabilitation, Michaels returned to the ring in 2002, and eventually retired for good in 2010 at Wrestlemania 26, losing a Streak vs. Career match to The Undertaker in the show's final match of the night. Michaels has occasionally reappeared for skits on WWE programming since, but has not <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the ring as a competitor.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Ellis {{was made}} {{captain of the}} Navy's new supercarrier USS Forrestal. He {{commanded}} the ship during its inaugural cruise and subsequently was fleeted up to Rear admiral on July 18, 1958. His first post as a two-star admiral was Chief of Staff to Commander Carrier Division 6. Ellis <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a command role with his appointment as Commander Carrier Division 2 in 1961. On June 2, 1964 {{he was given a}} third star and Vice admiral rank, and put in charge of the Sixth Fleet. After two years serving in this capacity he was relieved of his command and awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Specifically recognized in his full citation are Ellis's adroit management of an Atlantic command {{at a time when the}} Vietnam War pulled increasing Navy resource to the Pacific; and the swiftness with which he assisted in the recovery of a hydrogen bomb lost off the coast of Spain. Ellis's final position within the Navy was as Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic, a post he served in during his last year of service, 1968. He died in a Norfolk, Virginia hospital on September 26, 1982 as a result of cancer.|$|E

2500|$|On December 15, 2015, the {{district}} received an emailed threat, thought by some officials to be credible, causing {{the closure of}} all Los Angeles Unified Schools. It was later judged by Los Angeles police {{to have been a}} hoax. The email was traced to an IP address in Frankfurt, Germany. The Los Angeles Times reported that the threat did not necessarily [...] originate from an IP address in Frankfurt, Germany. After the threat had been received at 10 p.m. the previous day, the decision to close the schools was made at 6 a.m. by Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines.
