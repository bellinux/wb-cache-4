He {{was forced to}} miss 18 games due to a tendinitis in the elbow of his right arm, which was his <b>shooting</b> <b>arm.</b> Pippen started being bothered by minor injuries during December but still managed to play. His right arm stiffened after a game with the Boston Celtics on January 8. He missed the next six games and, after a two-point performance in a loss to the Sacramento Kings on January 20, the injury became too painful for him again. He had the elbow examined by several doctors before going into surgery. After undergoing the procedure to remove a bone fragment in his right elbow, he made his return on February 22 against the Utah Jazz and played {{for the remainder of}} the season. Pippen finished the season with averages of 11.3 points per game, 4.6 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game. The Trail Blazers finished the season with a 50–32 record, fourth in the Pacific Division and seventh in the Western Conference. They were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the returning and eventual repeat champions, the Los Angeles Lakers.|$|E

Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot. The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws, and in other circumstances while the jump shot is taken in mid-air, the ball released {{near the top of the}} jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.|$|E

Previous {{research has shown}} that people are quicker and more accurate to <b>shoot</b> <b>armed</b> targets that are black than targets that are white (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2002). However, previous research has also biased participants toward a more lenient shooting criterion. The current study proposes that when given motivation to not shoot, the stereotypically-dependent bias to shoot will decrease. That is, altering costs and rewards of decisions should influence participants’ responses towards responding quickly and accurately, regardless of target ethnicity. Results showed that the reward manipulation was unsuccessful in decreasing Shooter Bias. The manipulation was able to sway participants towards more conservative non-shooting decisions overall but participants remained more accurate and quicker in responses to <b>shoot</b> <b>armed</b> black targets compared to armed white targets...|$|R

50|$|He {{also had}} a short but notable career as a player for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. However, his chances of {{becoming}} a prominent National Hockey League player were severed after a serious arm injury in January 1995 at Winnipeg, when involved {{in a fight with}} another player, Keith Tkachuk. The tendons in McSween's left wrist were severely damaged after being severed by Tkachuk's skate. The nerve and tendon injury never fully healed, preventing him from being able to fully close his left hand, his <b>shooting</b> <b>arm,</b> effectively ending McSween's professional career. Ironically, McSween had severed the Achilles tendon of another promising player, Teemu Selänne, earlier in his career (Selänne would go on to make a full recovery, playing for 2 decades). After his injury McSween went on to play in the AHL (American Hockey League) for the Baltimore Bandits; in the IHL (International Hockey League) for the Grand Rapids Griffins and later Milwaukee Admirals; and in the UHL (United Hockey League) for the Muskegon Fury. He currently lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan, working as an electrical engineer and a volunteer coach for local Youth Hockey Leagues. He is raising two boys and a daughter with his wife.|$|E

In pure hand shots, release speed, angle and backspin are severely limited. All hand-forearm shot configurations are able to produce desired release speed, angle and backspin. General shots redundantly provide shooters with any desired ball release speed, angle and backspin, and {{they are required to}} suitably control each joint angular velocity and acceleration...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{basketball}} <b>shooting</b> <b>arm</b> {{model is}} used to estimate arm joint motions {{for a set of}} desired release speed, angle and backspin. The model has three rigid planar links with rotational joints imitating an upper arm, forearm and hand with shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. The kinematics of the <b>shooting</b> <b>arm</b> is solved to calculate the joint angles, and the velocity and angular velocity of links at release. There are many angular displacement and velocity combinations of shoulder, elbow and wrist joints to produce the optimal release speed, angle and backspin of the ball at release.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} how compensatory control of the <b>shooting</b> <b>arm</b> changed under the interacting constraints of task expertise and shooting distance. Expert, intermediate and novice male basketball players (n= 10 in each group) performed 30 shots from three distances (4. 25, 5. 25 and 6. 25 metres). The dependent variables included shooting performance together with variability of the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints at the instant of ball release. A significant main effect for expertise was observed for both shooting performance and shoulder joint variability at ball release. No significant main effects for expertise were found for either wrist or elbow joint variability at release. Quadratic regression analyses revealed greater compensatory control of the <b>shooting</b> <b>arm</b> for the expert participants compared to their intermediate and novice counterparts. The level of compensatory control shown also persisted with increasing shooting distance regardless of level of expertise. Findings are harmonious with existing data on movement variability during dynamic throwing tasks, specifically demonstrating how expert performers exploited variability in a functional manner to satisfy the constraints of the tas...|$|E
40|$|Low scoring {{within the}} paint {{area is the}} biggest issue for the Japan men 2 ̆ 7 s {{national}} basketball team, and therefore {{it is necessary for}} them to acquire a new approach to shooting that would increase the attacking variations for attempting a higher percentage of shots within this area. This study focused on the validity of the floater shot as a new offensive approach for overcoming this problem, and examined its usefulness and mechanism using three-dimensional motion analysis (VICONMX+). Comparison of the floater shot with the jump shot and lay-up shot revealed that the mechanism of the former involved (1) absence of a shooting posture, (2) a low vertical jump involving a slow step, (3) raising the <b>shooting</b> <b>arm</b> in a vertical direction, and (4) a highly arched ball trajectory with a height roughly {{the same as that of}} the top of the backboard. Our examination also revealed that maintaining one 2 ̆ 7 s distance from the defense through a weak jump and retroversion of the trunk, upsetting the timing of the blocking shot through release from a non-stopping motion, and shooting the ball over the hand during the blocking shot through the high-arched ball trajectory by elevating the <b>shooting</b> <b>arm</b> in a vertical direction were useful for achieving a high percentage of shots within the paint area, where the influences of height and selective defense are greater. These results are of relevance to not only the Japan men 2 ̆ 7 s national basketball team but also any team with a smaller stature when considering how to improve the scoring rate within the paint area...|$|E
