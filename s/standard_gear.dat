2500|$|By {{the time}} of the SLA shoot-out, SWAT teams had reorganized into six 10-man teams, each team being divided further into two five-man units, called elements. An element {{consisted}} of an element leader, two assaulters, a scout, and a rear-guard. The normal complement of weapons was a sniper rifle (a [...]243-caliber bolt-action, based on the ordnance expended by officers at the shootout), two [...]223-caliber semi-automatic rifles, and two shotguns. SWAT officers also carried their service revolvers in shoulder holsters. <b>Standard</b> <b>gear</b> included a first aid kit, gloves, and a gas mask. At a time when officers were usually issued six-shot revolvers and shotguns, it was a significant change to have police armed with semi-automatic rifles. The encounter with the heavily armed Symbionese Liberation Army, however, sparked a trend towards SWAT teams being issued body armor and automatic weapons of various types.|$|E
2500|$|... 2,750 {{examples}} of the Sopwith-Kauper gear were installed in service aircraft: {{as well as being}} the <b>standard</b> <b>gear</b> for the Sopwith Pup and Triplane it was fitted to many early Camels, and replaced earlier gears in 1½ Strutters and other Sopwith types. However, by November 1917, in spite of several modifications, it was becoming evident that even the Sopwith-Kauper gear suffered from the inherent limitations of mechanical gears. Camel squadrons in particular, reported that propellers were frequently being [...] "shot through", the gears having a tendency to [...] "run away". Wear and tear, as well as the increased rate of fire of the Vickers gun and higher engine speeds were responsible for this decline in performance and reliability. By this time the teething problems of the hydraulic C.C. gear had been overcome and it was made standard for all British aircraft, including Sopwiths.|$|E
