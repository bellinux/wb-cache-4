Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.|$|E

He introduced legislation {{to build more}} forts in the northwest, to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio, and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal, Wabash and Erie Canal, through Indiana. He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west, toward the Mississippi River, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> living in Indiana and Illinois would have some assurance that the road's large federal appropriation would benefit them directly. Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River {{and make it more}} accessible to year-round steamboat travel.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{psychological}} fear {{among the people}} that {{in the event of}} the merger of Kalahandi with Orissa province, the interest of Kalahandi would be jeopardized. Former British ruled Orissa like Cuttack, Balasore, Ganjam, Sambalpur and Koraput where freedom movement took place, would take upper hand on every issue. <b>So,</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were justified to take anti–merger stand.|$|E

25|$|A prophet, {{based at}} Shiloh, who went {{throughout}} the land, {{from place to}} place, with unwearied zeal, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people to repentance. In this role, Samuel acted as a (biblical) judge, publicly advising the nation, and also giving private advice to individuals. Eventually Samuel delegated this role to his sons, based at Beersheba, but they behaved corruptly and <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> facing invasion from the Ammonites, persuaded Samuel to appoint a king. Samuel reluctantly did so, and anointed Saul {{in front of the}} entire nation, who had gathered to see him.|$|E
25|$|Malachi also criticizes his {{audience}} for questioning God's justice. He reminds them that God is just, exhorting {{them to be}} faithful as they await that justice. Malachi quickly goes on {{to point out that}} the people have not been faithful. In fact, the people are not giving God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> have been neglecting to offer their full tithe to Elohim. The result of these shortcomings is that the people come to believe that no good comes out of serving God.|$|E
50|$|According {{to other}} opinion, Jamatia is {{conjugation}} of two Kokborok words: jama means 'tax' and twiya means 'no need to pay'. The men of this clan {{engaged in the}} Tripura royal force as soldiers by the kings of Tripura during <b>the</b> Manikya Dynasty. <b>So</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> of Jomatia clan were exempted to pay any tax by the king for their loyalty, service and sacrifice for the regime.

25|$|These points {{represent}} {{the bright side}} of Tatar rule, but it also had its dark side. So long as a great horde of nomads was encamped on the frontier, the country was liable to be invaded by an overwhelming force. Fortunately, these invasions were not frequent, but when they occurred they caused an incalculable amount of devastation and suffering. In the intervals the people had to pay a fixed tribute. At first it was collected in a rough-and-ready fashion by Tatar tax-gatherers; by about 1259 it was regulated by a census of the population; and finally its collection was entrusted to the native princes, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> were no longer brought into {{direct contact with the}} Tatar officials.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receiving}} news of {{the revolt}} and Lü Bu's intrusion, Cao Cao aborted the Xu Province campaign {{and headed back to}} Yan Province, where the forces of Lü Bu and Cao Cao clashed in Puyang. Cao Cao was unable to overcome Lü Bu and both sides were locked in a stalemate for over 100 days. Around the time, the area was plagued by locusts and droughts <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> suffered from famine and many had resorted to cannibalism to survive. Lü Bu moved his base further east to Shanyang (山陽; in present-day southern Shandong). Within two years, Cao Cao managed to take back all his territories in Yan Province and he defeated Lü Bu in a battle at Juye County. Lü Bu fled to Xu Province and took refuge under Liu Bei.|$|E
25|$|The Junta {{started a}} {{collection}} in Buenos Aires to equip the expeditionary force {{and created a}} small army of 1,150 men, which left from Monte de Castro on 6 July 1810 under the command of colonel Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, and lieutenant colonel Antonio González Balcarce. After receiving their orders they took the road to Córdoba to confront Liniers. Similar to the armies in the French Revolution, they were accompanied by the Junta's representative (political command), Hipólito Vieytes as commissioner and for the army's comptroller Feliciano Chiclana, who reached the army later on 28 July at Fraile Muerto and continued to Salta with a small guard, where he was named governor of Salta and Tucumán. The military command was subject to the political representative and he to the Junta through the Secretary of War Mariano Moreno. Vieytes carried instructions to arrange in each province for elections <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> could designate their representative to the new Junta.|$|E

25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. <b>So</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E

In this interview, Kamensky stated, “It is still a mystery what happened to the bodies of the crew and passengers on the plane.
