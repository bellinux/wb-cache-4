40|$|Covariances of the <b>self-shielding</b> <b>factor</b> and its {{temperature}} gradient for the uranium- 238 neutron cap-ture reaction {{have been evaluated}} from the resonance parameter covariance matrix and {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>self-shielding</b> <b>factor</b> and its {{temperature gradient}} to the resonance parameters. The resonance param-eters and their covariance matrix for uranium- 238 were taken from JENDL- 3. 3, while the sensitivity co-efficients were calculated by varying resonance parameters and temperature. A set of computer code mod-ules has been developed for the calculation of the sensitivity coefficients at numerous resonance levels. The present result shows that the correlation among resonance parameters yields a substantial contribution to the standard deviations of the <b>self-shielding</b> <b>factor</b> and its temperature gradient. In addition to the stand-ard deviations of these quantities, their correlation matrices in the JFS- 3 70 group structure are also ob-tained...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{increased}} resonance capture rates near zone interfaces in fast reactor media has been examined both theoretically and experimentally. An interface traversing assembly was designed, constructed and employed to measure U- 238 capture rates near the blanket-reflector interface in the MIT Blanket Test Facility. Prior MIT experiments on a thorium-uranium interface {{in a blanket}} assembly were also reanalyzed. Extremely localized fertile capture rate increases of {{on the order of}} 50 % were measured immediately at the interfaces relative to extrapolation of asymptotic interior traverses, and relative to state-of-the-art (LIB-IV, SPHINX, ANISN/ 2 DB) calculations which employ infinite-medium self-shileding throughout a given zone. A method was developed to compute a spatially varying background scattering cross section per absorber nucleus, a, which takes into account both homogeneous and heterogeneous effec~s on the interface flux transient. This permitted use of the standard <b>self-shielding</b> <b>factor</b> method (Bondarenko f-factors) to generate modified cross sections for thin layers near the interfaces.

40|$|High {{redshift}} quasars at z> 6 have masses up to 10 ^ 9 M_. One of {{the pathways}} to their formation includes direct collapse of gas, forming a supermassive star, precursor {{of the black}} hole seed. The conditions for direct collapse are more easily achievable in metal-free haloes, where atomic hydrogen cooling operates and molecular hydrogen (H 2) formation is inhibited by a strong external UV flux. Above a certain value of UV flux (J_crit), the gas in a halo collapses isothermally at 10 ^ 4 K and provides the conditions for supermassive star formation. However, H 2 can self-shield, reducing the effect of photodissociation. So far, most numerical studies used the local Jeans length to calculate the column densities for self-shielding. We implement an improved method for the determination of column densities in 3 D simulations and analyse {{its effect on the}} value of J_crit. This new method captures the gas geometry and velocity field and enables us to properly determine the direction-dependent <b>self-shielding</b> <b>factor</b> of H 2 against photodissociating radiation. We find a value of J_crit that is a factor of two smaller than with the Jeans approach (2000 J_ 21 vs. 4000 J_ 21). The main reason for this difference is the strong directional dependence of the H 2 column density. With this lower value of J_crit, the number of haloes exposed to a flux >J_crit is larger by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous studies. This may translate into a similar enhancement in the predicted number density of black hole seeds. Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures, published in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} work we experimentally tested some neutron self-shielding calculations methods for thermal absorbers, {{from which the}} semi-empirical "sigmoid method" gave the most accurate results. In this work we aim at evaluating the accuracy of this method on the epithermal self-shielding phenomena {{as compared to the}} analytical "MatSSF method". Metallic foils of Zr and Mo were compactly stacked together into small cylinders (or disks) of different thickness, allowing for up to 20 % epithermal self-shielding when irradiated on two channels of the BR 1 reactor. A 2 % relative difference between calculated and experimental <b>self-shielding</b> <b>factors</b> was obtained from the MatSSF method when a perpendicular source-sample axial configuration was assumed, while the isotropic or the co-axial configuration alternatives gave up to 10 % relative differences. On the other hand, the sigmoid method gave relative differences of up to 6 % that can be reduced to just 2 % by applying the "effective" epithermal absorption cross-sections for Mo- 98 and Zr- 96 proposed in this work...|$|R
40|$|Rhodium foils {{of about}} 5 mm {{diameter}} {{were obtained from}} IRMM. One foil had thickness of 0. 006 mm and three were 0. 112 mm thick. They were irradiated in the pneumatic transfer system and in the carousel facility of the TRIGA reactor at the Jo¿ef Stefan Institute. The foils were irradiated bare and enclosed in small cadmium boxes (about 2 g weight) of 1 mm thickness to minimise the perturbation of the local neutron flux. They were co-irradiated with 5 mm diameter and 0. 2 mm thick Al-Au(0. 1 %) alloy monitor foils. The resonance self-shielding corrections for the 0. 006 mm and 0. 112 mm thick samples were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation and amount to about 10 % and 60 %, respectively.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{effects in}} fast breeder {{reactors}} are examined through development of simple but accurate {{models for the}} calculation of a posteriori corrections to a volume-averaged homogeneous representation. Three distinct heterogeneous effects are considered: spatial coarse-group flux distribution within the unit cell, anisotropic diffusion, and resonance self-shielding. An escape/transmission probability theory is developed which yields region-averaged fluxes, used to flux-weight cross sections. Fluxes calculated by the model are in substantial agreement with S 8 discrete ordinate calculations. The method of Benoist, as applied to tight lattices, is adopted to generate anisotropic diffusion coefficients in pin geometry. The resulting perturbations from a volume-averaged homogeneous representation are interpreted in terms of reactivities calculated from first order perturbation theory and an equivalent "total differential of k" method. Resonance self-shielding is treated by the f-factor approach, based on correlations developed to give the <b>self-shielding</b> <b>factors</b> as functions of one-group constants. Various reference designs are analyzed for heterogeneous effects. For a demonstration LMFBR design, the whole-core sodium void reactivity change is calculated to be 90 e less positive for the heterogeneous core representation compared to a homogeneous core, due primarily {{to the effects of}} anisotropic diffusion. Parametric studies show at least a doubling of this negative reactivity contribution is attainable for judicious choices of enrichment, lattice pitch and lattice geometry (particularly the open hexagonal lattice). The fuel dispersal accident is analyzed and a positive reactivity contribution due to heterogeneity is identified. The results of intra-rod U- 238 activation measurements in the Blanket Test Facility are analyzed and compared to calculations. This activation depression is found to be of the order of 10 % (surfaceto- average) for a typical LMFBR blanket rod and is ascribed to the effect of heterogeneous resonance self-shielding of U- 238. Heterogeneous effects on the breeding ratio are studied with the conclusions that accounting for resonance self-shielding reduces the total breeding ratio by over 10 %, but heterogeneous effects are not important for breeding ratio calculations.

40|$|Activation foils, {{stacked in}} a package, {{together}} with a spectrum adjustment code are generally the means to characterize the neutron spectrum of a BNCT epithermal neutron beam. When using foil stacks, the phenomenon of neutron scattering is appreciably enhanced, especially in an epithermal neutron beam, as compared to a thermal neutron field. Contrary to the conventional idea of the self-shielding effect, <b>self-shielding</b> correction <b>factors</b> {{in most of the}} foils in the stack are larger than one. This paper demonstrates a way to correct the complex self-shielding effect using groupwise cross-sections adjusted for self-shielding, as calculated by the Monte Carlo neutron transport code, MCNP. This methodology can solve the perturbation problems caused by the foil stack applied in an epithermal neutron beam. In this study, the adjusted spectrum of the HB 11 epithermal neutron beam, dedicated for BNCT research in at Petten in The Netherlands, is utilized and two adjusted spectra are presented with and without the self-shielding correction. The difference between the spectra is highly significant and demonstrates that the self-shielding correction cannot be ignored. JRC. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{the neutron}} {{environment}} in the central cavity of the Sandia National Laboratories' Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) is important {{in order to provide}} experimenters with the most accurate spectral information and maintain a high degree of fidelity in performing reactor experiments. Characterization includes both modeling and experimental efforts. Building accurate neutronic models of the ACRR and the central cavity “bucket” environments that can be used by experimenters is important in planning and designing experiments, as well as assessing the experimental results and quantifying uncertainties. Neutron fluence characterizations of two bucket environments, LB 44 and PLG, are presented. These two environments are used frequently and represent two extremes in the neutron spectrum. The LB 44 bucket is designed to remove the thermal component of the neutron spectrum and significantly attenuate the gamma-ray fluence. The PLG bucket is designed to enhance the thermal component of the neutron spectrum and attenuate the gamma-ray fluence. The neutron characterization for each bucket was performed by irradiating 20 different activation foil types, some of which were cadmium covered, resulting in 37 different reactions at the peak axial flux location in each bucket.
