50|$|The {{engine is}} then turned {{over with a}} {{starting}} handle placed in the <b>starting</b> <b>dog</b> on the flywheel. This is aided by the decompression valve, which decompresses the engine and {{makes it easier to}} turn over to allow the flywheel to gain speed and inertia to turn the engine through compression, and get the engine to fire. A spiral groove on the perimeter of the flywheel carries a wheel on the decompressor mechanism and is used to determine the number of revolutions before the decompressor disengages. This is generally up to 3 revolutions, but can be anything up to 6 revolutions. Depending on the condition and mood of individual tractors, it is possible to get a thorough workout starting the Marshall.|$|E
