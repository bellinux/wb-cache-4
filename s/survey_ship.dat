5|$|Two {{years later}} the ship was {{purchased}} by South Africa and was converted into a <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> in 1949. Protea was obsolete by the late 1950s and was placed in reserve in 1957. The ship was sold in 1962 and was converted into a fishing trawler {{with the name of}} Justin. The company subsequently failed and she was scrapped in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> HMS Challenger {{yielded a}} tremendous amount of bathymetric data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the command}} of Oberleutnant zur See Erich Harms (the U-boat's former I.WO) from 7 June 1943, U-255 sailed from Bergen on 9 July, {{arriving}} at Narvik on the 16th. She left Narvik on 19 July and sailed into Soviet waters, where on 27 July she sank the 411 ton Russian <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> Akademik Shokalskij with her deck gun and small arms fire. U-255 established a secret seaplane base on Novaya Zemlya, and returned to Narvik on 19 September after 63 days at sea.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities in the United States, Seeadler steamed back across the Atlantic to the Azores, before proceeding into the Mediterranean Sea and then into the Red Sea. There, she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June. Seeadler proceeded to Bombay, India, for routine maintenance that lasted from 3 July to 21 August. The cruiser finally arrived on station on 2 September when she dropped anchor in Zanzibar and met the <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> , the other vessel on the East Africa Station. On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa; a group of slave traders had attacked the small police force detachment stationed there. The colonial army, the Schutztruppe (protection force), was unavailable to reinforce the police troops, and so Seeadler and Möwe bombarded the slavers and neutralized the threat.|$|E
5|$|After the side-scan sonar aboard Geosounder was {{switched}} {{out for the}} ROV (again {{delayed by}} technical issues and more bad weather), the <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> returned to Sydneys wreck site on 3 April, and performed a detailed study {{of the ship and}} her debris field. Inspections were also carried out on Kormoran and the believed battle site (the latter found to be outcrops of pillow lava), before Mearns declared the search over on 7 April. In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum commenced, with the objective of using 3D imaging to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Hiei alternated her {{training}} cruises with Kongō, making the 1897 cruise to the West Coast of North America and Hawaii from 13 April to 20 September and {{repeating the same}} cruise from 14 December 1898 to 28 August 1899. During that cruise, on 21 March 1898, the ship was re-designated as a 3rd-class coast defense ship, although she retained {{her training}} duties. Both ships made the 1902 cruise, their last, to Manila and Australia from 19 February to 25 August. Hiei played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War before she was reclassified as a <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> in 1906. Hiei was stricken from the Navy List on 1 April 1911 and ordered to be sold on 21 December. The exact date of her sale is not known, although Maizuru Naval District reported her sale on 25 March 1912.|$|E

5|$|Construction on Graf Zeppelin {{began on}} 28 December 1936, when her keel was laid {{down at the}} Deutsche Werke {{shipyard}} in Kiel. Named in honor of Graf (Count) Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the ship was launched on 8 December 1938, and was 85% complete by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Graf Zeppelin was not completed and was never operational due to shifting construction priorities necessitated by the war. She remained in the Baltic {{for the duration of}} the war; with Germany's defeat imminent, the ship's custodian crew scuttled her just outside Stettin in March 1945. The Soviet Union raised the ship in March 1946, and she was ultimately sunk in weapons tests north of Poland 17 months later. The wreck was discovered by a Polish <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|On January 24, Blandy {{named the}} Bikini Lagoon {{as the site}} for the two 1946 detonations, Able and Baker. The deep {{underwater}} test, Charlie, scheduled for early 1947, would take place in the ocean west of Bikini. Of the possible places given serious consideration, including Ecuador's Galápagos Islands, Bikini offered the most remote location with a large protected anchorage, suitable but not ideal weather, and a small, easily moved population. It had come under exclusive United States control on January 15, when Truman declared the United States to be the sole trustee of all the Pacific islands captured from Japan during the war. The Navy had been studying test sites since October 1945 and was ready to announce its choice of Bikini soon after Truman's declaration. On February 6, the <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> Sumner began blasting channels through the Bikini reef into the lagoon. The local residents were not told why.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} of its citizens on 13 January, the US government stated that it recognised that Zanzibar lay within Britain's sphere of influence, and would not intervene. The US did, however, urge that Britain cooperate with other Southeast African countries to restore order. The first British military vessel on the scene was the <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> HMS Owen, which was diverted from the Kenyan coast and arrived {{on the evening of}} 12January. Owen was joined on 15January by the frigate Rhyl and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Hebe. While the lightly armed Owen had been able to provide the revolutionaries with an unobtrusive reminder of Britain's military power, the Hebe and Rhyl were different matters. Due to inaccurate reports that the situation in Zanzibar was deteriorating, the Rhyl was carrying a company of troops of the first battalion of the Staffordshire Regiment from Kenya, the embarkation of which was widely reported in the Kenyan media, and would hinder British negotiations with Zanzibar. The Hebe had just finished removing stores from the naval depot at Mombasa and was loaded with weapons and explosives. Although the Revolutionary Council was unaware of the nature of Hebes cargo, the Royal Navy's refusal to allow a search of the ship created suspicion ashore and rumours circulated that she was an amphibious assault ship.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, British {{warships}} bombarded Dar es Salaam {{and destroyed}} the German wireless station there. By this time, Königsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff {{needed to find}} a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the <b>survey</b> <b>ship</b> Möwe. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, Königsberg passed over {{the bar at the}} mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed {{at the mouth of the}} river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg, observed a British cruiser—Pegasus—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.|$|E
