40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the design and control of {{a new class of}} brushless machine known as the flux switching machine for high speed and high power application. This machine is a hybrid of the inductor alternator and the switched reluctance machine. The characteristic of this machine determined from an experimental generator shows that the power delivery capability of the machine is limited by the synchronous inductance of the machine especially at high speeds. Various power factor control techniques are proposed and evaluated as possible solutions to the attendant problems with the uncontrolled flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator.</b> This involves the use of series compensation and shunt compensation techniques. For the series compensator technique, a new class of series line compensation delivering controlled power factor using pulse width modulation is identified and tested on an experimental flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system. The shunt compensation technique for the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system is a controlled rectifier, which uses phase angle pulse width modulation to deliver controlled power factor. The power factor control of the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system shows that significant improvement in power delivery for the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system can be achieved. Matlab/Simulink models are developed for each of the proposed technique and the results compared with experimental data shows reasonable agreement. These Matlab/Simulink models can now be effectively used for rapid design and prototyping of the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system. Closed loop control of the output voltage of the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system can be achieved. This is done using field current control and/or armature current control. The increased controllability of the FSG compared to other reluctance machines makes it a viable alternative for high speed, high power applications especially in mechanically harsh environment...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been {{increasing}} concerns about how geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) impact electrical power systems. Geomagnetically-induced currents (GICs) can saturate transformers, induce hot spot heating and increase reactive power losses. These effects can potentially cause catastrophic damage to transformers and severely impact {{the ability of a}} power system to deliver power. To address this problem, we develop a model of GIC impacts to power systems that includes 1) GIC thermal capacity of transformers as a function of normal Alternating Current (AC) and 2) reactive power losses as a function of GIC. We use this model to derive an optimization problem that protects power systems from GIC impacts through line <b>switching,</b> <b>generator</b> redispatch, and load shedding. We employ state-of-the-art convex relaxations of AC power flow equations to lower bound the objective. We demonstrate the approach on a modified RTS 96 system and the UIUC 150 -bus system and show that line switching is an effective means to mitigate GIC impacts.

40|$|Since Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in stream modes, such as counter (CTR), output {{feedback}} (OFB) and cipher feedback (CFB), {{can meet}} most industrial requirements, {{the range of}} applications for dedicated stream ciphers is decreasing. There are many attack results using algebraic properties and side channel information against stream ciphers for hardware applications. Al-Hinai et al. presented an algebraic attack approach to a family of irregularly clock-controlled linear feedback shift register systems: the stop and go generator, self-decimated generator and alternating step generator. Other clock-controlled systems, such as shrinking and cascade generators, are indeed vulnerable against side channel attacks. To overcome these threats, new clock-controlled systems were presented, e. g., the generalized alternating step generator, cascade jump-controlled generator and mutual clock-controlled generator. However, the algebraic attack could be applied directly on these new systems. In this paper, we propose a new clock-controlled generator: the <b>switching</b> <b>generator,</b> which has resistance to algebraic and side channel attacks. This generator also preserves both security properties and the efficiency of existing clock-controlled generators...|$|E

Most of electrical energy consumed in industrial facilities is received from electrical generators. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} perform research in order to develop advanced electric generators with less cost and high efficiency. There has been a recent interest in flux switching generators (FSG) in which all the flux sources are positioned in the stator that make the rotor simple, robust and brushless. Hence, this project presents an operating principle of a new proposed outer-rotor hybrid excitation flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator.</b> In this Generator a combination of a permanent magnet (PM) and field excitation coil (FEC) are used as the main flux sources. Additional FEC can be used to control the flux so that constant voltage can be produced at various wind conditions. Moreover, twelve coil tests, Three Phase coil test flux excited by PM only, Back-EMF at various speed and stack-length conditions, magnetic flux strengthening at various current densities and flux distribution are investigated by using JMAG software. The result shows that the generated voltage is directly proportional with the change of speed and stack-length {{and the size of the}} improved stack-length design has incremented 7. 4 times of the initial design. Moreover, another technique of improving induced B-EMF was proposed which is deterministic optimization method (DOM). The parameters of the design are optimized one at a time starting from the rotor dimensions followed by the stator parts such as PM, FEC and AC and the improved design indicated a higher output voltage...|$|E

Seen from the network operator's perspective {{as little more}} than negative load, the commissioning of such generators is subject to compliance with the Fit and Forget connection requirements of ENA Engineering Recommendation G 83 / 1. This thesis has sought to quantify the electromagnetic switching transient implications of integrating very large volumes of embedded generation into the UK's low-voltage supply networks. Laboratory testing of a converter-interfaced PV source has been undertaken to characterise typical switching transient waveshapes, and equivalent representative source models have been constructed in EMTP-ATP. A detailed frequency-dependent travelling wave equivalent of the DNO-approved Generic UK LV Distribution network model has been developed and, by means of extensive statistical simulation studies, used to quantify the cumulative impact of geographically localised <b>generators</b> <b>switching</b> in response to common network conditions. It is found that the magnitude of generator-induced voltage and current transients is dependent on the number of concurrently <b>switched</b> <b>generators,</b> and on their relative locations within the network. A theoretical maximum overvoltage of 1. 72 pu is predicted at customer nodes remote from the LV transformer terminals, for a scenario in which all households have installed embedded generation. Latent diversity in switch pole closing and inrush inception times is found to reduce predicted peak transient voltages to around 25 - 40 % of their theoretical maxima.

40|$|As {{illustrated}} {{in recent years}} (Superstorm Sandy, the Northeast Ice Storm of 1998, etc.), extreme weather events pose an enormous threat to the electric power transmission systems and the associated socio-economic systems that depend on reliable delivery of electric power.

40|$|Abstract—This paper studies {{fault-tolerant}} {{operation of}} multipole single-phase <b>switched</b> reluctance <b>generators</b> (SRG’s), in particular, an 8 / 8 -pole switched reluctance machine. The multipole single-phase SRG system is advantageous for reduced cost and higher efficiency compared to polyphase equivalents. However, using the classical phase-leg topology, a phase fault may prevent generating operation completely, since redundancy {{in the number}} of phases does not exist like polyphase systems. A new converter topology which connects two coil banks in parallel is proposed for higher fault tolerance with minimum additional cost. Faulty coils can be disconnected with the proposed converter and the SRG can continue generating operation after coil faults with reduced output power. Output power per coil current under faults is studied. Open- and short-circuit coils are studied through linear analysis, finite-element analysis, and static torque measurement. Generated currents under faults with the proposed converter are measured. The capability of the system to disconnect faulty coils dynamically is also shown.
