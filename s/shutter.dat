5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} <b>shutter</b> over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the <b>shutter</b> was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the <b>shutter</b> and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the <b>shutter,</b> then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the <b>shutter</b> could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the <b>shutter</b> open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Martin Scorsese {{cast her}} as the dead wife who haunts marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) in <b>Shutter</b> Island, a {{psychological}} thriller based on Dennis Lehane's 2003 best-selling novel of the same name. It was released on February 19, 2010. With $41.1million in ticket sales at over 2,900 locations, <b>Shutter</b> Island gave Williams her widest release and best opening weekend stats. In December 2010 she appeared with Ryan Gosling as a struggling married couple in the romantic drama Blue Valentine.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate ironclad Tennessee {{attacked}} Farragut's wooden ships {{without much}} effect {{after they had}} passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by Winnebago before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan's guns. About a half-hour later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. The monitors were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range. Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessees armor, but they did jam the armored <b>shutter</b> for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains, rendering her unable to steer. When the crew attempted to unjam the <b>shutter,</b> one shell struck {{the edge of the}} <b>shutter,</b> creating fragments that killed the machinist attempting to knock out the shutter's retaining pin and broke Admiral Franklin Buchanan's leg. This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship. The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered less than three weeks later.|$|E
50|$|Interior <b>shutters</b> are {{typically}} divided into narrow units hinged accordion-style so that {{two or more}} units cover each side of a window opening when closed. Operable louvered <b>shutters</b> have louvers (or louvres in British usage), or slats, controlled by a tilt bar or rod to adjust the louver position and keep them in a uniform position, to control light, visibility and airflow. <b>Shutters</b> with operable louvers are described variously as traditional <b>shutters,</b> California <b>shutters,</b> or plantation <b>shutters.</b> Plantation <b>shutters,</b> typical of warmer climates like Florida, South Africa, the Mediterranean or Australia, typically have only two <b>shutters</b> per window and wide louver blades.|$|R
50|$|Exterior <b>shutters</b> were {{originally}} constructed for light control, privacy, security and {{protection from the}} elements. Functional <b>shutters</b> hinge {{on each side of}} a window or at the top and swing closed when necessary and can also be mounted on tracks applied to the face of the building. Fixed and operable louvers shed rain, allow air transfer, filter direct sunlight, protect from small flying debris, and provide privacy. Operable louvered <b>shutters</b> allow for greater control of light and ventilation. Solid panels and board-and-batten <b>shutters</b> are generally used for security or protection during severe weather. Non-functional <b>shutters</b> are merely used to enhance the appearance of a building. Functional <b>shutters</b> have traditionally been constructed from solid woods that have proven to endure outside elements but have also been mass-produced in woods less suitable to the outdoors like pine. Finishing wood <b>shutters</b> is recommended for extended life. Composite <b>shutters</b> offer advantages over wood <b>shutters</b> such as resistance to twisting, splitting, and rotting. However, PVC <b>shutters</b> are often hinged with three or more hinges and painted with vinyl-safe paint to keep from bowing in the sun and can require additional hardware. Fiberglass <b>shutters</b> are more dimensionally stable than PVC.|$|R
50|$|Exterior <b>shutters</b> were vital {{elements}} on {{homes in}} the colonies. The expense of the <b>shutters</b> and their associated hardware was easily justified. There were no organized police forces; each man's home was truly his own castle to defend. With stout <b>shutters</b> securely locked from within, {{the windows of the}} home offered no easy access to marauding Indians or urban burglars. Which is why you often see raised panel <b>shutters</b> {{on the ground floor of}} early homes and louvered above. The raised panels were much more secure against access from ground level and the louvered upstairs <b>shutters</b> were often later additions to the home. Exterior <b>shutters</b> also proved a first barrier against the elements - winter winds and summer sun alike. In the cities <b>shutters</b> also provided privacy screens between the residents and the considerable pedestrian traffic only feet away. <b>Shutters</b> were in constant use, opened and closed daily.|$|R
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior <b>shutter,</b> the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and <b>shutter</b> closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E

5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the <b>shutter</b> of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the <b>shutter</b> of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his <b>shutter</b> and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E

5|$|A naval {{footnote}} in {{the history}} of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near <b>Shutter</b> Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a <b>shutter</b> speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E
