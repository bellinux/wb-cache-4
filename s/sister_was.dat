50|$|Two sisters go {{down by a}} body of water, {{sometimes}} a river and sometimes the sea. The older one pushes the younger in and refuses to pull her out again; generally the lyrics explicitly state her intent to drown her younger sister. Her motive, when included in the lyrics, is sexual jealousy - in some variants, the <b>sisters</b> <b>are</b> being two-timed by a suitor; in others, the elder <b>sister's</b> affections <b>are</b> not encouraged by the young man. In a few versions, a third <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> mentioned, but plays no significant role in events.

To protect her against an attack by Raynald, Saladin escorted the pilgrims while they were travelling near Oultrejordain.

Thereafter, Saladin marched to Ashtara, where the troops coming {{from all parts of}} his realm assembled.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} of Woodlea is variously stated as McKim, Mead & White, and Stanford White, although according to William Mitchell Kendall in his 1920 {{list of the}} firm's works, he attributes the house's design to McKim, Mead & White, with W. R. Mead as the supervising architect. Mead was rarely involved in architectural design in the partnership, making his design of Woodlea and another Vanderbilt house, Florham, unusual.

50|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that an older <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> likely to give a varied gender role to their younger {{siblings}} as well as being more likely to develop a close bond with their younger siblings. Older <b>sisters</b> <b>are</b> more likely to play with their younger siblings. Younger siblings display a more needy behavior when in close proximity to their older <b>sister</b> and <b>are</b> more likely to be tolerant of an older sisters bad behavior. Boys with only an older <b>sister</b> <b>are</b> more likely to display stereotypically male behavior, and such masculine boys increased their masculine behavior with the more sisters they have. The reverse is true for young boys with several sisters, as they tend to be feminine, however they outgrow this by the time they approach pubescence. Boys with older <b>sisters</b> <b>were</b> less likely to be delinquent or have emotional and behavioral disorders. A younger <b>sister</b> <b>is</b> less likely to be scolded by older siblings than a younger brother. The most common recreational activity between older brother/younger <b>sister</b> pairs <b>is</b> art drawing. Some studies also found a correlation between having an older sister and constructive discussions about safe sexual practises. Some {{studies have shown}} that men without <b>sisters</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be ineffectual at courtship and romantic relationships.|$|R

5|$|Alexandra {{spent the}} spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of Greece. During the Russo-Turkish War, Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a {{revision}} of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks. Alexandra and her two sons spent {{the next three years}} largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully. In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who was now the Tsarina.|$|E
5|$|Alice and Hugh I {{married in}} the first half of 1210, with Alice {{receiving}} the County of Jaffa as the agreed upon dowry. Alice's sister, Philippa, married Erard of Ramerupt, who laid claim to Champagne and Brie on Philippa's behalf in 1213. Blanche of Navarre soon approached the Holy See to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice's and Philippa's mother, stating that her first marriage to Humphrey IV of Toron had not been canonically annulled. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the pope's order concluded that both Humphrey IV and Isabella I had protested against the annulment of their marriage, which suggested that Isabella I's two subsequent marriages were unlawful. However, the Holy See did not complete the investigation and thus the legitimacy of Alice (and her <b>sister)</b> <b>was</b> not questioned.|$|E
5|$|Dausprungas is not {{mentioned}} anywhere else. However, {{it is known}} that Mindaugas had two nephews, Tautvilas and Gedvydas, who waged a war against their uncle. Since historians do not have any data on other brothers of Mindaugas, it is generally assumed that the two were sons of Dausprungas. During the civil war of 1249–1252 Tautvilas and Gedvydas asked Daniel of Galicia, their brother-in-law, for help. This bit of information indicates that they also had a sister. The <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> the second wife of Daniel and they did not have children. Dausprugas' wife must have been Duke of Samogitia Vykintas' sister since Vykintas was an uncle of Tautvilas and Gedvydas. It is believed that Gedvydas died in 1253 in a campaign against Bohemia, as it is the last message about him. Tautvilas was killed by his cousin Treniota in 1263. Some historians suggest that Tautvilas had a son, Constantine, who ruled Vitebsk, however others disagree and claim that his son might have been Aigust, who was sent by Novgorod to Pskov in 1271.|$|E
