50|$|As more schools, {{especially}} public schools, {{began to}} plan to integrate deeper learning, {{a group of}} Illinois advocates, aligned with P21, searched for assistance to scale best 21st Century teaching practices into classrooms. Already <b>successful</b> <b>exemplars</b> in the US and abroad were relying on versions of project based learning (problem-based, inquiry-based, product-making, project- based); there was great variation in effectiveness. After reviewing models from multiple sources, the Illinois Consortium for 21st Century Schools determined none were adequate for systemic integration into schools or systems. The consortium team, made up of volunteer, long experienced professional developers, classroom teachers, administrators and school change specialists, all with experience in public school reform, adapted and redesigned the most effective PBL models and designed a new school-wide approach of PBL that included explicit instruction and assessment of the 4CS as advocated by the Partnership, technology, reflection and a 5th C, cultural responsiveness. These elements were integrated into a PBL design cycle, called MindQuest21. Creative making was balanced with critical thinking to allow for teachers to challenge the narrow framework of the standards which ignored the creative C.|$|E

40|$|Japan’s defense {{production}} model {{is often seen}} as a <b>successful</b> <b>exemplar</b> of “techno-nationalism,” especially in {{the integration of the}} civilian and military sectors. Hence, Japan’s model has been considered as offering possible lessons for China to emulate in the reform of its own defense industry. But Japan’s defense {{production model}}, despite arguable past successes, is now experiencing what is often referred to by Japanese policymakers and industrialists as a “slow death” as its structural development limitations have been increasingly revealed over the past two decades. Japan’s defense production model is encountering three major structural limitations: 1. Stagnation in defense budgets and long-term military demand. 2. Flawed and failing procurement practices. 3.

40|$|European {{countries}} vary in {{the extent}} to which they succeed in reducing poverty using social transfers. However, we do not have good ways of understanding how these different outcomes are achieved. It is therefore very difficult to learn lessons from abroad. This paper uses micro data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Condition (SILC), and attempts to decompose reductions in child poverty rates and gaps into the contribution made by children, old age, social exclusion, housing and work-related benefits. The analysis is undertaken for all families with children under 16, lone parent families, couple families, and then for families with varying levels of work intensity. Transfers make a substantial contribution to reducing child poverty rates and closing poverty gaps. The contribution varies between countries in the European Union. There is no single model, no most <b>successful</b> <b>exemplar.</b> Some countries do better for their children in lone parent households and others do better for their children in couple households. The analysis has enabled some opening up of the how question, though what is going on is still something of a mystery in some countries. It is probable that analysis at the national level with greater knowledge of national benefits systems is necessary to further open the ‘black box’...|$|R
40|$|Although African-Americans as a {{group are}} {{economically}} disadvantaged compared to the white majority group, there are numerous salient counterexamples of black affluence. How do media images of highly successful African-Americans affect Whites` beliefs about the economic or political status of African-Americans as a whole? Three experiments are reported that begin {{to address this question}} by surreptitiously activating thoughts about specific exemplars of African-American success and observing the consequences for a measure of perceived discrimination against Blacks. Contrary to the Enlightened Racism perspective, which claims that images of affluent African-Americans are taken by white audiences as evidence of a lack of discriminatory barriers to black success. Experiment 1 revealed that prior activation of a successful, well-liked black exemplar resulted in increased perceptions of discrimination in contemporary society. Experiment 2 replicated this effect and showed further that it is limited to <b>successful</b> <b>exemplars</b> who are well liked; <b>successful</b> <b>exemplars</b> about whom subjects had more neutral attitudes did not produce any changes in perceptions of discrimination. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that the effect of successful, well-liked exemplars vanishes when people first {{think about the fact that}} the exemplars are atypical members of the group. These findings are discussed in terms of a generalized appraisal process in which momentarily salient outgroup exemplars influence intergroup attitudes, which in turn affect judgments and beliefs about the group via an attitude heuristic.

40|$|While {{clinical}} {{health services}} exist for service members with existing mental health conditions like posttraumatic stress, {{they are not}} stemming {{the rising tide of}} service suicides. A new approach to mental health intervention and suicide prevention in military-connected personnel is required, one that speaks to the participatory, hardworking ethos of military culture. Social work and health promotion professionals working to prevent and treat mental health problems like depression and stress injuries must understand the confluence of warrior culture and mental health issues in the veteran community. While the research literature does not yet address this confluence issue directly, programs exist that provide guidance, and a mindfulness-based training protocol may provide the answer. The purpose of this review is to provide programming recommendations based on a review of <b>successful</b> <b>exemplars</b> in treatment settings, the limited evaluation of best practices currently available when working with this priority population in prevention settings, and a cultural analysis of the military veteran community...|$|E
40|$|The European Union is {{increasingly}} committed to pushing forward open approaches {{as indicated by}} the G 8 Open Data Charter, the Opening Up Education initiative, the launch of the Open Education Europa Portal for OER resources and other similar initiatives. The EU-funded LinkedUp Project (Linking Web data for education) aims to gather <b>successful</b> <b>exemplars</b> of the use of open web data in education, with the objective of pushing forward the exploitation of the increasing amounts of public, open data available online. It aspires to do this by facilitating developer competitions and deploying an evaluation framework, which identifies innovative uses of robust, web-scale information management applications. This article will look at how LinkedUp has moved beyond advocacy of linked open data and has begun encompassing open approaches in all areas of work. One key focus has been in bringing together the open elements of an open data competition and sharing them as widely and openly as possible. It is anticipated that these elements can then be progressed and built upon by others organising similar competitions in both academia and industry. LinkedU...|$|E
40|$|With solid {{theoretical}} {{support from}} industrial ecology, {{an increasing number}} of industrial ecosystems (including eco-industrial parks and industrial symbiosis) have been created all over the world. There {{is no doubt that the}} Kalundborg symbiosis, which has steadily operates for thirty years, is our <b>successful</b> <b>exemplar,</b> although some problems also occurred in its history. However, we must realize that the Kalundborg symbiosis is not directly replicable elsewhere due to its special location and social surrounding. Indeed, designed EIPs (especially in the US in the 1990 s) have often resulted in failures, and most identifiable EIPs are still at a very early stage or transformation to an industrial ecosystem. The study of critical factors of EIPs is therefore important. One question is how to use typical IE tools, like MFA and LCA in EIPs. Recently, attention has been given to indentify and promote 9 ̆ 3 uncovering 9 ̆ 4 industrial symbiosis from the social perspective. Since an industrial ecosystem is a regional community with waste or byproduct links, cooperation and coordination among firms plays an important role. Researchers investigate this issue from multi-disciplines knowledge, such as social network approach, complex systems science, and system engineering to simulate the development, to evaluate an industrial ecosystem, or to help transformation of a traditional industrial system toward an EIP. Along this line, we should always reflect on to what extent IES could achieve resource recovery and sustainability. Uncertainty factors and reasons of failed IES should be further examined. Metrics or standards of successful industrial systems should be further clarified. This presentation will sketch some of these newer developments...|$|R
40|$|Singapore has few natural {{resources}} but, {{in a relatively}} short history, its economic and social development and transformation are nothing short of remarkable. Today Singapore {{is by far the most}} <b>successful</b> <b>exemplar</b> of material development in Southeast Asia and it often finds itself the envy of developed countries. Furthermore over the last three or four decades the ruling party has presided over the formation of a thriving community of Singaporeans who love and are proud of their country. Nothing about these processes has been 'natural' in any sense of the word. Much of the country's investment in nation-building has in fact gone into the selection, training and formation of a ruling and administrative elite that reflects and will perpetuate its vision of the nation. The government ownership of the nation-building project, its micromanagement of everyday life and the role played by the elite are three fundamental elements in this complex and continuing process of construction of a natrion. The intense triangulation of these elements and the pace of change they produce make Singapore one of the most intriguing specimens of nation-building in the region. In this critical study of the politics of ethnicity and elitism in Singapore, Barr and Skrbiš look inside the supposedly 'meritocratic' system, from nursery school to university and beyond, that produces Singapore's political and administrative elite. Focusing on two processes - elite formation and elite selection - they give primary attention to the role that etho-racial ascription plays in these processes but also consider the input of personal connections, personal power, class and gender. The result is a study revealing much about how Singapore's elite-led nation-building project has reached its current state whereby a Singaporean version of Chinese ethno-nationalism has overwhelmed the discourse on national and Singaporean identity...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the Rapid Prototyping Journal [© Emerald] and the definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 1355 - 2546 /Purpose – The computer-aided design (CAD) and manufacture of custom-fitting surgical guides {{have been shown to}} provide an accurate means of transferring computer-aided planning to surgery. To date guides have been produced using fragile materials via rapid prototyping techniques such as stereolithography (SLA), which typically require metal reinforcement to prevent damage from drill bits. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report case studies which explore the application of selective laser melting (SLM) to the direct manufacture of stainless steel surgical guides. The aim is to ascertain whether the potential benefits of enhanced rigidity, increased wear resistance (negating reinforcement) and easier sterilisation by autoclave can be realised in practice. Design/methodology/approach – A series of clinical case studies are undertaken utilising medical scan data, CAD and SLM. The material used is 316 L stainless steel, an alloy typically used in medical and devices and surgical instruments. All treatments are planned in parallel with existing techniques and all guides are test fitted and assessed on SLA models of the patients' anatomy prior to surgery. Findings – This paper describes the successful application of SLM to the production of stainless steel surgical guides in four different maxillofacial surgery case studies. The cases reported address two types of procedure, the placement of osseointegrated implants for prosthetic retention and Le Fort 1 osteotomies using internal distraction osteogenesis. The cases reported here have demonstrated that SLM is a viable process for the manufacture of custom-fitting surgical guides. Practical implications – The cases have identified that the effective design of osteotomy guides requires further development and refinement. Originality/value – This paper represents the first reported applications of SLM technology to the direct manufacture of stainless steel custom-fitting surgical guides. Four <b>successful</b> <b>exemplar</b> cases are described including guides for osteotomy as well as drilling. Practical considerations are presented along with suggestions for further development...|$|R

Globally there are 51 million hectares of certified organic agriculture land and a further 39 million hectares of wild culture land. For {{the past two}} decades organic agriculture has been growing at 11. 9 % per annum, thereby doubling the size of the sector every six years. Nevertheless, despite ten decades of advocacy for organics, only 1. 1 % of the world's agricultural land is certified organic. From the outset, the strategy has been to advance the sector 'one farm at a time'. This strategy has left the organics sector well short of the vision of the pioneers of organics who saw organic farming as a universal solution and a practice suited for all farmers and all agriculture. <b>Successful</b> <b>exemplars</b> of marketing strategies of converting 'one consumer at a time' remain elusive. Recent years have seen the development of new strategies for growth of the organics sector. The strategy of 'one crop at a time' has proved successful for the Dominican Republic which now produces 55 % of the world's certified organic bananas. The strategy of 'one state at a time' has seen the state of Sikkim (in India) declare itself as the first Indian organic state. Meanwhile, other Indian states are working towards all-organic status, including Mizoram, Goa, Rajasthan and Meghalaya. The strategy of 'one island at a time' has seen the Pacific islands of Cicia (in Fiji) and Abaiang (in Kiribati) commit to 100 % organic farming. The strategy of 'one country at a time' sees Bhutan with the stated goal of being the world's first organic nation. These new strategies rely for success on the tripartite cooperation of government, community and commerce. In the meantime, as these new strategies play out, only 11 countries report that 10 % or more of their agriculture land is organic, while 111 countries report that less than 1 % of their land is certified organic, which reveals great potential for new growth strategies...|$|E
40|$|In theory {{bringing}} a {{diverse range of}} the public together into a locality in a city and satisfying {{a broad spectrum of}} expectations is what public spaces are designed to satisfy. However, in reality this {{has proven to be a}} challenging task for both designers and planners. There are predominant factors that determine who would spend their time in a public space and to what extents they would be satisfied with their time spent. Those include age, gender, ethnicity, social class, needs, wants and personal preferences to just name a few. Having encompassed a wide range of activities, all-inclusive urban spaces may impose substantial costs to the city from inception through to the completion stages. However, such spaces can successfully be launched, and reimburse their costs, if they are carefully set up to absorb the mass of their peripheral communities and inhabitants on a regular basis. Offering relief for senior citizens, amusement for the youngsters and toddlers, entertainment for the teenagers, all in chorus, provide interactive atmospheres that resonate with the initial purposes of all-inclusive public spaces. This paper aims to investigate Niruye-Havaei, an established urban square, in Tehran as one of the most <b>successful</b> <b>exemplars</b> in provision of an overarching urban public space, overcoming the aforementioned problem. The paper begins with general background information of the place and the space, and the communities in the surrounding vicinities, and how they have been formed over the years and how they are in a dynamic interaction with each other, leading to introduction of such successful pattern. Utilising overt and covert participant observation (ethnography) methods, it will then contemplate on the potentials of place and space, and explores how the entire urban district has been ‘orbitalised' around this featured space and why it has found such a prominent role in the area. Finally, it concludes with a framework model for all-inclusive public spaces and suggests its application to similar situations for acquiring a record of success in urban developments...|$|E

40|$|One {{issue with}} {{learning}} effective policies in multi-agent adversarial games {{is that the}} size of the search space can be prohibitively large when the actions of all the players are considered simultaneously. In most team games, players need to coordinate to accomplish tasks, either in a preplanned or emergent manner. An effective team policy must generate the necessary coordination, yet considering all possibilities for creating coordinating subgroups is computationally infeasible. I propose that reusable coordination patterns can be identified from <b>successful</b> training <b>exemplars</b> and used to guide multi-agent policy search. Experiments are conducted within the Rush 2008 football simulator and show how an analysis of mutual information and workflow can be used to identify subgroups of players that frequently coordinate within a particular formation.

Results show how we can use knowledge of the top-ranked subgroup to focus search using two different policy generation methods 1) play adaptation and 2) UCT Monte Carlo (MC) planning. Our method produces superior plans which doubles the offensive team’s performance in the Rush 2008 football simulator over prior methods...|$|R

40|$|Purpose This chapter {{presents}} {{four different}} approaches to doing and writing qualitative research in strategy and management based on different epistemological foundations. It describes two well-established ‘‘templates’’ for doing such work, and introduces two more recent ‘‘turns’’ that merit greater attention. Design/Methodology/Approach The chapter draws on methodological texts and {{a detailed analysis of}} <b>successful</b> empirical <b>exemplars</b> from the strategy and organization literature to show how qualitative research on strategy processes can be effectively carried out and written up. Findings The two ‘‘templates’’ are based on different logics and modes of writing. The first is based on a positivist epistemology and aims to develop nomothetic theoretical propositions, while the second is interpretive and more concerned to capture and gain insight from the meanings given to organizational phenomena. The two ‘‘turns’’ (the practice turn and the discursive turn) are not as well defined but are generating innovative contributions based on new ways of considering the social world. Originality/Value The chapter should be helpful to researchers considering qualitative methods for the study of strategy processes. It contributes by comparing different approaches and by recognizing that part of the challenge of doing qualitative research lies in writing it up to communicate its insights in a credible way. Thus while describing the different methods, the chapter also draws attention to effective forms of writing. In addition, it introduces and assesses two more recent ‘‘turns’’ that offer promising routes to novel insight as well as having particular ontological and epistemological affinities with qualitative research methods...|$|R
