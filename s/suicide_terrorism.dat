These attacks have been aimed at diverse military and civilian targets, including in Sri Lanka, in Israel since July 6, 1989, in Iraq since the US-led invasion of that country in 2003, in Pakistan since 2001 and in Afghanistan since 2005 and in Somalia since 2006.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{violence}} of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas (a group dedicated to Israel's destruction) have convinced many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and a two state system is not the answer.

Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust Palestinian leadership to maintain control.

Robert Pape has argued that at least terrorists utilizing suicide attacks—a particularly effective form of terrorist attack– are driven not by Islamism but by [...] "a clear strategic objective: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland". However, Martin Kramer, who debated Pape on origins of suicide bombing, stated that the motivation for suicide attacks is not just strategic logic but also an interpretation of Islam to provide a moral logic. For example, Hezbollah initiated suicide bombings after a complex reworking of the concept of martyrdom. Kramer explains that the Israeli occupation of the South Lebanon Security Zone raised the temperature necessary for this reinterpretation of Islam, but occupation alone would not have been sufficient for <b>suicide</b> <b>terrorism.</b> [...] "The only way to apply a brake to suicide terrorism," [...] Kramer argues, [...] "is to undermine its moral logic, by encouraging Muslims to see its incompatibility with their own values." ...|$|E

40|$|If the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century is characterized by high development of science, technology, computerization, and all in the name of the liberation of humanity from dependence on nature and mastery of the laws that govern nature, {{the beginning}} of the twenty-first century is characterized by expansion of violence and terrorism in all parts of the globe exposed through all its forms ranging from assassinations, kidnappings, murders for political purposes, <b>suicides,</b> etc. <b>Terrorism</b> is a global phenomenon, which is characterized by illegally using threats and violence against individuals or groups of people or countries in order to achieve certain political, religious or ideological purposes. When we talk about international terrorism, in particular we talk about a phenomenon that is identical to the national terrorism and the only difference between them consists in the aspect of whether the terrorist act is performed within the territory of the country in which a terrorist organization acts or that he or she committed the terrorist act or the executed terrorist act transcends the boundaries of a state and thus save members of a particular international terrorist organization in the commission of international terrorist act and also citizens who are involved or the entire territory of more than one state. A key factor in the fight against global terrorism is the international cooperation and interplay of forces and means of the different countries in the world. Key stakeholders in the fight against global terrorism are NATO, EU, UN and regional organizations within countries which accomplish individual efforts and mutual economic, political or other types of cooperation. In this regard, the Republic of Macedonia not only as one country alone, but also in cooperation with other countries in Europe and the world is actively involved in the fight against global terrorism and continuously contributes to building peace and stability in the world. For the purposes of this paper, the essence, characteristics and forms in which terrorism occurs and acts, and the methods and forces to combat terrorism which are realized within the international community will be studied in detail and explained, and the role that the Republic of Macedonia has and the contribution that we make to the fight against global terrorism will be highlighted and analyzed with due attention, through its participation in peacekeeping operations to combat terrorism and building peace in the world as a candidate member of NATO and the European Union.

50|$|Signs {{of discontent}} continued. Terrorist {{activity}} increased dramatically in 2003, with the Riyadh compound bombings and other attacks, which prompted {{the government to}} take much more stringent action against <b>terrorism.</b> <b>Suicide</b> bombers killed 35 people at housing compounds for Westerners in Riyadh hours before U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell flew in for planned visit in May 2003. More than 300 Saudi intellectuals - {{women as well as}} men - signed a petition in September 2003, calling for far-reaching political reforms. A month later, police had to break up an unprecedented rally in the centre of Riyadh calling for political reform. More than 270 people were arrested. In November, a suicide attack by suspected al-Qaeda militants on a residential compound in Riyadh left 17 dead and scores injured. The King responded by granting the Consultative Council the ability it to propose legislation. There was a serious escalation in militant violence in 2004. In April four police officers and a security officer were killed in attacks near Riyadh. A car bomb at security forces' HQ in Riyadh killed four, wounds 148. A group linked to al-Qaeda claimed responsibility. In May, an attack at a petrochemical site in Yanbu killed five foreigners. Another attack and hostage-taking at an oil company compound in Khobar saw 22 people killed. In June, there were three gun attacks in Riyadh within a week, leaving two Americans and a BBC cameraman dead. The same week, a U.S. engineer was abducted and beheaded, his filmed death caused revulsion in America. Security forces killed the local al-Qaeda leader shortly afterwards, but an amnesty for militants which followed had only limited effect despite a fall in militant activity. In December, an attack on the U.S. consulate in Jeddah led to five staff and four attackers being killed. Two car bombs exploded in central Riyadh and security forces killed seven suspects in a subsequent raid.|$|R
40|$|There is {{not much}} {{research}} written {{about the relationship between}} education and the rise of terrorism. Some scholars have urged for educative response to end terrorism (Krueger and Maleckova, 2003; Brockhoff et al., 2015; Malazada, 2016; Illiteracy rates drop in Iraq: Government, 2014) In his study, Brockhoff et al., (2015) found that when country specific factors like the economic situation and political representation were unfavorable, education is the reason some individuals become terrorists. Abrifor (2008) concluded that abuse of students in Nigeria lead them to get involved in criminal activities, <b>suicide</b> bombing and <b>terrorism.</b> In light of these studies, it is legitimate to think that the problems facing the Iraqi educational system and the low quality of education are the main causes that fuel terrorism. Every Iraqi citizen knows that education in Iraq is deteriorating. However, the governments of Iraq have not tried to improve the educational system to make it resistant to terrorism. This study tries {{to find out if the}} Iraqi citizens who studied their whole life in the Iraqi educational system and who have suffered or know someone who have suffered from terrorism think that education in Iraq is responsible for the spread of terrorism in the country. The study also aims to find out if the respondents think that improving the educational system in Iraq can potentially exterminate terrorism from the country. Additionally, the study tries to find out the main issues that Iraqi education policymakers need to address so that education can be used as counterterrorism. For the study, a survey was used as the main method of data collection. The survey was posted on Facebook groups and 666 respondents answered it. The study found that most of respondents think that there is a relationship between education and terrorism in Iraq. The study also found that most of respondents think that improving the Iraqi educational system can exterminate terrorism in Iraq. In addition to that, the study found that the majority of respondents think that Iraqi educational system must be improved and unified to introduce students to different point of views, religions, and cultures, be inclusive and secular to promote pluralism in the country, and stop using or teaching about violence in schools. Furthermore, respondents favored that the goals of education must be given importance not the curriculum itself and that critical thinking is taught to help students be able to think objectively before adopting certain ideology. An important issue that the study found is that the majority of respondents think that history and Islamic education must be modified and their books must be rewritten to include other religions and ethnic groups in the country. This study suggests that the educational system in Iraq must be improved as soon as possible to tackle the issue of terrorism. The Iraqi educational system must be modified to be secular and inclusive. Islamic Education must be changed into either “Citizenship Education or Teaching about Religions” that many countries around the world have adopted. Therefore, it is important that teaching religion becomes non-denominational so that all students can feel welcomed and equal in the classroom...|$|R
40|$|On {{the anniversary}} of 11 September 2001, CLIVE WILLIAMS surveys the global and {{regional}} threats TERRORISM is still regarded by the Howard government as a medium {{threat to national security}} (that is, a terrorist attack could occur here), with the priority focus since the 7 / 7 London bombings being on the home-grown threat. Since 2000, 33 people have faced an Australian court, are facing court, or have been imprisoned for terrorism-related offences. These include 22 Operation Pendennis suspects whose trials are listed to commence in February 2008. Mid-year, Howard government counterterrorism credibility was damaged by the government’s inept handling of the Haneef case, particularly by the actions of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews. The Australian Federal Police were also embarrassed when Haneef’s counsel released two transcripts of interviews to counter leaks to the media intended to justify Haneef’s treatment. Al-Qaeda continues to exert influence internationally through its well-organised psychological warfare campaign. Even so, it is far from being the evil empire orchestrating global violence that the Bush Administration purports it to be. Rather, it serves to influence and reinforce the beliefs of young Muslims internationally who can relate to al-Qaeda’s rhetoric about injustices towards Muslims in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Mindanao, etc, and the need for Muslims to defend their religion. No significant progress will be made in the information war against al-Qaeda until there are positive political developments for Muslims in Palestine and elsewhere. Al-Qaeda has become an identifiable global “brand,” with which many local extremist groups, driven predominantly by local agendas, want to be associated. This sometimes leads them to incorporate “al-Qaeda” into their titles, as in the cases of “Al-Qaeda {{in the land of the}} two rivers” (Iraq) and “Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. ” This brand association gives local groups the advantage of being part of a global “structure,” increases their legitimacy internationally, improves their prospects of funding and recruiting, gives them access to other regional actors, and improves their training options. Al-Qaeda branding does not of course signify al-Qaeda control. Despite this globalised dimension of terrorism, circumstances vary from region to region. Russia has made former Chechen rebel Ramzan Kadyrov, 30, President of Chechnya. Putin shrewdly entrusted Kadyrov with power because he was seen as the only person who could keep large numbers of former rebels under control, thus stalemating the Second Chechen War. Kadyrov’s appointment and ruthless reputation have brought relative peace to Chechnya and Russia. The international Islamist fighters are now reported to have moved on to neighbouring Dagestan. There continues to be little incentive for Israel to engage in any meaningful peace process with the Palestinians. Israel is receiving generous aid from the United States (proposed military aid of $ 3 billion a year over the next ten years), is suffering little from Palestinian terrorist attacks since building the security wall (deaths are probably running at about 50 Palestinians to one Israeli in 2007), and is feeling little international pressure to curb Israeli settlement on the West Bank (Israeli settlers there are now estimated to be 250, 000 - 300, 000). At the same time, the US and Israel are trying to undermine democratically elected Hamas and aid the old corrupt Fatah power group. This inevitably has led to increased intra-Palestinian violence. In Iraq, despite claims of US military surge progress, the reality is that the United States lacks the numbers of combat personnel in country, or the hearts-and-minds mindset, to prevail against the insurgency, which the US acknowledges could number up to 100, 000, well up from earlier (2004) US estimates of 20, 000 - 25, 000. The foreign Islamist presence is believed to be of the order of 2, 000. Most of the suicide bombers are foreigners; mainly Saudis according to Israeli monitoring of martyr sites. In July, the Los Angeles Times reported that 45 per cent of foreign militants were from Saudi Arabia; 15 per cent from Syria and Lebanon; and 10 per cent from North Africa. Captured foreign fighters have been mainly from Egypt, Syria, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, in that order. Interestingly, 15 have been from the US. According to a February-March 2007 poll, 51 per cent of the Iraqi population approve of the attacks on Coalition forces. When broken down along sectarian lines, over 90 per cent of the Sunni approve of the attacks. But there is evidence of some falling out at a local level between foreign Islamists and local Sunni insurgents, particularly in al-Anbar Province to the west, which could be why much of the foreign action now appears to be north of Baghdad in Diyala Province. Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr has just ordered his Mahdi army militia to suspend offensive operations for six months to try to bring it more tightly under his control. It is currently plagued by out-of-control rogue and criminal elements. This should lead to a downturn in explosively formed projectile attacks against Coalition forces. In Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force is facing a resurgent “New” Taliban in Afghanistan’s south and east, operating from Pakistan and possibly also from Iran. NATO solidarity is under pressure because Britain and Canada are doing most of the fighting and suffering most of the deaths - 74 and 70 respectively as of 30 August 2007. It seems unlikely that the International Security Assistance Force will remain in Afghanistan for longer than another five years. Meanwhile, the New Taliban is building for the longer term through local intermarriage and warlord alliances, but is probably unlikely to be able to topple the central government or dominate the country again. According to the UN, in 2007 Afghanistan cultivated 193, 000 hectares of opium poppies, an increase of 17 per cent over last year. The amount of Afghan land used for opium is now larger than the corresponding total for coca cultivation in Latin America (Colombia, Peru and Bolivia combined). We should assume that at least some of this money will be finding its way to <b>terrorism.</b> <b>Suicide</b> attacks in Afghanistan have gone from just two in 2003 to 118 in 2006, with a continuing high level again this year. Use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) is also on the increase and there are reports of explosively formed projectiles being used. We can expect more kidnappings of foreign workers following the recent successful abduction of South Koreans, and reportedly large ransom paid for their release. India continues to suffer high levels of terrorist violence, often originating from Pakistan. The most recent major attacks were in Hyderabad, with 20 plus deaths. Islamist attacks are usually related to the Kashmir issue or Hindu discrimination against the 174 million Muslims in India, who form 13 per cent percent of the population. Naxalite violence is also on the increase in India. The Naxalites have intensified their insurgency in 2007 and are now active in half of India’s states, mostly in rural areas, in an attempt to encourage a peasant revolt. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said the Naxalites pose the biggest internal security threat to India since independence. In March, at least 49 police officers were killed in an attack on a police outpost. Sri Lanka’s ceasefire has broken down this year and there has been a resumption of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam attacks, including two crude attacks from the air. The Tamil Tigers face some cohesion problems posed by Colonel Karuna’s breakaway element, but remain the world’s best organised and most capable insurgent/terrorist group. Three Tamils in Australia have been charged this year with being linked to the organisation. Indonesia presents a more positive picture, with most of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leadership dead or in custody and the bulk of JI’s members now focused on non-violent political change. Concerns relate to the dangerous Noordin Mohammed Top element, which is still operational, while a JI rebuilding effort is going on in Mindanao in coordination with a breakaway element of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Projections of a much larger youth population in Indonesia in the future, and increasing unemployment, will bear watching. In the Philippines, the Arroyo government has had some operational successes - against the Rajah Solaiman Islamic Movement and the Abu Sayyaf Group, and there is a tenuous peace arrangement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Moro National Liberation Front. It remains to be seen whether the new leader of the Abu Sayyaf Group, religious scholar Yasser Igasan, will take it in a new direction. Non-Islamist left wing groups, such as the New People’s Army, are in decline and have commonly developed into criminal organisations, dominating some rural areas. Despite some successes, the Philippines government is under pressure for a lack of real social and political progress in Mindanao, and for the high level of extra-judicial disappearances throughout the Philippines. Thailand’s three southern provinces face a deteriorating security situation, largely brought about originally by central government mismanagement. There have been more than 2300 deaths there since an escalation of violence in January 2004. The insurgents’ main tactics are targeted killings (100 in the first half of this year), IED attacks (48 over the same period), arson attacks, and direct fire attacks. Military casualties from under-road IEDs are increasing. There is also an increase in Muslim disappearances and deaths in custody. The proximity of Malaysia means that wanted extremists can go into hiding across the border will little prospect of being arrested. Ammonium nitrate for the IEDs also comes from Malaysia. Despite some conjecture about the insurgency having foreign connections, there seems to be little evidence of foreign involvement, or of local Muslims going outside Thailand for training. While this survey of regional conflicts paints a mixed picture from a counterterrorism perspective, in my view the threat from terrorism can be managed and contained to the point that it is not going to affect our national security adversely. Iraq and Afghanistan will continue to be the focus of Australian attention because of our military involvement there, and is of course hostage to what the US and NATO decide to do in the future. But military withdrawal of most Western forces from Iraq and Afghanistan would not inevitably lead to terrorist domination or to a regional security disaster. This is particularly the case in Iraq, where the foreign terrorist element is supported by not more than 10 per cent of the population and is likely to be ejected once US forces withdraw. In fact, military withdrawal of most Western forces (other than training teams) from Iraq and Afghanistan could well throw up new and better prospects for countering Islamist extremists, and reduce the security threat at home that flows to a considerable extent from our military involvements and foreign policies. • Clive Williams is a Visiting Fellow at the ANU’s Strategic and Defence Studies Centre and an Adjunct Professor at Macquarie University’s Centre for Policing, Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism.
