In the lagoon, sparse living coral <b>still</b> <b>can</b> be found; the dominant species is Montipora bilaminata (family Acroporidae).

5|$|The team {{aimed to}} {{replicate}} the playing experience and difficulty of the extant Syndicate. Starbreeze considered {{the difficulty of the}} first game {{to be part of the}} franchise's legacy and was worth preserving; they hoped the new game would be challenging enough for players without being frustrating. They introduced a rarely scripted artificial intelligence (AI) into the game. The AI reacts to players' actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked. The new game has less gore than the older one; players <b>still</b> <b>can</b> kill innocent civilians but the team minimized these scenarios, which they thought were part of the game's environment rather than gameplay elements.|$|E

5|$|Two {{sections}} of the province are not dominated by forest. The province's northeast corner bordering Hudson Bay is above the treeline and is considered tundra. The tallgrass prairie once dominated the south central and southeastern parts including the Red River Valley. Mixed grass prairie {{is found in the}} southwestern region. Agriculture has replaced much of the natural prairie but prairie <b>still</b> <b>can</b> be found in parks and protected areas; some are notable for the presence of the endangered western prairie fringed orchid,.|$|E
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin <b>still</b> <b>can</b> not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
5|$|Since the Second World War, most {{but not all}} Commonwealth {{countries}} have created their own honours systems and no longer participate in the British honours system. This began soon after the Partition of India in 1947, when the new countries of India and Pakistan introduced their own systems of awards. The VC {{was replaced by the}} Param Vir Chakra (PVC) and Nishan-e-Haider (NH) respectively. Most if not all new honours systems continued to permit recipients of British honours to wear their awards according to the rules of each nation's order of wear. Sri Lanka, whose defence personnel were eligible to receive the Victoria Cross until 1972, introduced its own equivalent, the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya medal. Three Commonwealth realms—Australia, Canada and New Zealand—have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the Victoria Cross with their own. The only Commonwealth countries that <b>still</b> <b>can</b> recommend the VC are the small nations, none of whose forces have ever been awarded the VC, that still participate in the British honours system.|$|E

25|$|Solar <b>stills</b> <b>can</b> {{be used to}} make {{drinking}} water in areas where clean water is not common. Solar distillation is necessary in these situations to provide people with purified water. Solar energy heats up the water in the still.

25|$|Brandy {{is usually}} {{produced}} in pot stills (batch distillation), but the column <b>still</b> <b>can</b> {{also be used}} for continuous distillation. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation in column stills.|$|E

Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube.
