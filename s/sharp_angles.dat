5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E
5|$|Shot on {{location}} in Rome and at Elios Studios, Tenebrae utilized mostly modern-looking locations and sets to help Argento realize his intent that the film reflect a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography Luciano Tovoli, Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere, with <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> and modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band Goblin provided Tenebraes music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships are}} fully fitted with flag facilities, {{such as their}} {{capability}} of operating in a NBC environment, and also Radar cross-section reduction is presumed to be minimal, {{to the extent that}} some <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> are flattened. For primary air defence, a pair of two 3S-90 launchers (one forward of the bridge and the other atop the dual helicopter hangar) are fitted with the Shtil SAM system. The system consists of 24 Russian Shtil missiles in a below-deck magazine. The launchers elevate up to 70°, with a firing arc of 30° within the centreline. The launcher groups, which require a 20-man crew, weigh about 50 tons.|$|E
30|$|The {{unaffected}} acetabulum {{followed the}} normal age-dependent development of <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> {{as reported by}} Ozçelik et al. [17], whereas the affected side remained steep at the 5 -year-follow-up. One previous study has measured the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> in children with Perthes’ disease. Joseph showed that the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> of Perthes’ hips in male, skeletally immature patients was higher compared to the unaffected side (44.7 ° vs. 42.9 °) [5]. Furthermore, he found {{a significant difference in}} the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> between affected and unaffected hips in symptomatic adult patients with healed Perthes’ disease (40.1 ° and 36.1 °, respectively). These results are in accordance with our results, indicating that a steeper acetabulum is developed in Perthes’ hips during the course of the disease.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of the robot {{practical}} working, the change of motion direction of trajectory is inevitable. When the direction changes dramatically, the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> between adjacent trajectories, which can generate the vibration of robot, affects the service life of the robot. In order to deal with the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> between adjacent trajectories, we propose a method which can deal with the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> transferring by inserting transition arc, which is called position level, to solve the trajectory speed control problem. We analyze three basic analytic trajectories—space line, space arc, and space parabola—and present the formula for calculating the parameters of circular-arc-related parameters and propose the implementation process of algorithm of robot system. Through the simulation and experiment, this method can solve the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> trajectory transfer problem effectively, increase the transfer speed dramatically, and reduce the vibration of robot’s mechanical structure...|$|R
30|$|To our knowledge, no {{previous}} study has associated <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> {{at an early stage}} of Perthes’ disease with the later shape of the femoral head. We found no significant associations between this parameter at the time of diagnosis and at the 1 -year follow-up with the modified three-group Stulberg classification at the 5 -year follow-up. Thus, <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> is of no prognostic value in Perthes’ disease.|$|R

25|$|Though it is {{difficult}} to define what can properly be called a 'Cubist sculpture', Picasso's 1909-10 Head bares the hallmarks of early Cubism in that the various surfaces constituting the face and hair are broken down into irregular fragments that meet at <b>sharp</b> <b>angles,</b> rendering practically unreadable the basic volume of the head beneath. These facets are obviously a translation from two to three dimensions of the broken planes of Picasso's 1909-10 paintings.|$|E
30|$|A {{secondary}} change {{noted in}} patients treated with transphyseal screw fixation of the proximal femur was {{an improvement in}} acetabular geometry. <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> improved by 4.7 ° and the center edge angle improved by 5.8 °. The acetabular index was not measured in this study because it becomes increasingly difficult to measure as the triradiate cartilage closes when patients become skeletally mature. Meanwhile, <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> references landmarks present through development, and it shows little variation with pelvic tilt and pelvic rotation [15]. Furthermore, prior studies report good inter- and intra-rater reliability for <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> and center edge angle of Wiberg [20]. While the mean changes in <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> and the CE angle were small, in some children the improvement was remarkable. In reviewing and measuring many radiographs, {{it appears that the}} central third of the proximal femoral physis is relatively straight, while the superior and inferior margins droop. This central third of the physis corresponds to the roundest part of the femoral head, which could be a stimulus for acetabular improvement. However, this is difficult to document but deserves further investigation.|$|R

25|$|Much of {{the naval}} combat mini-game goes into {{attempting}} to outmaneuver the enemy, bringing the enemy vessel into cannon range while trying {{to stay out of}} the enemy's line of fire. The player may also attempt to board the enemy as quickly as possible to avoid harm to his ship or the target. Wind direction and specific ship capabilities feature heavily into this. Some ships are adept at sailing at <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> to the wind direction, while others can only gain reasonable speed while sailing across or with the wind. Turning speed is also different between ship types, and so some ships can actually weave between cannonballs, while others turn very slowly and cannot make fancy maneuvers. There is great emphasis on knowing the particular strengths and weaknesses of one's ship, and the ability to gauge wind direction continuously and act accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Söderling is an {{offensive}} baseliner {{who was known}} for his competitive drive and powerful game. His serve was heavy, reaching speeds up to 230km/h (143mph); although it could sometimes lack precision, leading him to struggle against strong returners like Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. He could overpower almost all of his opponents and possessed a good return game. He has accurate and powerful groundstrokes off both wings; his forehand was {{regarded as one of the}} most lethal in the game, and he also possesses a dangerously accurate two-handed backhand that can also produce winners with <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> although with less speed than his forehand. Most of his success came on faster surfaces (fast indoor courts; hard and carpet), although his best Grand Slam results came at the French Open; likely due to the heavy conditions and slowness of the clay which allowed him more time to set up his powerful shots.|$|E

The mural is themed around [...] "energy and man's application {{of it to}} the solution of his problems", and pays homage to the Golden Age of Aviation and the Machine Age. The mural is painted {{in the shape of a}} [...] "Y" [...] with ocher and golden tones. In its center is central image of the mural is a [...] "muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to the attainment of the triumphs of this mechanical era", according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised the building. The mural's Art Deco theme manifests itself in the characteristic triangles, <b>sharp</b> <b>angles,</b> slightly curved lines, chrome ornaments, and numerous patterns. The mural depicts several silver planes, including the Spirit of St. Louis, as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and the building itself. There is a wall panel dedicated to the work of clinchers, surveyors, masons, carpenters, plasterers and builders. Fifty different figures were modeled based on workers who participated in its construction. In 1999, the mural was returned to its original state after a restoration that removed the polyurethane coating and filled-in holes added in the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{style of}} The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is dark, twisted and bizarre; radical and {{deliberate}} distortions in perspective, form, dimension and scale create a chaotic and unhinged appearance. The sets {{are dominated by}} sharp-pointed forms and oblique and curving lines, with narrow and spiraling streets, [...] and structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, giving the impression they could collapse or explode at any given moment. Film critic Roger Ebert described it as [...] "a jagged landscape of <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives". The sets are characterized by strokes of bold, black paint. The landscape of Holstenwall is painted on canvas, {{as opposed to a}} constructed set, and shadows and streaks of light are painted directly onto the sets, further distorting the viewer's sense of perspective and three-dimensionality. Buildings are clustered and interconnected in a cubist-like architecture, surrounded by dark and twisted back alleys. Lotte Eisner, author of The Haunted Screen, writes that objects in the film appear as if they are coming alive and [...] "seem to vibrate with an extraordinary spirituality". Likewise, Expressionismus und Film writer Rudolf Kurtz wrote [...] "the dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created". The rooms have radically offset windows with distorted frames, doors that are not squared, and chairs that are too tall. Strange designs and figures are painted on the walls of corridors and rooms, and trees outside have twisted branches that sometimes resemble tentacles.|$|E
