40|$|Session: ImplantologyObjectives: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} <b>cover</b> <b>screw,</b> resin embedment and tube angulation on artifact of micro-CT scanning for implant. Methods: A total of twelve implants were randomly divided into 4 groups: 1) implants with <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> and resin embedment; 2) implants with <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> but no resin embedment; 3) implants with no <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> but with resin embedment; 4) implants with no <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> or or resin embedment. The implants were scanned with micro-CT at 0 °, 45 ° and 90 ° tube angulation. Images were assessed and the ratio of artifact volume to total volume (AV/TV) was calculated. A multiple regression analysis in stepwise model {{was used to determine}} the significance of different factors. One-way ANOVA was performed to identify which combination of factors could minimize the artifact. Results: In the regression analysis, tube angulation was identified as the best predictor for artifact among the factors. Resin embedment also had significant effect on artifact volume while <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> had not. ANOVA analysis indicated that non-embedded implants produced minimal artifact when the axis of implant was parallel to the center of x-ray source of micro-CT.

The <b>cover</b> <b>screws</b> were cleaned by using citric acid, sterile water, hydrogen peroxide and CO 2 laser {{alone or with}} a combination of these. In addition, decontaminated but not cleaned and unused <b>cover</b> <b>screws</b> were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After cleaning the <b>cover</b> <b>screws</b> were implanted in the abdominal wall of the rat for 6 weeks. The thickness of the fibrous capsule and the number of macrophages within the capsule were measured by means of light microscopical morphometry. As compared to the negative control, CO 2 laser on dry surface, CO 2 laser+hydrogen peroxide and the positive control had statistically significant thinner fibrous capsules. As compared to the positive, only laser alone resulted in a similar tissue response. It is concluded that CO 2 laser used alone or in combination with hydrogen peroxide may be used clinically for sufficient decontamination of titanium surfaces. © Munksgaard 2000.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Previous {{studies that}} {{evaluated}} the torque needed for removing dental implant screws have not considered {{the manner of}} transfer of the occlusal loads in clinical settings. Instead, the torque used for removal was applied directly to the screw, {{and most of them}} omitted the possibility that the hexagon could limit the action of the occlusal load in the loosening of the screws. The present study proposes a method for evaluating the screw removal torque in an anti-rotational device independent way, creating an unscrewing load transfer to the entire assembly, not only to the screw. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty hexagonal abutments without the hexagon in their bases were fixed with a screw to 20 dental implants. They were divided into two groups: Group 1 used titanium screws and Group 2 used titanium <b>screws</b> <b>covered</b> with a solid lubricant. A torque of 32 Ncm was applied to the screw and then a custom-made wrench was used for rotating the abutment counterclockwise, to loosen the screw. A digital torque meter recorded the torque required to loosen the abutment. RESULTS: There was {{a significant difference between the}} means of Group 1 (38. 62 ± 6. 43 Ncm) and Group 2 (48. 47 ± 5. 04 Ncm), with p= 0. 001. CONCLUSION: This methodology was effective in comparing unscrewing torque values of the implant-abutment junction even with a limited sample size. It confirmed a previously shown significant difference between two types of screws...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{current study}} aims to establish, {{for the first}} time, a model to {{determine}} the surgical and tissue processing protocols for testing {{the use of a}} synthetic bone graft material to augment the contour and volume of the reduced alveolar ridge. Materials and Methods: β-tricalcium phosphate grafts (Vitoss®), 6 mm width x 3 mm height x 10 mm length, were placed directly onto decorticated cortical bone on the lateral aspect of the left maxillary diastema of New Zealand white rabbits (n= 6). The graft was secured to the underlying bone using an 8 mm x 1. 4 mm titanium <b>screw,</b> <b>covered</b> with a resorbable collagen membrane and the surgical site closed. Tissue blocks were harvested at 3 weeks and 6 weeks. Two non-decalcified sections were scanned using micro tomographic imaging. Four sections were embedded in resin, stained with Pyronin-G and evaluated histologically. Graft vascularisation was examined on one decalcified frozen section labelled with anti-CD 31 monoclonal antibody. Results: All six sites healed well. The micro-CT analysis demonstrated maintenance of the graft height around the central screw. Histological evaluation and anit-CD 31 labelling demonstrated woven bone formation and vascular and cellular infiltration within the grafted region. Quantitative analysis demonstrated increased new bone formation at the second time point (0. 77 ± 0. 42) compared with the first time point (0. 48 ± 0. 48). Conclusion: The study concluded that the model was appropriate for testing the use of a synthetic bone graft material for augmentation of a reduced alveolar ridge.

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess bone {{microarchitecture}} in maxillary sites {{grafted with}} autogenous or xenogenous grafts {{as well as}} to demonstrate the usefulness of microCT in dental implant research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples (n = 12) consisting of titanium fixation <b>screws</b> <b>covered</b> by at least 0. 5 - 1 mm of human bone were obtained from 17 sites grafted with autogenous or xenogenous materials and prepared for microCT scanning and conventional histology. Bone histomorphometric parameters were evaluated in three distinct regions (graft region, transitional region, and native bone region). Three-dimensional (3 D) bone-to-implant contact (BIC) calculation was performed using microCT data. Histological sections were used to calculate two-dimensional (2 D) BIC percentages, which were compared with values obtained from 2 D microCT images. RESULTS: Histomorphometric parameters varied according to the type of graft used, but sites reconstructed with autogenous bone showed higher mean values in general. In autograft samples, indices for parameters such as Tb. Th and Tb. Sp were significantly different when the native bone region was compared to the graft region. While a higher mean 3 D BIC was found in the native bone region for both graft materials, significant BIC differences were absent when graft types were compared. The 2 D BIC percentages obtained from histological and microCT images were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Autografts outperformed the xenogenous material used in this study concerning the histomorphometric parameters assessed. While graft type did not seem to influence 3 D BIC, the native bone region showed the highest BIC percentages when compared to the other regions in both graft groups. In addition, 2 D BIC ratios were similar regardless of graft material or image source (histological sections x microCT slices). Taken together, our findings suggest that microCT is an effective tool for 2 D and 3 D histomorphometric and BIC assessments in dental implant research. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{favorable}} integration {{occurs with}} immediately loaded implants, {{the relationship between}} implant outcome, levels of occlusion, and diet requires optimization. Purpose: Pertubating load on single implant restorations immediately after placement by a hard food diet will increase the strains at the bone-implant interface, increasing the risk for failure. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight implants replaced {{the first and third}} mandibular premolars in 12 pigs, allocated into two groups based on soft- and hard-diet feeding. Cylindrical and tapered implants replaced the first and third premolars, respectively. Each animal received at random four different masticatory loading conditions (group 1 [control]: implant with either a <b>cover</b> <b>screw</b> or a healing abutment, and group 2 [test]: implant with a crown either with or without occlusal contacts). Results: Thirteen implants out of 44 failed in 11 animals (one with a <b>cover</b> <b>screw,</b> one with a healing abutment, three with nonocclusal, and eight with occlusal restorations). The failure rate of restored implants (either in occlusion or not) was significantly higher in the third premolar sites (p =. 007), although diet had no significant effect (p =. 421). Conclusions: While diet had no effect on the failure pattern of immediately loaded single implants, the position and type of load under the masticatory mode were significant. Immediately loaded implants {{both in and out of}} occlusion were less successful than the controls, and this is probably attributed to detrimental strain induced on the bone-implant interface...|$|R
