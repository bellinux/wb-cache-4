Labor <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> hourly units refers to the quantity of percapita labor supplymeasured in hourly units. Finally, labor <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> man-hour units indicatesthe quantity of labor supplied by a group of persons measured in man-hours. While Classical theory mainly treated the quantity of labor supplied inman units, Neo-Classical theory mainly discussed labor <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> hourly unitsor in man-hour units.

5|$|During the siege, {{with the}} <b>supplies</b> <b>in</b> the city running shorter by the day, British troops {{were sent to}} the Boston Harbour to raid farms for supplies. Graves, {{apparently}} acting on intelligence that the Colonials might make attempts on the islands, posted guard boats near Noddle's Island. These were longboats that included detachments of Marines. Sources disagree {{as to whether or not}} any regulars or marines were stationed on Noddle's Island to protect the naval <b>supplies.</b> <b>In</b> response, the Colonials began clearing Noddle's Island and Hog Island of anything useful to the British. Graves on his flagship , taking notice of this, signalled for the guard marines to land on Noddle's island and ordered the armed schooner , under the command of his nephew Lieutenant Thomas Graves, to sail up Chelsea Creek to cut off the colonists' route. This contested action resulted in the loss of two British soldiers and the capture and burning of Diana. This setback prompted Graves to move , which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved manoeuvrability if fired upon from land. He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle's Island; the colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island.|$|E
