In terms of packaging, this means that a successful packaging has to be easy to open, easy to use, resealable and easily disposable. With regard to food, the popularity of packaging that enables a quick and simple preparation (e.g. in the microwave) also keeps rising. Packaging has to refrain from posing any unnecessary obstacle whatsoever, this also includes language design, that is, packaging ought to use an easy languages and simple graphics while not overloading the consumer with information. Additionally to that, packaging has to adapt to socio-economic changes. As urbanization is increasing and <b>single-person</b> <b>household</b> become more and more common, producers have to provide food packaging with individual portions or packaging that, for instance, allows a quick and easy preparation of meals in the microwave.|$|E

In 2000, the number of <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> increased in the fifth census mainly because the average age of first marriage of young people leaving their parents to live independently increased. With the rise of the divorce rate, divorced parents who do not live with their children also contributed to the growth of <b>single-person</b> <b>households.</b> Compared with the fifth census, the increased rate of <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> was higher in 2010. Besides the delay of first marriage and the increase in the divorce rate, the improvement of housing conditions, the population flow, and the expanded proportion of widowed elderly resulting from the prolongation of expected life span are also important factors.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze {{reported}} changes in outdoor mobility, increased/unchanged/decreased, for a sample of older people (> 62 years) in two regions in Sweden, who have transitioned from a two-person to a <b>single-person</b> <b>household</b> during the two years since the study was conducted. The target group (N= 162) consists of all people who had transitioned to a <b>single-person</b> <b>household</b> in a random sample of 2033 people. The predominant results reveal that the stressful life event of transitioning into a <b>single-person</b> <b>household</b> in old age means reduced outdoor mobility for certain sub-groups. All modes of transport are used similarly regardless of reported changes in mobility (except for walking). Our results suggest that society must put more effort into offering good walking conditions, since (a) walking seems to be the most important mode of transport for outdoor mobility and (b) walking is valuated almost as high as car after becoming alone in the household regardless if the population in our study reported unchanged, decreased or increased mobility. Further, illuminating another result, namely that special transport service 3 (STS) came out as especially important for people with increased activity, society also needs to invest in the provision of STS to keep the most vulnerable group of people mobile when other modes of transport are no longer a reality...|$|E

The aim of our study is to find out how gender differences vary from one country to the next, and what causes the differences in each country. We have been especially interested in the weak correlation between a high female employment rate and small {{gender differences in}} the at-risk-of-poverty rate. The empirical part of our study is based on EU-SILC (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions). According to our study, elderly women’s high poverty risk is strongly related to difficulties regarding the income of <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> and the higher ratio of female than male <b>single-person</b> <b>households.</b> In addition, {{gender differences in the}} at-risk-of-poverty rate are affected by gender differences in the household structure. What is of significance here is whether the household is shared with an older or a younger partner and, in particular, whether this partner is of working age. The roles of employment history and pension scheme are most visible in <b>single-person</b> <b>households,</b> since these lack other income. A residence-based or a means-tested minimum pension seems to diminish gender differences considerably only if the pension benefit is high enough to ensure an adequate minimum income also for <b>single-person</b> <b>households,</b> despite employment differences...|$|R

40|$|Department of Creative Design EngineeringThis report {{deals with}} {{developing}} functional furniture for <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> as product convergence. As times change, {{the number of}} <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> is increasing globally, especially in Western Europe, North America, and Northeast Asia. As a result, the size of houses is getting smaller, which means that people do not need huge pieces of furniture. According to previous studies, <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> generally have space limits, and members of these households want to utilize resources efficiently. To reflect this, companies are releasing a lot of furniture and products to target <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> in the market, such as built-in appliances, transformable furniture, and multifunctional products. According to this trend, this project aims to develop suitable functional furniture for <b>single-person</b> <b>households.</b> To suggest suitable functional furniture for <b>single-person</b> <b>households,</b> an analysis was conducted. By doing this, the needs and wishes of those living in <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> could be obtained. As a user study, 20 members of <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> were interviewed, which took approximately 65 minutes. A focus group interview was conducted, which consisted of two sessions. For the first session, participants were asked questions regarding multifunctional products and furniture, and for the second session, they were asked questions regarding the experience they want from their space. As a result, {{it was found that}} they want to utilize their space more efficiently, and they want to rest in their space. Additionally, they want to invite their friends to their houses. Through further research, it was found that they spend their money on maintenance fees. In sum, this project tried to develop a product that could save their maintenance fees by redesigning existing heating appliances. There are two problems with existing heating appliances. Firstly, they are seasonal. This means that they occupy space even though they are not used in certain reasons, such as summer. This creates problems for <b>single-person</b> <b>households,</b> which have space limits. Secondly, some large heating appliances are energy consuming compared to small and local heating appliances, especially in Korea, Japan, and some parts of China. This is not suitable because members of <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> want to utilize their resources, such as money and energy, efficiently. Designing a heating appliance {{so that it can be}} used as a stool allows members of <b>single-person</b> <b>households</b> to utilize their space more efficiently because they can still use the appliance even when they are not using the heating function. Furthermore, they can provide an extra seat for their visitors. A mood light function was added because they said they wanted to rest in their houses. A feedback session was held to get some feedback from the participants regarding this heating stool. They gave various opinions. In particular, they wanted to be able heat their lower body parts with this heating stool. They not only preferred the mood light function, but also many other functions. However, only the mood light function was applied. To make a mock up, the exterior of the stool was chosen from among various sketches and 3 D models. The heating wire was densely inserted into the stool. Finally, the LED mood light was installed based on the need derived from the user study. After the prototyping, a user evaluation was conducted to evaluate the stool in terms of usability and users’ emotions. As a result of the evaluation, the following refinements were made. First, the user needed to be able to control the temperature of the stool. Second, the stool needed to heat up more quickly after the power was turned on. Third, proper feedback regarding the temperature of the stool needed to be given to the user. Through this project, we designed the heating stool as a product convergence, and we hope to contribute to the users in the following ways. First, it will enable the users to utilize their space and energy more efficiently. Second, it will be aesthetically pleasing to the users. Third, it will enable the users to provide a seat to their visitors who drop by. Most importantly, users will be able to utilize the stool as they please to have a positive experience. For example, they can dry their wet clothing quickly or put their feet on the stool to warm up. Additionally, they can use it as a mini table to prevent their food from getting cold. We expect that we could quickly manufacture large quantities of this stool to provide a positive user experience to more users. clos...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{analyzed}} China’s household changes {{based on}} data from China’s past four censuses of 1982, 1990, 2000, and 2010. The data showed that there was a rapid {{increase in the number of}} family households, a continued shrinking in household size, and a trend of simplification in household structure. The proportions of the one-couple household and the two-generation standard nuclear household presented the largest rise and the largest fall, respectively. Although the nuclear household still occupied the largest proportion, the <b>single-person</b> <b>household</b> was becoming more numerous, and the extended-family household still maintained a relatively large proportion. Low fertility, population mobility, aging, and the improvement of housing conditions were among the most significant factors that brought about changes to the family and the household in China. In addition, with the population aging, families with elderly members and empty-nest families progressively increased. While the proportion of the elderly-only family households increased, the share of coresidence of old people living with children declined. In China, the elderly are adopting two major forms of living arrangements: living alone or in multigeneration families. Future family policy should pay more attention to this phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|Policies {{to reduce}} {{household}} energy use usually target the individual customer. This {{is probably one}} explanation to the limited effect of many information policies, because two concepts with different meanings are confused: individual and household. In most contexts, an individual stands for what s/he does, but in the policy context, an individual is taken to represent the entire household. This is not problematic for a <b>single-person</b> <b>household,</b> but, in a multi-person household, activities performed by different household members influence the whole household’s energy use. This paper illuminates problems arising from confusing the concepts of household and individual when developing policies to reduce household energy use. Examples relate to indoor space heating and energy-intensive home-based activities. The results indicate that it is analytically simple to consider individuals at home, {{as well as their}} activities using electrical appliances contributing to heating, but much more complicated to take the whole household into consideration. Our model provides a basis for better-targeted information actions to reduce energy use. Also, empirically based models capturing variations between households with different activity patterns are important for developing policies resulting in reduced energy use for space heating in multi-person households...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{assesses the}} {{affordability}} of a nutritious diet for households in Toronto that {{are supported by}} welfare. Methods: For three hypothetical households, welfare incomes were compared to the monthly costs for food, shelter, and other essential expenditures in Toronto. Results: If households lived in market rental accommodation, average monthly incomes were insufficient to cover expenses for the <b>single-person</b> <b>household</b> and two-parent family, and barely adequate for the single-parent family considered in this study. However, the single-parent family’s actual income fell below expenses for {{six months of the}} year. For households with children, the relative inadequacy of welfare increased as children grew older. Living in rent-geared-to-income housing afforded substantial financial advantage, but the welfare income of single-person households was still insufficient to meet basic needs. Interpretation: These findings indicate discrepancies between welfare incomes and costs of basic needs, which may explain the vulnerability of welfare recipients to food insecuri-ty.
