5|$|In 1957, Pennsylvania law {{required}} that school students read Bible verses to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> The Abington School District added another {{requirement that the}} students read the Lord's Prayer. Several Unitarians in Abington, a suburb of Philadelphia, objected and held a protest against it. One of them, Ellery Schempp, contacted the American Civil Liberties Union about the issue. The ACLU and Schempp's parents believed the school prayer law violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ACLU's lawyers saw Sawyer as the best choice to argue it, given his skill as a litigator and his success in the Deutch case. Sawyer agreed and filed suit in federal district court.|$|E

25|$|Birds with {{relatively}} large eyes {{compared to their}} body mass, such as common redstarts and European robins sing earlier at dawn than birds {{of the same size}} and smaller body mass. However, if birds have the same eye size but different body masses, the larger species sings later than the smaller. This may be because the smaller bird has to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> earlier because of weight loss overnight. Overnight weight loss for small birds is typically 5-10% and may be over 15% on cold winter nights. In one study, robins put on more mass in their dusk feeding when nights were cold.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a pitch {{offering}} some moisture and grass {{on the first}} morning, but predicted {{to be a good}} batting track for days two to three and slowly develop into a spinner's track by day five.

25|$|Breakfast (quraac) is an {{important}} meal for Somalis, who often <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with some style of tea (shahie) or coffee (qaxwa). The tea is often {{in the form of}} haleeb shai (Yemeni milk tea) in the north. The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (canjeero or canjeelo) similar to Ethiopian injera, but smaller and thinner. It might also be eaten with a stew (maraqe) or soup. Qado or lunch is often elaborate. Varieties of bariis (rice), the most popular probably being basmati, usually serve as the main dish alongside goat or lamb. Spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and garden sage are used to aromatize these different rice delicacies. Somalis eat dinner as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, supper is often served after Tarawih prayers; sometimes as late as 11 pm.|$|E

25|$|Dempsey's Den was {{hosted by}} Ian, Zig, Zag and Zuppy. It moved to Network 2 from RTÉ One, and {{broadcasting}} {{for an extra}} hour from 15:00 to 18:00. Network 2 would <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> 14:30 with Bosco a pre-school television show. All children's television moved to Network 2 when it rebranded in 1988. When Ian Dempsey left Dempsey's Den the show was renamed The Den, with a new presenter, Ray D'Arcy. D'Arcy presented the show from 1990 to 1997 when the strand began to expand it schedule into {{the early hours of}} the morning. From 1997 to 2010 The Den ran for 10 hours a day starting at 07:00 to 17:00 followed by a strand which was given various titles and targeted at a teenage audience. When RTÉ rebranded their children's strands in 2010, this effectively axed the country's longest-running children's TV show.|$|E

I built... two cottages,... and walls and made... a large swimming pool which... could be heated to supplement our fickle sunshine. Thus I... dwelt at peace within my habitation". Bill Deakin, one of Churchill's research assistants, recalled his working routine. [...] "He would <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> at eight o'clock in bed, reading. Then he started with his mail. His lunchtime conversation was quite magnificent,...absolutely free for all. After lunch, if he had guests he would take them round the garden. At seven he would bathe and change for dinner. At midnight, when the guests left, then he would start work... to three or four in the morning. The secret was his phenomenal power to concentrate." ...|$|E

500|$|Crocodilians are ectotherms, {{producing}} {{relatively little}} heat internally and relying on external sources {{to raise their}} body temperatures. The sun's heat is the main means of warming for any crocodilian, while immersion in water may either raise its temperature by conduction, or cool the animal in hot weather. The main method for regulating its temperature is behavioural. For example, an alligator in temperate regions may <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> by basking in the sun on land. A bulky animal, it warms up slowly, but at some time {{later in the day}} it moves into the water, still exposing its dorsal surface to the sun. At night it remains submerged, and its temperature slowly falls. The basking period is extended in winter and reduced in summer. For crocodiles in the tropics, avoiding overheating is generally the main problem. They may bask briefly in the morning but then move into the shade, remaining there {{for the rest of the}} day, or submerge themselves in water to keep cool. Gaping with the mouth can provide cooling by evaporation from the mouth lining. By these means, the temperature range of crocodilians is usually maintained between , and mainly stays in the range [...]|$|E

2500|$|Typically, the lector would <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> reading local Spanish {{newspapers}} and some fiction, {{such as a}} romance or adventure novel. Since most residents of Ybor were very interested in politics, the lector would then usually move on to political treatises or writings about the current events in Cuba or Spain or other countries. In the afternoon, the selection was often a literary novel, such as Don Quixote or other works of classic literature. (In Nilo Cruz's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Anna in the Tropics set in Ybor City, Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is read.) [...] Because of the lector system, even cigar workers who could not read were exposed to classic literature and were conversant on political philosophy and current events both in Ybor City and around the world.|$|E
