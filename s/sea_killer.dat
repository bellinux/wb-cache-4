5000|$|The {{killer whale}} or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale {{belonging}} to the oceanic dolphin family, {{of which it is}} the largest member. Killer whales are found in all oceans, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical <b>seas.</b> <b>Killer</b> whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales are apex predators, as there is no animal which preys on them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaHUg0wSzo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaHUg0wSzo ...|$|R

Among humans, sunfish are considered a delicacy {{in some parts of}} the world, including Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In the EU, regulations ban the sale of fish and fishery products derived from the family Molidae. Sunfish are frequently caught in gillnets.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>Killer</b> Mark 2 was {{purchased}} by Iran to arm its Saam class of four frigates, each of which was fitted with a single 5-round launcher. No other sales of the ship-based version were made, but development of <b>Sea</b> <b>Killer</b> Mark 2 into an all-weather anti-ship missile to equip the Italian Navy's helicopters began in 1967, with the helicopter based weapon system being named Marte.|$|E

40|$|New micro-technology {{with links}} to {{satellites}} has revolutionized the collection {{of information on the}} foraging movements of marine animals, but observations of actual foraging are still very rare. Here we describe foraging by killer whales (Orcinus orca (L.)), minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis Burmeister), Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae (Hombron & Jacquinot)) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri Gray), in all cases we believe feeding on fish, in the south-western Ross <b>Sea,</b> Antarctica. <b>Killer</b> whales On 23 January 2004, we observed C ecotype killer whale...|$|R

50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>Killer</b> is an Italian anti-ship missile. It {{has been}} built in several versions, with differing {{guidance}} systems, and suitable for launching from ships or aircraft (in which form the weapons system is known as Marte).|$|E
50|$|In 1967, the Italian company Sistel (Sistemi Elttronici) {{was set up}} as a {{joint venture}} by five Italian companies, {{including}} Contraves Italiana, and the missile division of Contraves Italina was transferred to Sistel, along with the Nettuno and Vulcano missiles in 1969. Nettuno and Vulcano were renamed <b>Sea</b> <b>Killer</b> Mark 1 and 2 respectively for export, and these names gradually replaced the older names.|$|E
50|$|Halibut feed {{on almost}} any fish or animal they can fit into their mouths. Juvenile halibut feed on small {{crustaceans}} and other bottom-dwelling organisms. Animals {{found in their}} stomachs include sand lance, octopus, crab, salmon, hermit crabs, lamprey, sculpin, cod, pollock, herring, and flounder, {{as well as other}} halibut. Halibut live at depths ranging from a few meters to hundreds, and although they {{spend most of their time}} near the bottom, halibut may move up in the water column to feed. In most ecosystems, the halibut is near the top of the marine food chain. In the North Pacific, common predators are <b>sea</b> lions, <b>killer</b> whales, salmon sharks and humans.|$|R
5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the <b>sea</b> for them. <b>Killer</b> whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|R

Whilst en route to South America the ship is holed and eventually what's left of {{the crew and}} passengers find themselves marooned in a mist-enshrouded Sargasso <b>Sea</b> surrounded by <b>killer</b> seaweed, murderous crustaceans and previously marooned descendants of Spanish Conquistadores and pirates.|$|R
50|$|Marte entered {{service with}} the Italian Navy in 1977, with its SH-3 Sea Kings being fitted with two <b>Sea</b> <b>Killer</b> Mark 2 missiles. In 1983, a new version, Marte 2, was announced, with the beam-riding {{guidance}} {{replaced by an}} active radar homing seeker based on that used by the Otomat anti-ship missile. Testing of Marte 2 started in 1984, with the missile entering service with the Italian Navy in 1987.|$|E
40|$|Killer whales (Orcinus orca), both ecotype-B and-C, are {{important}} to the Ross Sea, Antarctica, ecosystem; the type-C referred to hereafter as “Ross <b>Sea</b> <b>killer</b> whale ” (RS killer whale). Herein we review existing data on occurrence patterns and diet of RS killer whales, and present data on numbers observed in the southwestern Ross Sea. These “resident ” whales appear to feed principally on fish, including Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni). On the basis of sea watches on the outer coast of Ross Island beginning in 2002 - 03, sighting frequency and average group size began to decrease beginning 2006 - 07 and thereafter; prevalence also decreased in nearby McMurdo Sound. We discuss trends with respect to environmental change as well as the initiation of industrial fishing for toothfish beginning in 1996 - 97. Consistent with a decrease in the catch-per-unit-effort of scientific fishing for toothfish in McMurdo Sound, we suggest that the change in Ross <b>Sea</b> <b>killer</b> whale numbers is related to a contraction of the toothfish stock, and not to changes in the physical environment. We surmise that in this closely-coupled foodweb, composed of very abundant penguin, seal and whale components, loss of the toothfish option for Ross <b>Sea</b> <b>killer</b> whales would force more direct competition for the smaller-fish prey. Therefore, the killer whales have opted {{to move out of the}} region...|$|E
40|$|A common thought among {{graduate}} students is: “how do established scientists get {{where they are}} today?” In Serendipity: An Ecologist’s Quest to Understand Nature, James Estes offers a personal reflection on research experiences spanning his 50 -year career, beginning as a Ph. D. student in 1970 and concluding with recognition {{as a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences in 2014. Estes chronologically outlines the foundational trophic cascade ecology research that he and colleagues conducted in the Aleutian Islands, examining key relationships among kelp forests, sea otters, <b>sea</b> urchins, and <b>killer</b> whales through anecdotal stories of achievement and challenge. Estes’ 3 main goals in writing this book are to: (1) recount what he had learned from 50 years of research; (2) provide a larger story of how predators and prey interact with one another; and (3) explain how science “really happens. ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there are}} a variety of styles and methods to train dogs, Joel Silverman's style is what he calls a [...] "hybrid" [...] dog {{training}} method. This method combines parts of dog training he learned from training dolphins, <b>sea</b> lions, and <b>killer</b> whales, as well as the training of dogs. Joel also adds a personality based dog training style called What Color is Your Dog?® This method teaches people that there is no [...] "one size fits all" [...] approach to dog training. He believes dogs should be trained based solely on their personalities. There are a huge percentage of dog trainers across the nation that train with this balanced dog training method, but {{there are a}}lso a small percentage of dog trainers that train using positive only training techniques that do not agree with Joel Silverman's style.|$|R
