5|$|In 2014–15, Massimiliano Allegri was {{appointed}} as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, {{making it a}} fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth Coppa Italia for the double. The club also beat Real Madrid in the semi finals of the Champions League 3–2 on aggregate to face Barcelona in the final in Berlin {{for the first time}} since the 2002–03 Champions League. Juventus lost the final to Barcelona 3–1 after an early fourth-minute goal from Ivan Rakitić, followed by an Álvaro Morata equalizer in the 55th minute. Then Barcelona took the lead again with a goal from Luis Suárez in the 70th minute, followed by a final minute goal by Neymar as Juventus were caught out on the counterattack. On 14 December 2015, Juventus won the Serie A Football Club of the Year award for the 2014–15 season, the fourth time in succession. On 25 April 2016, the club won their fifth-straight title (and 32nd overall) <b>since</b> <b>last</b> winning five-straight between 1930–31 and 1934–35, after second place Napoli lost to Roma to give Juventus mathematical certainty of the title with three games to spare; last losing to Sassuolo on 25 October 2015, which left them in 12th place, before taking 73 points of a possible 75. On 21 May, the club then won the Coppa Italia for the 11th time and their second-straight title, becoming the first team in Italy's history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons. On 17 May 2017, Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2–0 win over Lazio (the first team to win three consecutive championships). Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles. On 3 June 2017, Juventus entered a second Champions League Final in three years, but were defeated 1–4 by defending champions Real Madrid — a tragedy in Turin followed.|$|E

25|$|The current {{mainstay}} of manganism treatment is levodopa and chelation with EDTA. Both have limited and at best transient efficacy.

Enhanced excretion of manganese prompted by chelation therapy brings its blood levels down but the symptoms remain largely unchanged, raising questions about efficacy of this form of treatment.|$|E

25|$|Storage space {{allocated}} to a database {{is divided into}} sequentially numbered pages, each 8KB in size. A page is the basic unit of I/O for SQL Server operations. A page is marked with a 96-byte header which stores metadata about the page including the page number, page type, free space on the page and the ID of the object that owns it. Page type defines the data contained in the page: data stored in the database, index, allocation map which holds information about how pages are {{allocated to}} tables and indexes, change map which holds information about the changes made to other pages <b>since</b> <b>last</b> backup or logging, or contain large data types such as image or text. While page is the basic unit of an I/O operation, space is actually managed {{in terms of an}} extent which consists of 8 pages. A database object can either span all 8 pages in an extent ("uniform extent") or share an extent with up to 7 more objects ("mixed extent"). A row in a database table cannot span more than one page, so is limited to 8KB in size. However, if the data exceeds 8KB and the row contains varchar or varbinary data, the data in those columns are moved to a new page (or possibly a sequence of pages, called an allocation unit) and replaced with a pointer to the data.|$|E
