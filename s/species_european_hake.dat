The analyses of two common <b>species,</b> <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> and Norway lobster, collected from an area of Central Adriatic Sea, reported high mercury levels in crustaceans. For Norway lobster total mercury exceeded, in six out of ten analysed pools, the recommended 0. 5. mg/kg wet weight European limit. Moreover the increased amount of Hg concentrations in Norway lobster cooked samples suggests the necessity to review current procedures of Hg control in food, considering also consumption habits of consumers.

PCBs 118, 138, and 153 were the dominant congeners in all the species examined. The concentrations of all PCBs (from not detectable to 15, 427 ng g(- 1) fat weight) exceeded those of all the DDTs (from not detectable to 1, 769 ng g(- 1) fat weight) and HCB (not detectable to 150. 60 ng g(- 1) fat weight) in the samples analyzed. The OCP concentrations were below the maximum residue limits established for fish and aquatic products by the Decreto Ministerale 13 May 2005 in all the samples analyzed; therefore the OCPs in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea species {{are unlikely to be}} a significant health hazard. Conversely, the mean concentrations of PCBs exceeded (greatly in some cases) the current limits (200 ng(- 1) fat weight) set by the European Union for terrestrial foods.

40|$|Three finfish species {{frequently}} {{caught in}} the waters of the Gulf of Manfredonia (Apulia, Italy) were studied in order to know how the flesh composition (proximate, fatty acid, macro- and micro- element contents) could be affected by the season effect. The species we examined were European hake (Merluccius merluccius), chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), which were analysed at the raw state in three catch season and after cooking in two catch season. More precisely, European hake and chub mackerel caught during winter, summer and fall were analysed at the raw state. The composition of the flesh of grilled European hake and chub mackerel was study on fish caught in winter and fall. Horse mackerel of summer and winter catches were analysed both at the raw and grilled state. Furthermore, an overall sensory profile was outlined for each species in two catch season and the relevant spider web diagrams compared. On the whole, two hundred and eighty fish were analysed during this research project in order to obtain a nutritional profile of the three species. One hundred and fifty was the overall number of specimens used to create complete sensory profiles and compare them among the species. The three finfish species proved to be quite interesting for their proximate, fatty acids, macro- and micro-element contents.

My work was aimed at developing and analyzing novel genetic tools for a widely distributed marine fish <b>species,</b> the <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius merluccius), in order to investigate population genetic structure and explore potential applications to traceability scenarios. A total of 395 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) were discovered from a massive collection of Expressed Sequence Tags, obtained by high-throughput sequencing, and validated on 19 geographic samples from Atlantic and Mediterranean. Genome-scan approaches were applied to identify polymorphisms on genes potentially under divergent selection (outlier SNPs), showing higher genetic differentiation among populations respect to the average observed across loci. Comparative analysis on population structure were carried out on putative neutral and outlier loci at wide (Atlantic and Mediterranean samples) and regional (samples within each basin) spatial scales, to disentangle the effects of demographic and adaptive evolutionary forces on <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> populations genetic structure. Results demonstrated the potential of outlier loci to unveil fine scale genetic structure, possibly identifying locally adapted populations, despite the weak signal showed from putative neutral SNPs. The application of outlier SNPs within the framework of fishery resources management was also explored. A minimum panel of SNP markers showing maximum discriminatory power was selected and applied to a traceability scenario aiming at identifying the basin (and hence the stock) of origin, Atlantic or Mediterranean, of individual fish. This case study illustrates how molecular analytical technologies have operational potential in real-world contexts, and more specifically, potential to support fisheries control and enforcement and fish and fish product traceability. ...|$|R

The work presented here, the spatial-temporal data framework, {{is part of a}} larger study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach we present simplifies interdisciplinary model interoperability by separating technical and scientific challenges into a flexible and modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time series to drive the primary production in a marine ecosystem Ecopath with Ecosim food web model of the North-Central Adriatic. In general, the predictive capabilities of the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when applying the new framework by better reflecting observed species population trends and distributions.

40|$|The {{change of}} mesh size or shape as a {{management}} measure to improve selectivity {{as proposed by}} the EU should be assessed using actual fishery data, despite being tested experimentally in previous studies. This work was conducted to evaluate the consequences of inserting either a 40 -mm square-mesh or a 50 -mm diamond-mesh (instead of the traditional 40 -mm diamond-mesh) at codends in commercial Spanish trawlers. Landings in terms of biomass, income and catch composition were compared under commercial conditions. Four métiers were identified in the fishery: <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). No significant differences were observed in biomass or income owing to the new mesh in either <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> or red mullet.

Following this hypothesis, this work focuses on {{the relative importance of}} climate variability on recruitment dynamics of <b>European</b> <b>hake.</b> Interannual variability of recruitment success were analyzed through two types of time series: (i) from monthly and annual length distribution fishery data (1982 - 1999) of Spanish trawling fleet that worked under Spanish or European-Moroccan fishery agreements and (ii) recruits annual abundance from scientific Moroccan surveys (1982 - 2004). The time series were compared with the annual smoothed NAO index to evaluate the type of relationship, persistence and their relative contribution as a variation source of recruitment success. The recruitment to the fishery took place during all year with peaks in spring and summer, but the seasonal component was weak. The time series were in synchrony with NAO index of the previous year and showed strong positive correlation. The variation of recruitment success explained by NAO was 25 to 82 % depending on time series size. The main NAO effect in recruitment dynamics was the widening-contraction of Recruitment Window.

Marine ecosystem shifts have been investigated worldwide and their influence on trophic levels has been studied, from top predator fish populations down to planktonic prey species, but there is little information on the effect of atmosphere-ocean shifts on <b>European</b> <b>hake.</b> This work analyses hake recruitment success (recruits per adult biomass) in relation to environmental changes over the period 1978 - 2006 in order to determine whether the regime shift identified in several abiotic and biotic variables in the North Sea also affected the Northeast Atlantic shelf oceanography. Hake recruitment success as well as parameters such as the sea surface temperature, wind patterns and copepod abundance changed significantly {{at the end of the}} 1980 s, demonstrating an ecological regime shift in the Northeast Atlantic. Despite the low reproductive biomass recorded during the last decades, hake recruitment success has been higher since the change in 1989 / 90. The higher productivity may have sustained the population despite the intense fishing pressure; copepod abundance, warmer water temperatures and moderate eastward transport were found to be beneficial. In conclusion, in 1988 / 89 the Northeast Atlantic environment shifted to a favourable regime for northern hake production. This study supports the hypothesis that the hydro-climatic regime shift that affected the North Sea in the late 1980 s may have influenced a wider region, such as the Northeast Atlantic. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

50|$|Species {{like the}} sardine, Atlantic mackerel, tuna, and the <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> are {{important}} for the Portuguese commercial capture fisheries. Other, widely used species in Portuguese cuisine is the cod, known in Portugal as bacalhau. Salt cod has been produced for at least 500 years, {{since the time of}} the European discoveries. Before refrigeration, there was a need to preserve the codfish; drying and salting are ancient techniques to keep many nutrients and the process makes the codfish tastier.|$|R
40|$|<b>European</b> <b>hake</b> is a main target {{fish for}} the fleet {{operating}} in Atlantic waters, {{although there are}} many biological unknowns that compromise the quality of the current assessment and scientific advice. Growth, natural mortality and reproduction are main biological processes required to develop population dynamic models for assessment purposes. Currently, the parameters defining these processes such Von Bertalanffy asymptotic length, M, L 50 % of maturity or Beverton-Holt steepness are estimated outside the model and set as constants. Population dynamic bayesian models provide a suitable platform to develop solutions to this kind of problems since Bayesian models allow using additional knowledge from similar species {{in the form of the}} priors. Informative priors for biological key parameters have been developed based on available data for Northern hake combined with information from other hake species all over the world. This information is analyzed on the light of ecological theory for life history invariants (LHI) to produce the required priors. LHI figures are relatively constant among similar species. Information from other hakes may help to fill the gap in assessment and management of <b>European</b> <b>hake.</b> The pros and cons of using these informative priors to improve hake assessment are finally discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>European</b> <b>hake</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} economic resources for South European fleets; however, not many studies on its reproductive biology have been carried out. Gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices and condition factor were estimated. Proximate composition was analyzed in gonad, liver and muscle as indicators of female condition status; these results were converted to energy values. Variations of these parameters during the spawning season and through the year were studied. The hake population in Galician waters has a protracted spawning season with peak spawning from February to March. The proximate composition of tissues changes considerably throughout the spawning season although population spawning asynchrony masks temporal patterns. This work corroborates that energy dynamics associated with egg production in <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> are different from those observed in species from temperate waters (5 °– 10 °C), depending more on environmental conditions and food availability during the spawning season than on body energy reserves.

40|$|A fish {{stock is}} a part of a population, commercially {{exploited}} by fishing, characterized by distinctive demographic traits; it has a particular response to exploitation. The aim of this work is to provide a preliminary information on the size structure of <b>European</b> <b>hake</b> Merluccius merluccius (Linnaeus, 1758) (Osteichthyes: Gadiformes) along Eastern and Western coasts of Sardinia. Results showed a clear difference in the length structure of the species in the two areas which could imply the presence of different stocks along Sardinian seas...|$|R
5000|$|Very {{similar to}} M. merluccius (<b>European</b> <b>hake),</b> {{it has an}} average length of 40-60 cm, up {{to a maximum of}} about 80 cm. It lives close to the bottom in muddy areas on the {{continental}} shelf and slope. It usually is to be found at depths of 200 to 850 m, although most commonly below 400 m. Immature specimens feed on small deep-sea fishes and crustaceans, especially Euphausiacea. Mature hake feed mainly on fish, squid, and crustaceans, especially Mysidacea and Euphausiacea.|$|R
