Next, it discusses the history of the <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> Doctrine and sets forth criticisms of the Broad <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> Doctrine.

The majority were moved to Kangiqsualujjuaq, Quebec on the southern end of Ungava Bay. All of the former residents were scattered in the host communities of Nunavik, the homeland of the Inuit of Quebec. They arrived without housing, without income, and without many of their personal effects. Family groups were broken up and the Inuit were separated from their seasonal hunting territory. The host communities were neither advised nor prepared for this influx of people and there were no follow up programs or <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> to help with the resettlement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the general}} election, Blagojevich {{defeated}} Topinka and the Green Party's Rich Whitney, outspending Topinka $27 million to $6 million. He attempted to tie Topinka to former Republican governor George Ryan's corruption. Topinka ran advertisements detailing Blagojevich's federal investigations and non-endorsements by major state Democrats such as Lisa Madigan. A three-term state treasurer, Topinka {{said that she}} had attempted to stop Blagojevich from using money from <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> for general expenditures without approval of the legislature; she said Blagojevich used the funds for projects meant to distract voters from his associates' corruption trials: “This constant giving away of money … a million here, a million there, it raids our already hamstrung government and deadbeat state.” Topinka's spokesman claimed that Blagojevich was the most investigated governor in Illinois history. Topinka lost to Blagojevich by 11%.|$|E
500|$|Civic {{and private}} {{memorials}} {{in response to}} the war took many forms, from monuments, sculpture, buildings, gardens, artistic works or <b>special</b> <b>funds</b> to support particular activities. One of the major distinctions between proposed war memorials involved a distinction between utilitarian and non-utilitarian, symbolic designs; in the US, utilitarian memorials were termed [...] "living memorials". Utilitarian memorials were intended to commemorate the dead by having a practical function and typically include projects such as libraries, small hospitals, cottages for nursing staff, parks, clock towers or bowling greens, although in Britain and Canada, large-scale urban redevelopment projects were also proposed, including rebuilding the centre of Westminster, to form a huge war memorial complex and building a subway under the Detroit River. In contrast non-utilitarian memorials, such as monuments, remembered the dead purely through their symbolism or design. Locations could be also contentious: in France, some arguments as to whether market places, for example, were suitable locations: was it good to choose a central location, or did this cheapen the symbolism? In Britain, in a shift from 19th century practices, memorials were typically placed in busy public places.|$|E

5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> and disbursements.

Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the <b>Special</b> <b>Fund</b> were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|R
