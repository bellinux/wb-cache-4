5|$|Just before 05:00, the battalion's survivors, just 75 {{men of the}} 150 who had set out, {{left the}} battery and headed for their <b>secondary</b> <b>objective,</b> the village of La Plein. The battalion, being too weak, only managed to {{liberate}} around half of the village, and had to await {{the arrival of the}} 1st Commando Brigade later in the day to complete its capture.|$|E
5|$|General Archibald Wavell—the {{commander-in-chief}} of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation Brevity as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell {{intended to}} create advantageous conditions {{from which to}} launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> was to advance toward Tobruk, although {{only as far as}} supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.|$|E
5|$|Landing in Oran on November 8, 1942, the 1st Infantry Division's primary {{objective}} was to confront the German Afrika Korps commanded by Erwin Rommel, while its <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> was to support Bernard Law Montgomery's advance against the Italian forces. Eventually, the 1st Infantry Division broke through the German resistance and scaled Mount Djebel. Oran fell to the Allies on November 10 and Juskalian's unit advanced east into Tunisia, reaching the Algeria–Tunisia border by January 15, 1943. There, the task force met resistance from German and Italian troops.|$|E
40|$|<b>Secondary</b> game <b>objectives,</b> {{optional}} {{challenges that}} players {{can choose to}} pursue or ignore, are a fundamental element of game design. Still, {{little is known about}} how <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> affect player behavior. It is commonly believed that <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> such as coins or collectible items can increase a game’s flexibility, replayability, and depth. In contrast, we present results from analysis of two popular online Flash games showing that <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> can easily harm the retention of many players. We support our findings with data collected from over 27, 000 players through large-scale A/B tests in which we measured play time, progress, and return rate. We show that while <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> can encourage long-term players to extend their playtime, they can also cause many players to play for less time. By modifying <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> so that they reinforce the primary goal of the game instead of distracting from it, we are able to avoid negative consequences and still maintain the retention of long-term players. Our results suggest that <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> that support the primary goal of the game are consistently useful, while <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> that do not support the main goal require extensive testing to avoid negative consequences...|$|R
50|$|Career mode entails {{that the}} player completes primary {{objectives}} to continue/pass {{the level that}} usually consist of protecting an alley, finishing a race first, or by killing a selected target. The target is occasionally a boss battle, which {{there are quite a}} few of in this game, sometimes in large battle arenas that are a bit like a gladiator coliseum. Players may also complete <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> each level, but must complete the primary objectives first to complete the level to earn the completed <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives.</b> There is always <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> usually consisting of 3. When you complete the required primary objectives you may be rewarded with a car or a weapon and if you complete the designated amount of <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> you may obtain a car, weapon, or car skins that consists of various paint schemes.|$|R

5|$|Operation Winter '94 was {{the first}} in a series of {{successful}} advances made by the HV and the HVO in or near the Livanjsko field, an elongated flat-bottomed valley surrounded by hills. The region was formally controlled by the HVO, but the HV contributed a substantial force, including commanding officers. The attacks were primarily designed to draw the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) away from the besieged city of Bihać. The <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> was threatening the single direct supply route between Drvar in the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska and Knin, the capital of the Croatian Serb Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK).|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of the {{operation}} centred on the capture of Drvar, the <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> of the overall offensive. VRS defences around the town held until 14 September, when Gotovina detached a reinforced battalion from the 7th Guards Brigade held in the reserve of OG North and deployed it against Drvar. A renewed push by OGs West and South, combined with a rapid advance by the ARBiH 5th Corps against Bosanski Petrovac threatened to isolate Drvar, and the VRS withdrew from the town.|$|E
5|$|Fed by {{intelligence}} {{from the}} Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building {{up along the}} Pusan Perimeter {{and that they had}} to conduct an offensive soon or else forfeit the battle. In planning its new offensive, the North Korean commanders decided that any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy. Instead, they opted to use frontal attacks to breach the perimeter and collapse it. A <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city. As part of this mission, the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.|$|E
50|$|The game also rewards {{players with}} medals, which require {{progressing}} {{through the main}} campaign, completing <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> in VR training missions, or playing in a unique manner. Once the game has been beaten, additional VR missions are unlocked and the main campaign can also be replayed with the inclusion of <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives,</b> which may be attempted for more medals. Medals can be spent to obtain music tracks and costumes for the player to customize their avatar.|$|R

5|$|Plans for the Normandy {{invasion}} included five assault landings {{from the}} sea, supported by airborne landings on both flanks by British and American airborne divisions. In {{what would be}} its first action, the 6th Airborne Division was chosen {{to land on the}} left flank of the British landing zone. Its primary objective on day one was to capture intact two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne. The division's <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> was the destruction of the Merville gun battery, which could engage ships landing nearby at Sword. To prevent German reinforcements approaching the invasion area from the east, 6th Airborne also had to destroy the bridges crossing the River Dives then dig in around Ranville and hold the left flank of the advance.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Parachute Brigade had a <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> of {{capturing}} Le Muy. It {{was supposed to}} have been assaulted by the 4th Parachute Battalion with the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion providing fire support. With the forces he had at hand, Pritchard was unable to carry out the task. The objective was then given to the 550th Glider Infantry Battalion, which had arrived with the second wave of aircraft. At 02:15 16 August the American battalion moved through the British positions and assaulted the village. The village was defended in strength by the Germans and the attack failed, causing several casualties to the Americans. A second attempt at 11:40 was more successful, killing or wounding 300 Germans and taking 700 prisoners.|$|E
40|$|The {{formulation}} of a procedure for multiobjective control is presented. The procedure {{has been developed}} {{under the assumption that}} there are two subsets of objectives: the primary <b>objective</b> and the <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives.</b> The primary objective is used for defining a scalar-valued optimization problem. The <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> are being improved by a DM through changing a set of parameters in the scalar-valued optimization problem. An illustrative example presented, includes the part of the Iscar River, Bulgaria. Results are very satisfactory when compared with the existing control policy...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{optimization}} {{of multiple}} quantum objectives is often considered a demanding task. However, a special circumstance arises when a primary objective is pitted against {{a set of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives,</b> which we show leads to invariant behavior of the <b>secondary</b> <b>objectives</b> upon the primary one approaching its optimal value. Still, practical relationships among the objectives will generally lead to a threshold, beyond which system re-engineering is required to further increase the primary objective. This finding is of broad significance for reaching high performance in quantum technologiesComment: 5 page...|$|R

5|$|The Germans {{had made}} a big effort to {{reinforce}} Army Group South, and transferred Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, former commander of Army Group Center during Operation Barbarossa and Operation Typhoon. On 5 April 1942, Hitler issued Directive 41, which made the south the main area of operations under Case Blue, the summer campaign, {{at the expense of}} the other fronts. The divisions of Army Group South were brought up to full strength in late April and early May. The strategic objective was illustrated after the victories of Erich von Manstein and the 11th Army in the Crimea. The main objective remained the Caucasus, its oil fields and as a <b>secondary</b> <b>objective,</b> the city of Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Canadian Battalion {{successfully}} {{destroyed the}} bridges at Varaville and Robehomme after {{landing on the}} northern DZ. They then withdrew to defend Le Mesnil, where the brigade headquarters and the field ambulance were located. Meanwhile, by 02:50 only 150 men of the 9th Parachute Battalion had gathered at their assembly area, with virtually no heavy weapons or supplies. Unable to wait any longer, they headed for the Merville Gun Battery. The battalion captured the battery, but without explosives, could only damage two of its four guns. The battle had been costly, and only 85 men were left to head for their <b>secondary</b> <b>objective,</b> the village of Le Plein. The village was defended in strength by the Germans, and the weakened battalion could only dig in and wait the arrival of commandos from the 1st Special Service Brigade later that day. By nightfall the brigade was deployed facing east, along the ridge of high ground from Le Plein in the north to the Bois de Bavent in the south.|$|E
5|$|The British camp in Balaclava {{was on a}} plateau, {{with two}} {{approaches}} – the South and North valleys – and a small hill, known as the Causeway Heights, between them. At Balaclava, the force waited for supplies while the allied ships bombarded the forts surrounding Sevastopol, starting on 17 October. The forts proved to be particularly strong, but some damage was caused and Admiral Kornilov killed. From then on, time and time again, the allied navy would bombard the forts, causing damage, which the Russians would then repair each night. While the allied armies waited to strengthen their positions and increase their resources, Prince Menshikov, commander of the Russian forces, had a desire to provide a victory to the Tsar following his defeat at Alma. He formed a plan to cut the British army off from the harbour at Balaclava, with a <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> of capturing the harbour itself. The Russian forces assembled on 24 October, and attacked at around 7am on the 25th. General Gribbe covered the Russian left flank, with Semiakin, Levoutsky and Scudery on his right: General Ryzhov waited behind them, prepared to support any individual force that came under trouble. The Turkish forces in the first redoubts were quickly overwhelmed and forced to flee.|$|E

5|$|During {{the worst}} European winter in 40 years, the 48th Battalion {{continued}} {{to take its}} turn at the front line, and Leane was mentioned in despatches for the fourth time. In March 1917 his battalion followed up the Germans as they withdrew towards the multi-layered Hindenburg Line of fortifications. In early April 1917, the 12th Brigade was committed to an attack aimed at capturing Bullecourt, with the 48th Battalion given the task of capturing the <b>secondary</b> <b>objective,</b> following behind the 46th Battalion. During the preparations, due to a misunderstanding, Leane was ordered by his brigade commander to send 200 troops into the village of Bullecourt, which Leane believed to be well defended. Characteristically, Leane insisted that if the order must be carried out, it would involve the destruction {{of one of his}} companies, and he would have to choose that commanded by his nephew Allan. The timely arrival of a divisional staff officer clarified the situation, and the order was cancelled. On the morning of 10 April, the battalion was formed up for the attack when the promised tank support failed to arrive on time, and the assault was postponed. During the withdrawal back to the front line, Leane's brother, Major Benjamin Leanenow the second-in-command of the unitwas killed by shell fire, and the battalion suffered another 20 casualties. Leane found Ben's body among the dead, and carried him to a spot where he dug a grave before erecting a cross above it.|$|E
5|$|Gotovina {{said that}} {{although}} Operations Winter'94, Leap1 and Leap2 were planned and executed as three distinct operations, they represent a unified military action. Operation Winter'94 ostensibly failed to achieve its primary objective of relieving pressure on the Bihać pocket by drawing off VRS and ARSK forces to contain the attack; however, that was due to a decision by Chief of VRS General Staff General Ratko Mladić and not to mistakes in planning or execution. Faced with a choice between continuing with the attack on Bihać and blocking the advance from the Livanjsko field, the VRS chose not to move its forces, but Bihać was successfully defended by the 5thCorps of the ARBiH. The <b>secondary</b> <b>objective</b> of Operation Winter'94 was achieved more easily; the Croatian forces approached the Knin-Drvar road and directly threatened the main supply route between the Republika Srpska and the RSK capital. Operations Leap1 and2 built on the achievements of Operation Winter'94, threatened Bosansko Grahovo and created conditions to isolate Knin in Operation Summer'95, which was executed the following month. The advance was strategically significant; Mladić's decision not to react to Operation Winter'94 was a gamble which ultimately cost the Republika Srpska territory extending to Jajce, Mrkonjić Grad and Drvar and brought about {{the destruction of the}} RSK as the advances of the Croatian forces paved the way for Operation Storm.|$|E
5|$|The Jesuits in the Chiquitania had a <b>secondary</b> <b>objective,</b> {{which was}} to secure a more direct route to Asunción than the road then being used via Tucumán and Tarija to link the Chiquitania with the Jesuit {{missions}} in Paraguay. The missionaries in Chiquitos founded their settlements increasingly further east, towards the Paraguay River, while those south of Asunción {{moved closer to the}} Paraguay River by establishing their missions increasingly farther north, thereby avoiding the impassable Chaco region. Although Ñuflo de Chávez had attempted a route through the Chaco on an expedition as early as 1564, subsequent Jesuit explorations from Chiquitos (e.g. in 1690, 1702, 1703, and 1705) were unsuccessful. The Jesuits were stopped by the hostile Payaguá and Guaycuru tribes, and by the impenetrable swamps of Jarayes. In 1715, de Arce, the co-founder of the first mission in San Xavier, set out from Asunción on the Paraguay River with the Flemish priest Fr. Bartolomé Blende. Payaguá warriors killed Blende during the journey, but de Arce struggled on to reach San Rafael de Velasco in the Chiquitania. On the return trip to Asunción he too was killed in Paraguay. Not until 1767, when the missions had encroached sufficiently on the hostile region and just before the Jesuits were expelled from the New World, did Fr. José Sánchez Labrador manage to travel from Belén in Paraguay to Santo Corazón, the easternmost Chiquitos mission.|$|E
