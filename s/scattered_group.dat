2500|$|Tuvalu is a {{volcanic}} archipelago {{and consists of}} three reef islands: Nanumanga, Niutao, Niulakita and six true atolls: Funafuti, Nanumea, Nui, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Vaitupu. Its small, <b>scattered</b> <b>group</b> of atolls have poor soil and a total land area of only about [...] making it the fourth smallest country in the world. The islets that form the atolls are very low lying. Tuvalu's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covers an oceanic area of approximately 900,000km2.|$|E
2500|$|According to Charles Ebel, {{writing in}} the 1960s, [...] "Massalia was not an {{isolated}} Greek city, but had developed an Empire of its own {{along the coast of}} southern Gaul by the fourth century". But the idea of a Massalian [...] "empire" [...] is no longer credible in the light of recent archaeological evidence, which shows that Massalia never even had a very large chora (agricultural territory under its direct control). However further archaeological evidence since shows Massalia had over twelve cities in its network in France, Spain, Monaco and Corsica. Cities Massalia founded that still exist today are Nice, Antibes, Monaco, Le Brusc, Agde, and Aleria. There is evidence of direct rule of at least two of their cities with a flexible system of autonomy as suggested by Emporion and Rhodus' own coin minting. Massalia's empire was {{not the same as the}} monolithic of the ancient world or of the nineteenth century being a <b>scattered</b> <b>group</b> of cities connected by the sea and rivers. The Delian League was also a <b>scattered</b> <b>group</b> of cities spread far across the sea and became known as the Athenian Empire.|$|E
2500|$|Tuvalu {{consists}} of three reef islands and six true atolls. Its small, <b>scattered</b> <b>group</b> of atolls have poor soil and a total land area of only about 26square kilometres (less than 10sq.mi.) making it the fourth smallest country in the world. The islets that form the atolls are very low-lying. [...] Nanumaga, Niutao, Niulakita are reef islands and the six true atolls are Funafuti, Nanumea, Nui, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Vaitupu. Funafuti is the largest atoll of the nine low reef islands and atolls that form the Tuvalu volcanic island chain. It comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 25.1 kilometres (15.6mi) (N–S) by 18.4 kilometres (11.4mi) (W-E), centred on 179°7’E and 8°30’S. On the atolls an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon, with several natural reef channels. A standard definition of an atoll is [...] "an annular reef enclosing a lagoon {{in which there are}} no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus".|$|E

The girl led the party to the door of her father's hut; and there, through the medium of Henry as interpreter, they purchased the two bows for a very small sum of money. They also bought a drink of excellent milk for the whole party of Ninette's mother and then resumed their journey.|$|E
60|$|The {{east side}} of the gulf is fringed with islands, some solitary, others in groups. On the blue {{background}} of the high coast they seem to float on silvery patches of calm water, arid and gray, or dark green and rounded like clumps of evergreen bushes, with the larger ones, a mile or two long, showing the outlines of ridges, ribs of gray rock under the dark mantle of matted leafage. Unknown to trade, to travel, almost to geography, the manner of life they harbor is an unsolved secret. There must be villages--settlements of fishermen at least--on the largest of them, and some communication with the world is probably kept up by native craft. But all that forenoon, as we headed for them, fanned along by the faintest of breezes, I saw no sign of man or canoe in the field of the telescope I kept on pointing at the <b>scattered</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Stevenson and {{his party}} sailed {{accordingly}} on the trading schooner [...] Equator, [...] "on a certain bright June day in 1889," [...] for the Gilbert [...] Islands, a <b>scattered</b> <b>group</b> of atolls in the Western Pacific. Their [...] expectation was to come back into civilisation again {{by way of the}} [...] Carolines, Manila, and the China ports; but instead of this, [...] circumstances which occurred to change the trader's course took them [...] southwards to Samoa, where they arrived in December of the same year. [...] Their second voyage was thus of six months' duration; in the course [...] of it they spent two periods of about six weeks each on land, first [...] at one and then at another of the two island capitals, Butaritari and [...] Apemama. The following letter is the first which reached Stevenson's [...] friends from this part of his voyage, and was written in two [...] instalments, the first from on board the Equator in the lagoon of [...] the island of Apaiang; the second, six weeks later, from the [...] settlement on shore at Apemama, which the king, his friend Temhinoka, [...] allowed him {{and his party}} to occupy during their stay. The account of [...] this stay at Apemama and of the character of the king is far the most [...] interesting and attractive part of the volume called In the South [...] Seas, which was the literary result of these voyages.|$|E
6000|$|These islands, nine in number, form {{a widely}} <b>scattered</b> <b>group,</b> {{situated}} between 37° and 39° 40' N. Lat. and stretching in a south-east and north-west direction over {{a distance of}} nearly 400 miles. The largest of the islands, San Miguel, is about forty miles long, {{and is one of}} the nearest to Europe, being rather under 900 miles from the coast of Portugal, from which it is separated by an ocean 2,500 fathoms deep. The depth between the islands does not seem to be known, but the 1,000 fathom line encloses the whole group pretty closely, while a depth of about 1,800 fathoms is reached within 300 miles in all directions. These great depths render it in the highest degree improbable that the Azores have ever been united with the European continent; while their being wholly volcanic is equally opposed to the view of their having formed part of an extensive Atlantis including Madeira and the Canaries. The only exception to their volcanic structure is the occurrence in one small island only (Santa Maria) of some marine deposits of Upper Miocene age--a fact which proves some alterations of level, and perhaps a greater extension of this island at some former period, but in no way indicates a former union of the islands, or any greater extension of the whole group. It proves, however, that the group is of considerable antiquity, since it must date back to Miocene times; and this fact may be of importance in considering the origin and peculiar features of the fauna and flora. It thus appears that in all physical features the Azores correspond strictly with our physical definition of [...] "oceanic islands," [...] while their great distance {248} from any other land, and the depth of the ocean around them, make them typical examples of the class. We should therefore expect them to be equally typical in their fauna and flora; and this is the case as regards the most important characteristics, although in some points of detail they present exceptional phenomena.|$|E
