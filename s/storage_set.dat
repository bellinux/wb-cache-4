To {{simulate}} the welfare effects and impacts on market fluctuations of this subsidy, we use a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model assuming imperfect expectations.

40|$|We study {{here the}} effects on {{agricultural}} markets volatility of a public subsidy to private <b>storage</b> <b>set</b> up after a CAP reform. This kind of instrument is indeed often advocated in current international debates focusing on the management of agricultural price fluctuations. We use a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model to simulate the welfare and market stabilizing impacts of such a subsidy. The model we use assumes that agents have imperfect expectations, which allows {{a representation of the}} endogenous dimension of agricultural market volatility. Our results corroborate the fact, often advocated, that removing the european price support scheme tends to increase the agricultural markets volatility in the European Union and to decrease this volatility {{in the rest of the}} world. Furthermore, we show that private stockholding behaviours allow a reduction of market volatility, both before and after the political reform. On the other hand, the set up of a public subsidy aimed at stimulating private stockholdings comes to scramble the market signals sent to agricultural producers and therefore has a destabilizing effect...|$|E
40|$|Developers {{accelerating}} applications on FPGAs {{or other}} reconfigurable logic {{have nothing but}} raw memory devices in their standard toolkits. Each project typically includes tedious development of single-use memory management. Software developers expect a programming environment to include automatic memory management. Virtual memory provides the illusion of very large arrays and processor caches reduce access latency without explicit programmer instructions. LEAP scratchpads for reconfigurable logic dynamically allocate and manage multiple, independent, memory arrays in a large backing store. Scratchpad accesses are cached automatically in multiple levels, ranging from shared on-board, RAM-based, set-associative caches to private caches stored in FPGA RAM blocks. In the LEAP framework, scratchpads share the same interface as on-die RAM blocks and are plug-in replacements. Additional libraries support heap management within a <b>storage</b> <b>set.</b> Like software developers, accelerator authors using scratchpads may focus more on core algorithms and less on memory management. Two uses of FPGA scratchpads are analyzed: buffer management in an H. 264 decoder and memory management within a processor microarchitecture timing model.

40|$|The {{forests of}} the {{northern}} United States support a rich mix of floral and faunal communities that provide inestimable benefits to society. Today's forests face a range of biotic and abiotic stressors, {{not the least of}} which may be environmental change. This chapter reviews the compositional traits of presettlement forests and traces the major land use patterns that led to the development of contemporary forested ecosystems. Human impacts have dominated forest development over the last 150 years, so considerable attention is paid to current compositional, structural, and successional traits resulting from these impacts. Estimates of forest carbon <b>storage</b> <b>set</b> the stage for later chapters dealing with environmental factors affecting forest health and resiliency. Resource sustainability is addressed by examining productive capacity (growth) in relation to forest drain components: mortality and removals. Historical information has been gleaned from the literature. Source material for recent trends in timber-land area, species composition, stand structure, and net forest drain is from the successive state-level forest inventories conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) unit. Much of this information was compiled from the FIA's Eastwide Database (Hansen et al., 1992). W. H. McWilliams et al. Northern Forests in Perspectiv...|$|E

This limitation on space would affect couples who has a 0 to 8 years old child that {{need a lot of}} space for their playing activity and learning facility. The solution for this problem is to have a multifunctional furniture that suitable for the playing activity and learning in home with practical fun concept which has three main values in designing such as playable, useful, and enjoyable refering to the character of the child. Inspiration, ideation, and implementation are the three design thinking stages being used in the design research. and from these three steps, the design process extended to understanding, observe, pay, ideate, prototype, story telling, pilot, and business model. This design process was analyzed from the shape, function, psychological, and ergonomics aspect that presented on the design through the three alternatives in the multifunctional furniture. there are three sets of related products In every of each furniture that fullfil the activity and facility needs of the child according to the development.

In particular, we show that any correctable erasure pattern can be solved by easy repair.

40|$|International audienceMojette Transform (MT) based erasure {{correction}} coding possesses extremely efficient encoding/decoding algorithms {{and demonstrate}} promising burst erasure recovery performance. MT codes {{are based on}} discrete geometry and provide redundancy through creating projections. Projections are made of smaller data structures called bins and are generated from a two dimensional convex-shaped data. For exact data recovery, only a subset of projections are needed by the decoder. We realize that the discrete geometry definition of MT erasure codes corresponds to creating structured/deterministic generator matrices. In this study, we show an alternative Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code construction methodology through investigating parity check matrices of MT codes which shows sparseness as the blocklength of the code gets large. In a distributed <b>storage</b> <b>setting,</b> we also quantify the repair bandwidth and show that this novel interpretation {{can be used to}} facilitate bin-level local repairs...|$|R

40|$|Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a {{cryptographic}} primitive that hides {{memory access}} patterns {{as seen by}} untrusted storage. This paper proposes Ring ORAM, the most bandwidth-efficient ORAM scheme for the small client <b>storage</b> <b>setting</b> in both theory and practice. Ring ORAM is the first tree-based ORAM whose bandwidth is in-dependent of the ORAM bucket size, a property that unlocks multiple performance improvements. First, Ring ORAM’s overall bandwidth is 2. 3 × to 4 × better than Path ORAM, the prior-art scheme for small client storage. Second, if memory can perform simple un-trusted computation, Ring ORAM achieves constant on-line bandwidth (∼ 60 × improvement over Path ORAM for practical parameters). As a case study, we show Ring ORAM speeds up program completion time in a secure processor by 1. 5 × relative to Path ORAM. On the the-ory side, Ring ORAM features a tighter and significantly simpler analysis than Path ORAM. ...|$|R
