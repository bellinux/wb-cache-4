40|$|A {{survey of}} the floors of 3001 empty sea cargo {{containers}} in <b>storage</b> was <b>undertaken</b> to estimate the quarantine risk of importing exotic insect pests into Australia, with special reference to pests of timber. More than 7400 live and dead insects were collected from 1174 containers. No live infestations of timber-feeding insects were recorded, but feeding damage detected in one floor indicates a low risk of importing colonies of timber pests in containers. The survey collection of dead insects demonstrates that containers are regularly exposed to economically important quarantinable insects, including timber pests (bostrichids, curculionids, cerambycids, siricids and termites), agricultural pests (including Adoretus sinicus, Adoretus sp., Carpophilus obsoletus and Philaenus spumarius), and nuisance pests (vespids and Solenopsis sp.).

40|$|Accelerator {{science in}} coming years will be {{increasingly}} dependent upon high singlebunch charges and/or small emittances. Under these conditions, single-particle dynamics are not a sufficient description of beam behavior and interactions between the beam particles {{must be taken into}} account. One such interaction is when collisions between the particles that compose a bunch perturb the motion of the colliding particles significantly and frequently enough to impact the beam dynamics. Multiple, small-angle, collisions blow up the emittance of the bunch and are referred to as intrabeam scattering (IBS). Here are documented the theoretical and experimental studies of IBS in <b>storage</b> rings <b>undertaken</b> as part of the CesrTA program. Under the conditions where IBS becomes dominant, other multi-particle effects can also appear. The additional effects we investigate include potential well distortion, coherent current-dependent tune shift, and direct space charge. CesrTA design and analysis is conducted in a normal mode coordinates environment which allows for natural handling of coupling. To that end, we develop a 6 D normal modes decomposition of the linear beam optics. Multi-particle effects are also important for Energy Recovery Linear Accelerators (ERLs). Because the beam circulates for only {{a short period of time}} in an ERL, the beam lifetime imposed by Touschek scattering is not significant. However, the particles scattered out of the bunch can generate a radiation hazard where they collide with the beam pipe. We re-derive Piwinski's original Touschek scattering equation to check its validity when applied to ERL beams, then repurpose the formula to generate a profile of where scattered particles are generated and where they are lost. The results presented here advance our understanding of charge-dependent behavior in the sorts of high charge-density accelerators that will be implemented {{in coming years}}...|$|R

This paper develops a segmented nonlinear accelerated degradation model (SNADM) based on the equivalent method of accumulative damage theory, which tackles the problem that product life is difficult to be determined with degradation rate being {{a function of the}} variable of time. A segmented expression of the function of population accumulative degradation is derived. And combined with nonlinear function, an accelerated degradation function, i. e., SNADM is obtained. The parameters of the SNADM are identified by numerical iteration, and the statistical function of degradation track is extrapolated. The reliability function is determined through the type of random process of the degradation distribution. Then an evaluation of product <b>storage</b> life is <b>undertaken</b> by combining the statistical function of degradation track, reliability function and threshold.

The piles were 45 {{years old at the}} time of inspection. It was determined that several deterioration mechanisms were actively occurring in the above ground section of the piles. These included reinforcement corrosion due to chloride ions and carbonation, alkali-silica reaction, sulphate attack and salt hydration distress. Extensive repairs to the piles had been performed since 1972. The types of repairs included shotcrete patches and concrete collars. Cementitious waterproofing slurries and organic coatings had been used on selected piles for protection. Variations in shotcrete materials had also been explored. The project provided a valuable opportunity to observe the actual performance of different repair strategies and materials over an extended period in an aggressive environment. Shotcrete repairs were considered to have performed significantly better than the other solutions, particularly where removal of contaminated but undamaged concrete was adequate. Further repairs were recommended where deterioration was evident or where prior repairs were showing indications of failure, in order to extend the life of the shed piles for a further 30 years.

40|$|AbstractThere exists {{within the}} {{electricity}} generation sub-sector {{the potential for}} substantial GHG reductions {{through the application of}} CO 2 capture and storage technologies. Many assessments of the cost and performance of power plants with CCS (Carbon Capture and <b>Storage)</b> have been <b>undertaken</b> but these studies almost always omit considering operability: the ability of a process to operate satisfactorily under conditions different than the nominal design conditions. Electricity systems rely upon generators {{with a high degree of}} operability in order to meet variations in power demand, ambient conditions, fuel supply, etc. and the need for operability is expected to increase in the future. The operability of CCS technologies could have a major impact on the extent to which CCS is used in the years to come and it could also affect the choice of the optimum CO 2 capture technology. The attention given to the operability of power plants with CCS is in sharp contrast to its potential significance; only a handful of the research groups contributing to the sizeable CCS literature are explicitly investigating the operability of these technologies. This paper seeks to correct this oversight and proposes the scope of a comprehensive comprehensive assessment of the leading CO 2 capture schemes—pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-combustion— with respect to operability. In the final analysis, a layered approach is suggested with four major study areas: •flexibility•controllability•start-up/shutdown characteristics•assessment of trade-offs between operability and costWhile the proposed undertaking is ambitious, it is believed that by building upon the existing process modelling and simulation expertise that exists with the CCS community, the work could be completed within a reasonable amount of time...|$|R

Fundamental research can reveal the underlying principles controlling hydrogen uptake and release by storage materials, and also aid in characterizing and designing novel storage materials. New ideas for hydrogen storage materials come from exploiting the properties of hydrophobic hydration, which refers to water s ability to stabilize, by its mode of association, specific structures under specific conditions. Although hydrogen was always considered too small to support the formation of solid clathrate hydrate structures, exciting new experiments show that water traps hydrogen molecules at conditions of low temperatures and moderate pressures. Hydrogen release is accomplished by simple warming. While these experiments lend credibility {{to the idea that}} water could form an environmentally attractive alternative storage compound for hydrogen fuel, which would advance our nation s goals of attaining a hydrogen-based economy, much work is yet required to understand and realize the full potential of clathrate hydrates for hydrogen <b>storage.</b> Here we <b>undertake</b> theoretical studies of hydrogen in water to establish a firm foundation for predictive work on clathrate hydrate H{sub 2 } storage capabilities.

In the process we validate classical force field models of hydrogen in water and discover new features of hydrophobic hydration that impact problems in both energy technology and biology.

Technical support and advice to the project was provided by the Tropical Products Institute during three consultancy visits. The project began with a study of the minor wheat crop which provided the opportunity for field staff to gain essential experience and to develop a methodology for assessing storage losses. The main study of maize losses was undertaken between July 1979 and June 1980 and a limited study of losses occurring during the storage of paddy was conducted between November 1979 and June 1980. The published methodology for post-harvest loss assessment had to be adapted to the difficult field situation in the hills of Nepal and a simple method of estimating weight loss from observations of the percentage of damaged grains in a sample was used in the assessment of maize losses. The method, when compared with the preferred bulk density method of estimating weight losses, proved to be adequate. Modified bulk density methods were used to determine losses in wheat and paddy. The results of the survey demonstrated that farm level storage losses were lower (approximately 5 %) than previously reported (10 - 30 %) and in consequence tentative proposals for a programme to reduce losses by introducing new storage structures and pesticides, even if practical to implement, were shown to be unjustifiable...|$|R

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that an integrated ammonia-PEM fuel cell could unlock {{the potential of}} ammonia {{to act as a}} high capacity chemical hydrogen storage vector and enable renewable energy to be delivered eectively to road transport applications. Catalysts are developed for low temperature ammonia decomposition with activity from 450 K (ruthenium and cesium on graphitised carbon nanotubes). Results strongly suggest that the cesium is present on the surface and close proximity to ruthenium nanoparticles and that it produces activity in ruthenium by donation of electrons. The activity of sustainable cobalt for ammonia decomposition is shown to be a function of particle size and is more active on microporous carbon supports compared to mesoporous ones. Unlike ruthenium, activity for cobalt was not inuenced by the degree of surface graphitic nature and cobalt supported on microporous carbon approached the activity of ruthenium on the same support. In accordance with the sustainable objectives of this thesis, a case-study on the sustainability of ammonia as a sustainable hydrogen <b>storage</b> vector was <b>undertaken.</b> In this scheme, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity by electrolysis is con- verted to ammonia by the Haber-Bosch process and then converted back to deliver pure hydrogen at the point of use.

To assess the feasibility of the ammonia-PEM fuel cell, a conceptual design was un- dertaken to quantify the palladium membrane size and catalyst quantity required for a typical road transport vehicle.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifteen sperm whales (97 female, 15 male, 3 unknown gender) were {{involved}} in three mass stranding events {{during the month of}} February 1998 along the west and north-west coastlines of Tasmania, Australia. Sixty six of these whales stranded at Ocean Beach, Strahan, 35 at Greens Beach, Marrawah and 11 at Black River Beach, Stanley. The remaining three whales stranded singly along the coastline. Three mass strandings of this species in such close temporal proximity have not been reported in this area before, {{and this is the first}} time that samples have been systematically collected from complete or near-complete groups of sperm whales from Tasmanian waters. The broad aim of this project was to examine the life history of complete or near complete female groups of sperm whales in an effort to contribute to the paucity of knowledge on two key areas of research identified for sperm whales in the Australian Government's Action Plan on Australian Cetaceans: the basic biology of this species and pollutant impacts on this species. This study is made up of three components: (i) by developing modifications to current methods of age determination, an assessment of the demographics and growth of the female component of these groups was undertaken; (ii) by collecting stomach contents and blubber samples, an investigation into energy acquisition and <b>storage</b> was <b>undertaken</b> and (iii) concentrations of organochlorines were determined from blubber samples and concentrations and interpreted in light of ecological factors such as diet and demography. The three stranding groups were composed primarily of adult females. Total lengths of all animals ranged from 417 - 1200 cm and ages ranged from 0. 75 - 64 years. Female sperm whales, unlike many other mammals, demonstrate high, relatively stable survival throughout their entire life span. Overall, growth is prolonged in female sperm whales, not reaching asymptotic length until around 20 years. The longevity, low fecundity, slow growth, delayed sexual maturation and high input of resources into young over a protracted period define sperm whales as extreme K-selected animals. Survival in mature female sperm whales in this study was higher than those observed in mature females from Japanese waters and similar to that observed in female sperm whales deriven from Western Australian whaling operations. This suggests survival in female sperm whales from Australian waters may have undertaken little change post whaling. However, there appear to have been some changes in the age structure of female sperm whale groups and additionally increases in the total lengths of individuals, which indicate some postwhaling demographic changes. The diet of southern Australian sperm whales in late summer was dominated by oceanic cephalopods. Cephalopod beaks from stomach contents represented 48 species from 14 families of Teuthids, two species from two families of Octopods and the single Vampyromorph species. Subtropical and muscular species of cephalopods dominated the diet of southern Australian sperm whales, but a high level of both inter- and intra-group variability in the diet was apparent. Common cephalopod prey species were similar to that of sperm whales elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere and included members of the Histioteuthidae, Onychoteuthidae, Ommastrephidae, Architeuthidae, Cranchiidae and Pholidoteuthidae families. While smaller species ( 1, 000 gm) were clearly important to sperm whales (comprising 78. 6...|$|R
40|$|Report {{prepared}} for IGIDR – ERS/ USDA Project: Indian Agricultural Markets and Policy, January 2006. The {{objective of this}} study is to analyze some of the recent reforms proposed in the operation of government buffer stocks and provision of price support to wheat and rice farmers in India. Based on the Indian grain market scenario and the recent policy initiatives this study estimates the potential impacts of reforms in India’s farm support policies on producers, consumers and traders in various regions of the country. The results are based on a multi commodity partial equilibrium simulation model of regional supplies and demands of grains by different economic classes. In particular, the study focuses on the decentralization of procurement of grains by the individual states where the latter are free to fix their minimum support prices for wheat and rice and the purchase of grain for the public distribution system (PDS) is from the open market. The results show that a switch to decentralized PDS and procurement and removal of rice levy leads to a fall in both procurement and buffer stocks of grains. We also consider implications of reducing minimum support prices (MSP) from their current exorbitant levels. Since in a decentralized scenario the PDS requirements are purchased from the open market, costs of operating the PDS tend to go up. But, when the states reduce the MSP from its current high level, these costs go down. This, in fact, results in a fall in market prices leading to higher consumption by all income classes with consequent rise in consumer welfare. Adding across all agents, total surplus from rice and wheat policy reform is positive in net consuming states and negative in major surplus states. But at the aggregate national level, there are net gains. Price support to farmers could also be offered to farmers in the form of cash subsidy or ‘deficiency payment’. That is, farmers are compensated through deficiency payments when market prices fall below an insured price floor. This results in great cost savings to the government (as it no longer needs to <b>undertake</b> <b>storage</b> and physical handling of grains) while at same time benefiting consumers of all economic classes...|$|R
40|$|The {{greenhouse}} gas effect {{and the global}} warning phenomenon are largely discussed by scientific community and government and, in the next years, a number of actions focused on {{the reduction of the}} {{greenhouse gas}}es emissions have to be finalised. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved in several ways but probably, at the short/mid-term, the only way with an acceptable cost/benefit ratio is to avoid the CO 2 emission from the fossil fuel power plant and, in parallel, strongly develop the renewable energies. A really interesting option for the reduction of CO 2 emissions is CCS (CO 2 capture and storage). This technique consists of capturing CO 2 from power and industrial activities and storing it in deep geological reservoirs having different geological traps. The potential effectiveness of CCS is the reduction of 15 % of the emission by 2050. A critical component of long term geological sequestration of anthropogenic CO 2 will be our ability to adequately monitor a chosen site to ensure public and environmental safety. Near surface monitoring is particularly important, as it is possible to conduct sensitive and direct measurements at the boundary between the subsurface and the biosphere (i. e. surface water or atmosphere). In this work different aspects of direct gas measurements for the control and monitoring of CO 2 <b>storage</b> sites were <b>undertaken.</b> In particular: i. the study of some fault systems at the Latera caldera allowed {{a better understanding of the}} gas migration mechanisms; ii. soil gas surveys carried out at “Concessione mineraria Monte Sinni” and at Kaniow allowed baseline characterization and the test of this approach for the discontinuous post injection monitoring; iii. the design and development of an innovative and low cost monitoring system that can make possible the use of direct geochemical methods of measurement where the currently required costs make them unsuitable. The obtained results seem to confirm the potent of the geochemical approach, both in terms of sensitivity and cost/benefit ratio. In fact the discontinuous monitoring applied at Kaniow defined micro-leaks close to the injection site and the monitoring system tested at Panarea Island successfully worked highlighting a good sensitivity and repeatability of the measures. Finally, in the framework of the CCS activities, it is important to consider the importance of the “public acceptance” of this process. In this regards, although a number of well-tested (i. e. in the oil exploration), indirect geophysical monitoring techniques can be used, the monitoring of the storage site by direct geochemical measurements in the near-surface environment can provide a clearer observation phenomenon and can be easier understood and accepted by local stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} magnetically suspended composite flywheel {{energy storage}} (FES) system is operating at the University of Maryland. This system, designed for spacecraft applications, incorporates recent advances in the technologies of composite materials, magnetic suspension, and permanent magnet brushless motor/generator. The current system {{is referred to as}} an Open Core Composite Flywheel (OCCF) energy storage system. This paper will present design improvements for enhanced and robust performance. Initially, when the OCCF prototype was spun above its first critical frequency of 4, 500 RPM, the rotor movement would exceed the space available in the magnetic suspension gap and touchdown on the backup mechanical bearings would occur. On some occasions it was observed that, after touchdown, the rotor was unable to re-suspend as the speed decreased. Additionally, it was observed that the rotor would exhibit unstable oscillations when the control system was initially turned on. Our analysis suggested that the following problems existed: (1) The linear operating range of the magnetic bearings was limited due to electrical and magnetic saturation; (2) The inductance of the magnetic bearings was affecting the transient response of the system; (3) The flywheel was confined to a small movement because mechanical components could not be held to a tight tolerance; and (4) The location of the touchdown bearing magnifies the motion at the pole faces of the magnetic bearings when the linear range is crucial. In order to correct these problems an improved design of the flywheel energy <b>storage</b> system was <b>undertaken.</b> The magnetic bearings were re-designed to achieve a large linear operating range and to withstand load disturbances of at least 1 g. The external position transducers were replaced by a unique design which were resistant to magnetic field noise and allowed cancellation of the radial growth of the flywheel at high speeds. A central rod was utilized to ensure the concentricity of the magnetic bearings, the motor/generator, and the mechanical touchdown bearings. In addition, the mechanical touchdown bearings were placed at two ends of the magnetic bearing stack to restrict the motion at pole faces. A composite flywheel was made using a multi-ring interference assembled design for a high specific energy density. To achieve a higher speed and better efficiency, a permanent magnet DC brushless motor was specially designed and fabricated. A vacuum enclosure was constructed to eliminate windage losses for testing at high speeds. With the new improvements the OCCF system was tested to 20, 000 RPM with a total stored energy of 15. 9 WH and an angular momentum of 54. 8 N-m-s (40. 4 lb-ft-s). Motor current limitation, caused by power loss in the magnetic bearings, was identified as causing the limit in upper operating speed...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{of product}} is an {{important}} aspect in many commercial organizations where storage and shipment practices are required. Temperature {{is one of the}} main parameters that influence quality and temperature treatments of agricultural products therefore require special attention. The temperature variation in a meat chiller has a significant effect on tenderness, color and microbial status of the meat, therefore thermal mapping during the chilling process and during chilled shipment to overseas markets is vital. The literature indicates that deviations of only a few degrees can lead to significant product deterioration. There are several existing methods for thermal mapping: these includes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Methods (FEM) for examination of the environmental variables in the chiller. These methodologies can work effectively in non real-time. However these methods are quite complex and need high computational overhead when it comes to hard real-time analysis within the context of the process dynamics. The focus of this research work is to develop a method and system towards building an object-centric environment monitoring using collaborative efforts of both wireless sensor networks and artificial neural networks for spatial thermal mapping. Thermal tracking of an object placed anywhere within a predefined space {{is one of the main}} objectives here. Sensing data is gathered from restricted sensing points and used for training the Neural Network on the spatial distribution of the temperature at a given time. The solution is based on the development of a generic module that could be used as a basic building block for larger spaces. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) perform dynamic learning using the data it collects from the various sensing points within the specific subspace module. The ANN could then be used to facilitate mapping of any other point in the related sub-space. The distribution of the sensors (nodes placement strategy for better coverage) is used as a parameter for evaluating the ability to predict the temperature at any point within the space. This research work exploits the neuro Wireless Sensor Network (nWSN) architecture in steady-state and transient environments. A conceptual model has been designed and built in a simulation environment and also experiments conducted using a test-bed. A Shepard’s algorithm with modified Euclidian distance is used for comparison with an adaptive neural network solution. An algorithm is developed to divide the overall space into subspaces covered by clusters of neighbouring sensing nodes to identify the thermal profiles. Using this approach, a buffering and Query based nWSN Data Processing (QnDP) algorithm is proposed to fulfil the data synchronization. A case study on the meat plants cool <b>storage</b> has been <b>undertaken</b> to demonstrate the best layout and location identification of the sensing nodes that can be attached to the carcasses to record thermal behavior. This research work assessed the viability of using nWSN architecture. It found that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) at the infrastructural nodes has a variation of less than 0. 5 C. The resulting MAE is effective when nWSN can be capable of generating similar applications of predictions...|$|R
40|$|Glass {{ceramics}} {{are one of}} {{the preferred}} choices in the case for preservation of tooth structure. They also exhibit excellent aesthetic outcomes, and life-like translucency. Moreover, glass ceramics can provide better adhesion to the underlying tooth preparation, compared with metal-bonded ceramics and oxide ceramics. This is achieved by application of HF etching and silanization, followed by bonding with resin cement. The resin cement is applied as the means to provide a seal, adhesion and ‘filler’ in the small space that exists between a restoration and prepared tooth. These unique properties have given rise to expanded restoration designs for glass ceramics in comparison to other ceramics, e. g., veneers, inlays or onlays. Hence, durable and stable adhesion is strongly required for the long-term success of these restorations. The aim of this project was to evaluate the durability of adhesion between CAD/CAM ceramics and resin cements as well as the effect of different factors on long-term ceramic adhesion. In the first experiment, two bonding models were compared and contrasted using a microtensile bond strength test. Two surface treatments and two resin cements were also examined. Ceramic to ceramic, as a bonding model, was found to be better than a ceramic to resin composite model. Surface treatments and resin cements had a significant effect on the microtensile bond strength. The second experiment aimed to evaluate the stability of long-term adhesion using six resin luting cements when bonded to three different CAD/CAM ceramics in water over 12 months. According to the outcomes of this study, VITA Suprinity® and VITA Enamic® demonstrated better long-term adhesion compared to IPS e. max® CAD. Furthermore, the microtensile bond strengths of ceramic and resin cement decreased up to 3 months but thereafter became relatively stable. Different resin cements showed different bonding behaviour during prolonged storage time. The third study examined the effect of two etching times on long-term ceramic adhesion and the effect of six resin luting cements on durability of adhesion. This study indicated that prolonged etching time could increase the microtensile bond strength of glass ceramics in the short-term, however, different etching times did not have an obvious influence on the long-term adhesion. In the fourth experiment, an evaluation of sorption, solubility and dimensional change of six resin luting cements immersed in various <b>storage</b> media was <b>undertaken.</b> Significant differences were observed in the sorption, solubility and dimensional change of the cements when exposed to the different storage media over time. The objective of the last experiment was to evaluate the effect of immersion time and media on fracture toughness of six resin cements. It was concluded that fracture toughness varied among the cements and the value decreased over time. Furthermore, the three storage media evaluated in this study seemed to not have had a significant effect on the fracture toughness. It was concluded that, in general, lower sorption, solubility and dimensional change in resin cements seems to produce a higher fracture toughness and microtensile bond strength to glass ceramics. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Geological {{storage of}} CO 2 in {{subsurface}} geological structures can mitigate global warming. A comprehensive safety and monitoring system for CO 2 <b>storage</b> has been <b>undertaken</b> for the Prinos hydrocarbon field, offshore northern Greece; {{a system which}} can prevent any possible leakage of CO 2. This paper presents various monitoring strategies of CO 2 subsurface movement in the Prinos reservoir, {{the results of a}} simulation of a CO 2 leak through a well, an environmental risk assessment study related to the potential leakage of CO 2 from the seafloor and an overall economic insight of the system. The results of the simulation of the CO 2 leak have shown that CO 2 reaches the seabed in the form of gas approximately 13. 7 years, from the beginning of injection. From that point onwards the amount of CO 2 reaching the seabed increases until it reaches a peak at around 32. 9 years. During the injection period, the CO 2 plume develops only within the reservoir. During the post-injection period, the CO 2 reaches the seabed and develops side branches. These correspond to preferential lateral flow pathways of the CO 2 and are more extensive for the dissolved CO 2 than for the saturated CO 2 gas. For the environmental risk assessment, we set up a model, using ArcGIS software, based on the use of data regarding the speeds of the winds and currents encountered in the region. We also made assumptions related to the flow rate of CO 2. Results show that after a period of 10 days from the start of CO 2 leakage the CO 2 has reached halfway to the continental shores where the "Natura" protected areas are located. CO 2 leakage modelling results show CO 2 to be initially flowing along a preferential flow direction, which is towards the NE. However, 5 days after the start of leakage of CO 2, the CO 2 is also flowing towards the ENE. The consequences of a potential CO 2 leak are considered spatially limited and the ecosystem is itself capable of recovering. We have tried to determine the costs necessary for the creation of such an integrated CO 2 monitoring program both during the CO 2 injection phase as well as during permanent storage. The most prevalent solution consists of purchasing both seismic equipment and Echosounder systems as well as privileging a monitoring system, which uses selected boreholes. The necessary period required for monitoring the study area is at least 20 {{years after the end of}} the CO 2 storage period at Prinos. To the overall monitoring time, we should also add a further 20 years that are required for the injection phase as well as 12 years for the storage phase. The operating costs for monitoring the CO 2 amount to 0, 38 $/ton CO 2 and the total cost for EOR at Prinos amounts to 0, 45 $/ton CO 2...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{issue of}} this thesis {{concerns}} {{one of the fundamental}} problems of the future of our society: How to meet the energy requirements for a large and growing world population while preserving our environment? This question is important for the world and the answers are complex and interwoven. Conventional energy sources, fossil and fissile, are polluting in the present and in the future: they erode the environment and their resources are limited. Renewable energy (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal) constitutes a minimum of pollution in the different energy systems. The technologies for using renewable energy are well known though further development and progress are made. This development also requires behavioural change, adaptation, and above all political will. The transition from an economy based on fossil energy to an economy based on renewable energy appears necessary {{for the protection of the}} environment. The cost of renewable energy is often represented as an obstacle but remains competitive in the long run. The development and availability of renewable energy, which varies because of its spatial and temporal distribution, require an adaptation of lifestyle, habits, habitat design (passive bioclimatic houses), urban planning and transportation. The focus of this thesis was to apply renewable energy in an area with hot summers and cold winter, a climate like that in the northwest of Algeria. In order to provide improved comfort in the buildings and also economic development in this area, the energy demand for heating and cooling was analyzed in the ancient city of Tlemcen. To supply domestic hot water and space heating, water must be simultaneously available at two different temperature levels. Cold water temperature, close to that of the atmosphere, and hot water between 50 and 60 °C. An interesting feature of the preparation of hot water is the small variation of requirements during the year, unlike that to heating. The preparation of hot water is one of the preferred applications of solar energy in the building for several reasons. For this reason an experimental study of the thermal behaviour of a domestic hot water <b>storage</b> tank was <b>undertaken.</b> The phenomena that affect the thermal behaviour of tank especially the coupling between the solar collector and storage tank was studied. This study included concentrating solar collector in which optical fibers were used to transport the energy to the storage tank. Another technology was introduced and developed for the heating and cooling of buildings in the desert involving an existing ancient irrigation system called Fouggara. The novel idea is to use the Fouggara as an air conditioner by pumping ambient air through this underground system. Then air at a temperature of about 21 °C would be supplied to the building for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. This study shows the feasibility of using this ancient irrigation system of Fouggara and contributes to reducing and eliminating the energy demand for heating and cooling buildings in the Sahara desert.

40|$|AbstractThe China-UK Near Zero Emissions Coal (NZEC) Initiative {{examined}} {{options for}} carbon (CO 2) capture, transport and geological storage in China. It was developed under the 2005 EU-China NZEC Agreement {{which aims to}} demonstrate CCS in China and the EU. Collaborative research activities were conducted jointly by Chinese and UK experts from 30 organisations. China’s energy demand {{is expected to continue}} growing significantly; however the share of coal is projected to decrease to around 50 % by 2050. For the power generation and energy intensive industrial sectors, all of which remain heavily dependent on coal, CCS is the only option that can ensure a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions. A range of CO 2 capture technologies in coal-fired power generation have been examined. The more promising, near term options are post-combustion capture using Monoethanolamine in a state of the art pulverised coal power plant and pre-combustion capture in an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle unit. The cost of electricity generation with capture would be 463 and 413 RMB per MWh respectively for these options. Less mature capture technology options offer some potential to lower the overall cost, but this is within the range of uncertainties. <b>Storage</b> assessments were <b>undertaken</b> in two basins in North East China. These have potential to make use of CO 2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) although the reservoirs are geologically complex and well integrity may be a significant risk. While CO 2 EOR would provide the opportunity for gaining initial experience with CO 2 injection and storage, the capacity available for EOR in these regions appears insufficient for large scale CCS. It would therefore be necessary to assess and ultimately use saline aquifers for storage. An extensive saline aquifer formation has been identified in the Songliao Basin through the project. The average cost of electricity generation taking account of capture, transport and storage costs (assuming a storage site 200  km from the power plant) would be 470 RMB per MWh for the most mature capture options, an increase of around 200 RMB per MWh compared with a Pulverised Coal reference plant without CCS. This is equivalent to a cost of avoided emissions of about 280 RMB (US $ 50. 0) per tonne of CO 2. There are several challenges {{that need to be addressed}} for CCS in China. These include the extra cost and energy penalty of CCS, the novelty of the technology, the lack of regulations governing the storage of CO 2 underground and the availability of the necessary equipment for deployment of CCS in China. The China-UK NZEC Initiative has shown that CCS could provide a key, low carbon option for coal-based industry in China, particularly for power generation, which would enable the continued use of coal with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. An Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the European Commission and Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology for Phase II of the China-EU NZEC Agreement in November 2009. Phase II will involve the selection of a demonstration project and the completion of a feasibility study. Phase III will involve the construction and operation of a CCS demonstration project in China...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} growing {{increase}} in research in the field of vibrational energy harvesting - devices which convert ambient vibrational energy into electrical energy. The major application area for such devices is as power sources for wireless sensors, thereby replacing currently used batteries which suffer from a finite lifespan and pose environmental issues during disposal. The vast majority of designs are cantilever beams comprising of piezoelectric layers having coverage identical to the substrate layer. It is evident from the literature that rudimentary work has been performed on design optimisation, with reliable and extensive parametric studies on geometry, especially piezoelectric layer coverage, being overlooked. As a result of this, outcomes from previous research are yet to be seen in designs for practical applications. In this work a versatile linear model is developed which can accurately predict the performance of cantilever piezoelectric energy harvesters. An integral part of the model uses a transfer matrix method to accommodate the difference in structural dynamics of both uniform and non-uniform structures with model validation provided through extensive experimental work. The linear model developed is used to carry out parametric studies on the geometry of three distinct energy harvester cases thereby providing comprehensive knowledge on key variables and geometrical changes which can improve performance. In one of the cases examined, an improvement in performance of over 100 % is predicted by solely altering piezoelectric layer coverage. However, the load resistance, i. e. electrical condition, has a significant effect on the trends in generated power which led to work directed toward harvester optimisation in a more realistic electrical scenario. Investigation on harvester geometry whilst utilising an electrical scenario comprising of an energy <b>storage</b> medium is <b>undertaken</b> in this work. The developed model ensures the effects of electro-mechanical coupling remain and provides a solid basis from which users can readily apply model extensions through inclusion of further electrical components to resemble practical circuitry. Theoretically, for all examined case studies, improvements in performance were realised through alterations to piezoelectric layer dimensions with the most notable result indicating an improvement of over 200 % during optimisation of piezoelectric layer length. In conjunction to theoretical findings, outcomes of extensive experimental work are provided in order to highlight the accuracy and reliability of the presented theoretical models in both electrical scenarios. Variation in mechanical damping magnitude plays a pivotal role throughout experimental testing and is one key factor in explaining why devices comprising of shorter piezoelectric layers have high performance. A methodology behind unbiased design comparisons is also provided in this work, and involves comparing devices with identical fundamental frequencies. The reasoning behind this approach is to allow for each device to perform as efficiently as possible in the same excitation scenario. Systematic alterations to multiple geometric parameters are used to achieve this. Geometric parameters such as the substrate thickness are observed to provide adequate frequency control. Using this approach, performance improvements from adjustments to piezoelectric coverage still remain. The occurrence of non-linearity in piezoelectric materials is a widely known phenomena and so lastly, a more robust model is provided which incorporates material and geometric non-linearity. This model is useful in determining dynamical responses of uniform and non-uniform piezoelectric energy harvesters when subjected to moderate-to-high acceleration levels. A thorough validation of the theoretical model is achieved using extensive experimental data obtained from a range of samples. For the harvester composition tested in this work, the occurrence of mild non-linearity at base acceleration levels as low as 1 meter per second squared is witnessed with softening behaviour causing the resonant frequency to decrease with base acceleration. In order to avoid reduced efficiency in the final application, the prediction of possible frequency shifts is vital during the design process...|$|R
