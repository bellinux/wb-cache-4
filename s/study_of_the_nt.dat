40|$|Because of the {{uniformity}} of the text, NT papyri are {{well suited to}} codicological reconstruction. If there are two or more pieces of papyrus from the same codex, sound reconstructions are often possible. But good methodology will account for the fibre orientation of the fragments. Flawed conclusions are the inevitable result of neglecting such analysis. Skeat erred in this direction as regards P⁶⁴⁺⁶⁷ and P⁴. Nevertheless, his contribution in the area was substantial and enduring. It only remains for scholars to appreciate the insights that codicology can bring to the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>NT</b> text. 23 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectrum}} of Ni-substituted lizardite, (Mg,Ni) 3 Si 2 Os(OH) 4, {{has been discussed}} by many authors, who have successively given contradictory interpretations concerning the symmetry of the Ni-sites. Lakshman & Reddy (1973) affirmed that in garnierites Ni is in a tetrahedral site. Faye (1974) rejected this conclusion and showed that Ni 2 + occupies an octahedral site. However, the Ni [...] . O distance of 2. 01 A which he deduced from {{the intensity of the}} crystal field is unacceptable. Recently, using a completely different approach to the interpretation of the spectrum, Cervelle & Maquet (1982) claimed that Ni 2 + occupies a six-coordinated site of Car symmetry, and concluded that the mean Ni [...] . O distance is 2. 06 A. The aim of this note is to show {{that it is possible to}} interpret the {{spectrum of}} Ni-lizardite as arising from a predominantly octahedral field with a weak C 2 v component which provokes a small increase in width of the absorption bands. Preliminary theoretical <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nt</b> ~+ spectrum In order to interpret the Ni 2 +-ion spectrum we can reduce the problem to that of the d-electrons in the frozen core (ls) 2 (2 s) 2 (2 p) 6 (3 s) 2 (3 p) 6, i. e. consider Ni 2 +: d 8.

40|$|This {{inductive}} <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approximately 300 <b>NT</b> instances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{first class}} condition (ei + indicative) disputes the common under-standing that this construction {{should be interpreted}} as obviously true and translated as "since. " It is found {{that this is the}} case only 37 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. Surprisingly, in 51 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occurrences the condition is undetermined. Four proposed explanations of this construction are examined andfound to be inadequate. It is then argued that <b>the</b> correct explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first class condition is a simple logical connection between protasis and apodosis. T HE meaning of words is properly determined by a <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ways they are used in their many contexts, not by theoretical rationaliza-tions on root meanings and etymologies. In just the same way <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> a group of words in grammatical construction is determined by careful <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same construction in actually occurring contexts, not by rationalizing about voice, mood, and the technical terminology employed by grammarians to identify them. A commonly occurring example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neglect <b>of</b> this axiom is {{the manner in which the}} construction frequently called "First Class Condition " is handled in much exegetical literature. Reasoning from <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Ei instead <b>of</b> sav and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indicative mood, <b>the</b> mood <b>of</b> reality and actuality, the conclusion is drawn that the first class conditional sentence is not really a condition at all, but it implies that the condition is actually true and could well be translated "since.,, 1 Is this true?
