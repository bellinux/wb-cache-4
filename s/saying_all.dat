5|$|On March 31, 1995, Specter {{announced}} his candidacy for President of the United States, {{to challenge the}} incumbent Bill Clinton.

5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E

The planet that rises clockwise following the empty space will significantly influence {{the life of the}} person with this pattern, no matter what is indicated by the sun sign. It will act as the 'locomotive' of the natal chart, driving the individual to achieve goals through determined and unrelenting effort, with an exceptional drive and fund of energy at their disposal.

On December 19, Mark Dochtermann promised the patch would be released before Christmas, along with Vengeance, stating they had delayed release of the patch for the PC version so as to coincide its release with the Mac version of the game. Although the Mac version was ultimately released in January 2002, the patch was never officially released by MumboJumbo for either version of the game.|$|E

25|$|Exactly {{how and why}} did Merezhkovsky {{found himself}} on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova) was blaming her own {{secretary}} Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man {{to come to the}} studio {{in the early days of}} the Nazi invasion into the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled Bolshevism and Humanity is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for the anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what he was <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> through the 1920s and 1930s:Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day Russia has been – and remains to this very day – only a means to the end: that of its conquering the whole world.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the themes}} and musical styles of the album were {{inspired}} by Beyoncé's role in Dreamgirls. The plot of the film revolves around The Dreams, a fictional 1960s group of three female singers who attempt success in the mainstream music industry {{with the help of}} their manager, Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé portrays Deena Jones, the lead singer of the group and the wife of Taylor, and is emotionally abused by him. Because of her role, Beyoncé was inspired to produce an album with an overriding theme of feminism and female empowerment. In the bonus track, [...] "Encore for the Fans", Beyoncé says, [...] "Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> the things I wish she would have said in the film." ...|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E

I don't want to go by what everyone else sees – I {{want to see what}} is actually going on, and share in the reaction of the characters {{at the same time as}} them". However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted: [...] "If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, then-Harvard {{assistant}} coach Bill Holden saw that Lin was [...] tall, which fit the physical attributes he was seeking, {{and he had}} a 4.2 grade point average in high school, which met Harvard's academic standards. But Holden was initially unimpressed with Lin's on-court abilities, and told Lin's high school basketball coach, Peter Diepenbrock, that Lin was a [...] "Division III player". Later that week, Holden saw Lin playing in a much more competitive game, driving to the basket at every opportunity with the [...] "instincts of a killer", and Lin became a top priority for him. Harvard coaches feared that Stanford, close to Lin's home, would offer Lin a scholarship, but it did not, and Lin chose to attend Harvard. [...] "I wasn't sitting there <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> these Division I coaches were knuckleheads," [...] Diepenbrock said. [...] "There were legitimate questions about Jeremy." [...] Joe Lacob, incoming Warriors owner and Stanford booster, said Stanford's failure to recruit Lin [...] "was really stupid. The kid was right across the street. [...] you can't recognize that, you've got a problem." [...] Kerry Keating, the UCLA assistant who offered Lin the opportunity to walk-on, said in hindsight that Lin would probably have ended up starting at point guard for UCLA.|$|E
500|$|Drake then {{contacted}} Songz, who {{had been}} working with Drake back since 2007 on mixtapes. Songz said that Drake originally called him on advice of segueing his singing into rapping on interludes, then the terms of what records he would be featured on the mixtape, as he sent him the [...] "Successful" [...] track. After Drake still could not settle on the direction for the track, Songz came up with the his hook. He explained to MTV News, [...] "The first thing that came to mind was 'I want the money, money and the cars/ Cars and the clothes/ The ho's/ I suppose I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful.' When I'm <b>saying</b> <b>all</b> that, conceptually for me, the deepest part of the record was when I say, 'I suppose.' I supposed that's what success is about. That's what [...] led to believe." [...] After hearing the hook, Drake called it [...] "powerful", commenting, [...] "And it's like, it's almost like it made me feel like it may not be right what I want, you know? All these things, it's like it made me feel young. It kind of made me feel ignorant to the game. But it was an exciting record even though the tempo is slow. That's what I want... The 'I suppose' moment in there is like, it's almost like you're doubting yourself for a second. But {{at the end of the}} day, I just want to be successful. So that's what the record meant to me." ...|$|E
