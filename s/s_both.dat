25|$|The {{modernization}} work on {{the four}} Great War era battleships turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. The ship's guns were upgraded in main armament, going from 13 guns of 305mm diameter, to 10 guns of 320mm diameter. The middle turret and the vessel's central tower were eliminated. To increase speed the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers and ten meters {{were added to the}} ship's length to improve the coefficient of fineness. Though the ships were improved, they still were not an equal match for the s and the <b>s,</b> <b>both</b> of which carried larger guns and heavier armour.|$|E

In winning its second VLN 4h event, the LF-A improved its fastest lap time, with one driver completing 8:41 laps both in practice and in the race; by comparison, the fastest overall race laps were 8:27 by a Dodge Viper and a Porsche 997 Cup <b>S,</b> <b>both</b> of the new SP9 class, which is close to FIA-GT3.|$|E

500|$|The Imperator Aleksandr II-class battleships {{were the}} first all-steel battleships to be built for the Baltic Fleet and were {{designed}} to allow Russia to dominate the Baltic Sea by defeating rival ships like the [...] and the German <b>s,</b> <b>both</b> of which were built of wrought iron. They were designed according to the tactical theories of the day which emphasized ramming and incorporated a ram bow. In addition their forecastle deck sloped slightly downwards to allow the main guns to fire at the waterline of the enemy at short range as the ship closed to ram. A full transverse armored bulkhead protected the forward [...] guns from raking fire and no armor was originally provided {{to protect them from}} the side. They were given a full sailing rig to allow for deployments to the Mediterranean and other distant locations although it was never actually used. Imperator Nikolai I was originally going to be built to a completely different design, but this was changed at the last minute to {{a modified version of the}} Imperator Aleksandr II design, so there were significant differences between the two ships.|$|E
500|$|Credit {{issues were}} {{becoming}} more critical, however. Around {{the time the}} buyout was made public, Moody's and <b>S</b> <b>both</b> reduced Enron's rating to just one notch above junk status. Were the company's rating to fall below investment-grade, its ability to trade would be severely limited {{if there was a}} reduction or elimination of its credit lines with competitors. In a conference call, S affirmed that, were Enron not to be bought, S would reduce its rating to low BB or high B, ratings noted as being within junk status. Additionally, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron, or stopped doing business altogether, fearing more bad news. Watson again attempted to re-assure, attesting at a presentation to investors that there was [...] "nothing wrong with Enron's business". He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis. The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his [...] "reputation in tatters", stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year. An official at a company owned by Enron stated [...] "We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000. It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{effectively}} {{convert a}} Lehmer code d'n, d'n−1, ..., d2, d1 into {{a permutation of}} an ordered set S, one can start {{with a list of}} the elements of S in increasing order, and for i increasing from 1 to n set σ'i to the element in the list that is preceded by d'n+1−i other ones, and remove that element from the list. To convert an inversion table d'n, d'n−1, ..., d2, d1 into the corresponding permutation, one can traverse the numbers from d1 to d'n while inserting the elements of S from largest to smallest into an initially empty sequence; at the step using the number d from the inversion table, the element from S inserted into the sequence at the point where it is preceded by d elements already present. Alternatively one could process the numbers from the inversion table and the elements of <b>S</b> <b>both</b> in the opposite order, starting with a row of n empty slots, and at each step place the element from S into the empty slot that is preceded by d other empty slots.|$|E
