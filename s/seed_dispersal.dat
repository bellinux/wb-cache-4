40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms exhibit a multicellular developmental life cycle analogous {{to that of}} the myxobacteria. In non-mucoid PAO 1 biofilms cultured in glass flow cells the phenotypic differentiation of microcolonies into a motile phenotype in the interior of the microcolony and a non-motile surrounding 'wall phenotype' are described. After differentiation the interior cells coordinately evacuated the microcolony from local break out points and spread over the wall of the flow cell, suggesting that the specialized microcolonies were analogous to crude fruiting bodies. A microcolony diameter of approximately 80 microm was required for differentiation, suggesting that regulation was related to cell density and mass transfer conditions. This phenomenon was termed 'seeding dispersal' to differentiate it from 'erosion' which is the passive removal of single cells by fluid shear. Using the flow cell culturing method, in which reproducible seeding phenotype in PAO 1 wild-type was demonstrated, the effects of quorum sensing (QS) and rhamnolipid production (factors previously identified as important in determining biofilm structure) on <b>seeding</b> <b>dispersal</b> using knockout mutants isogenic with PAO 1 was investigated. Rhamnolipid (rhlA) was not required for <b>seeding</b> <b>dispersal</b> but las/rhl QS (PAO 1 -JP 2) was, in our system. To assess the clinical relevance of these data, mucoid P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis isolate FRD 1 was also investigated and was seeding-dispersal-negative...|$|R

40|$|We {{welcome the}} {{dialogue}} concerning the potential clinical significance of <b>seeding</b> <b>dispersal</b> (Purevdorj-Gage et al., 2005) {{in the life}} cycle of mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. We had based our hypothesis that the <b>seeding</b> <b>dispersal</b> phenomenon may be more relevant for non-mucoid, environmental strains on (1) the propensity of diseases associated with reduced mucociliary clearance in the lung, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to select for mucoid P. aeruginosa phenotypes, and (2) that conversion to mucoidy is usually associated with a concomitant down-regulation of flagella production and loss of swimming motility (see Garrett et al., 1999). However, as Kirov et al. discuss above, there may be greater diversity in mucoid CF isolates than generally acknowledged, and the perceived dichotomy between mucoidy and swimming phenotypes should be a topic for debate. More recently {{it has been shown that}} expression of flagellum genes in response to oxygen limitation precedes loss of mucoidy and is reversible during this state of transition (Wyckoff et al., 2002). Further, in an ongoing screen of mucoid CF isolates it was found that 6 out of 20 were motile (D. J. Wozniak, personal communication). However, it was suspected that growth medium may also play a role in the outcome of the motility assay and exact proportions may vary depending on culture conditions. The growth-condition-dependent transient switching between mucoid and swimming phenotypes is problematic when relating a particular biofilm behaviour with phenotype and stresses the importance of attempting to characterize the phenotypic state at various time points during biofilm development. Broadly though, the finding of Dr Wozniak is in agreement with that of Kirov et al. We agree that to fully assess the role of <b>seeding</b> <b>dispersal</b> (and other yet unidentified behavioural developmental phenotypes) in the context of lung infections, biofilm studies should include greater diversity in strains, growth conditions and be conducted over longer time scales. The interesting observation that seeding motility occurred in a mucoid CF isolate clearly demonstrates that the phenomenon may have clinical relevance. Another point we would like to briefly address is the difference in terminology used by our two groups in reference to the hollowing out of clusters. Kirov et al. refer to hollowing resulting from ‘bacteriophage-mediated lysis' as ‘death-associated dispersal’. We use the term ‘seeding dispersal’ in a more general sense to describe sequential steps from the formation of microcolonies culminating in the release of live cells from the centres of the colonies. Our working hypothesis for <b>seeding</b> <b>dispersal</b> which integrates observations from our two groups is thus: (1) the formation of cell clusters; (2) the differentiation of the cell cluster into two or possibly three distinct phenotypes consisting of the cells in the stationary cluster ‘wall’, the highly motile seeding subpopulation in the interior and the lysing interior subpopulation (Webb et al., 2003) which allows the interior to liquefy; (3) highly agitated ‘seeding motility’ in the interior; and finally (4) the swimming, or swarming, of cells out of the microcolony. In the case of PAO 1 the release appears to occur through directed motility, but we recognize that hollowing in non-motile species such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (P. Stewart & B. Pitts, personal communication) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Kaplan et al., 2003) may be driven by water currents. It is interesting to speculate that the recent increase in reports of hollow clusters occurring in a diversity of bacterial biofilms is evidence of convergent evolution in biofilm development...|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between spores and <b>seeds</b> as <b>dispersal</b> units is that spores are unicellular, while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte {{that produces a}} developing embryo, the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation.

5|$|The {{predominant}} tree in Yellowstone, the lodgepole pine, fared poorly from the fires, except {{in areas where}} the heat and flames were very mild. The lodgepole pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire. Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best <b>seed</b> <b>dispersal</b> occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires, and that <b>seed</b> <b>dispersal</b> was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns. Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5years. However, the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform, with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less. Stands of dead lodgepole killed by the fires may persist for decades, rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through <b>seed</b> <b>dispersal.</b> Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modeling}} approach {{to study how}} mature biofilms spread and colonize new surfaces by predicting the formation and growth of satellite colonies generated by dispersing biofilms. This model provides the basis for better understanding the fate and behavior of dispersal cells, phenomenon that cannot, as yet, be predicted from knowledge of the genome. The model results were promising as supported by the experimental results. The proposed approach allows for further improvements through more detailed sub-models for front propagation, seeding, availability and depletion of resources. The present study was a successful proof-of-concept in answering the following questions: Can we predict the colonization of new sites following biofilm dispersal? Can we generate patterns {{in space and time}} to shed light on <b>seeding</b> <b>dispersal?</b> That are fundamental issues for developing novel approaches to manipulate biofilm formation in industrial, environmental and medical applications...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{simultaneously}} {{evaluating the}} importance of safe-site and seed limitation for plant establishment are rare, particularly in human-modified landscapes. We used spatially explicit neighborhood models together with data from 10 0. 5 -ha mapped census plots in a fragmented landscape spanning 1000 km 2 to (1) evaluate {{the relative importance of}} <b>seed</b> production, <b>dispersal,</b> and safe-site limitation for the recruitment of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata; and (2) determine how these processes differ between fragments and continuous forests. Our analyses demonstrated a large degree of variation in <b>seed</b> production, <b>dispersal,</b> and establishment among and within the 10 study plots. Seed production limitation was strong but only at small spatial scales. Average dispersal distance was less than 4 m, leading to severe dispersal limitation at most sites. Overall, safe-site limitation was the most important constraint on seedling establishment. Fragmentation led to a more heterogeneous light environment with negative consequences for seedling establishment but had little effect on <b>seed</b> production or <b>dispersal.</b> These results suggest that the effects of fragmentation on abiotic processes may be more important than the disruption of biotic interactions in driving biodiversity loss in tropical forests, at least for some functional groups. These effects may be common when the matrix surrounding fragments contains enough tree cover to enable movement of dispersers and pollinators...|$|R
5|$|Dietary {{regimes of}} lemurs include folivory, frugivory, and omnivory, with some being highly {{adaptable}} while others specialize on {{foods such as}} plant exudates (tree gum) and bamboo. In some cases, lemur feeding patterns directly benefit the native plant life. When lemurs exploit nectar, they may act as pollinators {{as long as the}} functional parts of the flower are not damaged. In fact, several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur-specific pollination traits, and studies indicate that some diurnal species, such as the red-bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs, act as major pollinators. Two examples of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) and a species of legume-like liana, Strongylodon cravieniae. <b>Seed</b> <b>dispersal</b> is another service lemurs provide. After passing through the lemur gut, tree and vine seeds exhibit lower mortality and germinate faster. Latrine behavior exhibited by some lemurs may help improve soil quality and facilitate <b>seed</b> <b>dispersal.</b> Because of their importance in maintaining a healthy forest, frugivorous lemurs may qualify as keystone mutualists.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} {{tree species}} have seeds that are dispersed by ants. <b>Seed</b> <b>dispersal</b> by ants or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimates suggest that nearly 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations. Some plants in fire-prone grassland systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and dispersal as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground. Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.|$|E

40|$|Spatial genetic {{structure}} was analysed with five highly polymorphic microsatellite loci in a Romanian population of common ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), a wind-pollinated and wind-dispersed tree species occurring in mixed deciduous forests over {{almost all of}} Europe. Contributions of <b>seed</b> and pollen <b>dispersal</b> to total gene flow were investigated by analysing the pattern of decrease in kinship coefficients among pairs of individuals with geographical distance and comparing it with simulation results. Plots of kinship against the logarithm of distance were decomposed into a slope and a shape component. Simulations showed that the slope is informative about the global level of gene flow, in agreement with theoretical expectations, whereas the shape component was correlated with {{the relative importance of}} <b>seed</b> vs. pollen <b>dispersal.</b> Hence, our results indicate that insights into the relative contributions of <b>seed</b> and pollen <b>dispersal</b> to overall gene flow can be gained from details of the pattern of spatial genetic structure at biparentally inherited loci.

5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, <b>seed</b> <b>dispersal</b> to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E
5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for <b>seed</b> <b>dispersal</b> by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth.

This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for <b>seed</b> <b>dispersal.</b> The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E

40|$|Water flows affect {{dispersal}} of propagules of many plant species, and {{rivers and streams}} are therefore very important dispersal vectors. However, small water flows such as trough rain and snowmelt are much more common, but their effects on dispersal are barely studied. The importance of this form of dispersal deserves attention, especially when considering that climate change is predicted to change the amounts of rain and snow worldwide. Dispersal through melting snow and rain was addressed experimentally, using artificial soils mounted on slopes with different angles and subjected to a melting snow pack or an equivalent amount of dripping water. Seeds on the soil moved on average 3 · 02 [*]cm (± 1 · 81 [*]SE) in rain treatments and 0 · 23 [*]cm (± 0 · 3 [*]SE) in snowmelt treatments. Tracking plastic granules in field conditions further showed that snowmelt exhibited minimal dispersal capacity. Dispersal distances by rain were enhanced by increasing slope angles and with decreasing seed volume. Given that many species in cold environments have small <b>seeds,</b> <b>dispersal</b> by rain could provide an important (secondary) dispersal mechanism in these habitats...|$|R

5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. H. Corner published The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree.

However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.|$|E
5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of <b>seed</b> <b>dispersal</b> in plants, it provides dispersal for {{a large percentage of the}} biomass of land plants.|$|E

Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; giant tortoises are reported to distribute Opuntia seeds in the Galápagos Islands. Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as Blossfeldia. Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.|$|E
