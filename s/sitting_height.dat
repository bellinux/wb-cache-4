40|$|Background/Objective:To {{investigate}} socioeconomic, gestational {{and early}} life exposures as potential determinants of total height, leg and trunk length. Subjects/Methods:Male subjects from the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study {{were examined in}} 1986 at home, and in 2000 when registering at the local army base. The follow-up rate was 79 %. Standing and <b>sitting</b> <b>heights</b> were measured on both occasions. Leg length was calculated as the difference between standing and <b>sitting</b> <b>heights.</b> Outcome measures were height, leg and trunk length at 4 and 18 years and growth in this period. Complete data were obtained for 2012 participants, representing 71 % of all eligible male subjects. Results:Mean (s. d.) height, trunk length and leg length at 18 years were 173. 4 (6. 8), 96. 0 (3. 5) and 77. 5 cm (4. 5), respectively. The mean (s. d.) change in height from 1986 to 2000 was 75. 4 cm (5. 2) and for leg and trunk length 35. 4 (3. 9) and 40. 0 cm (2. 9), respectively. Of 11 independent variables analyzed, only maternal height and birthweight were associated with all three variables of growth. Gestational age showed no associations with growth or attained size. Conclusions: Early growth plays {{a pivotal role in}} determining attained height and its components. Both biological and socioeconomic variables strongly influence determinants of height, though socioeconomic factors appear to be more important in early growth. Leg and trunk length contribute almost equally to differences in overall height, regardless of the independent variable influencing the difference.

40|$|Background & aim: The {{risks of}} {{maternal}} mortality and morbidity associated with cesarean delivery are three and two {{times higher than}} vaginal delivery, respectively. The majority of cesarean sections are due to failure to progress in labor. One of the common risk factors for failure to progress is small maternal body size.

5000|$|Internal height. Manufacturers {{quote the}} maximum {{internal}} height, but the usable internal height {{may be a}} little lower, depending on the tent style. Ridge tents have a steeply sloping roof so the whole height is rarely usable. Dome tents slope gently in all directions from the peak enabling nearly the entire height to be usable for {{a large portion of the}} tent. Tunnel tents have a good usable height along the center line. Frame and cabin tents have gently sloping roofs and near vertical walls. To fully evaluate the usable space in a tent, both the maximum wall height and slope must be considered. There are four useful heights used to evaluate appropriate tent height: lie down only, sit, kneel, stand. The exact heights at which these apply depend on the heights of the campers involved; those over 182 cm are likely to have less choice of tents than those who are somewhat shorter. As a starting point, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> is often between 90 and 105 cm, and kneeling height may be between 120 and 150 cm.

This study will determine whether similar associations are observable in settings with different social histories, and will assess whether adult leg length is more strongly associated than adult height. Methods: Random samples of men and women aged 45 – 69 years were taken from population registers in Novosibirsk (Russia), Krakow (Poland) and six towns of the Czech Republic, recruiting nearly 29 000 people. Participants completed a questionnaire that included questions regarding their mother’s and father’s education (not available in the Czech Republic) and ownership of several household items when they were 10 years old. Participants’ standing and <b>sitting</b> <b>heights</b> were measured and from these an estimate of leg length was derived. Associations between indicators of childhood socioeconomic circumstances and anthropometric measures were analysed using linear regression. Results: Russian individuals were shorter and reported fewer household assets at the age of 10 years than Czech and Polish individuals. Parental education and household assets were strongly associated with each other and both were independently associated with height, leg length and trunk length. Height was associated with childhood circumstances more strongly than leg length. The associations of childhood circumstances with the leg/trunk ratio were weak and inconsistent.

Risk of both ER-PR- and ER+PR+ malignancies was positively associated with standing height, leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and inversely associated with increasing age at menarche. For ER+PR+ disease, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (hazard ratios: 1. 14 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 08 – 1. 20]) had a stronger risk association than leg length (1. 05 [1. 00 – 1. 11]).

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} growth of very low birthweight (VLBW) {{children}} in early adolescence with that of their normal birthweight peers; to examine the role of factors contributing to growth-parental height, perinatal variables, bone maturity and sexual maturation; to examine the correlation between head growth and cognitive and educational outcome. METHODS: Standing and <b>sitting</b> <b>heights,</b> weight, occipito-frontal circumference (OFC), skinfold thicknesses and pubertal staging were assessed in 137 VLBW children and 160 controls at 11 - 13. 5 years of age. Ninety six (70 %) of the VLBW children had their bone age assessed using the TW 2 method. Reported parental heights were obtained by questionnaire. All children had standardised tests of cognitive and educational ability. Perinatal data had been collected prospectively {{as part of a}} longitudinal study. RESULTS: VLBW children had lower heights, weight, and OFC. Skinfold thicknesses were no different. The children's short stature was not accounted for by difference in parental height, degree of pubertal development, or by retarded bone age. Indeed, the TW 2 RUS score was significantly advanced in the VLBW children. Using the bone ages to predict final adult height, 17 % have a predicted height below the third centile and 33 % below the tenth. Weight was appropriate for height, but there was a residual deficiency in OFC measurements after taking height into account. In the VLBW group smaller head size was associated with lower IQ and mathematics and reading scores. CONCLUSIONS: Growth problems persist in VLBW children and final heights may be even more abnormal than present heights suggest. VLBW children have smaller OFCs than expected from their short stature alone and this may be associated with poorer educational and cognitive outcomes...|$|R

Both groups had an identical history of chemotherapy and tumor stage and were treated with recombinant growth hormone therapy (rhGH). The mean age of group 18 Gy at diagnosis was 4. 0 years, and rhGH treatment was initiated in 6 children at age 9. 2 years. Group CD (12 children) was diagnosed at a mean age of 5. 8 years and rhGH started in 11 children at a mean age of 9. 6 years. The dose of rhGH used in both groups was identical (0. 3 mg/kg/wk). For group 18 Gy, adult <b>heights</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>heights</b> (a mean standard deviation score of − 1. 01 ± 1. 11 and − 1. 62 ± 1. 16, respectively) were statistically greater (P < 0. 05) than those for group CD (mean standard deviation score of − 2. 04 ± 0. 83 and − 3. 16 ± 1. 43, respectively). Moreover, adult heights of group 18 Gy were not different from midparental heights, unlike group CD, whose adult heights were less than midparental heights (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: Anthropometry is {{a branch}} of Ergonomics that {{considers}} the measurement and description {{of the human body}} dimensions. Accordingly, equipment, environments, and workstations should be designed using user-centered design processes. Anthropometric dimensions differ considerably across gender, race, ethnicity and age, taking into account ergonomic and anthropometric principles. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine anthropometric characteristics of microscope users and provide a regression model for anthropometric dimensions. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, anthropometric dimensions (18 dimensions) of the microscope users (N= 174; 78 males and 96 females) in Shiraz were measured. Instruments included a Studio meter, 2 type calipers, adjustable seats, a 40 -cm ruler, a tape measure, and scales. The study data were analyzed using SPSS, version 20. Results: The means of male and female microscope users’ age were 31. 64 ± 8. 86 and 35 ± 10. 9 years, respectively and their height were 161. 03 ± 6. 87 cm and 174. 81 ± 5. 45 cm, respectively.
