5|$|In late 2013, graphic {{designer}} Darren Wall released an art {{book about the}} history of British developer <b>Sensible</b> Software. Funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and written by games journalist Gary Penn of Zzap!64, <b>Sensible</b> Software 1986–1999 is a 340-page anthology of the company's full catalogue, from its popular 16-bit games (e.g. <b>Sensible</b> Soccer, Cannon Fodder, Wizball) to its lesser-known products and features. It also explains the personalities behind the company, mainly its founders Jon Hare and Chris Yates, through long-form interviews. Hare was elated when Wall originally contacted him about the project, but Yates, who has been estranged from Hare since 2003, did not participate. Hare explained the company's issues with scaling and hiring, and how the company was slow to transition to 3D graphics. Other commentators featured in the book include developer and entrepreneur David Darling, television personality Dominik Diamond, musician Martin Galway, and games journalist Gary Whitta.|$|E

5|$|Earl St Vincent was {{suffering}} from an extreme shortage of frigates, and on the arrival of <b>Sensible</b> at the Tagus immediately ordered the frigate to be commissioned as HMS <b>Sensible,</b> stripping six men from each of his ships to man her and turning the frigate into an active warship in just 12 hours. For a year <b>Sensible</b> remained with St. Vincent, until she {{was sent back to}} Britain in November 1799. On arrival the ship was downgraded from frontline service, but did spend several years commissioned as a military transport until wrecked off Ceylon on 3 March 1802. Among the treasures removed from the ship was a decorated brass cannon captured from the Ottomans in the seventeenth century and presented to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem by King Louis XIV of France, as well as a model of a galley made from gilt silver. These were sold, along with the other cargo and ships fittings at Sheerness in November 1799, the prize money shares subsequently awarded to the crew of Seahorse.|$|E

Fine also argues that Plato allows beliefs about both forms and <b>sensibles.</b>|$|R

5|$|In his 1698 book Cosmotheoros, Christiaan Huygens {{estimated}} {{the distance to}} Sirius at 27664 times {{the distance of the}} Earth to the Sun (about 0.437 light years, translating to a parallax of roughly 7.5 arcseconds). There were several unsuccessful attempts to measure the parallax of Sirius: by Jacques Cassini (6 seconds); by some astronomers (including Nevil Maskelyne) using Lacaille's observations made at the Cape of Good Hope (4 seconds); by Piazzi (the same amount); using Lacaille's observations made at Paris, more numerous and certain than those made at the Cape (no <b>sensible</b> parallax); by Bessel (no <b>sensible</b> parallax).|$|E
5|$|The Court {{makes it}} a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner.

5|$|A federal {{government}} is only <b>sensible,</b> for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Fodder 3 is an action-strategy PC game {{developed}} and published – originally in Russia – by Game Factory Interactive (GFI), along with developer Burut CT. The game {{is the second}} sequel to Cannon Fodder, a commercially and critically successful game released for multiple formats in 1993. Jon Hare and his company <b>Sensible</b> Software, the developers of Cannon Fodder and its prior sequel, were uninvolved with Cannon Fodder 3. GFI instead licensed the intellectual property from now-owner Codemasters.|$|E
5|$|Lookouts on Seahorse spotted <b>Sensible</b> at 16:00 on 26 June and Captain Edward Foote {{immediately}} gave chase, the French frigate fleeing southwards. For 12 {{hours the}} pursuit continued until Foote {{was able to}} catch and defeat his opponent, inflicting heavy casualties on the weaker and overladen French frigate. Among the prisoners captured was General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers who had been wounded in the storming of Malta, and among the treasure was an ornate seventeenth century cannon once owned by Louis XIV. The captured <b>Sensible</b> was initially fitted out as an active warship, but on arrival in Britain in 1799 the ship was downgraded to a transport. The action provided the British with the first conclusive evidence of the French intention to invade Egypt, but despite an extensive search for Nelson's fleet Foote was unable to relay {{the location of the}} French to his admiral before the Battle of the Nile on 1 August.|$|E

5|$|Teller {{later learned}} of Oppenheimer's {{solicitation}} {{and his role}} in the Interim Committee's decision to drop the bombs, having secretly endorsed an immediate military use of the new weapons.

Following Teller's discovery of this, his relationship with his advisor began to deteriorate.|$|E

5|$|Cannon Fodder 2: Once More {{unto the}} Breach, or simply Cannon Fodder 2, is an action-strategy shoot 'em up game {{developed}} by <b>Sensible</b> Software {{and published by}} Virgin Interactive for the Amiga and DOS in November 1994. The game is the sequel to Cannon Fodder, a successful game released for multiple formats in 1993. The game {{is a combination of}} action and strategy involving a small number of soldiers battling through a time-travel scenario. The protagonists are heavily outnumbered and easily killed. The player must rely on strategy and heavy secondary weapons to overcome enemies, their vehicles and installations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} {{before and after the}} first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use on Japan, and with that hopefully the weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, Teller consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. Teller believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem. Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation's fate should be left to the <b>sensible</b> politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E
5|$|Protein {{structures}} have to {{be represented}} in some coordinate-independent space to make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive representation is the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the alpha carbons). The matrix increases in dimensionality {{as the number of}} structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce <b>sensible</b> alignments, despite the loss of information from discarding distances, as noise is also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Read-Only Memory is a British {{publisher}} of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Following {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers <b>Sensible</b> Software and The Bitmap Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known. Read-Only Memory's books are archival anthologies, including original design documents juxtaposed with developer interviews and high-quality prints of in-game graphics. Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's breadth of unreleased concepts.|$|E
