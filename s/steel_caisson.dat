40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the dynamics of}} a mathematical model for the mobile barriers designed to close the tidal inlets of the Venice Lagoon and to defend the city from recurrent high waters. The barriers consist {{of a large number}} of <b>steel</b> <b>caissons</b> (hereafter referred to as gates) connected to the seabed with hinges. The gates usually rest horizontally on the sea bottom allowing mass exchange between the sea and the lagoon and are brought into operation during high tides by the inflow of compressed air. When in operation the gates close the lagoon openings even though they may oscillate around their mean position. In the present contribution the barriers are modelled by vertical rigid plates which can slide along the bottom and are subjected to a recoil effect simulating Archimedes' force acting on the real gates. First, the in-phase motion of the gates produced by an incoming wave is studied. Then, by means of a linear stability analysis of this basic motion, it is shown that oscillations of the gates, such that contiguous gates oscillate out of phase, can be excited for suitable values of the wave and barrier characteristics. In particular, the existence of a critical value of the amplitude of the incoming waves is pointed out, below which the in-phase motion of the gates is stable. A quantitative comparison with previous studies of the problem which used a simple model is made...|$|R
2500|$|In December 2005 Devon Energy started {{drilling}} {{the first}} offshore well in Canadian {{waters of the}} Beaufort sea since 1989, from the drilling rig SDC. The SDC (or <b>Steel</b> Drilling <b>Caisson)</b> was built for Canmar in 1982 by attaching the forebody of the Very Large Crude Carrier World Saga {{to the top of}} a steel barge with sloping sides (mimicking an artificial island); the barge can be ballasted to sit on the bottom for drilling operations. The Paktoa C-60 well was completed in 2006, but results are unknown as it was designated a [...] "tight hole" [...] – a well for which, for competitive reasons, no information could be released.|$|R
25|$|In 1982–1989, the Canmar drillships drilled only 10 wells for Dome Petroleum {{and other}} oil {{companies}} in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. In addition, four more wells were drilled by the drillships in the Alaskan waters in 1985–1991. Other wells were drilled from artificial drilling islands as well as novel drilling systems such as Kulluk and the single <b>steel</b> drilling <b>caisson.</b> While a number {{of oil and gas}} discoveries were made, none of the findings were sufficient to warrant commercial production. Following the falling oil prices in the 1980s and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, hydrocarbon exploration in the Beaufort Sea and the MacKenzie Delta gradually ended. Robert LeMeur was reportedly laid up in 1996.|$|R

40|$|A {{test program}} has been {{performed}} in an ice modeling basin to measure the load apportioning through ice rubble around Gulf's Molikpaq, a <b>steel</b> <b>caisson</b> offshore structure. A model of the Molikpaq and its supporting submarine berm was built at a 1 : 75 scale. The Molikpaq and berm were instrumented independently, so the load apportioning could be determined. Thirty-six ice-loading events, including rubble formation from level ice as well as impacts through the rubble by extreme ice features, were analyzed. The results of the tests show that the ice rubble can deform and transmit load to the structure at force levels well below those predicted by a rigid-body analysis of the rubble.

25|$|In 1976, Canadian Marine Drilling Ltd., a {{subsidiary}} of Dome Petroleum, brought a small armada to the Beaufort.

40|$|The Molikpaq <b>steel</b> <b>caisson</b> {{structure}} {{was used for}} exploratory drilling for four winters in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. During its deployment, it experienced loads from moving ice fields that had {{a wide range of}} morphology. A large number of first-year sea ice ridges interacted and failed against the Molikpaq with a variety of different failure behaviour including spine failures, failure behind the ridge, mixed modal, shear failure and stopping of the ridge. This paper reviews these failure behaviours and provides some representative information on the global loads generated during ridge interaction with the Molikpaq. The global loads were on the order of 45 MN to 90 MN which, compared to level ice crushing, are in the low to moderate range. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The Molikpaq is a <b>steel</b> <b>caisson</b> {{structure}} {{that was used}} in the 1980 s in the Canadian Beaufort Sea for exploration drilling of oil and gas. It was very extensively instrumented. Part of the instrumentation was designed to measure the ice loads. This paper presents an overview discussion of the characteristics and instrumentation of the Molikpaq. It presents detailed information on 188 ice loading events from both first-year and multi-year ice for different ice macrostructures including level ice, ridges, hummock ice and isolated floes. Investigation of the ice loads has shown that the Line Load (global load per unit length of the structure) increases with increasing ice thickness. The analysis of the ice loads in terms of the failure mode of the ice provides additional insight and explains some of the scatter in the ice load data. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{axisymmetric}} behaviour of a suction caisson installed in sand upon vertical monotonic and cyclic loading. A <b>steel</b> <b>caisson</b> is numerically modelled using the finite element code LAGAMINE. The Prevost model reproduces the cyclic behaviour of the soil, i. e. it captures the accumulation of deformation and pore water pressure within the soil. Coupled interface finite elements allow the modelling of the uplift behaviour of the caisson in both drained and partially drained conditions. Upon compression or traction loading, the suction caisson presents different modes of resistance: friction along the shaft, bearing capacity under the lid or {{the tip of the}} caisson, suction effect. The first part of this work describes the progressive mobilisation of these modes of resistance during monotonic simulations. The partially drained effect is particularly interesting since it drastically increases the resistance to transient loading. It proceeds from the transient consolidation process induced by the caissons loading. The second part describes the evolution of the settlement of the suction caisson upon different kind of cyclic loading signals. Peer reviewe...|$|E
50|$|The lock {{has three}} sliding gates {{constructed}} out of <b>steel</b> with <b>caissons</b> that allow to take ballast. The gates slide {{on a system}} of rollers on rails at the bottom {{at right angles to}} the longitudinal axis of the lock and disappear into special storage chamber or recess built into the sidewall of the dock. After a gate closes, it is ballasted with water and has to deballast before it opens again. There is one gate {{at each end of the}} lock and one in between (100 meters from the lower gate). The middle gate had to allow a faster turning time but the gain was very little so the gate was put out of service. For the first time, electrical engines were used to operate the gates.|$|R
