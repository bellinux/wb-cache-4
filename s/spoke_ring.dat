It {{consists of two}} concentric membranes perforated by nuclear pores, large protein complexes that form aqueous channels to regulate the flow of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These complexes are composed of at least 100 different polypeptide subunits, many of which belong to the nucleoporin family. This gene encodes {{a member of the}} FG-repeat-containing nucleoporins.

40|$|Nuclear pore {{complexes}} (NPCs) play {{a central}} role in mediating nucleocytoplasmic transport and exchange processes in eukaryotic cells. The arrangement and interactions of NPCs within amphibian nuclear envelopes have been studied using cryo-electron microscopy of unfixed and frozen hydrated specimens. The nuclear lamina in Necturus forms an orthogonal network with crossover distances which vary between 1, 600 and 4, 000 A and which may be related to the basic filament repeat of lamins. Furthermore, the NPCs are attached randomly within the confines of the lamin network, presumably by their nucleoplasmic rings. Image analysis of edge-on and en face projections of detergent-extracted NPCs has been combined with data on the coaxial thin rings to provide a quantitative evaluation of the triple ring model of NPC architecture proposed previously (Unwin, P. N. T., and R. Milligan. 1982. J. Cell Biol. 93 : 63 - 75). Additional details of the complex have been visualized including an intimate association of the inner spoke domains as an inner <b>spoke</b> <b>ring,</b> extensive domains within the spokes and coaxial thin rings, and interestingly, a central channel-like feature. Membrane- associated NPCs and detergent-extracted NPCs both possess peripherally located radial arms resulting in an effective diameter of approximately 1, 450 - 1, 500 A. In projection, the radial arms possess approximate mirror symmetry suggesting that they originate from both sides of the assembly. Moreover, membrane-associated NPCs are asymmetric at most radii and right-handed as viewed from the cytoplasm; detergent- extracted NPCs appear to be symmetric and have approximately 822 symmetry. Taken together, the data suggests that the framework of membrane-associated NPCs is perturbed from a symmetrical configuration, either during isolation of nuclei or by interactions with the lamina and the nuclear envelope in vivo. However, detergent extraction of nuclei appears to result in a more symmetrical alignment of components in apposing halves of the assembly...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We have {{isolated}} a major protein constituent from {{a highly}} enriched fraction of yeast nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The gene encoding this protein, Nup 188 p, was cloned, sequenced, {{and found to}} be nonessential upon deletion. Nup 188 p cofractionates with yeast NPCs and gives an immunofluorescent staining pattern typical of nucleoporins. Using immunoelectron microscopy, Nup 188 p was shown to localize to both the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic faces of the NPC core. There, Nup 188 p interacts with an integral protein of the pore membrane domain, Pom 152 p, and another abundant nucleoporin, Nic 96 p. The effects of various mutations N UCLEOPORINS are the molecular constituents of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) 1. Approximately 50 such individual nucleoporins (Rout and Blobel, 1993) constitute the complex 100 MD NPC structure and mediate multiple nuclear translocation processes. The core of the NPC reveals an octagonally symmetric architecture with several repetitious structural elements such as <b>spokes,</b> <b>rings,</b> and radial arms surrounding a central tube (termed "central plug") (Akey and Radermacher, 1993; Hinshaw et al., 1992).

50|$|Like all dynamos, the Faraday disc {{converts}} {{kinetic energy}} to electrical energy. This machine can be analysed using Faraday's own law of electromagnetic induction.

The surface integral that defines the magnetic flux can be rewritten as a line integral around the circuit. Although the integrand of the line integral is time-independent, because the Faraday disc that forms part of the boundary of line integral is moving, the full-time derivative is non-zero and returns the correct value for calculating the electromotive force. Alternatively, the disc can be reduce to a conductive ring along the disc's circumference with a single metal <b>spoke</b> connecting the <b>ring</b> to the axle.|$|R
40|$|Title: The Role of Secondary Electron Emission in Dust Grain Charging Author: Ivana Richterová Department: Department of Surface and Plasma Science Supervisor: Prof. RNDr. Zdeněk Němeček, DrSc. Abstract: This work {{presents}} a secondary emission model focused on micron and submicron dust grains. The results {{allowed us to}} predict surface potentials of grains charged by 50 eV [...] 15 keV electron beams. The probability that such electrons penetrate through grains increases with their energy and decreases with a grain size and depends on a grain shape. Model predictions were experimentally verified for glass, gold, and carbon spherical grains and for lunar regolith simulants. In dusty plasmas, charge accumulated on dust grains and plasma parameters govern the ensemble dynamics. The model can be thus utilised in calculations of phenomenon in planet magnetospheres (e. g. <b>spokes</b> in Saturn's <b>rings),</b> in tokamak edge plasmas, etc. Keywords: Secondary emission, dust grains, dust chargin...|$|R

40|$|We {{suggest that}} prior to its impact with Jupiter, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 will behave as an {{electrical}} generator in the Jovian magnetosphere, converting planetary rotational energy to electrical energy via a dust/plasma interaction. This electrical energy will then be deposited in the dayside auroral region where it may drive various auroral phenomena including cyclotron radio emission.

We apply the theory originally developed to explain the <b>spokes</b> in Saturn's <b>rings.</b> This theory allows us to quantify the driving potential associated with the comet and, consequently, to determine the radio power created in the auroral region.

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{demonstrate}} self-assembly fabrication {{methods for}} programmable global and localized surface wrinkling by utilizing the shape memory effects of shape memory polymers (SMPs). Heat responsive SMPs, {{due to their}} capability of memorizing and recovering different shapes, can provide unique opportunities to realize smart surface wrinkling, and therefore were used as smart substrates or films. To build the bilayer film-substrate system, thin films, such as Si ribbons and aluminum films, were transferred or deposited {{on the surface of}} programmed SMP substrates. In the Si ribbon-SMP system, time and temperature dependent wrinkling formation and evolution were observed and systematically studied. For the localized heating cases, such as line and point heating, aluminum thin films were deposited on the programmed SMP substrates and heating wires were used to achieve heating the samples locally. The wrinkling patterns by line heating showed good sinusoidal profiles, with wavelength and amplitude decreasing gradually with the distance from the heating source. The area of wrinkling can also be tuned with large range. For the systems heated by point heat sources, hierarchical wrinkling patterns were achieved. Two distinct wrinkling patterns, <b>spoke</b> and <b>ring</b> patterns, formed in a circular area around the heat source. Spoke patterns appeared around the point heat sources due to the free boundary conditions in the radial direction, and ring patterns appeared at the periphery due to the constraint from the outside SMP. We have also demonstrated the method to reversibly control the formation and disappearance of the wrinkling through SMP film-elastomer substrate system. In addition, fabrication of three-dimensional hierarchical structures through sequential wrinkling is presented. These results in this dissertation offer simple methods to fabricate different types of programmable surface wrinkling pattern, with potential applications in stretchable electronics, optical gratings, surface engineering, advanced manufacturing, and other demanding applications...|$|R

Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the intraspecific and interspecific competition between two contrasting tree species and to determine the distance over which competition can be observed. Methods: Competition was estimated using Hegyi’s index, implemented using the Simile visual modeling environment, and calibrated using nonlinear least squares with PEST. Results: Interactions were detected between pairs of stems closer than D ij [*] 3 ̆c[*] 40 (d i [*]+[*]d j) where D is distance (in centimeters) and d is stem diameter (in centimeters diameter at breast height).

40|$|As airless {{planetary}} {{bodies are}} directly exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation and plasma, {{an environment that}} fosters dust charging within planetary regolith will result, producing dust mobilization and transport. A multitude of unsolved in-situ planetary observations linked to electrostatic processes exist, ranging from dust ponds on the asteroid Eros, to intermittently appearing radial <b>spokes</b> in Saturn’s <b>rings,</b> and even to the lunar horizon glow. Available charging models could not adequately explain any of these phenomena. Through careful experimentation a new “Patched Charge Model” has been developed at the NASA/SSERVI’s Institute for Modeling Plasma, Atmospheres and Cosmic Dust (IMPACT) at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Experiments have proven that emission and re-absorption of photoelectrons and/or secondary electrons at the walls of dust microcavities generate large negative charge patches and particle-particle repulsive forces which mobilize dust particles. Experimentation focused on micron sized particles under conditions of ultraviolet illumination, electron-beam, and plasma with electron-beam. Dust was lofted to heights exceeding 2. 5 cm, which translates to lofting heights of the same order of magnitude required to produce the lunar horizon glow. Contrary to previous charging models and consistent with the patched charge model, dust under all three conditions were measured as having large negative net charges. Surface mobilization characterizing experiments are underway, investigating magnetic field interaction and surface morphology changes. Greater understanding of electrostatic dust mobilization and transport will enhance current understanding of surface evolution of airless bodies {{and is expected to}} assist in explaining unconsidered surface processes...|$|R
40|$|A {{spoke wheel}} roof system {{consists}} of tension rings, compression <b>rings,</b> and radial <b>spokes</b> and resists loads mainly through axial forces. Due to its light weight {{and ability to}} achieve a column-free, long span, {{it has been a}} popular solution to structures such as stadia since its first use in 1960 s. However, there has been lack of information on the performance of a spoke wheel roof system depending on its geometry. This thesis explores the history and general behaviors of a spoke wheel roof system. A representative model is created and tested in Rhino-Grasshopper-Karamba, and the geometric variations to the structure and their influence are evaluated. Configuration of the rings, inner and outer ring radii, aspect ratios of the <b>rings,</b> <b>spoke</b> spacing and slope are chosen to be variables, and load path is used as an evaluation criterion for structural performance or efficiency. Results show that the choice between different ring configurations depends on architectural needs and climate conditions. Assuming that minimal load path implies high structural performance, roof span and size are inversely related to the structural performance. They have a greater influence than the aspect ratios of the rings. Smaller spacing and larger slope of the spokes lead to a more efficient structure. by Harry Kim. Thesis: M.
