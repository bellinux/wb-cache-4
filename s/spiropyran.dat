5000|$|Once the {{irradiation}} has stopped, the merocyanine in solution {{starts to}} discolourate and {{to revert to}} its original form, the <b>spiropyran</b> (N).Procedure: ...|$|E
50|$|There are {{two methods}} for the {{production}} of <b>spiropyrans.</b> The first one can be by condensation of methylene bases with o-hydroxy aromatic aldehydes (or the condensation of the precursor of methylene bases). <b>Spiropyrans</b> generally could be obtained by boiling the aldehyde and the respective benzazolium salts in presence of pyridine or piperidine. The general formula of the synthesis of <b>spiropyrans</b> is shown in the Figure 1.|$|R
50|$|Another {{group of}} <b>spiropyrans</b> which contain {{indoline}} or nitrogen heterocycles and the indolinospirothiapyrans found their application in film forms of photochromic materials using polyester resins. Those resins {{with a high}} refractive index were used to make photochromic lenses. Moreover, <b>spiropyrans</b> are being used in cosmetics.|$|R
40|$|New <b>spiropyrans</b> with {{different}} substituents in the benzopyran fragment have been synthesized and investigated. It was shown that introduction of aldehyde {{group in the}} structure of <b>spiropyrans</b> gives a possibility to obtain new functionalized compounds. Effects of the substituents on the photochromic behavior were studied...|$|R
5000|$|In spirocyclic compounds, the two rings share {{only one}} single atom, the spiro atom, {{which is usually}} a {{quaternary}} carbon. An example of a spirocyclic compound is the photochromic switch <b>spiropyran.</b>|$|E
50|$|When the <b>spiropyran</b> is in a {{solution}} with polar solvents or when it receives heating (thermochromism) or radiation (photochromism) it becomes coloured because its structure has changed {{and it has been}} transformed into the merocyanine form.|$|E
50|$|Spiropyrans {{are used}} in photo {{controlled}} transfer of amino acids across bilayers and membranes because of nucleophilic interaction between zwitterionic merocyanine and polar amino acids. Recently, {{a certain type of}} <b>spiropyran</b> was reported, which shows glutathione induced ring opening.|$|E
50|$|Photochromism is the {{phenomenon}} {{that produces a}} change of colour in a substance by incident radiation. In other words, Photochromism is a light induced change of colour of a chemical substance. The <b>spiropyrans</b> {{are one of the}} photochromatic molecules that have raised more interest lately. These molecules consist of two heterocyclic functional groups in orthogonal planes bound by a carbon atom. <b>Spiropyrans</b> are one of the oldest families of photochromism. As solids, the <b>spiropyrans</b> do not present photochromism. It is possible in solution and in the dry state that radiation between 250 nm and 380 nm (approximately) is able to, by breaking the C-O binding, transform the <b>spiropyrans</b> into its colour emitting merocyanin-form. The structure of the colourless molecules, the substrate of the reaction (N), is more thermodynamically stable than the product - depending on the solvent in which it is stored. For example in NMP the equilibrium could be switched more toward the merocyanin form (solvatochromic effects). The photoisomers of the <b>spiropyrans</b> have a structure similar to cyanines, even though it is not symmetric about the center of the polymethine chain, and it is classified as a merocyanine (Figure 2).|$|R
50|$|The {{determination}} of peroxidase activity and NO2 {{levels in the}} atmosphere are applications of carboxylated <b>spiropyrans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Photochromic {{molecules}} can {{belong to}} various classes: triarylmethanes, stilbenes, azastilbenes, nitrones, fulgides, <b>spiropyrans,</b> naphthopyrans, spiro-oxazines, quinones and others.|$|R
50|$|The {{structural}} {{differences between}} <b>spiropyran</b> and merocyanine form is that, {{while in the}} first one the ring is in the closed form, in the other one the ring is opened. The photochromism is due to electrocyclic cleavage of the C-spiro-O bond with photoexcitation.|$|E
5000|$|Thanks to the {{creation}} of novel media sensitive to IR radiation and the potential of spiropyrans for optical recording data, semiconductor lasers as activating source of radiation are possible.Spiropyrans with ion complexes and <b>spiropyran</b> copolymers which are part of powdered and film materials have been used too to record optical data and increase the length of time of its storage ...|$|E
50|$|A {{photochromic}} {{complex is}} a kind of chemical compound that has photoresponsive parts on its ligand. These complexes have a specific structure: photoswitchable organic compounds are attached to metal complexes. For the photocontrollable parts, thermally and photochemically stable chromophores (azobenzene, diarylethene, <b>spiropyran,</b> etc.) are usually used. And for the metal complexes, a wide variety of compounds that have various functions (redox response, luminescence, magnetism, etc.) are applied.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Spiropyrans</b> {{are among}} the most {{promising}} organic photochromic dyes. However, <b>spiropyrans</b> are very sensitive dyes and there are many independent factors that can affect the performance of these dyes. The effect of substituent on the optical absorption spectra, fading kinetic, and also the dye stability of <b>spiropyrans</b> in diphenyl ether by UV irradiation has been investigated. The 6 -nitro BIPS displayed greater absorbance intensity of 0. 740 % at 600 nm compared to 8 -ethoxy- 6 -nitro BIPS of 0. 651 % at 620 nm. Furthermore, 6 -nitro BIPS is less stable as it has higher rate constant of 0. 1003 s- 1 and thus lower half-life time (50 % decay of the photochromic effect) of 6. 9 s, in contrast to 8 -ethoxy- 6 -nitro BIPS of 0. 0594 s- 1 and 11. 7 s respectively...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>spiropyran</b> is a 2H-pyran isomer {{that has}} the {{hydrogen}} atom at position two replaced by a second ring system linked to the carbon atom at position two of the pyran molecule in a spiro way [...] So there is a carbon atom which is common on both rings, the pyran ring and the replaced ring. The second ring, the replaced one, is usually heterocyclic but there are exceptions.|$|E

5000|$|Later Krongauz {{described}} unusual phase transitions {{of molecules}} composedof mesogenic and <b>spiropyran</b> moieties, which he named [...] "quasi-liquidcrystals." [...] A micrograph of their mesophase {{appeared on the}} cover of Nature in a 1984 paper, “Quasi-Liquid Crystals.” The investigation of spiropyran-merocyanineself-organized systems, including macromolecules (see, for example, Fig. 2),has continued over the years. [...] These studies have resulted in discoveries of unusual and practically significant phenomena.

5000|$|A <b>spiropyran</b> {{is a type}} {{of organic}} {{chemical}} compound, known for photochromic properties that provide this molecule with the ability of being used in medical and technological areas. Spiropyrans were discovered in the early twentieth century. However, it was in the middle twenties when Fisher and Hirshbergin observed their photochromic characteristics and reversible reaction. In 1952, Fisher and co-workers announced for the first time photochromism in spiropyrans. Since then, there have been many studies on photochromic compounds that have continued up to the present.|$|E
5000|$|Photopharmacology is an {{emerging}} approach in medicine in which drugs are activated and deactivated with light. The energy of light {{is used to}} change for shape and chemical properties of the drug, resulting in different biological activity. This is done to ultimately achieve control when and where drugs are active in a reversible manner, to prevent side effects and exposure to the environment of antibiotics. Switching drugs 'on' and 'off' is achieved by introducing photoswitches such as azobenzene, <b>spiropyran</b> or diarylethene into the drug. By introducing the photoswitch, the drug has two different states between which can be switched with light. Since both states have a different structure, {{the activity of the}} drug is different hence the 'on' and 'off' state of the drug [...] An example is photostatin, which is an inhibitor that can be switched on and off in vivo, to optically control microtubule dynamics.|$|E
5000|$|In his 1978 paper Krongauz {{coined the}} term “Quasi-Crystals” for the new self-organized {{colloidal}} particles [...] The Quasi-crystals are supramolecular aggregates manifesting both crystalline properties e.g. Bragg scattering, as well as amorphous, liquid-like properties i.e. drop-like shapes, fluidity, extensibility and elasticity in electric field. The supramolecular Quasi-crystals are produced in photochemical reaction by exposing solutions of photochromic <b>spiropyran</b> molecules to UV radiation. The ultraviolet light induces {{the conversion of the}} spiropyrans to merocyanine molecules that manifest electric dipole moments. (see Scheme 1). The quasi-crystals have external shape of submicron globules and their internal structure consists of crystals enveloped by an amorphous matter(see Fig. 1). The crystals are formed by self-assembled stacks of the merocyanine molecular dipoles aligning themselves in a parallel manner, while amorphous envelopes consist of the same merocyanine dipoles aligned in an anti-parallel manner (Fig.1, Scheme2). In an applied electrostatic field, quasi-crystals form macroscopic threads that show linear optical dichroism.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was the {{electrochemical}} study of photosensitive compounds and the fabrication of chemical dosimeters for ultraviolet protection. For this specific reason both sodium nitroprusside, a photosensitive compound and some photochromic <b>spiropyrans</b> with different substitutents in their benzopyram moiety were studied {{by means of the}} electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry. Polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fibers were used as working electrodes in all cases. The electrochemical behavior of sodium nitroprusside was examined in aqueous buffered solutions in pH range between 1. 0 and 12. 0. The cyclic voltammetric behavior of the <b>spiropyrans</b> was studied in solutions containing acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. From the obtained cyclic voltammograms we proposed satisfactory mechanism for their redox behavior on carbon fiber electrodes. Afterwards we fabricated chemical dosimeters from the dispersion of the photochromic <b>spiropyrans</b> into polystyrene, polycaprolactone and polycaprolactone-polyethylene succinates blends. The photochromic films were illuminated with ultraviolet light for different time periods in the presence and absence of an ultraviolet absorber and an antioxidant compound. The photochromic response of the polycaprolactone-polyethylene succinates blends revealed unexceptionable repeatability to fatigue. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a photochemically controlled photonic-crystal material by covalently attaching <b>spiropyran</b> derivatives to polymerized crystalline colloidal arrays (PCCAs). These PCCAs consist of colloidal particles that self-assemble into crystalline colloidal arrays (CCAs), which are embedded in crosslinked hydrogels. Photoresponsive PCCAs were made two ways: 1) [*]by functionalizing the hydrogel network with <b>spiropyran</b> derivatives, and 2) [*]by functionalizing the colloidal particles with <b>spiropyran</b> derivatives. These materials can diffract light in the UV, visible, or near-IR spectral regions. The diffraction of the PCCAs is red-shifted by exciting the <b>spiropyran</b> with UV light. Alternatively, the diffraction is blue-shifted by exciting the <b>spiropyran</b> with visible irradiation. Thus, this material acts as a memory storage material where information is recorded by illuminating the PCCA and information is read out by measuring the photonic-crystal diffraction wavelength. UV excitation forms the open <b>spiropyran</b> form while visible excitation forms the closed <b>spiropyran</b> form. The diffraction shifts result from changes in the free energy of mixing of the PCCA system as the <b>spiropyran</b> is photoexcited to its different stable forms...|$|E
