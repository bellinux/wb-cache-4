25|$|Another {{example is}} the work which was done on the {{methylation}} of elements such as sulfur, selenium, tellurium and polonium by living organisms.

For the sulfur work the isotope 35S was used, while for polonium 207Po was used. In some related work by the addition of 57Co to the bacterial culture, followed by isolation of the cobalamin from the bacteria (and the measurement of the radioactivity of the isolated cobalamin) it was shown that the bacteria convert available cobalt into methylcobalamin.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself. The most common and effective method is through antivenom (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake. Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent). In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, {{with the exception of}} the coral snake. To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse. The serum is separated and further purified and freeze-dried. It is reconstituted with <b>sterile</b> <b>water</b> and becomes antivenom. For this reason, people who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to antivenom. Antivenom for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.|$|E

2500|$|Equilibrium {{thermodynamic}} calculations {{predict that}} As(V) concentrations should {{be greater than}} As(III) concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions, i.e. where SO42− reduction is occurring. [...] However, abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow. Oxidation of As(III) by dissolved O2 is a particularly slow reaction. For example, Johnson and Pilson (1975) gave half-lives for the oxygenation of As(III) in seawater ranging from several months to a year. In other studies, As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation, again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates. Cherry found from experimental studies that the As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to 3 weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales. <b>Sterile</b> <b>water</b> samples have been observed to be less susceptible to speciation changes than non-sterile samples.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water.

Rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of Pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and <b>sterile</b> lake <b>water,</b> and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. Cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. Rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and <b>sterile</b> lake <b>water</b> and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. The abundance of Micrococcus flavus added to buffer and <b>sterile</b> lake <b>water</b> did not change, but the density of M. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. The abundance of R. leguminosarum fell in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer.

A microtiter plate assay was developed {{to evaluate the}} percentage of covered surface of the microtiter plate wells in different days from day 1 to day 69. Results All strains were able to develop biofilm in all the tested media. Middlebrook 7 H 9 showed the fastest growth, followed by <b>sterile</b> tap <b>water</b> and PBS- 5 % glucose. A sigmoid growth curve was detected in all the strains both in Middlebrook 7 H 9 and in <b>sterile</b> tap <b>water.</b> A difference could be detected for Mycobacterium abscessus in tap water, where it showed faster growth {{than all the other}} strains.
