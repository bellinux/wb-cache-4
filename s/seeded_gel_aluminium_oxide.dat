40|$|Frying oils (both {{vegetable}} oils and animal fats) degrade with use, {{and beyond the}} limits, the excessive free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide value (PV) and polar components preclude their further use in food applications, unless they can be purified by very effective adsorbent systems. In this study, four adsorbents: silica <b>gel,</b> activated carbon, <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> and acid-activated spent bleaching earth were used to reduce some of the poor quality parameters of the oils. Although pre-treatment of used frying oils with these adsorbents could improve the oil quality to a certain extent, the oils could only be used for non-food applications. The FFA and PV of the treated oils subjected to the above adsorbent treatment, were reduced as follows: 33. 3 % and 65. 1 %, 6. 5 % and 7. 8 %, 30. 2 % and 20. 8 %, and 11. 8 % and 46. 9 % respectively, and silica gel {{was found to be}} the most effective adsorbent.

40|$|<b>Oxides</b> {{containing}} <b>aluminium</b> and barium, optionally with chromium, are refractory {{with several}} possible industrial uses. A gel precursor of an oxide having the formula BaO. n(Al 2 xCr 2 yO 3), where 1 <n< 6. 6, (x+y) = 1 and 0 <y< 0. 5 was prepared by mixing {{a solution of}} a barium salt with a solution of an aluminium salt or a solution of an aluminium salt and a chromium III salt, then forming a gel which was fired to obtain the desired oxide. Filaments may be drawn as the gel is forming or extruded from a semi-rigid gel. FT-lR, XRD and 27 Al NMR studies showed that barium is not incorporated directly into the <b>gel</b> structure. Barium <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxides</b> were obtained only after liquefaction of barium species. A powder mixture suitable for firing to an oxide of the formula BaO. m [Al 2 xCr 2 y O 3] where 4. 6 <m< 6. 6, (x+y) = 1 and 0 <y< 0. 5 was prepared from source materials barium hydroxide, barium oxide, barium carbonate and barium mono-aluminate, alumina and/or a hydrated alumina and chromium III oxide, the relative amounts being varied to give the desired values of m and y on firing. A preferred oxide has the formula BaO. 6 Al 2 O 3 (m= 6 and y= 0). Strong ceramic shapes have been prepared from this. XRD studies of oxide compositions (n or m= 6 and y= 0) sintered at high temperature showed that barium mono-aluminate is a low-temperature intermediate phase.

25|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> is {{responsible}} for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering. Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin passivation layer of <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> (4nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface.

A number of alloys, such as aluminium bronzes, exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance. The <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> generated by anodising is typically amorphous, but discharge assisted oxidation processes such as plasma electrolytic oxidation result in a significant proportion of crystalline <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> in the coating, enhancing its hardness.|$|R

The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the thickness and the microstructure of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> layer on different three dental resin composite materials created by means of aerosol deposition. METHODS: Disk-shaped specimens were fabricated with three resin composites (Estenia C&B, Targis, and Gradia). The specimens were ground flat, and then subjected to aerosol deposition using <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> submicron particles without inducing a localized temperature rise. The average thickness (AVH) and maximum thickness (Hmax) of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> layer deposited on the resin composite material were measured using a profilometer. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc Tukey compromise test at alpha= 0. 05. The specimen surfaces were also observed using a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: The <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> layer formed on Estenia C&B (AVH 8. 1 mum, Hmax 9. 1 mum) and Targis (AVH 7. 7 mum, Hmax 8. 9 mum) were significantly thicker than that on Gradia (AVH 4. 2 mum, Hmax 5. 4 mum). The micrograph showed that the <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxide</b> layer on Estenia C&B was similar to that on Targis. However, the aerosol deposition area of Gradia was seen relatively rough and partly caved.
