5|$|The {{first step}} in fusion {{involves}} the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a <b>structural</b> <b>change,</b> exposing the chemokine receptor binding domains of gp120 and allowing them {{to interact with the}} target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{gradually}} to the north, the typhoon attained peak winds of 250km/h (155mph) on December1. Maintaining strength {{as a powerful}} system for several days, the storm remained over open waters. By December4, it began to weaken as upper-level winds became unfavorable and forced the cyclone to move northeast. Passing Japan well to the southeast that day, its large circulation brought increased winds to the Tokyo area and heavy rain and snow to parts of the nation. Ophelia soon underwent an extratropical transition as it raced over the open Pacific, completing this <b>structural</b> <b>change</b> by December6.

The railroad proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing the railroad came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by the railroad and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} the railroad.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the republic, Istanbul was {{overlooked}} in favor of Ankara, selected as Turkey's capital to distance the new, secular country from its Ottoman history. From the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great <b>structural</b> <b>change,</b> as new public squares, boulevards, and avenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of historical buildings. The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden, sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a creole with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages.

There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E
5|$|Kilham, Coldsmouth and Thompson's Walls, Howtel and Pawston {{were four}} of 15 townships {{in the ancient}} parish of Kirknewton, {{one of the largest}} parishes in England. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, parishes were grouped into unions: Glendale Poor Law Union was created in 1837.

The four townships became civil parishes in their own right, separate from Kirknewton but within the sanitary district, in 1866, and under the Local Government Act 1894 became part of Glendale Rural District.

5|$|Typhoon Longwang, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Maring, was the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone to impact China during the 2005 Pacific typhoon season. Longwang was first identified as a tropical depression on September25 north of the Mariana Islands. Moving along a general westward track, the system quickly intensified and reached typhoon status on September27. After reaching Category4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, adverse atmospheric conditions along with internal structural changes resulted in temporary weakening. The <b>structural</b> <b>change</b> culminated in Longwang becoming an annular typhoon and prompted re-intensification. The storm attained peak strength with winds of 175km/h (110mph) and a pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg) on October1 as it approached Taiwan. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island and further structural changes caused some weakening before the typhoon made landfall near Hualien City early on October2. Crossing the island in six hours, Longwang emerged over the Taiwan Strait before moving onshore again later that day, this time in Fujian Province, China as a minimal typhoon. Once over mainland China, the storm quickly weakened and ultimately dissipated late on October3.|$|E
5|$|On a {{westerly}} course toward Taiwan {{and eastern}} China, Longwang underwent {{a period of}} rapid intensification from September27–28. At {{the end of this}} phase, the JMA assessed peak winds at 155km/h (100mph) while the JTWC rated it as a Category4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. On September29, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned the typhoon the local name Maring as it entered their area of responsibility. The following day, Longwang underwent a <b>structural</b> <b>change,</b> transitioning from asymmetrical banding to symmetrical, making it an annular tropical cyclone. During the transition, upper-level divergence and outflow significantly decreased, resulting in temporary weakening of the typhoon. Additionally, an increase in westerly wind shear caused the interior structure to become asymmetric, with a southwest to northeast tilt noted by dropsondes released by the Dropwinsonde Observations for Typhoon Surveillance project. Once the transition into an annular cyclone completed, Longwang re-intensified and attained its peak intensity on October1 while situated 400km (250mi) south of Okinawa. The JMA assessed winds at 175km/h (110mph) along with a barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). The JTWC estimated Longwang to have been slightly stronger, with one-minute sustained winds of 230km/h (145mph).|$|E

Vidal admitted to William Morris in March 1959 that Fry rewrote as much as a third of the dialogue which Vidal had added to {{the first half of the}} script. Vidal made one <b>structural</b> <b>change</b> which was not revised, however. The Tunberg script had Ben-Hur and Messala reuniting and falling out in a single scene. Vidal broke the scene in two, so that the men first reunite at the Castle Antonia and then later argue and end their friendship at Ben-Hur's home. Vidal also added small character touches to the script, such as Messala's purchase of a brooch for Tirzah and Ben-Hur's purchase of a horse for Messala. Vidal claimed that he worked on the first half of the script (everything up to the chariot race), and scripted 10 versions of the scene where Ben-Hur confronts Messala and begs for his family's freedom.|$|E
40|$|New Keynesian Phillips curves (NKPC) have {{recently}} been modified to include additional lags of inflation in the specification in order to capture the considerable persistence in postwar U.

Our empirical results show multiple structural breaks in the NKPC in 1974 and 1982. Accounting for these <b>structural</b> <b>changes,</b> the backward-looking component is no longer significant throughout the whole sample period. In other words, the significant role of the backward-looking component in the earlier literature might be spuriously capturing the <b>structural</b> <b>changes</b> in the steady-state inflation rate. Thus, U. S. inflation dynamics are well explained by a pure NKPC if we take into account the possibility of <b>structural</b> <b>changes</b> in the steady-state inflation rate. ...|$|R
