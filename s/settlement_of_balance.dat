50|$|The New York Clearing House brought {{order to}} {{what had been a}} tangled web of exchanges. Specie {{certificates}} soon replaced gold as the means <b>of</b> settling <b>balances</b> at the Clearing House, further simplifying the process. Once certificates wereexchanged for gold deposited at member banks, porters encountered fewer of the dangers they had faced previously while transporting bags of gold from bank to bank. Certificates relieved the strain on the bank’s cash flow, thus reducing the likelihood of a run on deposits. Member banks had to do weekly audits, keep minimum reserve levels and log daily <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> which further assured more ordered, efficient exchanges.|$|R
40|$|The euro area's TARGET 2 {{payments}} {{system has}} featured heavily in academic and popular {{discussions of the}} euro crisis. Some of this commentary has described the system as being responsible for a secret bailout of Europe's periphery. Another common theme {{has been that the}} system has built up large credit risks for Germany should the euro break up. This paper discusses the TARGET 2 system, focusing in particular on how it impacts the <b>balance</b> sheets <b>of</b> the central banks that participate in the system. It discusses the factors driving TARGET 2 balances, considers some counterfactual cases in which euro area monetary policy operated differently, examines the risks to Germany and considers proposals for <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> these <b>balances...</b>|$|R
30|$|Apart from {{responses}} {{based on}} avoidance (which are conceptually irrelevant), choice-related responses align with {{the category of}} a dilemma (see Table  3). Compromise-related responses imply recognizing and attempting to accommodate competing demands but not at their full strength; this would entail finding a middle ground in the form <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> or <b>balance</b> (Jay 2013; Smith and Lewis 2011). In these cases, {{there is a tendency}} to reconcile and sacrifice some of one’s own needs: one party’s gain is another party’s loss. Following Table  3, this compromise aligns with the notion of a trade-off. Responses based on accepting and engaging tensions inherent in competing demands imply understanding contradiction, tension, and ambiguity as natural conditions of work (Lewis 2000). Doing so involves conceptualizing paradox in theory and accepting paradox in practice as a stimulus to the imagination of creative responses (Carlson et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Continuity and Renewal of the Monetary Debate. The {{central bank}} is major {{institution}} of market economies As {{the outcome of}} long evolutionary process the central bank is creation of the market not creation of the state. The modern transaction theory of money and payments systems coupled with historical evidence drawer from American British experiences can help show this basic result. Because interbank payments have to be centralized {{the best way to}} solve the trade-off between efficiency and security of payments is the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> clearing <b>balances</b> on the books of the central bank. This insight leads us to refuse the manicheism of hayekian doctrine with regard to the debate between Free Banking and Central Banking. Because it is the center of the payments system, the central bank has differentiated itself from other banks through learning process. Concern for systemic and global stability emerged in the Bank of England during the half century prior to World War I. The Bank developed both the lender of last resort principles and the guidance of the money market by bank rate in order to achieve convertibility. In the 20 th century powerful social and political trends have nationalized money. The prominence of convertibility has given way to economic policy However the monetary authorities must have legitimacy to carry out their responsabilities towards the general public. For this involvement to be credible the central bank shall not sup port any special interest group. Independence of central banks in the institutional implication of these requirements.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{safeguard}} power system security, Transmission System Operators {{are obliged to}} continuously maintain the balance between demand and supply of electrical power. To this end, they procure so-called balancing services. This thesis studies the design and integration <b>of</b> markets for <b>balancing</b> services in Europe. Contrary to previous academic work in this field, it approaches balancing markets from a broad perspective  i. e. as comprising the procurement <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> services and the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> imbalances  and {{takes into account the}} interrelationship between both components. The first part of this thesis focuses on the current  predominantly national  organisation <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> markets in Europe. It identifies and analyses main design parameters and puts forward an appropriate market design based thereon. This design proposal ensures both market-based balancing service procurement prices and cost-reflective imbalance prices. The second part of this thesis considers the implementation <b>of</b> cross-border <b>balancing</b> markets. It first discusses different implementation proposals and qualitatively assesses the benefits and implementation costs they each may entail using a self-developed framework. It further proposes methodologies to quantitatively assess the welfare gains of implementing cross-border procurement as well as the welfare distorting impact <b>of</b> implementing cross-border <b>settlement</b> in case <b>of</b> structurally differing imbalance settlement methods. Both methodologies are applied to the Belgian-Dutch border. nrpages: 159 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the types}} of {{population}} movement model, in the paper is determined the extent of demographic processes that influenced the formation of functional urban regions in Serbia. Demographic processes expressed by immigration-emigration and the natural component of the population development in the <b>settlements</b> <b>of</b> the Republic of Serbia from 1981 to 2002, aimed to identify spatial, demographic and functional changes and determine the degree of spatial differentiation of the Republic of Serbia through respecting the specificity of its territorial parts. Especially is emphasized the period from 1991 to 2002 when Republic of Serbia had a demographic decline in its entirety, with certain differences in the spatial manifestation {{but also in the}} intensity of relationship between natural and migration component of regional areas of the country. In Vojvodina, the migration balance had high values with whom he was able to compensate the consequences of negative natural growth. In the <b>settlements</b> <b>of</b> central Serbia the low values <b>of</b> migration <b>balance</b> even more emphasized negative natural increase, which together reflected on the overall demographic decline at the national level. Functional urban regions are recognized as the instruments <b>of</b> <b>balanced</b> regional development <b>of</b> Serbia. Generally are given the possible directions of further functional spatial development that could perspectively influence the rational organization of the territory of the Republic of Serbia.
