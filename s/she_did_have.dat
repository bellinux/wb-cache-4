5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer. At age27, she became obsessed with ballet, which she had studied as a girl. She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a fair degree of talent. But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife's desire to become a professional dancer, considering it a waste of time.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, when The Beatles had to {{pose for}} the {{photograph}} for the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover, Lennon asked Mona if he could borrow the war medals {{her father had been}} given in India to wear for the photo session. Although still upset at the way her son was dismissed from The Beatles, Mona agreed, and the medals were then returned, along with a Cash Box trophy that is in the letter 'L' of THE BEATLES flower-sign on the cover. Mona never opened another club, or engaged in another business venture, although <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> paying guests at her house, which she shared with her bed-ridden mother and her sons after she and Best parted. Mona {{died of a heart attack}} on 9 October 1988, after a long illness.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, guest stars included actor and comedian Patrick Bristow, animator, executive producer, animation director, storyboard artist and producer Butch Hartman (who played Mr. Weed, Peter's boss, and various other characters), writer Gary Janetti who played the Demon and Riff), actor John O'Hurley (who played the Cult Leader), and Waylon Jennings (who played himself). Recurring cast members included Mike Henry who played Cleveland Brown and Lori Alan who played Dianne Simons. This is the first episode Seth MacFarlane's sister, Rachael MacFarlane guest starred in the episode {{as the voice of}} Jennifer. In future episodes she would become a recurring voice actor for the series. Rachel has noted that she was asked by Seth to lend her voice for the show, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> to audition for the role.|$|E

5|$|She {{owned the}} winners of {{approximately}} 500 races. Her distinctive colours of blue with buff stripes were carried by horses such as Special Cargo, {{the winner of the}} 1984 Whitbread Gold Cup, and Devon Loch, which spectacularly halted just short of the winning post at the 1956 Grand National and whose jockey Dick Francis later had a successful career as the writer of racing-themed detective stories. Peter Cazalet was her trainer for over 20 years. Although (contrary to rumour) she never placed bets, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence, Clarence House, so she could follow the races. As an art collector, she purchased works by Claude Monet, Augustus John and Peter Carl Fabergé, among others.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} half of the thirties, Minnie did not appear as often in Mickey cartoons. This was mainly due to the growth in {{popularity}} of Mickey's new sidekicks, Goofy, Donald Duck, and Pluto, whose appearances in Mickey cartoons had more or less replaced Minnie's role. Minnie's appearances in Mickey cartoons thus became less numerous, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a few major roles in some Pluto and Figaro cartoons during the 1940s. Minnie made a sort of comeback in the 1980s when she was re-introduced in Mickey's Christmas Carol and then got her own starring role in Totally Minnie.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{as a child}} {{that she had a}} drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with {{the ups and downs of}} the business… As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

25|$|The San Francisco Bay Area Reporter, Inc., a free weekly {{newspaper}} serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) {{communities in the}} area, {{were one of the}} first to comment on their discontent with the matter:We have repeatedly voiced our displeasure over the transgender/lesbian storyline between Zarf/Zoe and Bianca. We disagree with the basic premise, Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman (and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a one-night stand with Leslie on New Year’s Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We don’t want her already messy love life in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasn’t sure she was even queer and then left her for another woman). We don’t want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.|$|E
25|$|She {{was from}} the outset {{considered}} to have great promise, but it was nevertheless {{difficult for her to}} win the leading roles from more established actors such as Zelma Hedin, Charlotta Almlöf, and Fanny Westerdahl, the stars of the 1850s. She had a brief affair with the Crown Prince, the future Charles XV of Sweden, who advised her to marry Daniel Hwasser, the secretary of the royal theatres direction, which oversaw the royal theatre. She took the Crown Prince's advice and married Hwasser in 1858, after which he was made director of the theatre. The fact that Elise Hwasser was suddenly awarded leading roles did not go unnoticed in the press: during her husband's short period as director of the theatre, she played all the leading female parts. Although this may very well have been the result of nepotism, it is equally clear that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> talent as an actress – a talent that she was now able to demonstrate. Proof of this is provided by the fact that, after her husband had been dismissed as a director and her royal lover had acquired a new mistress, she nevertheless continued to play the leading female parts. Whatever means she had employed, she had now proven herself and, for the next thirty years, she played the leading female role in well over one hundred and fifty performances.|$|E
500|$|Sergeant Reckless was {{chestnut}} colored with a blaze {{and three}} white stockings. Her {{date of birth}} and parentage are unconfirmed, but she {{was estimated to be}} around three or four years old when she was purchased by members of the United States Marine Corps in October 1952. She was sold to the Marines by her owner, a young Korean stableboy called Kim Huk Moon, though that was not his real name. The horse was originally named [...] in Korean, which translates to [...] "Morning Flame" [...] or [...] "Flame-of-the-Morning", also reputed to be the name of her dam, a racehorse at the track in Seoul.

500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E
500|$|After Valiant was {{commissioned}} {{she became the}} First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland, where she remained until 1885, an experience unique among the British ironclads, although <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> one break to have new boilers installed. From June to August 1878 the ship formed part of the Particular Service Squadron {{at the time of}} the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War, and sailed up the Dardanelles under the command of Admiral Hornby. On 20 July 1884 Valiant was accidentally rammed by the ironclad [...] in Lough Swilly, damaging her hull and tearing off her boats, davits and fittings on one side of the ship. Valiant was paid off in 1885, and saw no further front-line service; lying for thirteen years in a partially dismantled state at Devonport. In 1897 she was assigned to the HMS Indus stoker training establishment, briefly losing her name, before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904. The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III. She was offered for sale in 1922, but there were no takers so that she was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze, where she remained until 1956. Valiant was sold in that year to Belgian ship breakers and towed to Bruges on 8 December 1956.|$|E
500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it gave me a chance to let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E
