500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting at the desk would say to the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] looking around the room (he was later removed). There were also suspended conveyor baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms [...] "repairing" [...] a rocket, and a <b>security</b> <b>scanner</b> that flashed [...] "REJECT" [...] after scanning guests.A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E

40|$|Security {{scanning}} {{performed on}} computer systems {{is an important}} step to identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in an enterprise network, before they are exploited by mali-cious intruders. An effective vulnerability assessment architecture should assimilate knowl-edge from multiple security knowledge sources to discover all the security problems present on a host. Legitimate concerns arise since host-based <b>security</b> <b>scanners</b> typically need to run at administrative privileges, and takes input from external knowledge sources for the analysis. Intentionally or otherwise, ill-formed input may compromise the scanner and the whole system if the scanner is susceptible to, or carries one or more vulnerability itself. It is not easy to incorporate new security analysis tools and/or various security knowlege-bases in the conventional approach, since this would entail installing new agents on every host in the enterprise network. This report presents an architecture where a host-based <b>security</b> <b>scanner’s</b> code base can be minimized to an extent where its correctness can be verified by adequate vetting. At the same time, the architecture also allows for leveraging third-party security knowledge more efficiently and makes it easier to incorporate new se...|$|R
