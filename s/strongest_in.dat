2500|$|From its {{inception}} R has been criticised {{for being an}} agency not answerable {{to the people of}} India (R reports to Prime Minister only). Fears arose that it could turn into the KGB of India. Such fears were kept at bay by the R's able leadership (although detractors of R and especially the Janata Party have accused the agency of letting itself be used for terrorising and intimidating opposition during the 1975–1977 Emergency). The main controversy which has plagued R in recent years is over bureaucratisation of the system with allegations about favouritism in promotions, corruption, ego clashes, no financial accountability, inter-departmental rivalry etc. R also suffers from ethnic imbalances in the officer level. Noted security analyst and former Additional Secretary B. Raman has criticised the agency for its asymmetric growth; [...] "while being <b>strong</b> <b>in</b> its capability for covert action it is weak in its capability for intelligence collection, analysis and assessment. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> low and medium-grade intelligence, weak <b>in</b> high-grade intelligence. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> technical intelligence, weak <b>in</b> human intelligence. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> collation, weak <b>in</b> analysis. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> investigation, weak <b>in</b> prevention. <b>Strong</b> <b>in</b> crisis management, weak in crisis prevention." ...|$|R

Additionally, China's needs are changing as the economy matures, its acute focus on energy is lessening as energy prices plunge, renewables energy comes online, and major energy producers ramp up. At the same time, China's need for markets for its manufacturing base is growing especially as overcapacity issues bite and US and Japan are intent on wrestling away markets in favor of other less developed nations via trade pacts like Trans-Pacific Partnership.|$|R

Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E

5|$|Kruger's final {{administration}} was, Meintjes suggests, the <b>strongest</b> <b>in</b> {{the history}} of the republic. He had the former Free State President FW Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as Envoy Extraordinary in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from this point on.|$|E

In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the <b>strongest</b> <b>in</b> the antebellum South.|$|E

Despite the Moderate Party getting its highest share of the vote since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1921, Reinfeldt's government was reduced to a minority government, owing to the rise of Sweden Democrats; but he remained in power as the first centre-right Prime Minister since the Swedish-Norwegian Union to be re-elected.|$|E
