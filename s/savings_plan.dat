The Rjukan situation, as it was named in the press, became a source of conflict between the local community and Norsk Hydro; initially 250 jobs were to be moved to Herøya, but in 1964 Norsk Hydro applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Herøya—what would become the death sentence for the Rjukan Line. Permission for the construction of the power line was granted in 1968. Production of fertilizer was moved to Herøya and Glomfjord, and Rjukan transferred to production of kalkammonsalpeter in 1963 and ammonium nitrate in 1964.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} data from INSEE’s  2004  household assets survey (Enquête Patrimoine) to {{highlight}} the determinants of holding a contractual financial <b>saving</b> <b>plan</b> to provide supplementary income, distinguishing between working and retired households. Our {{results suggest that the}} profiles of individuals holding certain types of contractual <b>saving</b> <b>plans</b> (retirement <b>saving</b> and life insurance) are determined by factors common to workers and retirees, and tend to confirm behaviour of saving for retirement. Factoring in occupational status reveals specific profiles that suggest that private-sector workers are disadvantaged, particularly with regard to retirement saving. The discrepancy between the public and the private sector in terms of the supplementary retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plans</b> available is a potential source of inequality in terms of household participation in these schemes. The overlap between holding retirement savings and holding alternative savings (life insurance, employee <b>saving</b> <b>plans)</b> in preparation for old age indicates that altruism and a wish to make inter-generational transfers are among the motivations of holders of annuity products, since a significant proportion hold supplementary death insurance. The need to save for retirement via a non-occupational plan is lessened by the availability of a company retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plan,</b> which households with high incomes and financial assets are the most likely to hold. Employee <b>saving</b> <b>plans,</b> which are the only type of <b>saving</b> <b>plan</b> open to younger cohorts of households, are complementary to company retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

Since being appointed by President Bush, Saul pushed for more rigorous audits of TSP operations.

2500|$|Some federal, state, {{local and}} {{education}} government employees pay no Social Security but {{have their own}} retirement, disability systems that nearly always pay much better retirement and disability benefits than Social Security. These plans typically requires vesting—working for 5–10 years for the same employer before becoming eligible for retirement. But their retirement typically only depends on {{the average of the}} best 3–10 years salaries times some retirement factor (typically 0.875%-3.0%) times years employed. This retirement benefit can be a [...] "reasonably good" [...] (75–85% of salary) retirement at close to the monthly salary they were last employed at. For example, if a person joined the University of California retirement system at age 25 and worked for 35 years they could receive 87.5% (2.5% × 35) of their average highest three year salary with full medical coverage at age 60. Police and firemen who joined at 25 and worked for 30 years could receive 90% (3.0% × 30) of their average salary and full medical coverage at age 55. These retirements have cost of living adjustments (COLA) applied each year but are limited to a maximum average income of $350,000/year or less. Spousal survivor benefits are available at 100–67% of the primary benefits rate for 8.7% to 6.7% reduction in retirement benefits, respectively. UCRP retirement and disability plan benefits are funded by contributions from both members and the university (typically 5% of salary each) and by the compounded investment earnings of the accumulated totals. These contributions and earnings are held in a trust fund that is invested. The retirement benefits are much more generous than Social Security but are believed to be actuarially sound. The main difference between state and local government sponsored retirement systems and Social Security is that the state and local retirement systems use compounded investments that are usually heavily weighted in the stock market securities—which historically have returned more than 7.0%/year on average despite some years with losses. Short term federal government investments may be [...] "more" [...] secure but pay much lower average percentages. Nearly all other federal, state and local retirement systems work in a similar fashion with different benefit retirement ratios. Some plans are now combined with Social Security and are [...] "piggy backed" [...] on top of Social Security benefits.
