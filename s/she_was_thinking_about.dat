[...] They have since began to inch closer and {{he gave her a}} job offer for Jabot Cosmetics. Luke Kerr from Daytime Confidential recapped the storyline, [...] "At Jabot, Leslie told Neil she couldn’t accept his job offerbecause <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> him as a man. She told him it would be inappropriate for them to end up in a relationship if they were working together. Neil finally convinced her that if they had an overwhelming urge to date, he would fire her. Leslie accepted the job." [...] In December 2012, Redaric Williams was introduced to the series as her brother Tyler Michaelson, Leslie's first family member to appear on the soap opera. Williams told Soap Opera Digest that although Tyler is [...] "impatient", he gets along with his sister [...] "really well" [...] and they are [...] "very comfortable with each other".|$|E
50|$|Marcel waits downstairs for Pierre {{to return}} home and shoots him three times. Marcel then flees, but is shot dead by police. Séverine's husband survives, but is left in a coma. The police are {{unable to find a}} motive for the {{attempted}} murder. Sometime later Séverine is at home taking care of Pierre, who is now completely paralyzed and in a wheelchair. Husson visits Pierre to tell him the truth about his wife's secret life; she does not try to stop him. Afterwards, in an ambiguous ending, Séverine is amazed when Pierre suddenly gets out of his wheel chair and pours himself a drink. He asks what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>She</b> admits that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{very good}} plan too," [...] said Marian, laughing; [...] "but I am afraid poor Selina cannot be in such good hands. See, here are the impertinent people writing verses about her, {{as if they had}} any {{business}} to ask her what <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b> Listen, Gerald; did you ever hear such stuff?" ...|$|R
500|$|In the song, Bedingfield {{discusses}} a woman's {{fight to}} stop herself from rushing into relationships {{in an effort}} to find the right man to father her children. Bedingfield stated that she does not want to have children at this point in time, but that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. According to her, [...] "the song is about pacing yourself and taking everything slowly." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album. It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that one thing you can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E
2500|$|After leaving Morgan, Kiki {{immediately}} {{starts a}} romance with Michael. The pairing would pair Alderson {{back with her}} real-life boyfriend Chad Duell whom she worked with as Starr. Alderson worried about how fans would react to Kiki and Michael's relationship because Starr and Kiki are so different and [...] "it was interesting to see Michael with Kiki" [...] who is a lot less refined than Starr. However, the romance doesn't get much development, and ends a year later when Michael dumps Kiki after discovering she has been keeping quiet about Sonny's part {{in the murder of}} his biological father, A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan). Hayley Erin later said, [...] "When she was with Michael, I don't think <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Michael." [...] While she was definitely fully invested in the relationship, Kiki also had feelings for Morgan. [...] "Michael wouldn't be good for her now." [...] However, Erin said Kiki and Michael [...] "will always have a special relationship whether or not either of them acknowledge it." [...] While she is no longer in love with Michael, [...] "she's always going to have love for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Grewgious had by {{this time}} grown so very mysterious, that Rosa {{did not know how}} to go on. While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it Mr. Grewgious {{suddenly}} jerked out of himself for the second time: ...|$|E

Effy returns to college and lets Freddie know he's the one <b>she's</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> all summer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Frightful lot {{of things}} aren't settled," [...] said Ann Veronica. In addition, the Fadden Dance business, all out of proportion, {{occupied}} the whole foreground of her thoughts and threw a color of rebellion over everything. She kept thinking <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Manning's proposal of marriage and finding {{she was thinking of}} the dance.|$|E
60|$|It {{was exactly}} {{what he might have}} expected, what indeed had been {{at the back of his}} mind all along, and on the whole he was glad. Naturally she hesitated; {{naturally}} she wanted time to think, and as naturally it was impossible for her to tell him what it was <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's utterly {{out of the}} question," [...] said Aunt Janet seriously. When Aunt Janet said seriously that {{anything}} {{was out of the}} question it meant that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it, and would probably end up by doing it. If a thing really {{was out of the question}} she merely laughed and refused to discuss it at all.|$|E

5000|$|Banks {{has said}} that the {{inspiration}} for Modelland happened one day while she driving down on a street in New York City. <b>She</b> had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> why supermodels <b>are</b> [...] "super" [...] and the idea of Modelland came to mind.|$|R
60|$|I {{could give}} Euphemia no clue. I {{supposed}} {{there was some}} mistake, {{and that was all}} I could say, except that I was sleepy, and that we could find out all about it in the morning. But Euphemia could not dismiss the subject from her mind. She said no more,--but I could see--until I fell asleep--that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about,</b> as I glanced in admiring silence {{at the little}} soft hand travelling up the row of buttons on my coat, and at the clustering hair that lay against my breast, and at the lashes of her downcast eyes, slightly rising as they followed her idle fingers. At length her eyes were lifted up to mine, and she stood on tiptoe to give me, more thoughtfully than usual, that precious little kiss--once, twice, three times--and {{went out of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|Nature {{seemed to}} suggest, too, that Isobel's {{thoughts}} {{were with him}} at that moment; that she was uncommonly near to him in soul if not in body; that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{him as he was}} thinking about her, and saying much the same things to herself as he was saying to himself. Indeed, he even began a whispered conversation with her, of a sort he would not have ventured upon had she been there, pausing between the sentences for her answers, which, as he imagined them, were very satisfactory indeed.|$|E
25|$|Her {{sacrifice}} apparently {{will come}} into play as Oreadia initiates her unknown plan. Syndra is most likely the evil force to be awoken by nourishing on Yuri, as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> seen <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> thanking her host for her revival.|$|R
5000|$|In Yubi-ori Kazoeru Onna ( [...] , [...] "Woman {{counting}} {{with her}} fingers"), a woman counts {{something on the}} fingers of her right hand.

50|$|Alice is a {{sweet and}} {{attractive}} girl. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> always <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the {{well being of}} others. However, due to a mishap when Lapan came to the Human Realm, she {{ended up in the}} body arranged for him, a skeleton.|$|R
60|$|Little Dorrit's lover {{very soon}} laid down his penny on the tollplate of the Iron Bridge, and came upon it looking about {{him for the}} {{well-known}} and well-beloved figure. At first he feared she was not there; but as he walked on towards the Middlesex side, he saw her standing still, looking at the water. She was absorbed in thought, and he wondered what she might be thinking about. There were the piles of city roofs and chimneys, more free from smoke than on week-days; {{and there were the}} distant masts and steeples. Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|Lydia, on her part, {{acknowledged}} {{no obligation}} to entertain her guest by chatting, and enjoyed her thoughts and her dinner in silence. Alice began to be fascinated by her, and to wonder what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b> She fancied that the footman was not quite free from the same influence. Even the butler might have been meditating himself {{to sleep on the}} subject. Alice felt tempted to offer her a penny for her thoughts. But she dared not be so familiar as yet. And, had the offer been made and accepted, butler, footman, and guest would have been plunged into equal confusion by the explanation, which would have run thus: ...|$|E
60|$|And then Susan {{hardly knew}} how to behave herself with her {{accepted}} suitor. She {{felt that she was}} very happy; but perhaps she was most happy when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> him through the long day, assisting in fixing little things for his comfort, and waiting for his evening return. And as he sat there in the parlour, she could be happy then too, if she were but allowed to sit still and look at him,--not stare at him, but raise her eyes every now and again to his face for the shortest possible glance, as she had been used to do ever since he came there.|$|E
60|$|Taylor {{looked up}} at his wife. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> too much <b>about</b> it, the last few months. They all were.|$|R

6000|$|Mother didn't know of {{his mental}} struggles. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> more <b>about</b> her feet. She looked up with mild astonishment when, {{as they left}} the town by the highroad southward, Father burst out, [...] "I'll play if I want to, but I can't stand the gawping gumps here." ...|$|R
60|$|Marilla, {{walking home}} one late April evening from an Aid meeting, {{realized}} that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails {{to bring to the}} oldest and saddest {{as well as to the}} youngest and merriest. Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings. She probably imagined that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the Aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room, but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the declining sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook, of still, crimson-budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool, of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod. The spring was abroad in the land and Marilla's sober, middle-aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep, primal gladness.|$|E
50|$|Eye {{movement}} desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) {{is a form}} {{of psychotherapy}} developed and studied by Francine Shapiro. She had noticed that, when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> disturbing memories herself, her eyes were moving rapidly. When she brought her eye movements under control while thinking, the thoughts were less distressing.|$|E

6000|$|He {{pursed his}} lips, but made no {{immediate}} answer, for Helen was still slightly inattentive. <b>She</b> had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Rachel and {{which of the}} two young men <b>she</b> <b>was</b> likely to fall in love with, and now sitting opposite to Hirst she thought, [...] "He's ugly. It's a pity they're so ugly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, if you'd heard her--She couldn't talk of {{anything}} except this Tyson, {{and what his}} wife did to him. She talked of it sort of sad, kind of regretful, as if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sorry, but felt {{that it had to}} be. I could see <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it a whole lot.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{carrying}} {{plates and}} cups from the cupboard as she spoke, {{so that her}} sentences were more than usually broken apart. Mary could not help looking at the odd little priestess of humanity with something like admiration. While <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> herself, Mrs. Seal had thought of nothing but her vision.|$|R
