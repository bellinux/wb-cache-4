40|$|<b>Slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> are {{considered}} a high risk group for zoonotic disease due to increased contact with animals, animal products and excreta. Globally, <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> {{have been shown to}} have an increased seroprevalence to zoonotic pathogens, though no such studies exist in Kenya. <b>Slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> may also act as reservoirs of these zoonotic organisms and asymptomatic carriage of pathogenic bacteria has been demonstrated. This study aimed to determine the carriage of enteropathogens in <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> in rural western Kenya and to determine if there was asymptomatic carriage of Staphylococcus aureus specifically Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA). This study was conducted in the Lake Victoria Crescent region of western Kenya. Five hundred <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> from this region were asked a comprehensive questionnaire regarding risk factors for zoonotic disease, faecal samples were collected for examination and culture and a nasal swab was cultured for S. aureus. This study reports on the seroprevalence of Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, pathogenic Escherichia coli and Campylobacter spp. in these individuals as well as reporting the nasal carriage of S. aureus and MRSA. This is the first community based study regarding S. aureus and MRSA in Kenya. The asymptomatic carriage of these organisms in <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> highlights a reservoir that may be important in the dissemination of these pathogens. The study further comments on the risk factors for infection with these pathogens and suggestions are made for simple hygiene interventions that can reduce disease in <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> and dissemination to the wider communit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the distribution of Shiga toxin (Stx) gene-positive stool samples from dairy farmer and <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> in Gyeonggi-Do province. MethodsA total of 621 samples from healthy farmers and 198 samples from <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) infection on stool samples. ResultsThe PCR product of Stx-encoding genes was detected in 21 (3. 4 %) of 621 farmers and 15 (7. 6 %) of 198 slaughterhouse workers’ stool samples. Distribution of the Stx PCR positive workers by age increment revealed an increase in STEC infection with age increment in both workers. Distribution of the Stx PCR positive workers by working years revealed an increase in STEC infection with working years in farmers. ConclusionThese results of the study show that <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> are at higher risk of STEC infection than farmers. In addition, <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> have a more potential source of food contamination of STEC and transmission...|$|R

Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 478 blood samples from people living in rural areas (n = 292) and 186 <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> were screened by slide agglutination and microplate agglutination tests. Seropositive specimens were analyzed with Elisa for IgG and IgM antibody. Results: Seroprevalence of brucellosis among <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> and the people living in rural areas were 9. 8 % (n = 18) and 5. 5 % (n = 16), respectively (p = 0. 04).

IgG antibodies titer was higher than IgM in seropositive cases of the <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> and the people living in rural areas. Conclusions: Seroprevalence of brucellosis in <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> was higher than people living in rural areas.

40|$|Objective: Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a viral {{zoonotic}} disease. Butchers and <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> {{are considered}} to be high risk occupational groups for the disease.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the seroprevalence of CCHF and risk factors for seropositivity among them in Sistan and Baluchistan province in 2011. Methods: Questionnaire data and blood sample collection were carried out for each participant and the sera samples were sent to the national reference laboratory for ELISA IgG testing. Results: In this study, the seroprevalence of CCHF among 190 butchers and <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> from 11 counties was 16. 49 %. 79 % of participants were aware that they were at risk of zoonosis and 39. 7 % did not use any personal protective equipment during their work. Of 31 CCHF IgG positive individuals in this study, eleven individuals had a previous record of CCHF infection in 57 months prior to the study.

40|$|Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a {{zoonotic}} arbovirus affecting {{livestock and}} people. This {{study was conducted}} in western Kenya where RVFV outbreaks have not previously been reported. The aims were to document the seroprevalence and risk factors for RVFV antibodies in a community-based sample from western Kenya and compare this with <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> in the same region who are considered a high-risk group for RVFV exposure. The {{study was conducted in}} western Kenya between July 2010 and November 2012. Individuals were recruited from randomly selected homesteads and a census of slaughterhouses. Structured questionnaire tools were used to collect information on demographic data, health, and risk factors for zoonotic disease exposure. Indirect ELISA on serum samples determined seropositivity to RVFV. Risk factor analysis for RVFV seropositivity was conducted using multi-level logistic regression. A total of 1861 individuals were sampled in 384 homesteads. The seroprevalence of RVFV in the community was 0. 8 % (95 % CI 0. 5 – 1. 3). The variables significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity in the community were increasing age (OR 1. 2; 95 % CI 1. 1 – 1. 4, p< 0. 001), and slaughtering cattle at the homestead (OR 3. 3; 95 % CI 1. 0 – 10. 5, p = 0. 047). A total of 553 <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> were sampled in 84 ruminant slaughterhouses. The seroprevalence of RVFV in <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> was 2. 5 % (95 % CI 1. 5 – 4. 2).

This study investigated and compared the epidemiology of RVFV between community members and <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> in western Kenya. The data demonstrate that slaughtering animals is a risk factor for RVFV seropositivity and that <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>workers</b> are a high-risk group for RVFV seropositivity in this environment.

50|$|Charles Burnett's first {{full-length}} {{feature film}} Killer of Sheep {{was written for}} his UCLA master's thesis. The black and white film took Burnett five years to finish, apparently due to the imprisonment {{of one of the}} film's actors. The low-budget film was finally released to the public in 1978. The cast consisted mainly of his friends and film colleagues and was filmed primarily with a handheld camera, seemingly in documentary style. The main character was played by Henry G. Sanders, a Vietnam veteran who had studied cinema at Los Angeles City College and was enrolled in several classes at UCLA as well. Since his performance in the movie, Sanders has gone on to a career in films and TV, including roles in Rocky Balboa, ER, Miami Vice, and The West Wing. The lead female character in Killer of Sheep was played by Kaycee Moore, who later went on to act in former UCLA classmate Julie Dash's film Daughters of the Dust. The story follows the protagonist Stan, a <b>slaughterhouse</b> <b>worker,</b> who struggles to make enough money to support his family. According to the film's website, the movie “offers no solutions; it merely presents life”. Killer of Sheep revolves around rituals, in the family, childhood, oppression, and resistance to oppression. The soundtrack of ballads, jazz, and blues includes artists Faye Adams, Dinah Washington, Gershwin, Rachmaninov, Paul Robeson, and Earth Wind & Fire. The film was only screened occasionally because of its poor 16mm print quality and failed to find widespread distribution due to the cost and complexity of securing music rights. It was recently restored by the UCLA Film & Television archive in a new 35mm print of much higher quality. The re-released film won an array of awards including the critics' award at the Berlin International Film Festival, first place at the Sundance Film Festival in the 1980s, then called the USA Film Festival, and a Special Critics' Award from the 2007 New York Film Critics Circle. It was also recognized as a national treasure and included among the first 50 films entered in the National Film Registry for its historical importance by the Library of Congress in 1990. In addition, it was chosen as one of the 100 Essential Films of All Time by the National Society of Film Critics in 2002.
