40|$|The {{trend of}} {{pesticide}} consumption in Japan was examined {{as a function}} of time using the data published in the 2 ̆ 2 Noyaku Yoran 2 ̆ 2 (Handbook of Agricultural chemicals). A special reference was made to the technological progress of pesticides after 1970 s and to the accompanying change in pesticide quality and price increase. In contrast to the previously conceptualized general view of excessive and increasing use of pesticides in Japanese agriculture, the total amount of pesticide consumption in terms of active ingredient has been more or less stable, or rather shows a decreasing trend. The trend, however, was found to consist of two contrasting facets, i. e; an increase particuraly noted in the use of <b>soil</b> <b>disinfectants</b> and a decrease {{in the use of the}} other compounds which took place as a result of decreased farm land and change in pesticide quality that exerts higher activity with less amount. 我が国における農薬消費動向について, 主に昭和 40 年代中期以降の農薬に関わる法規制の強化と技術進歩, それらに伴う有効成分を中心とした農薬の質的変化, 価格上昇, さらに農薬に特有な有効成分ベースの分析の必要性などを考慮しつつ, 『農薬要覧』を用い, 時系列的に再吟味を行った. 総体としては, 従来の一般的見解であった「農薬多投化」は必ずしも進展しておらず, 農薬消費は横這いから減少傾向にある. また, この傾向は, 土壌消毒剤の特異的な増加傾向とその他の剤の質的変化を伴った減少傾向という二面性の総和として理解できる...|$|R
40|$|Methyl bromide is {{a widely}} used <b>soil</b> <b>disinfectant</b> that, because of its ozone {{depleting}} properties, is being phased out in the EC by 2005.   Soil steaming is a well-established system of soil disinfestation and is increasingly seen as a viable option to methyl bromide replacement.   Traditional glasshouse steaming techniques create {{a number of problems}} because it involves treatment of soil with high-temperature (100 - 140 °C) steam for up to eight hours or more.   This not only eliminates unwanted soil-borne pests and diseases, but also creates a ‘biological vacuum’, in which target pests and pathogens may quickly re-enter and luxuriate, perpetuating the need for regular disinfestation.    Soil steaming at lower temperatures, e. g. at 70 °C, does not normally result in these unwanted side effects, because of the partial survival of the saprophytic microflora population. In this study agricultural soil samples, containing a range of important soil-borne pests and pathogens, were treated with steam in a specially designed laboratory steam-rig.   It was found that treatment at 60 °C, for a duration of only 3 minutes plus eight minutes ‘resting’ (“low-temperature/short duration soil steaming”) was enough to 100 % kill soil-borne fungal pathogens Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Sclerotium cepivorum, Verticillium dahlia e and Pythium ultimum;  potato cyst nematodes Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida, and weeds Chenopodium album and Agropyron repens. When low temperature/short duration soil steaming was compared with a chemical <b>soil</b> <b>disinfectant,</b> using the fumigant dazomet (Basamid) at a rate of 760 kg/ha, both disinfestation methods resulted in 100 % elimination of the above pathogens, nematodes and weeds and caused IGR (Increased Growth Response) of lettuce plants. In a further study, using four different soil types at three different matric potentials, it was found that efficacy of low-temperature/short duration steaming is dependent on soil type and soil moisture content, and that treatment of soil in a moist state is more effective than treatment in a dry state, especially when treating fine-textured sand and loam soils. Soil samples containing survival structures of soil pests were also treated with ozone gas in a specially designed ozone treatment chamber, but this did not result in elimination of target organisms.

40|$|Methylisothiocyanate (MITC) is {{the main}} {{degradation}} product of metam sodium, a <b>soil</b> <b>disinfectant</b> widely used in agriculture, and is responsible for its disinfectant properties. Because MITC is highly toxic and volatile, metam sodium has to be applied {{in a manner that}} tries to reduce atmospheric emissions but still maintains adequate concentration of MITC in soil to ensure its disinfectant effect. Thus, monitoring of MITC concentrations in soil is required, and to this end sensitive, fast, and reliable analytical methods must be developed. In this work, a headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) method was developed for MITC determination in water and soil samples using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS–MS) with a triple-quadrupole analyzer. Two MS–MS transitions were acquired to ensure the reliable quantification and confirmation of the analyte. The method had linear behavior in the range tested (0. 026 – 2. 6 ng mL− 1 in water, 1 – 100 ng g− 1 in soil) with r 2 over 0. 999. Detection limits were 0. 017 ng mL− 1 and 0. 1 ng g− 1 in water and soil, respectively. Recoveries for five replicates were in the range 76 – 92 %, and RSD was below 7 % at the two spiking levels tested for each matrix (0. 1 and 1 ng mL− 1 for water, 4 and 40 ng g− 1 for soil). The potential of using multiple HS-SPME for analyzing soil samples was also investigated, and its feasibility for quantification of MITC evaluated. The developed HS-SPME method was applied to soil samples from experimental plots treated with metam sodium following good agriculture practices...|$|E
40|$|Nurseries {{producing}} {{apple and}} rose rootstock plants, apple orchards {{as well as}} rose production often experience replanting problems after several cultivations at the same site when a chemical <b>soil</b> <b>disinfectant</b> is not applied. The etiology of apple and rose replanting problems is most likely caused by soil-borne pathogen complex, defined as “replant disease (RD) ”. Symptoms typical of RD are reduced shoot and root growth, a smaller leaf area, {{a significant decrease in}} plant biomass, yield and fruit quality and a shorter life span. In our previous study, we showed that RD symptoms were reduced when apple rootstock M 106 were grown in RD soils treated either with the soil fumigant Basamid or after biofumigation by incorporating Brassica juncea or Raphanus sativus or by growing Tagetes under field conditions compared to untreated control soil. The present study aimed at identifying potential bacterial and fungal taxa that were affected by different soil treatments and linking bacterial and fungal responders to plant performance. Miseq® Illumina® sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene fragments (bacteria) and ITS regions (fungi) amplified from total community DNA extracted from soil samples taken 4 weeks after treatments were performed. Soil properties and culture history of the two RD sites greatly influenced soil microbiomes. Several bacterial genera were identified that significantly increased in treated soils such as Arthrobacter (R. sativus, both sites), Curtobacterium (Basamid, both sites), Terrimonas (Basamid and R. sativus, site A) and Ferruginibacter (B. juncea, site K and R. sativus, site A) that were also significantly and positively correlated with growth of apple M 106 plants. Only few fungal genera, such as Podospora, Monographella and Mucor, were significantly promoted in soils treated with B. juncea and R. sativus (both sites). The least pronounced changes were recorded for bacterial as well as fungal communities in the RD soils planted with Tagetes. The detection of bacterial and fungal genera that were significantly increased in relative abundance in response to the treatments and that were positively correlated with plant growth suggests that management of the soil microbial community could contribute to overcome the apple RD encountered at affected sites...|$|E
30|$|High {{turbidity}} {{in water}} causes problems with water purification processes {{and leads to}} increased treatment cost (DWAF 1998).

40|$|A {{machine for}} the soil thermo - {{mechanics}} sterilization, {{has been designed}} and realized. It is formed from a loom provided of wheels on which are installed: a soil cutting device, a soil conveyer device and a rotating oven whose axis is tilted of 20 ° {{in comparison to the}} horizontal axis. The working width is 1 m. The working depth is suitable until 30 cm. The speed has been 2 m/s with working capability of 0. 72 ha/h and with speed of 3 m/s the working capability has been 1. 08 ha/h. The ribbon conveyer, completely closed and sealed, it performs the soil transport to the hopper of the rotating oven. The rotating oven is formed from a rotating cylinder with length of 2. 500 mm, with a diameter of 500 mm and with angular speed = 3. 2 1 /s. A burner, situated at the extremity of the cylinder, it produces a flame along the cylinder axis. It produces a temperatures distribution inside the cylinder that has been determined by mean a thermodynamic study of the considered process. The soil carried upward by the ribbon conveyor, in around 3 s, it comes in the hopper of the rotating cylinder. It moves toward the cylinder outlet, because of the inclination and rotating motion of the cylinder, advancing in counter-current to the heat propagation. Besides the soil, because of the rotating motion of the cylinder considered, is dragged upward for then reverting in the low part of the cylinder, with further soil breaking up. This is also made easy because there is a metallic fin on the cylinder inside surface. Under such operative conditions the heat transfer in the soil is facilitated and therefore it increases the effectiveness of the <b>soil</b> <b>disinfectant</b> treatment during the range time when it crosses the whole length of the cylinder. It has been seen that with the values used of speed during the tests, it is avoided the “cooking” of the contained clay in the considered soil. On the soil samples treated in such way, physical, chemical and microbiological analysis have been performed, and satisfactory data results have been obtained {{from the point of view}} of the performed treatment. Besides a moisture loss has been noticed of about 3 - 4 % while macroscopically burnt and pulverized zones and reduction of organic substance are not been underlined. The obtained data results show that such machine perform a good soil sterilization treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensification}} of aquaculture in the Philippines {{has made the}} use of chemicals and biological products inevitable. A recent survey conducted nation wide among shrimp and milkfish culture facilities revealed the use of more than 100 products for rearing, prophylaxis, and treatment purposes. The most commonly applied chemicals are <b>disinfectants,</b> <b>soil</b> and water conditioners, plankton growth promoters, organic matter decomposers, pesticides, feed supplements, and antimicrobials. All of these are readily available in the market. The dosages, purposes, patterns of use, origins, and manufacturers of these chemicals and biological products are discussed in this paper. The indiscriminate use of chemicals has caused mortalities and morphological deformities in the host and development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The use of chemicals in aquaculture also poses dangers to public health. Government policies regulating or prohibiting the use ofcertain chemicals for aquaculture have helped curtail the destructive consequences of chemotherapy. Moreover, research institutions have geared their studies towards discovering environmentally safe drugs and other alternatives to disease control. However, these efforts will be futile unless a strong and aggressive campaign on the cautious and restricted use of drugs in aquaculture is conducted among shrimp and fish farmers, drug manufacturers and suppliers...|$|R
40|$|Research {{was carried}} out on the {{possible}} yield increase of crops in The Netherlands {{by the use of}} PSS (partial soil sterilization) on the soil, on the basis of published as well as unpublished data and by experimentation with different <b>disinfectants,</b> <b>soils</b> and plants. Following review of the literature and the methods employed are chapters dealing with inventory of quantitative data, PSS treatments of random fields without known problems, of soils with known nematode problems, and of fresh uninfested soils, with a final chapter on diagnostic studies on one particular PSS effect in oat. PSS was applied to 600, 000 ha, 1 % of the land, in the U. S. A. and to 40, 000 ha, 4 % of the arable land, in The Netherlands in 1969. The literature of the last five years comprises more than 400 scientific articles, but no reliable estimates have apparently been published about the magnitude of the effect of PSS in general, nor has the effect on plant growth been fully explained. The effect of the various PSS treatments, physical as well as chemical, may be direct in connection with the ingredients applied or the soil organisms or the soil itself, and indirect, e. g. in connection with plant growth. Plant growth is the main parameter used to measure PSS effects in this study, although density of pathogens (especially nematodes), and the chemical soilfertility (especially in connection with nitrogen) have sometimes been assessed as well. The approach and the methods employed in this study were partly statististical and partly experimental; in both cases common techniques were used. The data were usually arranged after calculations and tested by means of the IBM and CDC computerfacilities of the Landbouwhogeschool. Altogether 2453 individual treatment-soil-plant combinations from trials in The Netherlands during the period 1947 - 1970 could be collected. They were derived from the author's 545 experiments, from unpublished files of the Plantenziektenkundige Dienst, the Landbouwhogeschool and other institutions or individual researchers, and from literature. For each separate item the growth or yield was calculated as a percentage of untreated, and inclusive of supplementary data inserted into a computer card. After standardization and comprehension of the data special computer programmes furnished a number of tables and diagrams (Tables 2 - 9, Figs. 1 - 6). The yield on treated soil showed as general average 141 % of untreated, or 154 % without phytotoxic cases. For PSS treatments with the best known chemicals these figures were 151 %/ 164 %. If for each crop the average best treatment is selected, 172 %/ 188 % is reached. The average results of the treatments increased from pentachloronitrobenzene (103 %/ 118 %), via Vapam, Trapex, dichloropropene and chloropicrin to heat (221 %/ 240 %). The recommended doses normally used in practice appeared to give optimal average PSS effects. The percentage phytotoxic cases was on an average about 20 %. It, did not increase with higher doses, but was strongly correlated with the boiling point of the fumigants used. The crop averages differed widely. Pea, barley and woody plants seldom reached a good yield unless PSS had been applied. For grass, clover, potato and cabbage an intermediate yield increase was usually reached, whereas the response to PSS of many crops was low on some and very high on other soils. The measure of growth improvement was strongly correlated to the presence of known noxious pests and diseases (Tables 5 - 7). They were according to this inventory, very low on new polder soil, or clean sand, or fresh peat (99 %/ 114 %), and moderate on random soils without known infestation (115 %/ 125 %), as compared to the overall average already mentioned above (141 %/ 154 %), The effects varied much with soil type; they decreased from loamy sand, via clay soil, peaty sand, diluvial sand and dune sand to silty clay. The effect for polder sand (mainly fresh soils) was slight and for river sand it was even negligeably small, indicating the absence of stimulatory effects on plant growth by the chemicals themselves. PSS effects also varied with the different localities throughout the country. The relatively high effects for the Winschoten and Wageningen districts are the result of numerous experiments on heavily nematode- infested plots and experiments with imported loads of infested test soils. Therefore they are not representative for these districts. The low effect for Emmeloord district reflects results obtained on new, uninfested polder soils. The PSS treatments on 11 random fields without known problems (treatments with chloropicrin, dichloropropene and pentachloronitrobenzene, 7 to 14 test crops per field, three replicates) reached an average yield of 113 %, or 122 % excluding the phytotoxic cases, or 156 % for the average of the best treatments of each soil-crop combination. Nearly all crops suffered heavy yield losses on some fields and nearly all fields contained noxious problems for some crops which could be solved by PSS treatment (Fig. 7). The potential effect of PSS applied to all agricultural land including the problem fields must exceed 156 %, but should be less than 188 % found above as the average for all trials in The Netherlands. Five PSS treatments applied in pottrials to eight soils, with a known, noxious nematode problem and grown with nematode susceptible test plants, illustrated strong growth responses according to expectation, except for two soils where nematodes were probably not the main nor the sole problem, and except for some phytotoxic effects (Tables 11 - 26, Figs. 9 - 19). Dichloropropene was as effective as heat and chloropicrin in these soils with respect to nematode control and reached about the same yield increases. The nematicidal effect of Ternik was delayed but sustained; its systemic potencies were confirmed, but sometimes it was phytotoxic. Captan showed poor nematicidal, but not wholly negligeable effect. It was among the best treatments only in one soil with a suspected fungus infestation (Fig. 19) and was strongly phytotoxic in two soils (Figs. 17, 18). In pot trials with five PSS treatments of soils without or with very few noxious organisms caused only barely measurable growth responses to the crops carrot, rose and ryegrass (Tables 29, 31 and Figs. 20 - 24). Two unidentified, probably seed-borne problems, i. e. loss of seedlings and branching of roots, encountered in carrot, did not show up in soils previously disinfected with beat, chloropicrin or a very heavy dose of dichloropropene (Fig. 21). Diagnostic studies on an important PSS effect on oat, in soils infested with a complex of freeliving root-infesting nematodes (Pratylenchus crenatus + Tylenchorhynchus dubius + Rotylenchus robustus) proved, that inoculation with the nematode could produce the damage for the greater part (Tables 33 - 37, Figs. 25 - 27). The possible contribution of other organisms was however not excluded. The inoculation procedure seemed to cause important losses amongst the nematodes thus inoculated. For some species these were even aggravated by using steamed or heated soil shortly prior to the test...|$|R
