More commonly they are applied for the delivery of water-soluble drugs, but given their structural attributes they can also be employed as <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> for low solubility drugs as well as drug targeting agents. To further explore the potential of liposomes as <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents,</b> we have investigated the role of bilayer packaging in promoting drug solubilisation in liposome bilayers. The effect of alkyl chain length and symmetry was investigated to consider if using 'mis-matched' phospholipids could be used to create 'voids' within the bilayers, and enhance bilayer loading capacity. Lipid packing was investigated using Langmuir studies, which demonstrated that increasing the alkyl chain length enhanced lipid packing, with condensed monolayer forming, whilst asymmetric lipids formed less condensed monolayers. However this more open packing did not translate into improved drug loading, with the longer chain, condensed bilayers formed from long-chain, saturated lipids offering higher drug loading capacity. These studies demonstrate that liposomes formulated from longer chain, saturated lipids offer enhanced solubilisation capacity. However the molecular size, rather than lipophilicity, of the drug to be incorporated was also a key factor dominating bilayer incorporation efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA) based {{copolymers}} {{are known}} to undergo conformational transition in response to environmental stimuli. This smart behaviour {{makes it possible to}} mimic the behaviour of native apoproteins. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} develop a better understanding of the structure-property relationships of various PSMA-based copolymers sought. The work undertaken in this thesis has revealed that the responsive behaviour of PSMA-based copolymers can be tailored by varying the molecular weight, hydrophobic (styrene) and hydrophilic (maleic acid) balance, and more so in the presence of additional hydrophobic, mono-partial ester moieties. Novel hydrophilic and hydrophobic synthetic surfactant protein analogues have successfully been prepared. These novel lipid <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> possess a broad range of HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) values that have been estimated. NMR spectroscopy was utilised to confirm the structures for PSMA-based copolymers sought and proved useful in furthering understanding of the structure-property relationships of PSMA-based copolymers. The association of PSMA with the polar phospholipid, 2 -dilauryl-sn-glycero- 3 - phosphocholine (DLPC) produces polymer-lipid complexes analogous to lipoprotein assemblies present in the blood plasma. NMR analysis reveals that the PSMA-based copolymers are not perfectly alternating. Regio-irregular structures, atactic and random monomer sequence distribution have been identified for all materials studied. Novel lipid <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> (polyanionic surfactants) have successfully been synthesised from a broad range of PSMA-based copolymers with desired estimated HLB values that interact with polar phospholipids (DLPC/DPPC) uniquely. Very low static and dynamic surface tensions have been observed via the du Noϋy ring method and Langmuir techniques and correlate well with the estimated HLB values. Synthetic protein-lipid analogues have been successfully synthesised, that mimic the unique surface properties of native biological lubricants without the use of solvents. The novel PSMA-DLPC complexes have successfully been combined with hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA). Today, the employment of HA is economically feasible, because it is readily available from bacterial fermentation processes in a thermally stable form - HyaCare®. The work undertaken in this thesis highlights the usage of HA in biolubrication applications and how this can be optimised and thus justified by carefully selecting the biological source, concentration, molecular weight, purity and most importantly by combining it with compatible boundary lubricating agents (polar phospholipids). Experimental evidence supports the belief that the combined HA and PSMA-DLPC complexes provide a balance of rheological, biotribological and surface properties that are composition dependent, and show competitive advantage as novel synthetic biological lubricants (biosurfactants) ...|$|R

In recent {{years there has been}} a renaissance in bile acid based research as it has emerged that bile acids have a wide range of biological effects, which extend beyond their traditional role as <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> in the gut. Bile acids have been shown to activate apoptotic, carcinogenic, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signalling pathways. Using a chemical biology approach this thesis sought to investigate some of the biological effects of bile acids in an esophageal cancer model. Previous studies have demonstrated the cytotoxicity of bile acids in hepatic, colonic and esophageal cell lines. Bile acid hydrophobicity is believed to be an important cytotoxicity determinant but this relationship is not well characterised. Chapter three of this thesis describes an investigation into the relationship between bile acid hydrophobicity and effects on cell viability. In this study we synthesised new azido and other hydrophobic bile acid derivatives. We assembled a panel of 37 bile acids with a good range of hydrophobicities as determined by reverse phase thin layer chromatography.

40|$|A complex {{formed by}} human α-lactalbumin (α-LA) and oleic acid (OA), named HAMLET, {{has been shown}} to have an {{apoptotic}} activity leading to the selective death of tumor cells. In numerous publications {{it has been reported that}} in the complex α-LA is monomeric and adopts a partly folded or “molten globule” state, leading to the idea that partly folded proteins can have “beneficial effects”. The protein/OA molar ratio initially has been reported to be 1 : 1, while recent data have indicated that the OA-complex is given by an oligomeric protein capable of binding numerous OA molecules per protein monomer. Proteolytic fragments of α-LA, as well as other proteins unrelated to α-LA, can form OA-complexes with biological activities similar to those of HAMLET, thus indicating that a generic protein can form a cytotoxic complex under suitable experimental conditions. Moreover, even the selective tumoricidal activity of HAMLET-like complexes has been questioned. There is recent evidence that the biological activity of long chain unsaturated fatty acids, including OA, can be ascribed to their effect of perturbing the structure of biological membranes and consequently the function of membrane-bound proteins. In general, it has been observed that the cytotoxic effects exerted by HAMLET-like complexes are similar to those reported for OA alone. Overall, these findings can be interpreted by considering that the protein moiety does not have a toxic effect on its own, but merely acts as a <b>solubilising</b> <b>agent</b> for the inherently toxic fatty acid...|$|E

Using the muscarinic antagonist quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), a single saturable binding component was found with an equilibrium constant of ZOOpM, approximately 10 âfold higher than the membrane receptor and 4 âfold higher than the ratio k -l /k l determined kinetically in the soluble material. This latter difference may indicate that the binding of QNB to the solubilised receptor {{is not a simple}} secondâorder process. Inhibition constants for a variety of muscarinic agonists and antagonists were 10 to 20 âfold higher than in the membrane state and non-muscarinic ligands were without effect.

Instead the Hill coefficient of the soluble material decreased as the percentage of total binding sites solubilised increased.

It catalyzes oxidation of phenolic substrates with water as only by-product. Moreover, laccases {{are able to}} oxidize non-phenolic compounds indirectly, with help of redox mediators. In laccase mediator system (LMS) the enzyme oxidizes low molecular weight phenolic compound—mediator—and a very reactive intermediate product is formed. Next, it leaves the laccase active site and oxidizes other substrates which could not enter the enzyme active site on their own. The mediators are either synthetic ones like 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) or natural ones—lignin derivatives, such as sinapic acid, 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenol or p-coumaric acid. Laccases are enzymes useful in various fields—food and textile industry, biomedical diagnostics, biofuel production, organic synthesis and bioremediation (Pollegioni et al. 2015; Kaczmarek et al. 2017; Hilgers et al. 2018).

Two <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) and Tween 80 (®) (TW 80) were chosen as cyclodextrin (CD) and surfactant representatives, respectively. In order to reuse HPCD and to degrade the pollutant simultaneously, the following optimal parameters were determined: [Fe(2 +) ] = 0. 05 mM (catalyst), I = 2000 mA, and natural solution pH (around 6), without any adjustment. Only 50 % of TW 80 (still higher than the critical micelle concentration (CMC)) can be reused against 90 % {{in the case of}} HPCD while phenanthrene is completely degraded in the meantime, after only 180 min of treatment. This {{can be explained by the}} ternary complex formation (Fe(2 +) -HPCD-organic pollutant) (equilibrium constant K = 56 mM(- 1)) that allows OH to directly degrade the contaminant. This confirms that Fe(2 +) plays an important role as a catalyst since it can promote formation of hydroxyl radicals near the pollutant and minimize HPCD degradation. After 2 h of treatment, HPCD/phenanthrene solution got better biodegradability (BOD 5 /COD = 0. 1) and lower toxicity (80 % inhibition of luminescence of Vibrio fischeri bacteria) than TW 80 /phenanthrene (BOD 5 /COD = 0. 08; 99 % inhibition of V. fischeri bacteria).

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that highly pure P 450 3 A 4 {{can be prepared}} utilising either of the detergents Emulgen 911 (E 911) or CHAPS as the <b>solubilising</b> <b>agent,</b> and that CHAPS, a steroidal detergent, binds to P 450 3 A 4 but is less inhibitory than E 911, most likely because of its low affinity. In addition this work highlights, for the first time, that CHAPS-solubilised P 450 3 A 4 is not a homogeneous preparation, and {{is in fact a}} mixture of oligomers, the size of the oligomeric state being affected by the amount of detergent used to purify the enzyme. Despite this aggregation, however, the preparations of P 450 3 A 4 were shown to be active with respect to binding carbon monoxide in the reduced for, oxidising a profluorescent substrate (7 -BQ), and producing an optical spin state change upon substrate binding. Optical binding studies have suggested a correlation between a compound's affinity for P 450 3 A 4 and its solubility, i. e. the more soluble the substrate the weaker it will bind to this protein, as has been suggested in the past. These studies have also indicated that, (i) the affinity of a substrate may be enhanced by the presence of a nitrogen that can coordinate to the iron, (ii) the active site is unlikely to be merely a large cavity where substrates can bind, (iii) the cooperative behaviour of testosterone and amitriptyline with P 450 3 A 4 is dependent upon the buffer conditions used and (iv) one or more substrate molecules may be interacting with this protein at once, and at distinct binding sites, although the nature of these sites cannot be determined. In addition, NMR relaxation studies were carried out in an attempt to determine haem iron to substrate proton distances for P 450 3 A 4. However, {{it was not possible to}} achieve this because the systems under investigation were all in slow/intermediate exchange on the NMR time scale, possibly because the protein samples were aggregated...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades {{osteoporosis}} {{has become a major}} subject on the field of drug discovery and design. One of the enzymes recently considered important to use as a target for theses drugs is the enzyme H + -V O -ATPase. This proton pump is located in the osteoclast cells, which are positioned at the bone surface. These enzymes control the proton flux to the bone surface and consequently bone resorption. One major task on drug design is the knowledge of the secondary and tertiary structure of the enzyme under study. The topology of the V-ATPase protein complex has been largely established, however, only the three-dimensional structure of some individual subunits is known up to the time this thesis was printed. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the proton translocation channel located in subunit a of the V-ATPase complex. For this purpose, we designed two peptides, consisting of 25 and 37 amino acid residues, representing the seventh transmembrane segment of subunit a that encompass the proton translocation channel as well as the region of interest for possible inhibitors. Using a combination of NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and CD (circular dichroism) spectroscopy we analysed the conformation of these V-ATPase peptides in different membrane-mimicking environments: aqueous solutions of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) and amphipols, and the organic solvent DMSO (dimethylsulphoxide). The conformation of the V-ATPase peptides in SDS micelles was studied by CD spectroscopy, however, due to their low solubility NMR spectroscopy turned out to be impossible. The CD results showed that the size of the peptide can drastically alter the solubilization in SDS. For the 37 -residue V-ATPase peptide the overall conformation was a-helical and not dependent on the SDS concentration. On the other hand, the conformation of the 25 -residue V-ATPase peptide depended on the peptide to SDS ratio changing between an a-helix and β-sheet conformation. As an alternative <b>solubilising</b> <b>agent</b> for the peptides in aqueous solutions we tested amphipols, a new class of macromolecules that were designed to solubilise transmembrane proteins for NMR and X-ray studies. The CD and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy results showed that both peptides aggregated in a β-sheet conformation. The formation of these b‑sheets aggregates might result from the interaction of the arginine residue present in the V-ATPase peptides with the anionic polymer. Such an interaction could prevent the peptide from cross­ing the hydrophobic core of the particle, preventing the formation of an a‑he­lix. High-quality high-resolution NMR spectra of the V-ATPase peptides were obtained in DMSO enabling to analyse the atomic structure of the peptides. The use of DMSO on structural studies of transmembrane polypeptides always raised some debate in the literature. This fact motivated us to perform a molecular dynamics study to investigate the solvation of the 25 -residue V-ATPase peptide by DMSO. From this work, we show that DMSO can provide both polar and apolar environments to the peptide, making it a good membrane-mimicking organic solvent. The NMR study of the 37 -residues peptide enabled us to confirm the a-helical conformation and to predict that the transmembrane spanning region of the seventh transmembrane segment is larger than expected. Instead of 25 transmembrane residues, we propose a transmembrane region of 32 residues. Furthermore, the NMR study of the 25 -residue peptide lead us to postulate the existence of a hinge region located near the cytoplasmic end of the channel. It is proposed that the presence of this hinge allows the opening and closing of the proton translocation channel and provides flexibility for the channel to act as a binding pocket for inhibitors. The resulting NMR data sets for the two V-ATPase peptides are deposited in the BioMagResbank (BMRB) under the access numbers 15025 and 6878, and the calculated structure ensemble for the 25 -residue peptide is deposited in the PDB databank with entry 2 NVJ. ...|$|E

The distinctive morphology of this region of plasma membrane is a feature which facilitates the isolation of these membranes in a pure form. The preparation of the brush borders is described {{and some of the}} biochemical characteristics have been established. Attempts to study the organisation of proteins within the brush borders were made using a variety of <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents.</b> Concentrated salt solutions released up to 40 % of the membrane protein without concomitant release of brush border enzymes, antigens, phospholipid, cholesterol or carbohydrate. After such treatment the membrane appeared intact, but the core filaments were removed. Neutral detergents appeared to disrupt the membrane continuum, releasing maltase, trehalase, and leucine aminopeptidase, but lesser amounts of alkaline phosphatase. Some membrane phospholipid (principally the anionic classes), cholesterol, carbohydrate and antigens were also solubilised. Brush border core filaments and desmosomes were resistant to this treatment. Anionic detergents did not achieve selective extraction of brush border components but at high concentrations resulted in wholesale dissolution of the organelles. A proteolipid fraction which comprised 2 % of the brush borders was isolated. Distinct subfractions of the brush border organelle were obtained by sequential extraction with 1 % Triton X- 100 followed by 2 M NaCl. No difference in relative turnover of these subfractions was observed, although enzymic and immunologic investigations of the macro- molecular constituents from urine indicated that the selective loss of brush border components may occur via the urine. A protein, (molecular weight 44, 500) derived from the core of the brush borders was purified by selective repolymerization and shown to possess structural but not functional properties similar to those of striated muscle actin. </ol...|$|R
40|$|Is it {{possible}} to find an easy, generic method for protein refolding? The preparation of functionally active protein molecules from the unfolded state can be a difficult task. Although there are many well-established techniques for protein refolding, such as dilution, dialysis, chromatography and others, in many instances these methods can be time consuming and inefficient. A rapid, inexpensive and simple method for protein folding is a much sought after technique. Proteins in the unfolded state (either inclusion bodies or unfolded by chemical or physical means) are generally solubilised in solutions containing urea or guanidine hydrochloride. The removal of these molecules from the protein environment is commonly utilised as a method for triggering refolding. A new method for the refolding of biomolecular species has been developed via the formation of Protein Coated Micro-crystals (PCMC). The formation of PCMC is a recently developed method for the immobilisation protein upon {{the surface of a}} watersoluble excipient (salt, amino acid or sugar) via a co-precipitation reaction in a water miscible organic solvent. These proteins can then be used as immobilised biocatalysts in both the aqueous and organic phase. In the immobilisation of unfolded, solubilised protein, the <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> (e. g. urea or guanidine hydrochloride) are removed from the protein environment as they are soluble in the organic phase. The removal of these molecules initiates protein folding during the coprecipitation process. In the course of this project, a number of proteins were studied in order to observe their behaviour in this immobilisation and simultaneous folding process. Lysozyme was utilised as it is an enzyme which is relatively simple to refold from the chemically unfolded state by conventional methods such as dilution. Upon immobilisation of lysozyme from the chemically unfolded state, up to 92 % of the activity of the native protein was regained. The enzyme lipase, which is notoriously difficult to fold, was also used to determine the efficiency of this method under more challenging conditions. Lipase immobilised from the chemically unfolded state was seen to regain up to 36 % of the activity of the native protein...|$|R
40|$|Over 50 % of clinically-marketed drugs target {{membrane}} proteins; {{in particular}} G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs {{are vital to}} living cells, performing {{an active role in}} many processes, making them integral to drug development. In nature, GPCRs are not sufficiently abundant for research and their structural integrity is often lost during extraction from cell membranes. The objectives of this thesis were to increase recombinant yield of the GPCR, human adenosine A 2 A receptor (hA 2 AR) by investigating bioprocess conditions in large-scale Pichia pastoris and small-scale Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultivations. Extraction of hA 2 AR from membranes using novel polymers was also investigated. An increased yield of hA 2 AR from P. pastoris was achieved by investigating the methanol feeding regime. Slow, exponential feed during induction (μlow) was compared to a faster, exponential feed (μhigh) in 35 L pilot-scale bioreactors. Overall hA 2 AR yields were increased for the μlow cultivation (536. 4 pmol g- 1) compared to the μhigh 148. 1 pmol g- 1. hA 2 AR levels were maintained in cytotoxic methanol conditions and unexpectedly, pre-induction levels of hA 2 AR were detected. Small-scale bioreactor work showed that Design of Experiments (DoE) could be applied to screen for bioprocess conditions to give optimal hA 2 AR yields. Optimal conditions were retrieved for S. cerevisiae using a d-optimal screen and response surface methodology. The conditions were 22 °C, pH 6. 0, 30 % DO without dimethyl sulphoxide. A polynomial equation was generated to predict hA 2 AR yields if conditions varied. Regarding the extraction, poly (maleic anhydride-styrene) or PMAS was successful in solubilising hA 2 AR from P. pastoris membranes compared with dodcecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) detergent. Variants of PMAS worked well as <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> with either 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DMPC) or cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS). Moreover, esterification of PMAS improved solubilisation, suggesting that increased hydrophobicity stabilises hA 2 AR during extraction. Overall, hA 2 AR yields were improved in both, P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae and the use of novel polymers for efficient extraction was achieved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Lipids play a {{vital role}} at {{interfaces}} such as the tear film in the protection of the anterior eye. Their role is to act as lubricants and reduce surface and interfacial tension. Although {{there is a lack of}} appropriate methods to solubilize and dilute phospholipids to the tear film. Here, we report that styrene-maleic acid copolymers (PSMA), can form polymer–lipid complexes in the form of monodisperse nanometric particles, which can easily solubilise these phospholipid molecules by avoiding for example, the use of any kind of surfactant. Method: The interactions of PSMA with phospholipids have been studied by its adsorption from aqueous solutions into monolayers of dimyristoyl-phosphorylcholine (DMPC). The Langmuir trough (LT) technique is used to study this pH-dependant complex formation. The formed nanoparticles have been also analysed by 31 P NMR, particle size distribution by light scattering (DLS) and morphology by electron microscopy (SEM). Results: The LT has been found to be a useful technique for in vitro simulation of in vivo lipid layer behaviour: The limiting surface pressure of unstable tear films ranges between 20 and 30 mN/m. More stable tear films show an increase in surface pressure, within the range of 35 – 45 mN/m. The DMPC monolayers have a limiting surface pressure of 38 mN/m (water), and 45 mN/m (pH 4 buffer), and the PSMA-DMPC complexes formed at pH 4 have a value of 42 mN/m, which resembles that of the stable tear film. The average particle size distribution is 53 ± 10 nm with a low polydispersity index (PDI) of 0. 24 ± 0. 03. Conclusions: New biocompatible and cheap lipid <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> such as PSMA can be used for the study of the tear film composition and properties. These polymer–lipid complexes in the form of nanoparticles can be used to solubilise and release in a controlled way other hydrophobic molecules such as some drugs or proteins...|$|R
40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is {{the staple}} food of {{subsistence}} {{farmers in the}} vast areas of Ultisols and Oxisols of the tropical and subtropical rainfed uplands and lowlands Phosphorus (P) deficiency and soil acidity commonly constrain yields. Phosphorus fertiliser is considered an expensive input, and must therefore be used efficiently. The objective of this thesis was to investigate fertiliser strategies and plant mechanisms that could enhance the uptake efficiency of P by aerobically grown rice. The long-term aim of understanding rice P-uptake mechanisms is that such research will help in developing P-efficient rice varieties. In acid soils, aluminium (Al) toxicity restricts root growth and therefore limits P uptake. A bioassay was developed as a basis to compare two techniques for assessing concentrations of phytotoxic Al. It was found that Al in soil solution extracted by centrifugation correlated better with rice root extension than Al extracted in 0. 02 M CaCl 2. Aluminium toxicity was found not to restrict root growth (hence P uptake) in the Philippines Ultisol (Cavinti soil) used in later experiments. Experiments investigating the effect of different fertiliser management practices, showed that banding of fertiliser P, as opposed to incorporating P fertiliser throughout the soil, enhanced the availability of P to rice grown in the high P-fixing Cavinti soil. The practice of applying green manure with reactive phosphate rock (RPR) decreased the dissolution of RPR because mineralisation of green manure nitrogen increased the soil pH. Aerobically grown rice exhibited a number of mechanisms that would enhance P uptake; rhizosphere acidification, localised proliferation of fine roots in P-rich zones, and association with mycorrhizae. Mathematical modelling indicated that upland rice {{must be able to}} release <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents,</b> e. g. organic anions, in order to explain the observed P uptake in banded, moderately fertilised soil. By extracting soil fertilised at different P rates with citrate solutions, it was found that more P was extracted, per mole of citrate added, from highly fertilised soil. This indicated {{that there would be a}} positive interaction between banding fertiliser P and solubilisation by organic anions. Initial extraction, storage and detection methods were unable to identify significant quantities of organic acids in the rhizosphere of aerobically grown rice. Better methods for extracting organic anions from soil were developed, and improved procedures for studying the mechanisms of plant induced changes in the rhizosphere are proposed...|$|R

40|$|Surfactants are <b>solubilising</b> <b>agents</b> {{that are}} {{commonly}} used in householdand industrial applications. A large fraction of surfactants used is emitted to wastewater they can reach the soil through wastewater irrigation or applications of sewage sludge and pesticides. Surfactants are relatively harmless in the soil ecosystem since they are readily degradable and have low toxicity. However, surfactants can facilitate the mobility of different contaminants in soil, and this indirect risk of surfactants on groundwater contamination prompted this study. The aim of this soil chemical study is to evaluate the effects {{of different types of}} surfactant on mobility of four organophosphorous pesticides and of the trace metals Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn. Surfactants assayed through this thesis were selected as representative of compounds used in agriculture, i. e. their presence in pesticide formulations or their presence in sludge and wastewater. Sorption and desorption of organophosphorous pesticides were measured in the presence of different surfactants (cationic, anionic and non-ionic) through batch assays in 9 different Mediterranean soils. The presence of a cationic surfactant increased pesticide retention in soils more than 100 times for the most hydrophobic compound, and this increase was most pronounced in soils with high CEC values, suggesting that sorption of the cationic surfactant promotes pesticide binding at the hydrophobic moiety of the surfactant. Addition of non-ionic and anionic surfactants increased or decreased the pesticide retention in soil, depending on soil characteristics and type of pesticide, with a factor of 2 at most. A degradation experiment of the same organophosphorous pesticides in a Mediterranean soil in the presence of three different surfactants (cationic, anionic and non-ionic) or wastewater showed that the non-ionic surfactant enhanced degradation rates for all the pesticides except the mosthydrophobic and at high cationic surfactant concentration, pesticide half lives were increased 3  10 times, {{and in the case of}} the most hydrophobic compound (diazinon), circa 55 % of the added concentration was still recovered in the soil after 4 months of incubation. These results indicate that increased pesticide sorption in presence of cationic surfactantsdiminishes the availability of pesticides to microorganisms, thus decreasing biological degradation. The effect of surfactants on trace metal solubility was studied in short-term (24 h) batch experiments or in a long-term (1 70 days) incubationexperiment with a collection of 8 soils and different surfactants. Submicellar concentrations of cationic surfactants decreased trace metal solubility about 5 20 %, while submicellar concentrations of anionic surfactants increased metal solubility by 30 % at most. Cationic surfactants decreased the concentrations of dissolved soil organic matter, likely by promoting sorption of the hydrophobic matter. In contrast, anionic surfactant increased the soil organic matter solubility by reducing soluble Ca 2 + that acts as a coagulant for organic matter. The changes in soluble soil organic matter statistically explained surfactant effects and this was confirmed by speciation calculations. Above the critical micelle concentration, the increase in metal solubility was up to 100 -fold and was largely related to the relative increase in soil organic matter solubilitythat was pronounced at these high surfactant concentrations due to micellar solubilization. Effects of irrigation with A 22 on metal leaching were assessed in column experiments at two flow rates and at different surfactant concentrations. Leaching with A 22 increased copper (Cu) concentration in the leachates up to three times compared to the control treatment and Cu was not mobilised by complexation with the surfactant, but indirectly through solubilisation of soil organic matter. The solubilisation of soil organic matter is likely related to the precipitation of A 22 with Ca 2 + ions. The solution Ca concentration at the highest A 22 dose was only half of that in the control, which likely resulted in solubilization of humic substances, thereby facilitating leaching of soil DOC and associated Cu ions. Overall, the most significant effects are, in general, the enhancement of hydrophobic pesticides retention by cationic surfactants and the increased solubilisation of organic matter and resulting mobility of trace metals by anionic surfactants.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Combination {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy is}} essential for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. At least three active drugs, usually from two different classes, are required to effectively suppress the virus to allow recovery of the immune system and reduce the emergence of HIV resistance. Nevirapine (NVP), lamivudine (3 TC) and zidovudine (AZT) form part of the first-line regimen for the treatment of HIV/AIDS as stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Current anti-retroviral therapy is extremely complicated, requiring between 2 and 20 dosage units a day from different dosage forms. Furthermore, the drugs themselves are very expensive. It is clear that there is a great need for more powerful drugs and easier regimens to be developed and become available to more people in the near future. Combining the above mentioned drugs into one dosage form will not only be more cost-effective but will also increase patient adherence. Both 3 TC and AZT are readily soluble in an aqueous environment with solubilities of 70 mg/ml and 20. 1 mg/ml respectively. NVP is practically insoluble in water (± 0. 1 mg/ml) and its solubility decreases even further with an increase in pH, thus, making it difficult to formulate a liquid dosage form at physiological pH. Furthermore, there is very little literature available about the stability and degradation kinetics of NVP. The goal {{of the study was to}} gather information about the stability and degradation kinetics of NVP including pH-stability and measurement of the rate of degradation. Chapter 1 gives a literature overview of stability and degradation kinetics. Chapter 2 gives information about the three drugs used in the study, namely: NVP, 3 TC and AZT. Chapter 3 gives a literature overview of solubility and techniques for solubilising drugs. Chapter 4 gives information about the various <b>solubilising</b> and complexing <b>agents</b> used in the study. Chapter 5 describes the methods used in the stability tests, pH-solubility tests, phase-solubility tests and solubility tests using different co-solvents. Chapter 6 and 7 finally deals with the results obtained and the conclusions that were made. Stability tests were done on the three drugs separately, as well as in combination, to ascertain the effect that combining the drugs have on their stability. The tests show NVP to be very stable with a t 90 (pH 7) of - 3000 days. 3 TC is less stable with increased degradation at pH < 4 but still has a long t 90 of - 2500 days at pH 7. AZT is the most stable of the three drugs as very little degradation occurred. Also, AZT is the most stable in the combination with 3 TC and NVP. However, all of the drugs showed increased degradation in combination. NVP is approximately 10 times less stable in combination at pH 7. The shelf life of NVP decreased from - 3000 days to - 300 days in combination with 3 TC and AZT. Therefore, it would be possible to formulate an aqueous solution with NVP as a single drug but a combination formulation with 3 TC and AZT is not recommended as the shelf life decreases to substandard levels for both NVP and 3 TC. Solubility studies and phase-solubility studies were conducted with NVP in various co-solvents and complexing agents. In conclusion it can be said that none of the solubilising techniques investigated were of any practical value in increasing NVP's solubility. Master...|$|R
