40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{results of}} the Integrated DWPF (Defense Waste Processing Facility) Melter System (IDMS) ammonia scrubber testing during the PX- 7 run (the 7 th IDMS run with a Purex type sludge). Operation of the ammonia scrubber during IDMS Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) processing has been completed. The ammonia scrubber was successful in removing ammonia from the vapor stream to achieve NH 3 concentrations far below the 10 ppM vapor exist design basis during SRAT processing. However, during SME processing, vapor NH 3 concentrations as high as 450 ppM were measured exiting the scrubber.

Three additional tests with ammonia are planned to verify the data collected during off-line testing. Operation of the ammonia scrubber during IDMS SRAT and SME processing will be completed during the next IDMS run. The Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) scrubbers were successful in removing ammonia from the vapor stream to achieve ammonia vapor concentrations far below the 10 ppM vapor exit design basis. In most of the tests, the ammonia concentration in the vapor exit was lower than the detection limit of the analyzers so results are generally reported as < 0. 05 parts per million (ppM).

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, the {{breakdown}} of spacetime symmetries {{has been identified as}} a promising research field in the context of Planck-scale phenomenology. For example, various theoretical approaches to the quantum-gravity problem are known to accommodate minute violations of CPT invariance. This talk covers various topics within this research area. In particular, some mechanisms for spacetime-symmetry breaking as well as the Standard-Model Extension (<b>SME)</b> <b>test</b> framework will be reviewed; the connection between CPT and Lorentz invariance in quantum field theory will be exposed; and various experimental CPT tests with emphasis on matter–antimatter comparisons will be discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|The largest gap in our {{understanding}} of nature at the fundamental level is perhaps a unified description of gravity and quantum theory. Although there are currently a variety of theoretical approaches to this question, experimental research in this field is inhibited by the expected Planck-scale suppression of quantum-gravity effects. However, the breakdown of spacetime symmetries has recently been identified as a promising signal in this context: a number of models for underlying physics can accommodate minuscule Lorentz and CPT violation, and such effects are amenable to ultrahigh-precision tests. This presentation will give an overview of the subject. Topics such as motivations, the <b>SME</b> <b>test</b> framework, mechanisms for relativity breakdown, and experimental tests will be reviewed. Emphasis is given to observations involving antimatter. Comment: 6 page...|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) Chemical Process Cell (CPC) {{cycle time}} {{identified}} several opportunities {{to improve the}} CPC processing time. The Mechanical Systems & Custom Equipment Development (MS&CED) Section of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) recently completed the evaluation {{of one of these}} opportunities - the possibility of using an Isolok sampling valve {{as an alternative to the}} Hydragard valve for taking DWPF process samples at the Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME). The use of an Isolok for SME sampling has the potential to improve operability, reduce maintenance time, and decrease CPC cycle time. The <b>SME</b> acceptability <b>testing</b> for the Isolok was requested in Task Technical Request (TTR) HLW-DWPF-TTR- 2010 - 0036 and was conducted as outlined in Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan (TTQAP) SRNLRP- 2011 - 00145. RW- 0333 P QA requirements applied to the task, and the results from the investigation were documented in SRNL-STI- 2011 - 00693. Measurement of the chemical composition of study samples was a critical component of the <b>SME</b> acceptability <b>testing</b> of the Isolok. A sampling and analytical plan supported the investigation with the analytical plan directing that the study samples be prepared by a cesium carbonate (Cs{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }) fusion dissolution method and analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The use of the cesium carbonate preparation method for the Isolok testing provided an opportunity for an additional assessment of this dissolution method, which is being investigated as a potential replacement for the two methods (i. e., sodium peroxide fusion and mixed acid dissolution) that have been used at the DWPF for the analysis of <b>SME</b> samples. Earlier <b>testing</b> of the Cs{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } method yielded promising results which led to a TTR from Savannah River Remediation, LLC (SRR) to SRNL for additional support and an associated TTQAP to direct the SRNL efforts. A technical report resulting from this work was issued that recommended that the mixed acid method be replaced by the Cs{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } method for the measurement of magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and zirconium (Zr) with additional testing of the method by DWPF Laboratory being needed before further implementation of the Cs{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } method at that laboratory. While the <b>SME</b> acceptability <b>testing</b> of the Isolok does not address any of the open issues remaining after the publication of the recommendation for the replacement of the mixed acid method by the Cs{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } method (since those issues are to be addressed by the DWPF Laboratory), the Cs{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } testing associated with the Isolok testing does provide additional insight into the performance of the method as conducted by SRNL. The performance is to be investigated by looking to the composition measurement data generated by the samples of a standard glass, the Analytical Reference Glass - 1 (ARG- 1), that were prepared by the Cs{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } method and included in the <b>SME</b> acceptability <b>testing</b> of the Isolok. The measurements of these samples were presented as part of the study results, but no statistical analysis of these measurements was conducted as part of those results. It is the purpose of this report to provide that analysis, which was supported using JMP Version 7. 0. 2...|$|R

This paper used loan data from Chinese <b>SMEs</b> to <b>test</b> this hypothesis during {{a financial crisis}} and during non-crisis times. Compared with large banks, small banks are only superior in offering SMEs relationship lending through a pre-existing relationship, regardless of the financial crisis. Without pre-existing relationships, small and large banks have no advantage in providing loans to SMEs. We also find that there is no significant positive association between bank size and whether an SME changes its lending bank or the number of its financing sources, regardless of whether there is currently a financial crisis. The results indicate that small banks fail to maintain a strong relationship with SMEs, possibly because of the hold-up problem resulting from relationship lending...|$|R

Controlling for firm characteristics, city characteristics and firm and city diversity, there is strong evidence for the firm effect.
