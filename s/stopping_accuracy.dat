This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of optimal convergence rates of adaptive algorithms. In particular, this work studies <b>stopping,</b> <b>accuracy</b> and efficiency behavior of adaptive algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), partial differential equations (PDEs) and Itô stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The main ingredient of the adaptive algorithms is an error expansion of the form “Global error = ∑ local error · weight + higher order error”, with computable leading order terms. The algorithm uses additional computational work to obtain the error estimate because of the weights. However, the approximation of the weights is required to inform where to refine the mesh to achieve optimal efficiency. Based on the a posteriori error expansions with “error indicator: = |local error · weight|”, the adaptive algorithm subdivides the time steps or elements if the error indicators are greater than TOL/N, and stops if all N time steps or elements have sufficiently small error indicators. Similar algorithms are derived with eithe...|$|E

Converging evidence from patient and animal studies points to the role of noradrenaline in dopaminergically insensitive aspects of the parkinsonian dysexecutive syndrome, yet the direct effects of noradrenergic enhancement have not to date been addressed. Our aim was to directly investigate these, focusing on impulsivity during response inhibition and decision making. To this end, we administered 40 mg atomoxetine, a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor to 25 patients with Parkinson’s disease (12 female / 13 male; 64. 4 6. 9 years old) in a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled design.

40|$|Background and Aims: Adaptive {{behavior}} {{depends on}} the ability to voluntarily suppress context-inappropriate behaviors, a process referred to as response inhibition. Stop Signal tests (SSTs) are the most frequently studied paradigm used to assess response inhibition. Previous studies of SSTs have indicated that inhibitory control behavior can be explained using a common model in which GO and STOP processes are initiated independent from one and another, and the process that is completed first determines whether the behavior is elicited (GO process) or terminated (STOP process). Consistent with this model, studies have indicated that individuals strategically delay their behaviors during SSTs in order to increase their stopping abilities. Despite being controlled by distinct neural systems, prior studies have largely documented similar inhibitory control performance across eye and hand movements. Though, no existing studies have compared the extent to which individuals strategically delay behavior across different effectors is not yet clear. Here, we compared the extent to which inhibitory control processes and the cognitive strategies that support them during oculomotor and manual motor behaviors. Methods: We examined 29 healthy individuals who performed parallel oculomotor and manual motor SSTs. Participants also completed a separate block of GO trials administered prior to the Stop Signal tasks to assess baseline reaction times for each effector and reaction time increases during interleaved GO trials of the SST. Results: Our results showed that stopping errors increased for both effectors as the interval between GO and STOP cues was increased (i. e., stop signal delay), but performance deteriorated more rapidly for eye compared to hand movements with increases in stop signal delay. During GO trials, participants delayed the initiation of their responses for each effector, and greater slowing of reaction times on GO trials was associated with increased accuracy on STOP trials for both effectors. However, participants delayed their eye movements to a lesser degree than their hand movements, and strategic reaction time slowing was a stronger determinant of <b>stopping</b> <b>accuracy</b> for hand compared to eye movements. Overall, stopping accuracies for eye and hand movements were only modestly correlated, and the time it took individuals to cancel a respons...|$|E

40|$|Self-generated {{thoughts}} {{unrelated to}} ongoing activities, {{also known as}} ‘mind-wandering’, make up {{a substantial portion of}} our daily lives. Reports of such task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs) predict both poor performance on demanding cognitive tasks and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity in the default mode network (DMN). However, recent findings suggest that TUTs and the DMN can also facilitate metacognitive abilities and related behaviors. To further understand these relationships, we examined the influence of subjective intensity, ruminative quality, and variability of mind-wandering on response inhibition and monitoring, using the Error Awareness Task (EAT). We expected to replicate links between TUT and reduced inhibition, and explored whether variance in TUT would predict improved error monitoring, reflecting a capacity to balance between internal and external cognition. By analyzing BOLD responses to subjective probes and the EAT, we dissociated contributions of the DMN, executive, and salience networks to task performance. While both response inhibition and online TUT ratings modulated BOLD activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of the DMN, the former recruited a more dorsal area implying functional segregation. We further found that individual differences in mean TUTs strongly predicted EAT <b>stop</b> <b>accuracy,</b> while TUT variability specifically predicted levels of error awareness. Interestingly, we also observed co-activation of salience and default mode regions during error awareness, supporting a link between monitoring and TUTs. Altogether our results suggest that although TUT is detrimental to task performance, fluctuations in attention between self-generated and external task-related thought is a characteristic of individuals with greater metacognitive monitoring capacity. Achieving a balance between internal and externally oriented thought may thus allow individuals to optimize their task performance...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive eating {{behaviors}} {{are dependent on}} an interaction between motivational states (e. g., hunger) and the ability to control one’s own behavior (inhibitory control). Indeed, behavioral paradigms are emerging that seek to train inhibitory control to improve eating behavior. However, inhibitory control is a multifaceted concept, and it is not yet clear how different types (e. g., reactive motor inhibition, proactive motor inhibition, reward-related inhibition) are affected by hunger. Such knowledge will provide insight into the contexts in which behavioral training paradigms would be most effective. The present study explored the impact of promoting a need state (hunger) together with motivationally salient distracting stimuli (food/non-food images) on inhibitory control in 46 healthy adults. Participants attended two study sessions, once after eating breakfast as usual and once after acute food restriction {{on the morning of the}} session. In each session, participants completed questionnaires on hunger, mood and inhibitory control, and undertook task-based measures of inhibitory control, and had physiological measurements (height, weight and blood glucose) obtained by a researcher. Acute food restriction influenced task-based assessments but not questionnaire measures of inhibitory control, suggesting that hunger affects observable behavioral control but not self-reported inhibitory control. After acute food restriction, participants showed greater temporal discounting (devaluation of future rewards), and subjective hunger and these were inversely correlated with <b>stop</b> <b>accuracy</b> on the <b>stop</b> signal task. Finally, participants generally responded faster when food-related distractor images were presented, compared to non-food images, independent of state. This suggests that although food stimuli motivate approach behavior, stimulus relevance does not impact inhibitory control in healthy individuals, nor interact with motivational state. These findings may provide some explanation for poorer inhibitory control often reported in studies of individuals who practice restraint over eating...|$|R

40|$|This work generalizes a {{multilevel}} Monte Carlo (MLMC) method in-troduced in [7] for the {{approximation of}} expected values of functions {{depending on the}} solution to an Ito stochastic differential equation. The work [7] proposed and analyzed a forward Euler MLMC method based on a hierarchy of uniform time discretizations and control variates to reduce the computational effort required by a standard, single level, forward Euler Monte Carlo method from O(TOL^(− 3)) to O(TOL^(− 2) log(TOL^(− 1)) ^ 2) for a meansquare error of size 2. This work uses instead a hierarchy of adaptivelyrefined, non uniform, time discretizations, generated by an adaptive algo-rithm introduced in [20, 19, 5]. Given a prescribed accuracy TOL in theweak error, this adaptive algorithm generates time discretizations basedon a posteriori expansions of the weak error first developed in [24]. Atheoretical analysis gives results on the <b>stopping,</b> the <b>accuracy,</b> and thecomplexity of the resulting adaptive MLMC algorithm. In particular, it isshown that: the adaptive refinements stop after {{a finite number of}} steps;the probability of the error being smaller than TOL is under certain as-sumptions controlled by a given confidence parameter, asymptotically asTOL → 0; the complexity is essentially the expected for MLMC methods,but with better control of the constant factors. We also show that themultilevel estimator is asymptotically normal using the Lindeberg-FellerCentral Limit Theorem. These theoretical results are based on previouslydeveloped single level estimates, and results on Monte Carlo stoppingfrom [3]. Our numerical tests include cases, one with singular drift andone with stopped diffusion, where the complexity of uniform single levelmethod is O TOL− 4. In both these cases the results confirm the theoryby exhibiting savings in the computational cost to achieve an accuracy of O(TOL), from O(TOL^(− 3)) for the adaptive single level algorithm toessentially O(TOL^(− 2) log(TOL− 1) ^ 2) for the adaptive MLMC.

Charged particle imaging determines the stopping power either tomographically – particle computed tomography (pCT) – or by combining prior knowledge from particle radiography (pRad) and x-ray CT. Generally, multiple Coulomb scattering limits the spatial resolution. Compared to protons, heavier particles scatter less due to their lower charge/mass ratio. A theoretical framework to predict the most likely trajectory of particles in matter was developed for light ions up to carbon and {{was found to be}} the most accurate for helium comparing for fixed initial velocity. To further investigate the potential of helium in particle imaging, helium computed tomography (HeCT) and radiography (HeRad) were studied at the Heidel-berg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre (HIT) using a prototype pCT detector system registering individual particles, originally developed by the U. S. pCT collaboration. Several phantoms were investigated: modules of the Catphan QA phantom for analysis of spatial resolution and achievable <b>stopping</b> power <b>accuracy,</b> a paediatric head phantom (CIRS) and a custom-made phantom comprised of animal meat enclosed in a 2 % agarose mixture representing human tissue. The pCT images were reconstructed applying the CARP iterative reconstruction algorithm. The MTF 10 % was investigated using a sharp edge gradient technique. HeRad provides a spatial resolution above that of protons (MTF 1010 %= 6. 07 lp/cm for HeRad versus MTF 10 %= 3. 35 lp/cm for proton radiography). For HeCT, the spatial resolution was limited by the number of projections acquired (90 projections for a full scan). The RSP accuracy for all inserts of the Catphan CTP 404 module was found to be 2. 5 % or better and is subject to further optimisation. In conclusion, helium imaging appears to offer higher spatial resolution compared to proton imaging. In future studies, the advantage of helium imaging compared to other imaging modalities in clinical applications will be further explored...|$|R

Method. Young adults (N = 29) diagnosed with ADHD were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen of Dexmethylphenidate, Atomoxetine, or psychotherapy. All participants engaged in the Stop-Signal task preand post-treatment. Response speed, latencies, <b>accuracy,</b> <b>stop</b> signal response times (SSRTs), and Event Related Potentials (ERP) served as outcome measures. Results: Pre-treatment weaknesses in oral language skills were observed. Exposure to overall treatment was associated with faster SSRTs and longer SOAs during successful inhibition. Post-treatment increases in right frontal N 2 amplitudes, decreased parietal N 2 amplitudes, and faster parietal N 2 onset was observed. Post-treatment increase in frontal P 2 amplitudes, and decreased central and parietal P 2 amplitudes were also evident. No significant BI-related behavioral or ERP changes were observed in Atomoxetine-exposed participants. Dexmethylphenidate-exposed participants showed increased zenith N 2 and P 2 amplitudes, as well as right frontal N 2 amplitudes during successful inhibition. Treatment with Dexmethylphenidate was associated with decreased parietal P 2 amplitudes. Changes in P 2 amplitudes most clearly distinguished the three treatment conditions. Conclusions. Overall treatment improved participants’ ability to anticipate environmental feedback and facilitated faster inhibition. Dexmethylphenidate notably affected BI-related frontal and parietal electrophysiology of ADHD adults, whereas Atomoxetine did not. Dexmethylphenidate effectively facilitated the function of fronto-parietal neural networks associated with preperceptual attentional and inhibitory processes. Dopaminergic, deep-brain basal ganglia circuits were implicated as central to BI-related deficits in young adults with ADHD. ...|$|R

In this study this filter characterizes the transfer function between a cylinder pressure and a measurement point. An engine is characterized by several filters (one for each cylinder) which are estimated for many operating conditions (engine speed and load). The purpose of this work is to obtain an averaged spectrofilter allowing the synthesis of combustion noise in all operating conditions. This synthesis should be accurate enough {{to be used in}} perceptive studies. In order to refine the spectrofilter estimation in the medium frequency band, this paper consists in taking advantage of the multitude of information given by the estimations from different operating conditions. To do this, an experimental model is adopted so modal parameters are extracted from a great number of measured filters. Different procedures such as the {ESPRIT} method or the {LSCE} method (modal analysis) are used to decompose the impulse responses on a complex exponential basis. The spectrofilters estimated from different operating conditions are analyzed and compared in this reduced basis, in order to identify the underlying structural parameters.

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) {{are used to}} provide safer and better transport services to ensure people’s mobility. Digital ecosystems, analogous to natural ecosystems, are self-evolving and self-sustaining. A small scale ITS system that bears {{the characteristics of a}} digital ecosystem was designed and developed in this PhD study. Based on the Internet Engineering Task Force presence model, the system was designed with three discrete but inter-connected components: an on-board device installed on a distributed network of shuttle buses; a central server; and a mobile application that allows users to access the system on the go. Using a combination of different communication protocols (e. g. HTTP, WSDL, SOAP, SSL), the system allows effective communication among the three components and ensures secured communication when needed. Using the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principle, the system software functions are designed to provide a stratum of services to the system, with the central layer of services designed to serve the other Connected Mobility Digital Ecosystem applications. Passengers’ travel patterns, shuttle bus travelling time on road, dwelling time at bus stops, and schedule adherence data was gathered and analysed. A historical data based prediction model was developed using an algorithm based on the historical travel data combined with the real-time bus travelling information. It incorporates variables of realtime bus travel speed, route distance, historical travelling time, and historical dwelling time at each stop before reaching a particular bus <b>stop.</b> The prediction <b>accuracy</b> of travel time by using historical data based model and linear regression model is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) method in comparison with the prescribed bus timetable. The evaluation results show clearly that the model based predictions of travel time from both linear regression and historical data based models show a significant advantage over using timetable. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy from the historical data based model consistently outperformed that using linear regression model in all the conditions, because the historical data based model has taken into account the dwelling time to improve the prediction accuracy while the linear regression model does not include the effect of dwelling time in its model. The system collects data from its distributed sensors (i. e. network of shuttle buses equipped with the on-board devices, and the passengers who use the app through smartphones), performs data analysis and predicts bus arrival time. While passengers utilise the system to better plan their travel, the system identifies the repeatable passenger usage patterns, which allows the dynamic scheduling of buses that optimises throughput. This process continues and forms an on-going digital ecosystem cycle, which allows better system performance and management. This system behaviour embodies the CMDE’s self-evolving, self-sustaining and mutual benefit design philosophy. An extensive evaluation study was conducted to assess the system’s usability and usefulness. Results showed that passengers highly value the system, with high ratings on the information sufficiency, accuracy, usefulness, relevance, and ease of use. The app’s main function, prediction of bus arrival time, attracted the most use.
