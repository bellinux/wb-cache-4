He scored once that season for Portsmouth in the League Cup against Peterborough United. Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to Christianity after a friend of his wife's invited him to church.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Admiral Fisher was {{prevented}} from ordering an improved {{version of the}} preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915. To obtain ships <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> doctrinal roles of battlecruisers, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.|$|E
5|$|Friedland {{was laid}} down at Lorient in January 1865 and {{launched}} on 15 October 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction {{time is not}} known, the budget for the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> industrial age. The ship began her sea trials on 1 May 1875, but was not completed until 20 June 1877. Friedland joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1878 and the ship bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax from 6–16 July 1881 {{as part of the}} French occupation of Tunisia. She was reduced to reserve in 1887 and decommissioned in 1893. Friedland returned to active duty in 1893, but was paid off in 1898 and condemned in 1902.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E

5|$|Richelieu {{was laid}} down at Toulon in 1869 and {{launched}} on 3 December 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction {{time is not}} known, it was probably due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy's budget which was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time, which were not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Age. The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875, but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron, of which she became flagship, until 10 February 1876. She was placed in reserve on 3 December 1879.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin {{and other}} pelagic birds are {{excellent}} bioindicators {{of the environment}} as they occupy a high trophic level. Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain and, as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, there is great potential for them to bioaccumulate heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers or internal organs and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by lipophilic substances as well as metals. In fact these surveys {{can be used to}} provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular pollutant, using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prosecution of offenders.|$|E
