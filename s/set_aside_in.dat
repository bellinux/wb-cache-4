5|$|C. Kluane National Park Reserve was <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> 1976, {{following}} the Kluane Game Reserve {{of the early}} 1940s. Subsequently, an eastern portion of the Reserve became Kluane National Park in 1993.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 54,800 beds were <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> Palestine and Egypt, {{including}} convalescence and clearing hospitals. There were 22,524 hospital beds available in Egypt. A hospital centre in the Deir el Belah and Gaza area along with stationary hospitals between Kantara and Ludd, could accommodate another 15,000 casualties. By August, casualty clearing stations or clearing hospitals were located at Ludd, Jaffa and Jerusalem, supported by medical stores depots at Ludd and Jerusalem. However, the Australian Stationary Hospital at Moascar {{only had a}} few beds available. No. 14 Australian General Hospital on the Suez Canal was full of malaria cases from the Jordan Valley with the overflow being treated in the No. 31 British General Hospital at Abbassia, Cairo.|$|E
5|$|The Emirates Stadium {{is served}} {{by a number of}} London Underground {{stations}} and bus routes. Arsenal tube station is the closest for the northern portion of the stadium, with Highbury & Islington tube station servicing the southern end. While Holloway Road tube station is the closest to the southern portion, it is entry-only before matches and exit-only afterwards to prevent overcrowding. Drayton Park station, adjacent to the Clock End Bridge is shut on matchdays as the rail services to this station do not operate at weekends nor after 10pm. £7.6 million was <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> the planning permission for upgrading Drayton Park and Holloway Road; however Transport for London decided not to upgrade either station, in favour of improvement works at the interchanges at Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park, both of which are served by Underground and National Rail services and are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The Emirates Stadium is the only football stadium that stands beside the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh and is just over 2 miles from London King's Cross.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Harrison, President William McKinley <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> forest lands, as did President Theodore Roosevelt, until Congress {{put a stop}} to the practice in 1907, by banning additional <b>set</b> <b>asides</b> <b>in</b> six western states.|$|R

(4) The {{judgment}} of the court affirming or <b>setting</b> <b>aside,</b> <b>in</b> whole or in part, any such regulation of the Secretary shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28 of the United States Code.|$|R
5|$|The United States Army had {{jurisdiction}} over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by {{a brief period of}} civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.|$|E
5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run off the edge and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability {{to see where the}} edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as a worm). Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers {{in a corner of the}} cage for later consumption; no other food items were <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> this fashion.|$|E
5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
50|$|While macOS {{can also}} read the NeXTSTEP format, Apple <b>sets</b> it <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> favor {{of two new}} formats of its own.|$|R
50|$|Welch {{wrote to}} Bullinger and soon {{met with him}} to discuss the {{relation}} of Paul's 14 epistles to the boundary line of Acts 28. Although Bullinger had written many times previously concerning Israel's <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> God's dealings at Acts 28, he had continued {{to write about the}} New Testament epistles without reconciling the fact that some were written before, and some after Acts chapter 28.|$|R
5000|$|The Council <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> $50,000 <b>in</b> 1967 {{and asked}} Barrett Reid, the Executive Officer of the Library Services Division of the Library Council of Victoria, {{to revise the}} 1961 survey.|$|R

50|$|Motions to <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> {{judgment}} <b>in</b> {{criminal cases}} are rare: in U.S. jurisprudence the writ {{of habeas corpus}} is the usual method of attacking a criminal conviction after the right of appeal has been exhausted.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1812, Congress {{passed an}} act which <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> lands <b>in</b> Arkansas, Michigan, and Illinois as payment to {{volunteer}} {{soldiers in the}} War of 1812. Mercer County was part of this [...] "Military Tract." ...|$|R

25|$|The entire Yaquina Bay area (and large {{portions}} of the Oregon coast {{to the north and}} south) had been <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> the 1850s as the Coast Indian Reservation. This did not last long, and on January 8, 1866, the Yaquina Bay area was opened up to white settlement.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 38 {{percent of}} Tanzania's land area is <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> {{protected}} areas for conservation. Tanzania has 16 national parks, plus {{a variety of}} game and forest reserves, including the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. In western Tanzania, Gombe Stream National Park {{is the site of}} Jane Goodall's ongoing study of chimpanzee behaviour, which started in 1960.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Crown Land's Alienation Act of 1868, which {{required}} that public notice be given of Crown Land which was to be permanently reserved from public, four Reserves were <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> Warwick in 1869. One of the four reserves was this Recreation Square which then became officially gazetted as such.|$|E

25|$|Alaska's United States Senators {{belong to}} Class 2 and Class 3. In 2008, Democrat Mark Begich, mayor of Anchorage, {{defeated}} long-time Republican senator Ted Stevens. Stevens {{had been convicted}} on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election. The conviction was <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{the state}} {{government}} announced a further 7.5 kilometre extension to the line, taking {{it as far as}} the northern suburb of Butler. Previously, Alannah MacTiernan, the Planning and Infrastructure Minister, had announced that funds of $2.1 million (2007) had been <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> the 2007-08 state budget for the Public Transport Authority to undertake preparation of the master plan for that segment of works.|$|E
25|$|The {{reserve for}} future claims {{liabilities}} was <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> an unusual way. The syndicate bought a reinsurance policy {{to pay any}} future claims; the premium was equal {{to the amount of}} the reserve. In other words, rather than putting the reserve into a bank to earn interest, the syndicate transferred its (strictly, its members') liability to pay future claims to a reinsurer. This was RITC – a transaction that allowed the syndicate to be closed, and a profit or loss declared.|$|E
25|$|The park {{is part of}} a 70-acre tract that Kennedy {{purchased}} in 1948, recorded restrictive covenants <b>setting</b> <b>aside</b> land <b>in</b> perpetuity as a wildlife refuge, and the following year subdivided, subsequently selling all but his own 4 acre parcel.|$|R

25|$|Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes is a {{collection}} of nursery rhymes written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1917. Potter had a lifelong fascination with rhymes, and proposed a book of short verses called Appley Dapply to Warne following the release of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902. Warne preferred Potter's original fantasies to her derivative work, and gave Appley Dapply little encouragement. The book was <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> favour of other projects.|$|E
25|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia in 2007. Mast and Thiele {{were not}} then ready to tender a new arrangement, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series, thus minimising the nomenclatural {{disruption of the}} transfer. Thus George's taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra was <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> <b>In</b> effecting the transfer, Mast and Thiele overlooked the six taxa published by George in 2005; these taxa thus retain their original, and now invalid, names.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 70s, in {{what became}} known as the Sino-Soviet split, the {{relationship}} between China and the Soviet Union became extremely tense. In competition with Soviet tank designers, the Chinese developed several tanks including the Type 59, Type 62, and Type 63 variants. The WZ-132 was also designed around this time; however, its technical indicators were too high for China at that time to produce it in large numbers and as a result, its specifications were changed several times before the design was <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> <b>in</b> 1975.|$|E
50|$|The city of Oakland has {{proposed}} a US$1billion redevelopment plan for the base.
