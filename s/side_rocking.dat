60|$|Terror {{took hold}} of Elsa, and running to the door she opened it hoping to escape down the stairs. Behold! water was {{creeping}} up them, {{she could see it}} by the lantern in her hand--her retreat was cut off. But there were other stairs leading to the top storey of the mill that now lay at a steep angle, and along these she climbed, since the water was pouring through her doorway and there was nowhere else to go. In the very roof of the place was a manhole with a rotten hatch. She passed through this, to find herself upon the top of the mill just where one of the great naked arms of the sails projected from it. Her lantern was blown out by now, but she clung to the arm, and became aware that the wooden cap of the structure, still anchored to its brick foundation, lay upon its <b>side</b> <b>rocking</b> to and fro like a boat upon an angry sea. The water was near her; that she knew by its seethe and rush, although she could not see it, but as yet it did not even wet her feet.|$|E
40|$|A two-straight-legged walking {{mechanism}} {{with flat}} feet is {{designed and built}} to study the passive dynamic gait. It is shown that the mechanism having flat feet can exhibit passive dynamic walking as those with curved feet, but the walking efficiency is significantly lower. It is also shown that the balancing mass and its orientation are etfective for controlling side-to-side rocking and yaw, which have significant effects on steady walking. The effects of various parameters on the gait patterns are also studied. lt is shown that changes in the ramp angle have the most dominant effect on the gait pattern {{as compared with the}} changes in the hip mass, ramp surface friction and size of the flat feet. More specifically, as the ramp angle increases, the step length increases while the range of the side-to <b>side</b> <b>rocking</b> angle decreases and the step length dictates the walking speed and the gravitational power Another finding, is that adding a hip mass improves the walking efficiency by allowing the mechanism to walk on a flatter ramp. This research enables us {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanics of walking. Such an understanding will have a direct impact on better design of prostheses and on the active control aspects of bipedal robots...|$|E

40|$|An exhumed crustal {{section of}} the Mesozoic Torlesse terrane {{underlies}} the Southern Alps collision zone in New Zealand. Since the Late Miocene, oblique horizontal shortening has formed the northeastern–southwestern trending orogen and exhumed the crustal section within it. On the eastern <b>side,</b> <b>rocks</b> are zeolite- to prehnite–pumpellyite-grade greywacke; on the western <b>side</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{they have the same}} protolith, but are greenschist to amphibolite facies of the Alpine Schist. Zircon crystals from sediments in east-flowing rivers (hinterland) have pre-orogenic fission-track ages (> 80 Ma) and are dominated by pink, radiation-damaged grains (up to 60 %). These zircons are derived from the upper f 10 km crustal section (unreset FT color zone) that includes the Late Cenozoic zircon partial annealing zone; both fission tracks and color remain intact and unaffected by orogenesis. Many zircon crystals from sediments in west-flowing rivers (foreland) have synorogenic FT ages, and about 80 % are colorless due to thermal annealing. They have been derived from rocks that originally lay in the reset FT color zone and the underlying reset FT colorless zone. The reset FT color zone occurs between f 250 and 400 jC. In this zone, zircon crystals have color but reset FT ages that reflect the timing of orogenesis. D 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

He made two first team appearances against Bristol City on 13 April 1907, and Middlesbrough on 17 April 1907, scoring once. Blanthorne was criticised at Anfield because he lacked 'speed and dash'.
