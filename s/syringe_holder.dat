40|$|Summary &mdash; The syringe guide {{consists}} of a long thick wire rod fixed to the <b>syringe</b> <b>holder.</b> This rod allows an inseminator to make all syringe-tip movements by moving the guide with his left hand. The right hand is then free to insert the syringe-tip and semen into the vagina, without the inconvenience of removing the hand from the syringe. The guide enables queens to be inseminated more quickly and with less discomfort. Construction of the guide is simple and economical. Apis mellifera / instrumental insemination / apparatu...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Fine-needle {{aspiration}} biopsy {{has been}} accepted worldwide for breast lesions. However, some questions remain, including {{the appropriateness of the}} puncture method. The objective of this work was to compare aspirates obtained by the auto-vacuum device and by the <b>syringe</b> pistol <b>holder.</b> DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized trial for validation of diagnostic method, at Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade Federal de Goiás and Hospital Araújo Jorge, Goiânia. METHODS: 351 patients presenting breast lumps underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy, either with the auto-vacuum device or the <b>syringe</b> pistol <b>holder.</b> A single cytopathologist analyzed all of the cytology slides. The rates of insufficient material, cellularity, cell distortion and background hemorrhage were evaluated. RESULTS: The percentages of insufficient material were 16 % and 22 % (p = 0. 18), for the auto-vacuum and pistol aspirates, respectively. Good cellularity was seen in 34 % of auto-vacuum and 29 % of pistol samples (p = 0. 4). Cell distortion was seen in 31 and 26 cases, respectively (p = 0. 7). Background hemorrhage occurred in 63 (35 %) and 54 cases (31 %) (p = 0. 2), for auto-vacuum and pistol. The sensitivity was 88 % and 86 %; specificity 99 % and 100 %, positive predictive value 96 % and 100 %, negative predictive value 96 % and 95 % and total accuracy 76 % and 75 % for the auto-vacuum and pistol, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results obtained from the two fine-needle aspiration biopsy methods were equivalent. Therefore, the auto-vacuum device is a good option for obtaining aspirates for cytology...|$|R

40|$|Fine-needle {{aspiration}} biopsy (FNAB) {{has been}} used throughout {{the world as a}} diagnos-tic tool for breast tumors. However, despite being a simple and practical procedure, the insertion technique has some peculiarities that must be taken into consideration. 1 Because of its motility, the operator must keep the lump in a single position with one hand. Thus, only the other hand will be free to hold the syringe, pull the plunger (to generate a vacuum inside the syringe) and make the forward and backward move-ments needed for locating and puncturing the tumor. The three maneuvers are simple; however, when performed at the same time, uneven results can ensue, as sometimes the volume of the aspirate can be greater or smaller. In addition, the pulling movement exerted on the plunger can occasionally dis-tract the operator, thereby causing a change in needle direction. These difficulties may make this method less than precise. 1, 2 In order to correct such difficulties, several health units have been using a pistol-grip mechanical <b>syringe</b> <b>holder,</b> first developed by Franzen and later modified by several manufacturing companies. 3 This pistol-grip mechanical <b>syringe</b> <b>holder</b> makes fine-needle aspiration biopsy much easier to perform. However, the use of the holder causes the distance between the tumor and the hand holding the device to increase. This decreases the sensitivity of the operator’s touch 4 and, moreover, the size of the assembled device frequently frightens patients, who may become less willing to collaborate in the procedure. 5 The present authors have developed a dif-ferent device with the purpose of facilitating the procedure and not frightening the patient. The idea consists of the interposition of a spring between the lateral wings of a disposable syringe and the plunger, so that the spring can exert a force on the plunger to cause distal traction, thus creating the required negative pressure inside the syringe. This vacuum would then be responsible for suctioning the collected material into the hollow needle. The operator no longer needs to actually create the vacuum, as the device does it by itself (Figure 1). This device has therefore been named the “auto-vacuum device”. 6 Initially, the physical characteristics of a steel spring that would fit into a 5 -ml syringe were defined at the School of Mechanica...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) cytology is {{a well-established}} diagnostic method {{based on the}} microscopic interpretation of often scant cytological material; therefore, experience, good technique and smear quality are equally important in obtaining satisfactory results. Aims of Study: We studied the use of fresh surgical pathology specimens for making so-called mock-FNA smears with the potential of cytohistological correlation. Additionally, we studied how this process aids the improvement of preparation technique and smear quality. Methods: Cytological aspirates from 32 fresh biopsy specimens from various sites: lung (20), lymph nodes (6), and breast (6) were obtained, all with a clinical diagnosis of tumor. Aspiration was performed from grossly palpable tumors. 25 G needle and Cameco-type <b>syringe</b> <b>holder</b> was used with minimal or no suction. Results: Unfixed surgical specimens provided sufficient cytological material that resulted in good quality smears. After standard processing of specimens into microscopic sections from paraffin embedded tissues, cytohistological case-series were created. No significant alteration was reported in tissue architecture on hematoxylin-eosin stained sections after the aspiration procedure. A gradual, but steady improvement was observed in smear quality just after a few preparations.

40|$|Background: Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) {{is a rare}} intricate pediatric neoplasm with varied clinical manifestations {{and multiple}} treatment modalities. Aim: To study the cytological features of LCH and the differential diagnoses on fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Materials and Methods: FNA was performed using a 23 -gauge needle fitted to a 10 mL syringe mounted on <b>syringe</b> <b>holder.</b> LCH was diagnosed on FNA smears in seven cases confined to {{the head and neck}} region, which included three cases of lymphadenopathy, three cases of scalp swelling, and one case of orbital swelling. Results: The age of the patients ranged from 25 days to 11 years and male-to-female ratio was 1 : 1. 3. Clinically, the diagnoses suggested were tuberculosis, inflammatory lesion, abscess, and malignancy. The cytologic findings included high cellularity, isolated Langerhans cells (LCs) with prominent nuclear indentation, grooves and abundant vacuolated cytoplasm, multinucleated giant cells, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Areas of necrosis were noted in one case. Histopathology, along with positive S- 100 immunohistochemistry, confirmed the diagnosis of LCH. Conclusions: LCH is a rare disease occurring predominantly in children and can be diagnosed with ease on FNA cytology by the presence of characteristic Langerhans cells. The S- 100 positivity aids in suggesting a diagnosis of LCH...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} method is described for the calibration of continuously recorded dye dilution curves. The accuracy {{of this method}} is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. ONE of the main problems in the use ofcontinuously recorded dye dilution curves has been the calibration of the obtained curves. Methods involving measurements from the "tail " of the dilution curve are often inac-curate because in {{this portion of the}} curve the concentration of dye is low. Other methods of calibration involve determinations from a sample of blood withdrawn before or after the dilution curve has been recorded. A method of calibration has been developed which avoids many of these difficulties. I t involves the use of a sample of the same blood which is being withdrawn through the cuvette for the inscription of the dye curve and is therefore of a much higher concentration. The calibration is carried out by determining the mean concentration of dye in the sample and determining the mean deflection over the period of the collection. METHOD To obtain a constant rate of withdrawal and for the collection of an integral sample, a syringe pump was designed (fig. 1). * The pump is electrically driven and a four speed tansmission drives a hori-zontal shaft (ram) either forward or backward. The end of the shaft is attached to the syringe plunger, so that the pump may be used for either injection or withdrawal of fluid.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a trend towards {{combining}} multiple forms of additive manufacturing together for increased functionality, freedom and efficiency. In this work, two forms of multiple-material additive manufacturing technologies - inkjet and direct-ink writing - are combined in a hybrid system. Several advantages are realized due to the increased material library and geometric freedom as a result of new printing modalities. Initially, models of each process are reviewed and the processes are evaluated for compatibility. Then, the precision machine design of a passively-indexed, carousel-style, <b>syringe</b> tool <b>holder</b> is completed. An error budget employing Homogeneous Transformation Matrices was maintained to estimate the tooltip errors. In order to register these two non-contact printing processes, a unique approach to their registration to a common global origin was necessary. A single non-contact optical CCD micrometer is used to register the three spatial coordinates of the syringe tooltip. Measurements are performed to characterize the repeatability of the nozzle registration scheme and the constructed gantry and carousel system, which well exceeds the requirements and the predictions from the conservative error budget. This novel system can print with a wide array of inks, including those that solidify via polymerization or crosslinking, two part chemistries, solvent evaporation or sintering, as well as liquids, gels and pastes. These materials can have a wide range of mechanical properties and functionalities, for example electrical conductivity or force sensitive resistivity. Models for the extrudate flow rate are used alongside experimental determination of the extrudate cross-section to ensure accurate process congruence. Finally, printed results demonstrate the various printing techniques, highlight the expanded material library, and display novel assemblies not possible with conventional additive processes. One such example is a fully printed pressure sensor array. by Nicholas Graham Bandiera. Thesis: S. M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2017.

40|$|Abstract Background Due to {{difficulty}} in confirming clinical suspicions of malignancy in patients presenting with bone tumours, {{the cost of}} surgical biopsies where hospital charges are borne almost entirely by patients, competition with bone setters and healing homes with high rate of loss to follow up; {{we set out to}} find if sufficient material could be obtained to arrive at reliable tissue diagnosis in patients with clinical and radiological evidence of bone tumours in our hospitals. Methods After initial clinical and plain radiographic examinations, patients were sent for fine needle aspirations. Aspirations were carried out with size 23 G needles of varying lengths with 10 ml syringes in a <b>syringe</b> <b>holder</b> (CAMECO, Sebre Medical, Vellinge, Sweden). The aspirates were air dried, stained by the MGG method and examined microscopically. Histology was performed on patients who had subsequent surgical biopsy. These were then correlated with the cytology reports. Results Out of 96 patients evaluated, [57 males, 39 females, Mean age 31. 52 years, Age Range 4 – 76 years,] material sufficient for diagnosis was obtained in 90 patients. Cytological diagnosis of benign lesions was made in 40 patients and malignant in 47. Of these, 27 were metastases, osteogenic sarcoma 16, giant cell tumour 19, infection 11. Histology was obtained in 41 patients. Correct diagnosis of benignity was made in 17 out of 18 cases, malignancy in 21 out of 22 cases. One non-diagnostic case was malignant. The accuracy of specific cytological diagnosis was 36 / 41 (87. 8 %) and incorrect in 5 / 41 (12. 2 %). Conclusion We conclude that FNAC can be useful in the pre-operative assessment of bone tumours especially where other diagnostic modalities are unavailable. </p...|$|E
