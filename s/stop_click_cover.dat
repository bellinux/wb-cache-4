5000|$|In several languages, {{including}} Nama and Juǀ'hoan, the alveolar click types [...] and [...] only occur, or preferentially occur, before back vowels, {{whereas the}} dental and palatal clicks occur before any vowel. The effect is most noticeable {{with the high}} front vowel [...] In Nama, for example, the diphthong [...] is common but [...] is rare after alveolar clicks, whereas {{the opposite is true}} after dental and palatal clicks. This is a common effect of uvular or uvularised consonants on vowels in both click and non-click languages. In Taa, for example, the back-vowel constraint is triggered by both alveolar <b>clicks</b> and uvular <b>stops,</b> but not by palatal clicks or velar stops: sequences such as [...] and [...] are rare to non-existent, whereas sequences such as [...] and [...] are common. It is also triggered by labial clicks, though not by labial <b>stops.</b> <b>Clicks</b> subject to this constraint involve a sharp retraction of the tongue during release.|$|R
25|$|Most old cameras had a {{continuously}} variable aperture scale, with each full stop marked. Click-stopped aperture came into common {{use in the}} 1960s; the aperture scale usually had a <b>click</b> <b>stop</b> at every whole and half stop.|$|R
5000|$|... 1.) Rectilinear stitching. This {{involves}} {{the rotation of}} a digital camera, typically in the portrait (up and down) position and centered directly over the tripod. As the operator manually rotates the camera clockwise, the camera <b>stops</b> or <b>clicks</b> into a detent at regular intervals, such as every 30° of rotation. The rotator can be adjusted by changing the position of [...] "detent ring or bolt," [...] into another slot, to alter the interval of rotation: 40°, 60°, 90° etc.|$|R
5000|$|Evoked otoacoustic {{emissions}} are currently evoked using three different methodologies. Stimulus Frequency OAEs (SFOAEs) are measured during {{the application of}} a pure-tone stimulus, and are detected by the vectorial difference between the stimulus waveform and the recorded waveform (which consists of the sum of the stimulus and the OAE). Transient-evoked OAEs (TEOAEs or TrOAEs) are evoked using a click (broad frequency range) or toneburst (brief duration pure tone) stimulus. The evoked response from a <b>click</b> <b>covers</b> the frequency range up to around 4 kHz, while a toneburst will elicit a response from the region that has the same frequency as the pure tone. Distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs) are evoked using a pair of primary tones [...] and [...] with particular intensity (usually either 65 - 55 dBSPL or 65 for both) and ratio (...) [...] The evoked responses from these stimuli occur at frequencies (...) mathematically related to the primary frequencies, with the two most prominent being [...] (the [...] "cubic" [...] distortion tone, most commonly used for hearing screening) and [...] (the [...] "quadratic" [...] distortion tone, or simple difference tone).|$|R

5000|$|There {{are also}} preglottalized nasal clicks.

They are considered unitary consonants, and not sequences of glottal <b>stop</b> plus nasal <b>click.</b> They are only reported from a few languages: Taa, Ekoka !Kung, and ǂHoan. (Taa also has preglottalized non-click nasals, though Ekoka apparently does not.) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{optimization}} {{approach can}} be elaborated to consider additional characteristics of keyboard function. For example, a popular approach is to enable predictive typing, where the keyboard monitors what is typed and presents a list of options and the user can select a full word after entering the first few letters. Such a feature carries {{both positive and negative}} aspects for users of switch keyboards. On the positive side, it may require entering fewer characters to type common words and thereby it may speed communication. On the negative side, navigating to the list of choices requires the user to guide the cursor to the list (either with a linear cursor path or in a hierarchical structure). There is, of course, a risk of a selection error when trying to reach an item in the prediction list, and an error in that context may alter the list and thereby render the system rather difficult to work with. If a prediction system is part of a keyboard, then {{there is a need to}} optimize its design within the keyboard, and the approach we have presented here can be modified to provide such optimization. Similarly, it is important to consider how users would correct errors with a switch keyboard. Error correction with a switch keyboard using a delete or undo command can only be initiated by the user guiding the cursor to an appropriate action key. To correct past text, switch keyboards have action keys that move a marker in the text (e.g., up a line or down a page). Some switch keyboards also allow for control of mouse actions (movement, hold, drag, select, <b>stop,</b> <b>click,</b> and double-click commands), which can be used to fix errors, among other things. Such command keys should also be optimized according to their frequency of use for a given user.|$|R
5000|$|A few {{languages}} {{also have}} preglottalized nasal clicks. These are pronounced like ordinary voiced nasal clicks, but are {{preceded by a}} very short period of prenasalization that has a glottal-stop onset. They are considered unitary consonants, and not sequences of glottal <b>stop</b> plus nasal <b>click.</b> They are reported from Taa, Ekoka !Kung, and ǂ’Amkoe. (Taa and Ekoka !Kung also have preglottalized nasals [...]) In one dialect of Gǀui, glottalized nasal clicks before pharyngealized vowels have become preglottalized nasal clicks, perhaps under the influence of ǂ’Amkoe.|$|R

We report the temporal measures of burst duration, relative burst amplitude and rise time, {{as well as the}} spectral value of center of gravity in the click bursts. COG correlates with lingual cavity volume. We show that there is inter-speaker variation in the acoustics of the palatal click, which we expect to correlate with a difference in the anterior constriction release dynamics. We show that burst duration, amplitude and rise time are correlated, similar to the correlation found between rise time and frication duration in affricates.

5000|$|However, it {{has become}} {{standard}} to analyse clicks as simplex segments, as {{research has shown that}} the front and rear articulations are not independent, and to use <b>click</b> symbols to <b>cover</b> the rear articulation as well, with diacritics rather than digraphs for the accompaniments.

5000|$|The first camera, the SLV, {{was born}} with the 6X7 / 6X9 format, with a {{rotating}} back with <b>click</b> <b>stop</b> each 90 degrees and the lens, a Super Angulon 5,6/47 mm in focusing helical mount by Schneider, was not interchangeable. The shift mechanism permitted a total rise or fall of 25 mm, it consisted in a control knob and two counter posed screws right/left and allowed a precise setting and locking of the shift. The attachment of the roll film back was Graflex compatible that opened the system to the application of various backs like Mamiya, Horseman, Wista, etc. The image viewing and the focusing were made on the round glass by mean of a magnifying lens in a leather bellows. The whole camera structure was made in anodized aluminium worked with CNC machineries, ensuring constructive exactness and reliability.|$|R
25|$|Vocal {{imitation}} occurs potentially {{in regard}} to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use consonantal phones that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract place of articulations (from the lips to the glottis). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable manner of articulations (nasal <b>stops</b> to lateral <b>clicks).</b> Speech can be copied {{in regard to}} its social accent, intonation, pitch and individuality (as with entertainment impersonators). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, timbre, pitch, loudness and emotion. Speech further exists in different forms such as song, verse, scream and whisper. Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in regional dialects and foreign accents. These aspects are readily copied: people asked to repeat speech-like words imitate not only phones but also accurately other pronunciation aspects such as fundamental frequency, schwa-syllable expression, voice spectra and lip kinematics, voice onset times, and regional accent.|$|R
5000|$|The M5 has {{the largest}} M shutter speed dial. It is coaxial with the shutter button and {{overhangs}} the top plate, making for very comfortable and quick manipulation, adjustable without taking the camera from your eye. This ergonomic feature is often cited {{as one of the}} M5's paradigmatic advantages, and a non-coaxial variant was later reintroduced as of the M6 TTL (1998). The M5 is the only full-size M with shutter speeds visible in the finder. It allows reliable, linear intermediate speeds between full <b>click</b> <b>stops</b> from the 1/1000 through to the 1/2 second setting. The speed dial is additionally engraved with [...] "B" [...] (Bulb) speeds from 1 to 30 seconds. These settings are coupled with the light meter, but the exposure time must be manually implemented using a cable release. The camera's internal exposure timing mechanism disengages below the 1/2 second setting. The shutter release button is threaded for a standard cable release. The M5 is capable of making double exposures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{developers}} {{were focused}} on the idea they had for the game from the beginning. The visual style and gameplay were established early in the development, motivating the developers in how simply the development process progressed. In {{the first months of}} its development, the developers had created a tool chain and approximately 90% of the gameplay functionality. Two features of the game were unclear to the developers during development; a [...] "troop manipulation" [...] mechanic, a common feature found in other real-time strategy video games that allows players to control the movements of their units, was a feature that the developers wanted to include. They attempted to include it by allowing players to drag units backwards or <b>stop</b> them by <b>clicking</b> on them, but felt that such a feature took away from tactical decisions and put too much emphasis on micromanagement and twitch gameplay. The developers added menus to the main gameplay late in the game. The final version was described by them as a [...] "very polished version" [...] of the vision they had of what they wanted.|$|R
5000|$|The MP5 has {{a hammer}} firing mechanism. The trigger group is housed inside an {{interchangeable}} polymer trigger module (with an integrated pistol grip) and {{equipped with a}} three-position fire mode selector {{that serves as the}} manual safety toggle. The [...] "S" [...] or Sicher position in white denotes weapon safe, [...] "E" [...] or Einzelfeuer in red represents single fire, and [...] "F" [...] or Feuerstoß (also marked in red) designates continuous fire. The SEF symbols appear {{on both sides of the}} plastic trigger group. The selector lever is actuated with the thumb of the shooting hand and is located only on the left side of the original SEF trigger group or on both sides of the ambidextrous trigger groups. The safety/selector is rotated into the various firing settings or safety position by depressing the tail end of the lever. Tactile <b>clicks</b> (<b>stops)</b> are present at each position to provide a positive stop and prevent inadvertent rotation. The [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger by blocking the hammer release with a solid section of the safety axle located inside the trigger housing.|$|R

They do not reflect those of AT&T Corp. nor those of ZoEmail LLC. 1 Key Ideas A spammer can’t send you email if he doesn’t know your address. The patented[3] Email Channels technology[1, 2], invented and originally developed by me during {{the latter half of the}} 1990 s at AT&T Laboratories Research and currently being commercialized by ZoEmail LLC[4], allows a user effectively to have many variants of a common “base ” address, with each variant to be used by a different set of correspondents. The variants, also known as channels or channelized addresses, are chosen so that knowing one will not reveal any of the others. Typically, a user would allocate a channel for private use by each close friend or colleague, ones for use by particular companies, services, or websites, and general public channels for use on business cards and personal web pages. By having many channels, if a correspondent sends spam and won’t <b>stop,</b> one simply <b>clicks</b> “close channel” and that person’s future messages are rejected by the mail servers before they are accepted and stored on the ISP’s machine, before they are downloaded through a slow modem link, and most importantly before the user sees them. (There is also an option to “switch ” the channel of a legitimate correspondent, in case that correspondent has accidentally leaked the channel address to a spammer.) 1 Channelized address formats. There are many ways to embed the channel identification into a standards-compliant email address. Current channelized systems (including my original system and ZoEmail LLC’s first release) insert the channel identifier, a substantially unguessable character string uniquely designating the channel, between hyphens immediately to the left of the at-sign...|$|R
