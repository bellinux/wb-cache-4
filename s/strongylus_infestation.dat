40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} four cases of Ctenocephalides felis <b>strongylus</b> <b>infestation</b> in buffalo calves of district Toba Tek Singh, Punjab, Pakistan. The infested animals were suffering from pyrexia, alopecia, hyperkeratinization, accelerated pulse, tachypnea, depression, anemic mucous membranes and ataxia (n= 3). Flea infestation was generalized with higher infestation in hairy areas of body especially legs, flank and mane. Microscopic {{examination of the}} peripheral blood revealed moderate (n= 2) to high (n= 2) numbers of piroplasms. All four calves were treated with ivermectin (Ivomec, Merial, France; 0. 02 mg/kg) twice at 15 days intervals. The treated calves were found aparasitemic on day 10 th post treatment. The three cases recovered in 10 days after completion of {{the second round of}} treatment. One calf died 8 days after second treatment on day 11. However, the vector role of Ctenocephalides felis strongylus may be better studied on conventional/ molecular grounds using salivary glands of the specimens...|$|E
