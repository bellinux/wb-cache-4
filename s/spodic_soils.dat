50|$|<b>Spodic</b> <b>soils</b> {{refer to}} a {{diagnostic}} subsurface horizon defined by the illuvial accumulation of organic matter. Iron oxide can be present or absent, and the soil is generally derived from a sandy parent material. Spodic may also refer to the taxonomic soil order spodosols.|$|E
50|$|The arid {{climate of}} the Late Triassic was {{interrupted}} by the markedly more humid conditions of the Carnian Pluvial Event (CPE).Evidences of increased rainfall during the CPE are 1) the development of palaeosols (histic and <b>spodic</b> <b>soils)</b> typical of tropical humid climate with a positive water budget throughout the year; 2) hygrophytic palynological assemblages that reflect a vegetation more adapted to humid climate; 3) siliciclastic sediment input into the basins due to increased continental weathering and runoff; 4) the widespread presence of amber.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} three hypotheses in a nutrient dose {{and application}} frequency study installed in juvenile (aged 2 – 6 years old) Pinus stands at 22 {{sites in the}} southeastern United States. At each site, eight or nine treatments were installed where nitrogen was applied at different rates (0, 67, 134, 268 kg ha− 1) and frequencies (0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 years) in two or four replications. Phosphorus was applied at 0. 1 times the nitrogen rate and other elements were added as needed based on foliar nutrient analysis to insure that nutrient imbalances were not induced with treatment. Eight years after treatment initiation, the site responses were grouped based on texture and drainage characteristics: soil group 1 consisted of poorly drained soils with a clayey subsoil, group 2 consisted of poorly to excessively drained <b>spodic</b> <b>soils</b> or soils without a clay subsoil, and group 3 consisted of well-drained soils with a clayey subsoil. We accepted the first hypothesis that site would be a significant factor explaining growth responses. Soil group was also a significant factor explaining growth response. We accepted our second hypothesis that the volume growth-cumulative dose response function was not linear. Volume growth reached an asymptote in soil groups 1 and 3 between cumulative nitrogen doses of 300 – 400 kg ha− 1. Volume growth responses continued to increase up to 800 kg ha− 1 of cumulatively applied nitrogen for soil group 2. We accepted our third hypothesis that application rate and frequency did not influence the growth response when the cumulative nitrogen dose was equivalent. There {{was no difference in}} the growth response for comparisons where a cumulative nitrogen dose of 568 kg ha− 1 was applied as 134 kg ha− 1 every two years or as 269 kg ha− 1 every four years, or where 269 kg ha− 1 of nitrogen was applied as four applications of 67 kg ha− 1 every two years or as two applications of 134 kg ha− 1 every four years. Clearly, the sites examined here were limited by nitrogen and phosphorus, and applications of these elements to young stands effectively ameliorated these limitations. However, there were differences in the response magnitude that were related to soil texture and drainage. Juvenile fertilizer applications resulted in high stocking levels early in the rotation; this condition should be considered when undertaking juvenile fertilization programs...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} in a chronosequence of Michigan <b>soils</b> (<b>Spodic</b> Udipsamments and precursors) was studied in thin section and by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass {{spectrometry}} (GC/MS). The Michigan soils {{were compared with}} a well-drained Dutch Typic Haplorthod that was studied with the same methods. Both techniques indicate that most B-horizon organic matter in the Michigan sequence is root- and char-derived and not due to illuviation. Microbial matter contributes significantly to B-horizon chemistry. Although charcoal is common in A horizons, it hardly contributes to soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry in this horizon, while it constitutes {{a significant part of}} B-horizon C. This suggests that silt-size particulate charcoal is transported downward. Nitrogen-containing pyrolysis fragments are abundant, which, together with significant amounts of aromatic components, points to contribution of proteins. The Michigan soils are far less rich in alkyl C than the Dutch counterpart. This suggests a much lower residual accumulation of recalcitrant compounds in the former, probably due to a larger contribution of root litter and a more efficient decomposition. Faster decomposition (shorter mean residence time) in the Michigan soils is also suggested by the low accumulation of SOM in the B horizon. Thus we can conclude that in the Michigan soils, dissolved organic matter contributes significantly to transport of Al and Fe, but essentially without illuviation of organic matter in the B. In the Dutch Spodosol, on the other hand, both transport of dissolved organic C to the B horizon and accumulation of SOM through decomposition of roots play important roles. Pyrolysis-GC/MS is a powerful tool in deciphering organic-matter-related aspects of soil genesis. The formation of many soils is organic matter driven, and this aspect is still poorly understood...|$|R
