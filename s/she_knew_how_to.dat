25|$|She was one {{of several}} Canadian pioneers in the film {{industry}} who were attracted by the rapid growth of the fledgling motion picture business. In 1906, she appeared in her first motion picture. The next year, she appeared in 38 movies for the Vitagraph film company. During {{the spring and summer of}} 1906, Lawrence auditioned for a number of Broadway productions, with no success. However, on December 27, 1906, she was hired by the Edison Manufacturing Company to play Daniel Boone's daughter in Daniel Boone; or, Pioneer days in America. She got the part because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> ride a horse. Both she and her mother received parts, and were paid five dollars a day for two weeks of outdoor filming in freezing weather.|$|E
500|$|Though Spielberg {{complied}} with {{a request from}} Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that [...] "somewhat anonymous" [...] performers would help the audience [...] "believe this was happening to {{people like you and}} me", whereas [...] "stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes... corrupt the story." [...] The director added that in his plans [...] "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.|$|E
500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it {{put her in the}} same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, at least <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly. She was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1933, Shutta was {{featured}} on the Nestle Chocolateers program. A review in the October 1933 issue of Radio Fan-Fare magazine described Shutta as [...] "a foolproof radio attraction. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sing songs, and <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sell 'em." [...] She and Olsen were heard on the Oldsmobile Program on CBS radio in 1933.|$|R

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed all three of Swift's prior music videos. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she felt that since Fanjoy directed her prior videos, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deviate from it and what new grounds to cover. As opposed to their previous collaborations, the video was conceptualized to be edgy and comical. Swift herself was styled edgier than usual, sporting clothing, hair, and jewelry she was not accustomed to. She was intended to wear thigh-length boots, but {{was not able to}} find a pair to correspond with her height. Instead, her stylist sewed black fabric to strap onto black high heels to give the illusion of thigh-length boots. The video's plot was conjectured to involve rampaging and seeking revenge on her ex-boyfriend. Swift chose football player Justin Sandy to portray her ex-boyfriend in the video, believing he had a classic and suspiciously perfect demeanor; she described him as [...] "real like Ken". Swift desired to portray her backup band's sense of humor, and thus enlisted them for the video. Swift's real-life best friend Abigail Anderson also made a cameo appearance in the video.|$|E

2500|$|Possibly no American ever {{enjoyed the}} {{friendship}} {{of so many}} distinguished people at home and abroad, and Blye had so many souvenirs of appreciation, gifts from almost every place she has been, and the unique and interesting collection demonstrated that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> value them. Among her hundreds of autograph photographs was one of Longfellow, who named her “the little golden-haired princess.” Bancroft, the historian, sent her baskets of roses from his rose gardens, saving: “Even the roses bloomed brighter in her presence.” There was also {{a picture of the}} gallant General Sherman, who gave her a letter to the Ambassador at the Court of St. James, James Russell Lowell, the poet, which read: “I send with this the sweetest poem in the English language, entitled Birdie Blye.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Satana then starred as [...] "Varla" [...] in the 1965 film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!—a very {{aggressive}} and sexual female character {{for which she}} did all of her own stunts and fight scenes. Renowned film critic Richard Corliss called her performance [...] "the most honest, maybe the one honest portrayal in the Meyer canon and certainly the scariest". Originally titled The Leather Girls, the film is an ode to female violence, based on a concept created by Russ Meyer and screenwriter Jack Moran. Both felt at her first audition that Satana was [...] "definitely Varla." [...] The film was shot on location in the desert outside Los Angeles during days when the weather was more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and freezing nights, with Satana clashing regularly with teenage co-star Susan Bernard due to Bernard's mother's reportedly disruptive behavior on the set. Meyer said Satana was [...] "extremely capable. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> handle herself. Don't fuck with her! And {{if you have to}} fuck her, do it well! She might turn on you!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Nancy Cooey, Kahlo {{made herself}} through her {{paintings}} into [...] "the main character {{of her own}} mythology, as a woman, as a Mexican, and as a suffering person ... <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> convert each into a symbol or sign capable of expressing the enormous spiritual resistance of humanity and its splendid sexuality". Similarly, Nancy Deffebach has stated that Kahlo [...] "created herself as a subject who was female, Mexican, modern, and powerful", and who diverged from the usual dichotomy of roles of mother/whore allowed to women in Mexican society. Due to her gender and divergence from the muralist tradition, Kahlo's paintings were treated as less political and more naïve and subjective than those of her male counterparts up until the late 1980s. According to art historian Joan Borsa, [...] "the critical reception of her exploration of subjectivity and personal history has all too frequently denied or de-emphasized the politics involved in examining one's own location, inheritances and social conditions [...] Critical responses continue to gloss over Kahlo's reworking of the personal, ignoring or minimizing her interrogation of sexuality, sexual difference, marginality, cultural identity, female subjectivity, politics and power." ...|$|E
