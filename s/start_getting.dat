25|$|This {{left the}} team {{in a state of}} disarray with the {{consensus}} view that the team should be disbanded. At that point, Radbourn offered to start every game {{for the rest of the}} season (having pitched in 76 of 98 games the season before) in exchange for a small raise and exemption from the reserve clause for the next season. From that point, July 23 to September 24 when the pennant was clinched, Providence played 43 games and Radbourn started 40 of them and won 36. Soon, pitching every other day as he was, his arm became so sore he couldn't raise it to comb his hair. On game day he was at the ballpark hours before the <b>start,</b> <b>getting</b> warmed up. He began his warm up by throwing just a few feet, increasing the distance gradually until he was pitching from second base and finally from short centerfield.|$|E
25|$|Result: Platinum {{got out to}} {{an early}} <b>start,</b> <b>getting</b> some {{relatively}} good discounts on their first few items, but things were marred by infighting among the sub-team of David, Amy and Lucy. The team also struggled to find {{some of the more}} expensive items on the list, and were late back to the Coliseum. None of the Odyssey members started buying anything until three hours in, with the sub-team of Patrick, Maria and Navdeep spending a further three hours doing research. Their research did pay off however, as they got some significant discounts on the items that they did buy. Ultimately the teams both bought only five of the ten items each. However, Platinum were cost dearly by being late and not buying a second-hand car, the most expensive item on the list and correspondingly the one with the biggest fine. Platinum's total spend was £2,204, and Odyssey's total spend was £2,033.|$|E

25|$|The race {{had several}} attacks, the first {{meaningful}} one coming in only lap five from Aksana Papko of Belarus {{in an early}} bid to match her countryman Aliaksandr Lisouski's victory in the men's race on day one. She was chased down by a small group that included Svetlanan Paulikaite of Lithuania, Svitlana Halyuk of Ukraine and Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands. The rest of the bunch was very attentive {{at this early stage}} and they were soon back together. Paulikaite struck out alone, but her effort did not come to anything. A crash in the middle period of the race took down Catherine Cheatley of New Zealand and Spain's Gema Pascual Torrecilla after a touch of wheels near the back. Cheatley rejoined after a few minutes, but Torrecilla pulled out having fallen more heavily. More attacks continued, but all were reeled. With less than eight laps to go, Van Dijk struck out alone and no one else reacted. She overtook the Danish rider Trine Schmidt from an earlier escape and had soon almost half lap lead. The rest of the riders did not react and looked to each other. Despite having almost half a lap {{on the rest of the}} bunch, Van Dijk refused to <b>start</b> <b>getting</b> complacent and kept going. When a chase did materialise, it was too late and Van Dijk finished alone with a considerable gap to take the gold medal and the rainbow jersey. Behind Van Dijk the sprint was won by the 2007 champion Yumari Gonzalez Valdivieso of Cuba, ahead of Belinda Goss from Australia. Annalisa Cucinotta of Italy was fourth and Rebecca Quinn from the United States of America finished fifth.|$|E

She also struggled {{to deal with her}} [...] "physical and emotional scars" [...] and soon developed agoraphobia. Toyah found support from her mother and neighbour Charlie Ramsden (Clare McGlinn), who revealed that she had once been raped. Taylor told Inside Soap's Allison Maund that Charlie's advice really helped Toyah to <b>start</b> <b>getting</b> back on her feet. However, the process was hampered when Toyah received an anonymous phone call, which left her feeling [...] "extremely frightened". The phone call sparked [...] "a terrifying event" [...] in which Toyah's rapist was finally revealed to be her friend Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam). When Phil came round to comfort Toyah, she recognised his voice as he called out her name and realised that he was her rapist. While Toyah tried to escape, Phil grabbed her and held her hostage. Toyah's screams were heard by Peter, who broke the door down and knocked Phil unconscious. A show spokesperson commented that Toyah would be left to worry about whether Phil would deny the rape and be convicted.|$|E

In the conclusion of his review VanDerWerff called the episode [...] "excellent and fun", and [...] "full of surprisingly gorgeous animation and a nicely creepy feel that hung over all of the jokes" [...] and rated it as a B+, the best rating between The Simpsons episode [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] and The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Browner". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the episode's writers for doing a [...] "solid job of creating a genuine mystery throughout the hour, keeping us guessing as to who did it and what their motive may have been". Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's numerous guest stars, and compared its portrayal of Diane Simmons to that of The Simpsons character Sideshow Bob. Natalie Zutter of Ology also praised the episode, calling it, [...] "Surprisingly, {{the best of the}} evening." [...] In the summary of her review, Zutter wrote that it was a [...] "fun murder mystery that lets us see all our favorite Quahog folks", while continuing to wonder whether the characters who were killed off would remain dead.|$|E
