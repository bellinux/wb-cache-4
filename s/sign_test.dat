40|$|<b>Sign</b> <b>tests</b> {{are among}} the most {{successful}} procedures in multivariate nonparametric statistics. In this paper, we consider several testing problems in multivariate analysis, directional statistics and multivariate time series analysis, and we show that, under appropriate symmetry assumptions, the fixed-$p$ multivariate <b>sign</b> <b>tests</b> remain valid in the high-dimensional case. Remarkably, our asymptotic results are universal, in the sense that, unlike in most previous works in high-dimensional statistics, $p$ may go to infinity in an arbitrary way as $n$ does. We conduct simulations that (i) confirm our asymptotic results, (ii) reveal that, even for relatively large $p$, chi-square critical values are to be favoured over the (asymptotically equivalent) Gaussian ones and (iii) show that, for testing i. i. d. -ness against serial dependence in the high-dimensional case, Portmanteau <b>sign</b> <b>tests</b> outperform their competitors in terms of validity-robustness.

50|$|The <b>sign</b> <b>test</b> {{requires}} {{only that the}} observations in a pair be ordered, for example x > y. In some cases, the observations for all subjects can be assigned a rank value (1, 2, 3, …). If the observations can be ranked, and each observation in a pair is a random sample from a symmetric distribution, then the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is appropriate. The Wilcoxon test will generally have greater power to detect differences than the <b>sign</b> <b>test.</b> The asymptotic relative efficiency of the <b>sign</b> <b>test</b> to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, under these circumstances, is 0.67.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sign</b> <b>test</b> is a {{statistical}} method {{to test for}} consistent differences between pairs of observations, such as the weight of subjects before and after treatment. Given pairs of observations (such as weight pre- and post-treatment) for each subject, the <b>sign</b> <b>test</b> determines if {{one member of the}} pair (such as pre-treatment) tends to be greater than (or less than) the other member of the pair (such as post-treatment).|$|E
50|$|If the paired {{observations}} are numeric quantities (such as the actual {{length of the}} hind leg and foreleg in the Zar example), and the differences between {{paired observations}} are random samples from a single normal distribution, then the paired t-test is appropriate.

However, if {{the distribution of the}} differences between pairs is not normal, but instead is heavy-tailed (platykurtic distribution), the <b>sign</b> <b>test</b> can have more power than the paired t-test, with asymptotic relative efficiency of 2.0 relative to the paired t-test and 1.3 relative to the Wilcoxon signed rank test.|$|E
