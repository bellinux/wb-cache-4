40|$|Enteric methane arising due to {{fermentation}} of feeds in the rumen contributes substantially to {{the greenhouse}} gas emissions. Thus, like evaluation of chemical composition and nutritive values of feeds, methane production potential of each feed should be determined. This experiment {{was conducted to}} evaluate several feeds for methane production potential and rumen fermentation using in vitro gas production technique so that low methane producing feeds could be utilized to feed ruminants. Protein- and energy-rich concentrates (n= 11), cereal <b>and</b> grass <b>forages</b> (n= 11), <b>and</b> different <b>straws</b> <b>and</b> shrubs (n= 12), which are commonly fed to ruminants in India, were collected {{from a number of}} locations. Gas production kinetics, methane production, degradability and rumen fermentation greatly varied (p< 0. 01) among feeds depending upon the chemical composition. Methane production (mL/g of degraded organic matter) was lower (p< 0. 01) for concentrate than <b>forages,</b> <b>and</b> <b>straws</b> <b>and</b> shrubs. Among shrubs <b>and</b> <b>straws,</b> methane production was lower (p< 0. 01) for shrubs than straws. Methane production was correlated (p< 0. 05) with concentrations of crude protein (CP), ether extract and non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) negatively, and with neutral detergent (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) positively. Potential gas production was negatively correlated (p= 0. 04) with ADF, but positively (p< 0. 01) with NFC content. Rate of gas production and ammonia concentration were influenced by CP content positively (p< 0. 05), but by NDF and ADF negatively (p< 0. 05). Total volatile fatty acid concentration and organic matter degradability were correlated (p< 0. 05) positively with CP and NFC content, but negatively with NDF and ADF content. The results suggest that incorporation of concentrates <b>and</b> shrubs replacing <b>straws</b> <b>and</b> <b>forages</b> in the diets of ruminants may decrease methane production...|$|R

40|$|In nature pigs spend a {{large part}} of their active time foraging, a {{behaviour}} in which their snout plays a big role. In an intensive system pigs have an extremely limited possibily to perform natural behaviour such as foraging. The floors in intensive modern systems are often bare and the pigs are provided with a restricted amount of bedding material. Inability to perform natural behaviours may lead to stress and development of stereotypies and is an indicator that the animal has trouble handling the environment. The animal can for instance be less active and {{spend a lot of time}} motionless. The objective of this study was to determine whether environmental enrichment in the form of a straw dispenser has any effect on the level of exploratory behaviour, activity and manipulation of penmates. The pen hygiene and amount of leftover straw were scored during the experiment to examine the effect a foraging tower had on hygiene <b>and</b> <b>straw</b> consumption.

Two Hanwoo cows (358 ± 10. 61 kg) fistulated at the rumen were treated with two replications of each treatment during the 63 –day experimental period. In accordance with TDN (total digestible nutrients) of the Korean Feeding Standard for Hanwoo (NISA, 2007), concentrates <b>and</b> <b>forage</b> (6 : 4 ratio) were provided twice a day, with a free access to mineral block and water. Using the in situ method with a nylon bag, disappearance rates in the rumen of DM, CP, NDF, and ADF were measured. CH_ 4 emissions were measured hourly using a hood–type chamber. Disappearance rates in the rumen of DM, CP, NDF, and ADF were higher in Klein grass hay, rice <b>straw,</b> <b>and</b> annual ryegrass <b>straw,</b> in that order, with significantly higher (p< 0. 01) in Klein grass hay than in rice <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> annual ryegrass.

40|$|Low feed quality, {{short periods}} of grazing each day {{and the need to}} search for forage are all {{constraints}} on cattle productivity in most parts of Africa. From the literature reviewed, it was observed that many factors affect the intake and utilization of feeds and that no single factor controls intake and/or utilization. Consequently, in the experiments in this thesis the effect of feed quality and limited time of access to the feed were investigated using stall-fed and grazing animals. The study determined the effect of these factors on the intake and utilization of legume <b>forage</b> supplement <b>and</b> low quality roughage. This was to provide a basis on which to develop a management strategy for using forage legume-based pastures (fodder bank) as a source of supplement for traditionally managed cattle maintained on the range. A series of experiments were undertaken to examine (a) the effect of restricted time of access to feed on intake and utilization; (b) the effect of feeding additional urea-molasses block on. ?. ? intake and utilization of low quality roughage <b>and</b> <b>forage</b> legume supplement; (c) the grazing pattern <b>and</b> <b>forage</b> selection of Bunaji cattle grazing open range or Stylosanthes-based fodder bank; (d) the growth and reproductive performance of Bunaji cattle maintained on open range, or supplemented on preserved natural pasture, or fodder bank with or without additional ureamolasses block. Results from a pen experiment on the effect of feedi ng <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> providing <b>forage</b> legume supplement for a limited time indicated that sheep were able to consume enough supplement to result in liveweight gain and wool growth even when daily access was limited to 0. 5 hours. In another experiment, limiting total access to feed to only 9 hours per day <b>and</b> <b>forage</b> legume offered for only 1 hour per day resulted in low feed intake and performance of the animals maintained on the low quality roughage alone. This indicated that provided there is access to good feed even for a limited period, animals are able to adjust their rate of eating and feed intake to support improved performance. Feeding urea-molasses block containing 12. 5 % urea to provide non protein nitrogen (NPN) while animals were confined at night improved the intake of the low quality roughage in stall-fed cattle without access to <b>forage</b> legume supplement <b>and</b> increased the intake of the legume supplement in those with access to both, but did not improve digestible dry matter intake. The dry matter (OM) disappearance of the low quality roughages and the legume from nylon bags incubated in the rumen of both sheep and cattle were significantly improved by the forage legume supplementation. This was associated with increased rumen NHJ-N concentrations. Although additional feeding of urea-molasses block after confining animals at night increased rumen NH 4 -N concentration in cattle, it did not increase feed digestibility possibly because of lack of continuous supply of enough NH 4 -N in the rumen for continuous fermentation of fibrous feed components. The immediate interpretation was that, because the urea-molasses block was fed at night, most of the additional N was excreted in the urine. The relationship between time of N provision and continuing fibre fermentation was therefore complex and sensitive to timing. Data from the grazing experiment indicated that cattle compensated for the low N content of the common range grasses by preferentially feeding on crop residue and browse plants during the dry season. Thus they were not as' adversely affected as they would have been if they had to consume only available range grasses. Crop residue and browse plants were most important to the group that had no access to the forage 1 egume fodder bank as supplement. The importance of browse plants increased as the dry season advanced. Animals in all groups were found to seek the regrowth of grasses from burnt areas of the range, especially {{at the onset of the}} rains when most of the Stylo h...|$|R

The {{differences of}} passage rate particles is considerably influenced by different feed consumption relating {{to the nature of}} feed, types of animals, and physiological status of animals. The purpose of this experiments was to measure differences of passage rate feed particles at various crude fiber feed in cows’ rumen. This experiment used two cows of fistulated crossed breed Frisian Holland (PFH), non-productive with the age of 4 - 5 years. Feed observed in this experiments were peanut <b>straw,</b> corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> fed as single feed. Method applied to measure passage rate was chrome mordanse/chrome and NDF as marker introduced through fistulated rumen. All data were analyzed by using regression. The value of passage rate (Kp) was about 3, 7 % per hour for peanut <b>straw,</b> <b>and</b> 2, 5 % per hour for corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw.</b> Kp value of peanut straw was higher than that of corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw.</b> The highest value of Kp for peanut srtaw was due to better quality of peanut straw compared to corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw</b> in which peanut straw contained high level of protein and low level of Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF). The differences of chemical composition of crude fiber feed from peanut straw with high level of protein and low level of NDF compared to corn <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> sugar cane <b>straw</b> resulted in degradation of feed by microbial rumen was higher, low rumination.
