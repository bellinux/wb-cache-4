5|$|The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs, a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E

40|$|The {{locomotive}} horn is {{an effective}} deterrent to accidents at grade crossings. However, the noise associated with the locomotive horn is often a quality of life issue in populated areas where trains operate. This paper examines why the sound from the locomotive horn is both an effective audible alarm and source of community annoyance. This paper also reviews the various FRA approved Supplementary Safety Measures (SSMs) that may be installed at grade crossings to effect <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive horn.

Hannibal broke box office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in February 2001, but was met with a mixed critical reception.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that the <b>silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen {{did not attend the}} court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been {{to gain access to the}} wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821–23) and Beornwulf (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{arose in the}} early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an {{assistant}} film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.|$|E

5|$|The dump months {{evolved over}} the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major {{releases}} followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like The Kid, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs, a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, Dirty Dancing and Fatal Attraction became hits following releases in August and September respectively.|$|E
5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a cameo role in {{the comedy}} The Ladies Man, Moore's only other {{appearance}} in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of Samuel Beckett's play Not I. In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Hannibal, a sequel to the Oscar winning film The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambs. Jodie Foster had declined to reprise the role, and director Ridley Scott eventually cast Moore, over Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Gillian Anderson, and Helen Hunt. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she {{was not interested in}} upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, Hannibal earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with David Duchovny in the science fiction–comedy Evolution, in her husband's dramatic film World Traveler, and with Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, and Cate Blanchett in The Shipping News. All three films were poorly received.|$|E
40|$|In Drosophila, {{heterochromatin}} causes mosaic <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> euchromatic genes brought {{next to it}} by chromosomal rearrangements. Silencing {{has been}} observed to "spread": genes closer to the heterochromatic rearrangement breakpoint are silenced more frequently than genes farther away. We have examined <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white and roughest genes in the variegating rearrangements In(1) w(m 4), In(1) w(mMc), and In(1) w(m 51 b). Eleven stocks bearing these chromosomes differ widely in <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> white and roughest. Stock-specific differences in <b>the</b> relative frequencies <b>of</b> inactivation of white and roughest were found that map to the white-roughest region or the adjacent heterochromatin. Most stock-specific differences did not correlate with gross differences in <b>the</b> heterochromatic content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rearranged chromosomes; however, two stocks, In(1) w(m 51 b) and In(1) w(mMc), {{were found to have}} anomalous additional heterochromatin that may act in trans to suppress variegating alleles. In comparing different stocks, <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roughest gene, which is more distant from heterochromatin, does not correlate with <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more proximal white gene on the same chromosome, in contradiction to <b>the</b> expectation <b>of</b> models of continuous linear propagation <b>of</b> <b>silencing.</b> We frequently observed rough eye tissue that is pigmented, as though an active white gene is skipped...|$|R
