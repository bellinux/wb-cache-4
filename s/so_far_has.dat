He and the other candidates, including former White Sox teammate Minnie Miñoso, all fell short of selection. The committee meets and votes on ten candidates selected from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Pierce received less than 4 votes of the required 12 votes from the committee at the MLB winter meeting on December 8, with no one elected to the Hall by the committee.

5|$|HMS Tiptoe (pennant number P332) was a British {{submarine}} of {{the third}} group of the T class. She was built by Vickers Armstrong, Barrow, and launched on 25 February 1944. She {{was one of two}} submarines named by Winston Churchill, and <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> been the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named Tiptoe. In 1955 she was involved in a collision with a coastal steamer whilst in Tromsø harbour. She was involved in escape trials off Malta in 1962, and the commanding officer was reprimanded in 1964 following an incident in the Firth of Clyde where she was run aground, and again in 1965 when she collided with HMS Yarmouth. Although originally named for the ability to sneak up on someone undetected, she maintained several links with ballet, including the Royal Ballet and ballet dancer Moira Shearer. She was scrapped in Portsmouth in 1975, while her anchor is on display in Blyth, Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that for every day since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>has</b> occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E
