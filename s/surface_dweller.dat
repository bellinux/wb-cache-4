50|$|Because Entreri has {{for so long}} defined {{himself by}} his {{fighting}} skills, he has several times worried about aging - less because of fear of death due to natural causes {{than the fact that}} aging will slow his reflexes and rob him of his fighting skills. This is particularly vexing to him because Drizzt Do'Urden, his great nemesis, is an elf, and will likely remain young and vital long after age has stolen his own fighting abilities and, eventually, caused him to die. In The Silent Blade and Servant of the Shard, it is implied that age has slowed him slightly. Age has only very slightly reduced his speed and agility — he is still capable of speedy and agile movements many younger fighters cannot even dream of — but, as Artemis has long prided himself on being the best of the best, it irks him to slow even slightly. In the short story That Curious Sword, Entreri accidentally infuses himself with part of the essence of a shade when he uses his jeweled dagger (capable of magically draining life energy) to kill the shade attacking him and Jarlaxle. Later stories and novels imply that this has greatly slowed his aging process, and perhaps even rejuvenated him to some extent. It is likely that Entreri is now as fast and agile as he was at his peak, and that his aging process has slowed to the point that he may live as long as Drizzt Do'Urden, or longer.

40|$|Benthic foraminiferal data {{as well as}} stable {{oxygen and}} carbon isotope records of {{different}} planktonic and benthic foraminifera from a shelf sediment core off southwest Mallorca document major sedimentological, hydrological and trophic changes during the Holocene. The Holocene relative sea-level rise resulted in the progradation of different sediment facies types characterized by specific benthic foraminiferal assemblages. This succession reflects the evolution from an unstable shelf ecosystem with high-energy conditions at the sea-floor in the earlier Holocene to a more stable shelf ecosystem {{in the middle and}} late Holocene. Between approximately 10. 3 and 5. 5 kyr BP, low delta C- 13 values of the <b>surface</b> <b>dweller</b> Globigerinoides ruber (white) and high difference in delta C- 13 values between the epifaunal Cibicides lobatulus and the infaunal Bulimina aculeata document enhanced input of nutrients in surface waters and high remineralization rates at the sea floor. The trophic change is associated with a change in sediment facies and can be attributed to higher precipitation and consequently, higher nutrient supply via riverine runoff from the island, mainly during the late summer/early fall season. This early Holocene humid interval is nearly contemporaneous to the formation of sapropel Si in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the African Humid Period. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

The benthic foraminiferal extinction event (BFEE) and Sr 3 C excursion {{was accompanied by a}} planktic foraminiferal turnover marked by an influx of warm water species (Morozovella and Acarinina), a decrease in cooler water species (Subbotina), a sudden short-term increase in low oxygen tolerant taxa (Chiloguembelina), and no significant species extinctions. These faunal changes suggest climatic warming, expansion of the oxygen minimum zone, and a well stratified ocean water column.

40|$|Profound biotic changes {{accompanied}} the late Cenomanian δ 13 C excursion and OAE 2 in planktic foraminifera in the Tarfaya Basin of Morocco. Planktic foraminifera experienced a severe turnover, though no mass extinction, {{beginning with the}} rapid δ 13 C excursion and accelerating with the influx of oxic bottom waters during the first peak and trough of the excursion. Species extinctions equaled the number of evolving species, though only the disaster opportunists Guembelitria and Hedbergella thrived along with a low oxygen tolerant benthic assemblage. The succeeding δ 13 C plateau and organic-rich black shale deposition marks the anoxic event and maximum biotic stress accompanied by a prolonged drop in diversity to just two species, the dominant (80 – 90 %) low oxygen tolerant Heterohelix moremani and <b>surface</b> <b>dweller</b> Hedbergella planispira.

Faunal evidence shows a decline of taxa of Miocene origin between 4. 5 and 4. 0 Ma at both sites. Prior to this decline, Globoturborotalita species and Neogloboquadrina acostaensis dominated Sites 806 and 847 assemblages, respectively. Globoturborotalitids were not replaced by other thermocline dwellers after 4. 2 Ma, which suggests a deepening of the thermocline and thickening of the warm pool at Site 806. At Site 847 in the eastern "cold tongue", N. acostaensis was gradually replaced by N. dutertrei.

The events in planktonic foraminifer evolution and ecology suggest that between 4. 5 and 4. 0 Ma a significant step was made toward development of the modern east-west gradient in surface hydrography.

40|$|The Intermediate Mode Waters {{formed in}} the Southern Ocean are {{critical}} for the lower thermocline ventilation process in the Southern Hemisphere Gyres. They also might have served as the most relevant pathways transporting climatic signals from high to low latitudes via the “oceanic tunneling” on glacial/interglacial time scales. Despite {{the importance of the}} Southern Ocean Intermediate Waters (SOIWs), our understanding on the long–term evolution, exact advection paths, and impact on the South Pacific Gyre’s thermocline is still fragmentary. Here, we present a 200 kyr record of paired Mg/Ca ratios and stable oxygen isotope from <b>surface</b> <b>dweller</b> and deep dwelling planktonic foraminifera, from the South Pacific Gyre (SPG). On average, the Mg/Ca–derived sea Surface Temperatures (Globigerina bulloides) show similar conditions during the LGM and Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 (9. 4 °C versus 9. 9 °C). In contrast, our Mg/Ca–derived subsurface temperatures (Globorotalia inflata and Globorotalia truncatulinoides) suggest LGM from 3 to 2 °C colder than MIS 6. The reconstructed subsurface ice volume corrected stable oxygen isotope ratio of seawater (δ 18 Osw-ivc, proxy for local salinity changes) suggests opposing glacial subsurface conditions, i. e., slightly saltier–than–Holocene during MIS 6 to fresher–than–Holocene during MIS 2. Considering that subsurface hydrography at the core site is plausibly driven by the formation and/or advection of SOIWs from the South East Pacific, our results provide further support on the relevance of subsurface processes in the Southern Ocean transferring climatic signals (temperature and salinity) to the SPG. Furthermore, the contrasting subsurface glacial scenarios at the SPG’s thermocline imply that the advection of SOIWs during glacial stages could be highly variable during different glacial stages...|$|E

The data is deposited at www. pangaea. de, (doi: 10. 1594 /PANGAEA. 837987). The impact of global change on marine ecosystems is a major concern for the future. Examples from the geological past may provide insight into how ecosystems respond to major shifts in environment. Here we use the progressive closure of the Central American Seaway over the last 10 Myrs, and the resulting new environmental conditions and niches on either side of the Panama Isthmus, as a time series documenting the reaction of planktic foraminifers to environmental change and vicariance. Our main finding is that the size and shape evolution of both investigated species is strongly influenced by temperature, despite their different ecology. The <b>surface</b> <b>dweller</b> Trilobatus sacculifer conserved the same shape on both sides of the Isthmus for most of the studied interval, and diverged only recently when environment diverged on both sides of the Isthmus. The shape response is a combination of a change in mean shape and in percentage of morphotypes occurring within T. sacculifer. This suggests a minor role of vicariance and the potential to react to changes in the local environment through ecotypic or plastic variation. This interpretation is corroborated by extensive phenotypic variability in the absence of genetic differentiation today in this species. The shape of the deeper-living species Gt. tumida, in contrast, diverged on both sides of the Isthmus at a time that coincides with the cut-off of the connection of its habitat. This divergence combines a response to temperature and to location, suggesting local adaptation in response to vicariance. These different reactions highlight both a high potential for adaptation, but also sensitivity to temperature variations. The species-specific responses to environmental pressures indicate the difficulty in upscaling from one species to foraminifers in general. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) in {{the ocean}} {{represent}} key regions for the interaction between atmosphere and ocean waters and can be a sink or source for atmospheric CO 2. Hence, they {{play a major role}} with respect to anthropogenic induced global warming. Biological productivity is very high in these areas and resulting degradation processes consume substantial amounts of dissolved oxygen from the water column, leaving certain water depths almost oxygen‐free. One {{of the largest and most}} distinctive OMZs worldwide stretches along the west coast of South America offshore Ecuador, Peru and Chile. This OMZ is associated with intense coastal upwelling, which is most pronounced between ~ 5 °S and ~ 25 °S. The intensity of the upwelling varies seasonally, being propelled mainly by external forcing mechanisms like the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the strength of trade winds and modulations of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This hydrographically complex ocean area affords different approaches to study its characteristics. Sediment surface samples and corresponding seawater samples from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP), ranging from a water depth of 60 to 2, 000 m and covering a large latitudinal range from the equator to 17 °S, were investigated. Apparent calcification depths (ACDs) were calculated by combined analyses of stable oxygen isotopes (d 18 O) in planktonic foraminifers from these samples and from water samples (Chapter 4). Investigations of ACDs for species G. ruber (white, morphotype sensu stricto) and N. dutertrei (dextral) show clear differences between both species within the EEP. <b>Surface</b> <b>dweller</b> G. ruber constantly inhabits the upper 16 meters of the water column; contrary N. dutertrei favors different habitat depths in dependence on the surrounding water masses. On average, the ACDs for N. dutertrei indicate a calcification depth of ~ 200 m in the northern part of the study area (the equator to 5 °S) and ~ 70 m in the southern region (7 ° to 13 °S). The shallower habitat depth in the south is probably related to the more intense upwelling, which results in the rise of cooler water masses and thus similar temperatures (~ 15 °C) are reached in shallower depths. Additionally, lower oxygen concentrations in the southern part of the study area are likely to force N. dutertrei to shallower habitat depths. The correct estimation of ACDs in the EEP provides a more detailed view on the vertical habitat of N. dutertrei, which is particularly important for the following paleointerpretations in Chapter 5. Two piston cores from the Gulf of Guayaquil at 3. 5 °S in the EEP were studied, covering time spans of ~ 13, 000 years (core 056; temporal resolution ~ 60 years) and of ~ 18, 000 years (core 059; temporal resolution ~ 80 years), respectively (Chapter 5). Surface and subsurface temperatures were reconstructed for the past 18, 000 years using alkenone thermometry as well as foraminiferal Mg/Ca‐based approaches for surface (Globigerinoides ruber, white) and for subsurface depths (~ 200 m; Neogloboquadrina dutertrei). Salinity approximations (d 18 Oivf‐sw) for surface and subsurface depths were generated to corroborate the high‐resolution temperature records. In the study area the deglaciation was characterized by much warmer temperatures (~ 3 °C) and higher salinities than nowadays, in surface as well as in subsurface depths. <b>Surface</b> <b>dweller</b> G. ruber and alkenone records show almost identical temperatures prior to ~ 10 ka BP, indicating that both proxy carriers recorded a similar habitat and seasonality during this time. After ~ 10 ka BP both proxies divert markedly, which was possibly caused by a shift of alkenone‐synthesizing coccolithophores from annual mean temperatures during the deglaciation to austral summer temperatures during the Holocene. The cooling in G. ruber records by ~ 2 °C in both cores during the Holocene implies a strengthened influence of cooler water masses. The surface records lag the subsurface records of N. dutertrei by ~ 1 ‐ 2 kyrs, implying that different mechanisms control the surface and subsurface hydrography. The temperature decrease and freshening trends during the Holocene coincide with an enhanced marine productivity, indicating that cooler (EUC‐sourced) water masses and strengthened upwelling intensity transported more nutrients into the EEP. A newly developed species‐specific transfer function for benthic Mg/Ca ratios based on Uvigerina peregrina data from the EEP is presented in Chapter 6 and completes the foraminiferal investigations. The sediment surface data set of endobenthic species U. peregrina shows a clear correlation between water depth and d 18 O as well as Mg/Ca ratios, thus supporting the use of this species as a reliable temperature proxy. The reconstruction of bottom water temperatures is important to understand the complex, local hydrography. The effect of bottom water delta [CO 32 ‐] on Mg/Ca ratios in U. peregrina is apparently small and does not influence the temperature signal. A compilation of data from the EEP and literature data results in a transfer function covering a temperature range between 5 and 20 °C; the resulting function (R²= 0. 77) estimates temperatures with a precision of ± 1. 6 °C. This new transfer function provides a more precise estimation of Mg/Ca‐derived temperatures in the EEP for endobenthic species U. peregrina than previous approaches...|$|E

However, on a commercial scale they are not really candidates for worm farming for providing fishing bait. The greyish brown common earthworms are deep burrowing (anecic) and do not readily breed in the shallow worm farm bins. The red compost worms, such as the well known red wiggler or the European nightcrawler, are better candidates, as they are epigeic, or <b>surface</b> <b>dwellers.</b> This {{is the reason that}} red worms are more usually available commercially for bait worms. Their natural home is just below the surface in rotting leaves, dung heaps and other plant litter. They are called detritivourous because they eat detritus (waste material).|$|R
