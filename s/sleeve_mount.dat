50|$|The cold stream {{system is}} known for {{structural}} integrity, reliability, and versatility. During thrust reverser activation, a <b>sleeve</b> <b>mounted</b> {{around the perimeter of}} the aircraft engine nacelle moves aft to expose cascade vanes which act to redirect the engine fan flow. This thrust reverser system can be heavy and difficult to integrate into nacelles housing large engines.|$|R
25|$|Evidence, from {{artifacts}} and the often large mosaics of great villas, indicates that one favorite sport of the agrarian elite was the hunt. Depicted are well-dressed sportsmen (in embroidered riding tunics with striped <b>sleeves).</b> <b>Mounted</b> on horseback they go cross-country {{in pursuit of}} illustrated game—here perhaps a jackal. Various wild birds are also shown as desired prey, to be gotten with traps. On {{the floor of a}} patio, a greyhound appears to be chasing a hare across the surface of its mosaic.|$|R

40|$|A {{subcutaneous}} electrode structure {{suitable for}} a chronic implant and for taking a low noise electrocardiogram of an active animal, comprises a thin inflexible, smooth disc of stainless steel having a diameter as of 5 to 30 mm, which is sutured in place to the animal being monitored. The disc electrode includes a radially directed slot extending in from {{the periphery of the}} disc for approximately 1 / 3 of the diameter. Electrical connection is made to the disc by means of a flexible lead wire that extends longitudinally of the slot and is woven through apertures in the disc and held at the terminal end by means of a spot welded tab. Within the slot, an electrically insulative sleeve, such as silicone rubber, is placed over the wire. The wire with the <b>sleeve</b> <b>mounted</b> thereon is captured in the plane of the disc and within the slot by means of crimping tabs extending laterally of the slot and over the insulative wire. The marginal lip of the slot area is apertured and an electrically insulative potting material such as silicone rubber, is potted in place overlaying the wire slot region and through the apertures...|$|R
50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, a docking <b>sleeve</b> or <b>mounting</b> boss is a tube or enclosure used {{to couple}} two mechanical components together, or for chilling, or to retain two components together; this permits two equally sized appendages {{to be connected}} via insertion and fixing within the construction. Docking sleeves may be physically solid or flexible, their implementation varying widely according to the required application of the device. The most common application is the plastic appendage that receives a screw in order to attach two parts.|$|R

50|$|Conventional SiC, or {{sometimes}} the less expensive SiSiC, {{have been used}} successfully for more than 25 years in slide or journal bearings of pumps. The pumped liquid itself provides the lubricant for the bearing. Very good corrosion resistance against practically all kinds of media, and very low wear and low friction coefficients are {{the basis of this}} success. These bearings consist of a static bearing, shrink-fitted in its metallic environment, and a rotating shaft <b>sleeve,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the shaft. Under compressive stress the ceramic static bearing has a low risk of failure, but a SiC shaft sleeve does not have this situation and must therefore have a large wall thickness and/or be specially designed. In large pumps with shafts 100-350 mm in diameter, the risk of failure is higher due to the changing requirements on the pump performance - for example, load changes during operation. The introduction of SiC/SiC as a shaft sleeve material has proven to be very successful. Test rig experiments showed an almost triple specific load capability of the bearing system with a shaft sleeve made of SiC/SiC, sintered SiC as static bearing, and water at 80 °C as lubricant.The specific load capacity of a bearing is usually given in W/mm2 and calculated as a product of the load (MPa), surface speed of the bearing (m/s) and friction coefficient; it is equal to the power loss of the bearing system due to friction.|$|R
30|$|The haptic device mainly {{consists}} of the base, the cuboid frame and cylindrical sleeve, the handle, three actuators, and photoelectric encoders. The proposed structure {{is similar to a}} three-axis gyroscope in which three axes are orthogonal and intersect at a fixed point (coordinate origin). The cuboid frame is mounted horizontally on the base and can be rotated around the X-axis. The cylindrical <b>sleeve</b> is <b>mounted</b> vertically to be rotated around the Y-axis. The handle is mounted coaxial with the Z-axis actuator in the cylindrical sleeve and can be rotated around the Z-axis. In this way, each kinematic freedom is independent and there is no motion interference which means kinematic coupling is mechanically avoided.|$|R
40|$|ISCST {{shall not}} be {{responsible}} for statements or opinions contained in papers or printed in its publications. Tri-helical gravure roll coating is a process which is used widely for depositing a thin liquid film onto a moving substrate. An analytic model of a simplified form of the process, that of rectangular grooves at 0 mesh angle, is presented together with supporting experimental results which confirm {{the validity of the}} model. Included also are interesting flow visualisations of the coating process, which for the first time shows the underlying physics of the process. Experimental Setup A schematic of the coating rig used to carry out the experiments is shown in figure 1. The apparatus utilises gravure coating rolls, of length 200 mm and diameter 100 mm, which can reach a maximum speed of URoll 100 m s; together with controls for web tension, velocity and wrap angle. The gravure rolls are comprised of an acrylic <b>sleeve</b> <b>mounted</b> with grub screws on a central steel core. This facilitates study of a range of groove geometries and aids the illumination of the fluid bead for flow visualisation purposes achieved by the injection of a small volume of coloured dye. Film thickness measurements were made by scraping fluid from the web over a known time interval. The residual fluid remaining after scraping was found to be negligible. The fluid used in the experiments is a Newtonian water-glycerol mixture with a small volume of surfactant to reduce surface tension. The viscosities used were in the range of µ 0 002 to 0 0075 Pas and with surface tensions of σ 0 033 to 0 065 N m...|$|R
50|$|The {{midshipman}} uniforms {{followed the}} CS Navy uniform regulations issued after 1862, requiring the uniform to be steel grey in color, lined with dark black silk serge. The jackets were coarse gray cloth material, {{and made of}} wool. The sleeves of midshipmen, like all officers, had three <b>sleeve</b> buttons <b>mounted</b> vertically. In lieu of stripe, mishipman had three small buttons with fouled anchors, and passed midshipmen had three large buttons with fouled anchors mounted horizontally. A midshipman had no shoulder strap, while a passed midshipman had a strip of gold lace four inches long and half an inch wide. The covers of both ranks of midshipman were also steel gray and contained only a horizontal gold officers band with a fouled anchor, and a black leather visor.|$|R

40|$|An online signal {{injection}} approach {{based on}} a special current transformer is proposed {{as part of a}} solution for improving the test setup of transfer function diagnostics of transformers. However, the method is general and applicable to many types of substation equipment, such as circuit breakers and transmission lines. The system allows a high-power, high-frequency test signal to be injected directly on a high-voltage bus of an energized system. Due to the self-contained nature of the injector, no external power supplies or signal generators are needed and the design {{does not need to be}} ground-referenced. The system can thus be at the bus potential. In conjunction with wireless communication for control, no isolator bushings are required and the device can be constructed as a <b>sleeve</b> to be <b>mounted</b> around the busbar. This allows for economical retrofitting to existing installations. In this paper, the operational need for such an injection device is discussed, followed by the theory behind the proposed concept. Finally, a low-voltage, optically controlled, self-powered prototype is designed and demonstrated online to show the practical validity of the concept. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{assemblage}} of Neolithic antler tools – sleeves originated from the lake-dwelling sites of Switzerland, which are stored at National Museum of Tatarstan Republic. The morphological and technological analyses of 94 connecting devices between the wooden haft and stone axe or adze (sleeves) {{have been carried}} out by the authors. The typology scheme has been made. Four unequal groups were singled out: 1) elementary device with one mounting hole for the stone tool of adze or chisel function (1 instance); 2) a pick-axe shaped device with hafting hole (1); 3) sleeve of cylindrical shape with two holes (4 instances); 4) <b>sleeve</b> with one <b>mounting</b> hole (88). The last one consists of 4 types depending on {{the presence or absence of}} clear-cut hafting part and functional or nonfunctional ledge as well as remnant of the burr.
