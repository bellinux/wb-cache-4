40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in the scientific literature on sports is that of the competitive balance (CB for short). In this paper we present a new index to measure the CB, named the <b>surprise</b> <b>index.</b> The <b>surprise</b> <b>index</b> has several comparative advantages vis-?-vis more conventional indices of CB. Firstly, it can easily be used to compare leagues over time, between different countries and even between different sports. Secondly, it enables us to say something about the optimal number of teams in a league. These advantages arise {{because of the way the}} CB is measured by the <b>surprise</b> <b>index</b> compared to more familiar CB-indices like the standard deviation or the concentration ratio. Whereas the latter only use the statistics of the final league table at the end of the season, the <b>surprise</b> <b>index</b> makes use of much more detailed information. The results of all matches within a competition enter into the formula. Moreover, it gives a relatively high weight to surprising outcomes within the league competition, whereas the saliency of these matches is lost when computing the standard deviation or the concentration ratio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{argues that}} chance (risk or opportunity) {{discovery}} is challenging, from a reasoning point of view, because {{it represents a}} dilemma for inductive reasoning. Chance discovery shares many features with the grue paradox. Consequently, Bayesian approaches represent a potential solution. The Bayesian solution evaluates alternative models generated using a temporal logic planner to manage the chance. <b>Surprise</b> <b>indices</b> are used in monitoring the conformity {{of the real world}} and the assessed probabilities. Game theoretic approaches are proposed to deal with multi-agent interaction in chance management. Key words: Bayesian confirmation, chance discovery, inductive reasoning 1...|$|R
40|$|A pure {{significance}} test would check {{the agreement of}} a statistical model with the observed data even when no alternative model was available. The paper proposes {{the use of a}} modified p-value to make such a test. The model will be rejected if something surprising is observed (relative to what else might have been observed). It is shown that the relation between this measure of surprise (the s-value) and the <b>surprise</b> <b>indices</b> of Weaver and Good is similar to the relationship between a p-value, a corresponding odds-ratio, and a logit or log-odds statistic. The s-value is always larger than the corresponding p-value, and is not uniformly distributed. Difficulties with the whole approach are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{official}} published version can {{be accessed}} through the link below. Through 4 experiments, the author investigated the effects of stimuli discrepant with schemas of varying strength on 3 components of surprise: the interruption of ongoing activities (indexed by response time increase), the focusing of attention on the schema-discrepant event (indexed by memory performance), and the feeling of <b>surprise</b> (<b>indexed</b> by self-reports). Response times were consistently found to increase with schema strength. This effect was attributed to the increasing difficulty of schema revision. In contrast, memory for the schema-discrepant event was not affected by schema strength, supporting the hypothesis that schema-discrepant stimuli are stored in memory with a distinct tag. Finally, self-reports of surprise intensity varied with schema strength only if they were made immediately after the surprising event without any intervening questions, suggesting that self-reports of surprise are highly susceptible to memory distortions...|$|R
40|$|For {{effective}} indexing {{of presentation}} speech such as lectures and seminars, we explore {{a novel approach}} based on detection of the audience’s interest level. In this work, we deal with poster presentations {{and focus on the}} backchannel responses or reactive tokens, which are fre-quently observed in poster conversations and presumably used for expressing the audience’s interest level. First, we note that the most common reactive token “hai (yes) ” is mainly used for acknowledging the speech segments, and that there are specific kinds of reactive tokens which can be used for expressing non-verbal information. Then, we made a prosodic analysis and identified effective combi-nations of the syllabic and prosodic patterns which ex-press interest and <b>surprise.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms: prosody, backchannel, reactive token, au-dio indexin...|$|E
40|$|The Sato Caution Index {{takes into}} account the number and {{difficulty}} of items gotten wrong by a student within his or her ability, as well as the number and difficulty of items gotten right beyond his or her ability. Sato subtracts the two components to define a single Caution Index. In this study, the components are kept separate, defining a Within Ability Concern Index (W) and a Beyond Ability <b>Surprise</b> <b>Index</b> (B). Using data from 10 -item testlets taken by 121 college students, the critical information made available by using the B and W Indexes in addition to the Sato Index is identified. The relationships of the three indexes to total score and the number of errors committed by the students within ability-level are examined. Factor analysis reveals that the new indexes can add a new dimension to test performance information provided by the Sato Index. Five tables provide analysis data.

More precisely, the aim {{of the present study was}} to examine {{the effects of}} the strength of the cognitive structure or schema from which the surprise-eliciting event deviates, on three components of the surprise syndrome, namely the subjective feeling of surprise, the interruption of ongoing activities and the focusing of attention on the surprise-eliciting event.

40|$|As a {{foundation}} {{for the remainder of}} the book, this chapter takes a tour through the elements of information retrieval outlined in Chapter 1, covering the basics of indexing, retrieval and evaluation. The material on indexing and retrieval, constituting the first two major sections, is closely linked, presenting a unified view of these topics. The third major section, on evaluation, examines both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the algorithms introduced in the first two sections. 2. 1 Inverted Indices The inverted index (sometimes called inverted file) is the central data structure in virtually every information retrieval system. At its simplest, an inverted index provides a mapping between terms and their locations of occurrence in a text collection C. The fundamental components of an inverted index are illustrated in Figure 2. 1, which presents an index for the text of Shakespeare’s plays (Figures 1. 2 and 1. 3). The dictionary lists the terms contained in the vocabulary V of the collection. Each term has associated with it a postings list of the positions in which it appears, consistent with the positional numbering in Figure 1. 4 (page 14). If you have encountered inverted indices before, you might be <b>surprised</b> that the <b>index</b> show...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the impact of}} U. S. monetary policy announcement <b>surprises</b> on equity <b>indexes</b> in sixteen countries, covering both developed and emerging economies. Using high-frequency intraday data, I find a large and significant response of Asian, European, and Latin American equity indexes to U. S. monetary policy announcement surprises at short time horizons. In this paper, I use two proxies for monetary policy surprises: a surprise change to the current target federal funds rate, and a revision to the path of future monetary policy (Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2004)). Consistent with results for the U. S. equity market, this paper finds that in most cases foreign equity indexes react only to a surprise change in the current target rate. On average, a hypothetical unanticipated 25 -basis-point cut in the federal funds target rate {{is associated with a}} 1 / 2 to 21 / 2 percent increase in foreign equity indexes. The variation of the response across countries appears to be more related to the degree of financial integration with the United States than it is to trade linkages with the United States or the degree of exchange rate flexibility.

In the streaming model, a massive data stream is presented in an arbitrary order to a randomized algorithm that tries to approximate certain statistics of tile data {{with only a few}} (usually one) passes over the data.

Problems of interest include approximating the number of distinct elements, approximating the <b>surprise</b> <b>index</b> of a stream, or more generally, approximating the norm of a dynamically-changing vector in which coordinates are updated multiple times in an arbitrary order. In the two-party communication model, there are two parties who wish to efficiently compute a relation of their inputs. We consider the problem of approximating Lp distances for any p > 0. It turns out that lower bounds on the communication complexity of these relations yield lower bounds on the memory required of streaming algorithms for the problems listed above. Moreover, upper bounds in the streaming model translate to constant-round protocols in the communication model with communication proportional to the memory required of the streaming algorithm. The communication model also hias its own applications, such as secure datamining, where in addition to low communication, the goal is not to allow either party {{to learn more about the}} other's input other than what follows from the output and his/her private input. (cont.) We develop new algorithms and lower bounds that resolve key open questions in both of these models. The highlights of the results are as follows. 1. We give an Q(1 /E 2) lower bound for approximating the number of distinct elements of a data stream in one pass to within a (1 ± c) factor with constant probability, as well as the p-th frequency moment Fp for any p Ž 0. This is tight up to very small factors, and greatly improves upon the earlier Q(1 /E) lower bound for these problems. It also gives the same quadratic improvement for the communication complexity of 1 -round protocols for approximating the Lp distance for any p 2 0. 2. We give a 1 -pass O(ml- 2 /p) -space streaming algorithm for (1 ± 6) -approximating the Lp norm of an m-dimensional vector presented as a data stream for any p 2 2. This algorithm improves the previous ((m 1 - 1 /(P-')) bound, and is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. As a special case our algorithm can be used to approximate the frequency moments Fp of a data stream with the same optimal amount of space. This resolves the main open question of the 1996 paper by Alon, Matias, and Szegedy. 3. In the two-party communication model, we give a protocol for privately approximating the Euclidean distance (L 2) between two m-dimensional vectors, held by different parties, with only polylog m communication and 0 (1) rounds. This tremendously improves upon the earlier protocol of Feigenbaum, Ishai, Malkin, Nissim, Strauss, and Wright, which achieved O(vm) communication for privately approximating the Hamming distance only. This thesis also contains several previously unpublished results concerning the first item above, including new lower bounds for the communication complexity of approximating the Lp distances when the vectors are uniformly distributed and the protocol is only correct for most inputs, as well as tight lower bounds for the multiround complexity for a restricted class of protocols that we call linear. by David P.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} U. S. monetary policy announcement surprises on foreign equity indexes, short- and long-term interest rates, and exchange rates in 49 countries. We use two proxies for monetary policy surprises: the surprise change to the current target federal funds rate (target surprise) and the revision to the expected path of future monetary policy (path surprise). We find that different asset classes respond to different components of the monetary policy <b>surprises.</b> Global equity <b>indexes</b> respond mainly to the target surprise; exchange rates and long-term interest rates respond mainly to the path surprise; and short-term interest rates respond to both surprises. On average, a hypothetical surprise 25 -basis-point cut in the federal funds target rate is associated with about a 1 percent increase in foreign equity indexes and a 5 basis point decline in foreign short-term interest rates. A surprise 25 -basis-point downward revision in the expected path of future policy is associated with about a Â½ percent decline in the exchange {{value of the dollar}} against foreign currencies and 5 and 8 basis point declines in short- and long-term interest rates, respectively. We also find that asset prices' responses to FOMC announcements vary greatly across countries, and that these cross-country variations in the response are related to a country's exchange rate regime. Equity indexes and interest rates in countries with a less flexible exchange rate regime respond more to U. S. monetary policy surprises. In addition, the cross-country variation in the equity market response is strongly related to the percentage of each country's equity market capitalization owned by U. S. investors. This result suggests that investors' asset holdings {{may play a role in}} transmitting monetary policy surprises across countries.
