This leads {{to the fact that the}} <b>self-demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> must be considered as a contribution to the coercive field and that the slope of the magnetization variation is higher than the classical demagnetizing field slope. This description of demagnetization processes is confirmed by numerical modeling...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} force microscope(MFM) {{was used to}} study the displacement of domain walls (DW) in amorphous TbFe alloy films and Co/Pd multilayerfilms with high spatial resolution. The reversible bending of domain wall segments pinned to defects and irreversible, jumplike displacement of domain wall segments were imaged with the MFM in an applied magnetic field. The maximum reversible displacement of domain walls was 50 – 100 nm {{and the length of}} the segments which reversibly curved in the field was about 150 nm. Measurement of the change in radius of curvature of a DW segment in response to an applied field allowed estimation of the DW energy density and <b>self-demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> of the film acting on the DW. The DW energy density for the TbFe films was about 1 erg/cm 2. It was shown that the <b>self-demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> acting on a domain wall depends on the domain structure surrounding the studied DW segment. For instance, for a film with saturation magnetization 100 G and thickness 80 nm, which exhibited a mazelike domain structure, the demagnetizing field varied from 100 G {{in the center of a}} mazelike domain to 400 G near the edge of a domain. The irreversible displacement of a DW was not a continuous process. The 200 – 400 nm long DW segments exhibited jumplike motion over distances of 100 – 150 nm...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss a}} method for the {{determination}} of activation volumes of reversal in perpendicular media. This method does not require correction for the <b>self-demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> normally associated with these media. This is achieved by performing time dependence measurements at a constant level of magnetization. From the difference in time taken for the magnetization to decay to a fixed value at two fields-separated by a small increment DeltaH, the activation volume can be determined. We report data for both CoCrPt alloy films and a multilayer film, typical of those materials under consideration for use as perpendicular media. We find activation volumes {{that are consistent with}} the hysteresis curves of the materials. The activation volume scales qualitatively with the exchange coupling. The alloy films have significantly lower activation volumes, implying that they would be capable of supporting a higher data density...|$|E
40|$|First-order {{reversal}} curve (FORC) and remanence-based Preisach diagrams are {{alternative ways}} of determining the Preisach distribution of a sample, which incorporates information about the coercivity spectrum {{and the distribution of}} interactions and <b>self-demagnetizing</b> <b>fields.</b> We compare results of the two methods for well-characterized synthetic and natural samples containing single-domain (SD) and pseudo-SD (PSD) magnetite, maghemite, titanomagnetite and titanomaghemite. The greater time requirements of remanence as opposed to in-field measurements limited our Preisach diagrams to a few hundred points, compared to several thousand points for the corresponding FORC diagrams. Only minimal smoothing could be applied in order to limit the regions near the axes of the diagrams in which function values must be extrapolated. In spite of these restrictions, we find excellent agreement between the essential features of the distributions determined by the two methods. The main features, the location and spreading of the distribution peak, are very consistent. However, the low-coercivity part of the Preisach distribution is sometimes poorly resolved or not imaged at all for remanence-only measurements. Features in this region can be diagnostic of PSD and multidomain (MD) grains. The essential agreement between our FORC and Preisach diagrams in the region where they overlap justifies using the much faster FORC routine instead of traditional remanence-based Preisach methods to determine the Preisach distribution of palaeomagnetic samples without strong interactions. We propose a symmetric FORC protocol that would permit separation of the irreversible and reversible parts of the Preisach distribution. The irreversible part is what is determined by remanence-only methods and what is desired for characterization of the remanence behaviour of palaeomagnetic samples. The reversible part is most significant in detecting MD behaviour and screening out samples containing large PSD and MD grains...|$|R
40|$|Bulk (RE) BCO {{materials}} {{can be used}} potentially as powerful permanent magnets. The magnetic flux distribution above a bulk HTS magnet, however, is strongly non-uniform (conic profile predicted by the Bean model) compared to the rather flat distribution above a ferromagnet. In the present work, we study how FeNi soft ferromagnetic alloys of different shapes can be combined with a bulk, large grain (RE) BCO superconductor (RE denotes a rare-earth element) to improve the distribution of trapped field at the surface or its average value through {{the volume of the}} sample. A FeNi ferromagnetic alloy was machined into pieces of various shapes (cylinders and rings) and attached to (i) the top surface of the bulk HTS cylinder to form bulk ferromagnet / superconductor (F/S) hybrids and (ii) to the top and bottom surfaces to form bulk F/S/F hybrids. The magnetic properties of each hybrid structure were measured under axial magnetic field at 77 K. Pick-up coils wound around the superconductor were used to measure the average magnetic induction inside the superconductor while the remnant induction distribution near the top and bottom surfaces was determined by miniature Hall probe mapping. The modifications of the hysteresis curves and flux distributions were analyzed by taking into account the ferromagnet intrinsic properties (intrinsic permeability, saturation) and geometrical properties (shape, size and volume). The results show that the effect of the ferromagnet increases with its volume. In presence of a ferromagnet, the superconductor hysteresis curve shows a combination of a diamagnetic and a ferromagnetic behaviour on which {{it is worth noting that}} (i) the bulk remnant magnetization increases and (ii) in the magnetic saturation regime of the ferromagnet, the magnetic effects of the superconductor and the ferromagnet are superimposed. The results also give evidence that flux lines curve through the ferromagnetic component, which produces a decrease of the <b>self-demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> inside the superconductor...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{combined}} experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} dynamic excitation spectra in ‎arrays of 20 nm thick NiFe disks arranged into a hexagonal lattice. The disks, fabricated using the ‎etched nano-sphere lithography, have diameter of 370 nm and an edge-to-edge separation of 20 nm. ‎Longitudinal hysteresis loops measured by magneto-optic Kerr effect reveal that the magnetization ‎reversal for both arrays is governed by the formation and expulsion of vortices inside the nanodisks ‎and is nearly independent on the in-plane external field direction. Spin wave spectra were measured ‎complementary by the all-electrical spin-wave spectroscopy and Brillouin light scattering, for two ‎different in-plane direction of the applied magnetic field, i. e. H parallel and perpendicular ‎to the disks rows. Dynamical simulations have been performed by ‎means of Micromagus and the dynamical matrix methods (DMM), obtaining a good agreement with ‎the experimental results. We found both bulk modes, concentrated in central regions of the ‎nanodisks, and edge modes located near {{the borders of the}} nanodisks. Starting from the positive ‎saturation we notice that for both the field orientation the frequency of all the modes decreases in ‎an almost linear way, except for the edge mode. Simulations reveal that both bulk and edge modes ‎are strongly affected by the external field orientation, due to the anisotropy of the magnetodipolar ‎interaction between the disks. In particular, the edge mode is absent when H is directed along the ‎nanodisks rows, due to the nearly complete cancellation of the <b>self-demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> of a ‎nanodisk by the stray field of its nearest neighbors. ‎ Results of this systematic research is relevant for the fundamental studies of spin wave modes in ‎patterned magnetic structures in general, and for the design of magnonic crystals for numerous ‎potential applications such as spin-wave guides and filters. ‎ This work was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme ‎‎(FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under Grant Agreement n° 228673 (MAGNONICS) and n° 233552 ‎‎(DYNAMAG). ...|$|E
