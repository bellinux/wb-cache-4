In this work, a novel methodology for determining those parameters is outlined and successfully applied to the titanium alloy, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Utilizing the results from a lattice <b>strain</b> <b>pole</b> figure experiment conducted at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, an iterative approach is used to optimize the single crystal elastic moduli by comparing experimental and simulated lattice <b>strain</b> <b>pole</b> figures at discrete load steps during a uniaxial tensile test. Due to {{the large number of}} unique measurements taken during the experiments, comparisons were made by using the discrete spherical harmonic modes of both the experimental and simulated lattice <b>strain</b> <b>pole</b> figures, allowing the complete pole figures to be used to determine the single crystal elastic moduli...|$|E
40|$|A salient {{manifestation of}} {{anisotropy}} in the mechanical response of polycrystal- line materials is the inhomogeneous partitioning of elastic strains over the aggregate. For bulk samples, the distributions of these intergranular strains {{are expected to}} have a strong functional dependence on grain orientations. It is then useful to formulate a mean lattice strain distribution function (LSDF) over the orientation space, which serves to characterize the micromechanical state of the aggregate. Orientation-dependent intergranular stresses may be recovered from the LSDF via a constitutive assumption, such as anisotropic linear elasticity. While the LSDF may be determined directly from simulation data, its experimental determination relies on solving an inverse problem that is similar in character to the fundamental problem of texture analysis. In this paper, a versatile and robust direct method for determining an LSDF from <b>strain</b> <b>pole</b> figures is presented. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using synthetic <b>strain</b> <b>pole</b> figures from a model LSDF obtained from the simulated uniaxial deformation of a 1000 -crystal aggregate...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} the current work is on {{investigating}} the orientation dependent micromechanical response of face-centered cubic (fcc) polycrystals using crystal-based elastoplastic finite element simulations. This dissertation contains three related studies examining {{the evolution of the}} lattice strains and the crystal stresses in fcc polycrystalline aggregates subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. These three studies, which can be read independently, are presented in Chapters 1, 2 and 3. Chapter 1 contains an investigation into the evolution of the orientation dependent lattice strain response in fcc polycrystals under monotonic tensile loading, particularly in the elastic-plastic transition regime leading up to fullydeveloped plasticity. The lattice strains, when plotted {{as a function of the}} macroscopic stress, begin to deviate from linear behavior in the elastic-plastic transition regime when certain sets of crystals begin yielding before others. It is demonstrated that the progression of yielding in different sets of crystals is influenced by a combination of the single crystal elastic and plastic anisotropies, which can be quantified by the directional strength-to-stiffness ratio [1]. Chapter 2 examines the evolution of the lattice strains and the crystal scale stress distributions in fcc polycrystals under fully-reversed, strain-controlled cyclic loading with respect to the concepts of the directional strength-to-stiffness ratio [1] and the vertices of the single crystal yield surface [2], which have previously only been applied to monotonic tensile loading. These two concepts are derived from the single crystal elastic and plastic anisotropic properties and are used to explain observed behaviors in the lattice strain response such as the size and shape of the lattice strain hysteresis loops. Chapter 3 presents a coordinated approach to quantifying the evolution of lattice strains in an AA 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloy under in situ zero-tension cyclic loading using high-energy synchotron x-ray diffraction experiments and crystal-based finite element simulations. This dissertation involves only the computational aspect of this coordinated approach. Lattice <b>Strain</b> <b>Pole</b> Figures (SPFs) are constructed from both measured and computed lattice strains and comparisons are made at the same macroscopic stress on several cycles in the loading history. Trends in the evolution of crystal quantities such as the crystal stresses, slip system activity and the slip system strengths, which are available from the simulation data, are examined and explained in a consistent manner with respect to the single crystal yield surface topology.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} essentially {{consists of}} three related studies concerned with quantifying the structure and micromechanical state of bulk polycrystalline materials. They are contained in Chapters 1, 2 and 3, which may be read independently. The {{emphasis is on the}} development of new methods for the analysis and interpretation of generalized pole figure data. Chapter 1 contains an expanded version of a manuscript my coauthors and I have submitted for review [3]. In it, a robust method for obtaining an orientation distribu- tion function (ODF) from pole density functions (PDFs) is presented. The method uses the gradient norm of the ODF for conditional control of the solution {{in the context of a}} constrained minimization problem. The introduction has been expanded to include a detailed definition of the ODF and PDF. Several additional sample applications of the method have also been included, as well as several appendices that elaborate on the mathematical formalism of orientations and other technical aspects of the implementation. Chapter 2 is largely similar to a second manuscript that has been provisionally accepted for publication in the Journal of Applied Crystallography [5]. In it, the methods developed in Chapter 1 have been adapted to obtain a lattice strain distribution function (LSDF) from <b>strain</b> <b>pole</b> figures (SPFs). The proposed SPF inversion method utilizes conditional control formulated independently of any kinematic linking assumptions. In Chapter 3, a methodology is presented for extracting generalized pole figure data from 2 -d powder diffraction images. An example application of this analysis, along with the methods presented in Chapters 1 and 2, is provided using data obtained via an in situ loading/diffraction experiment performed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. The fourth and final chapter provides a summary of the salient scientific contributions of this dissertation, along with proposed extensions of the research. Together, the 3 methods presented in this dissertation provide a set of tools for characterizing the structure and micro-mechanical state of polycrystalline materials at the bulk scale. Most importantly, the resulting distributions are suitable for direct comparison to the predictions of structure-based models of polycrystalline materials.

Then they moved a foot or two, and the work was a little easier when they next dipped the poles. They made a few yards. With a cry to the half-breed, Carnally loosed the line, and they shot forward up-stream with a back-eddy. It swirled about them in curious green upheavals, streaked with lines of foam, and they sped with it past boulder and shingle at a furious pace.

40|$|Understanding the {{conditions}} that drive phenomena like fatigue crack initiation in polycrystalline samples requires knowledge of the stress state at the crystal scale. Even during uniaxial tensile loading, the stress state at the crystal scale is often complicated due to anisotropic single crystal properties and the arrangement of neighboring grains. Instead of manufacturing specimens on the size scale of the microstructure, diffraction of synchrotron x-rays with in situ mechanical loading provides the means to probe the micromechanical response within deforming polycrystals. Measurement of lattice <b>Strain</b> <b>Pole</b> Figures (SPFs) is a robust technique for quantifying the three dimensional micromechanical state within a polycrystalline sample. The focus of this work was to bring the SPF experiment {{to the level of}} a measurement capability as opposed to a one-off style experiment. This dissertation is composed of three related studies, each of which is presented as a chapter that can be read independently. Chapter 1 contains a manuscript which was provisionally accepted for publication in Experimental Mechanics [56]. The work investigates the interconnected nature of the SPF coverage and the regions of orientation space probed by each diffraction measurement. The major contribution is a new technique for quantifying how well a set of lattice strain measurements (SPFs) probes each crystal orientation. The orientation space sampling matrix, defined [GAMMA](R), repre- sents the set of lattice strain measurements that interrogate each crystal orientation. The rank of [GAMMA](R) can be used to quantitatively compare different experimental configurations. The net result is a new tool for selecting experimental conditions to produce optimal sets of SPF data. Chapter 2 is a second manuscript that was provisionally accepted for publication in the Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design [55]. The focus of this effort was the development of an expression for the lattice strain uncertainty that delineates the contributing factors into terms that vary independently: (i) the contribution from the instrument and (ii) the contribution from the material under investigation. The instrument portion of the lattice strain uncertainty is explored and modeled using a calibrant powder method (diffraction from an unstrained material with high precision lattice constants). Chapter 3 focuses on quantifying the evolution of lattice strains due to cyclic mechanical loading. To interpret the cycle-by-cycle variation in the lattice strains as experimental fluctuations or material evolution a new methodology was developed that combines x-ray diffraction experiments with in situ mechechanical loading and crystal-based finite element simulations. Merging what can be measured at grain scale with a simulation of the deforming polycrystal provides a robust tool for studying micromechanical behavior. A key finding of the work is that the lattice strain evolution due to cyclic loading occurs rapidly during the earliest portion of the samples fatigue life, and slows as the sample approaches failure...|$|E

It can infect {{a large number of}} ruminant species and is a very dangerous parasite of sheep and goats worldwide. The infection caused by these worms is called haemonchosis. The symptoms are anaemia, loss of weight and death of the infected sheep and goats. Nowadays we can prevent this disease. The prevention of haemonchosis is available in the form of anthelmintic drugs. The most commonly administered drugs from this category are represented by benzimidazoles. However, the frequent use of anthelmintic leads to development of drug resistance in parasites. The resistance to anthelminthic drugs is caused by mutation at codon 200 of β-tubulin. The worms Haemonchus contortus can be divided into sub-groups according to their anthelmintic resistance.

60|$|Green Wood.--To season Wood.--Green wood {{cannot be}} {{employed}} in carpentry, as it is very weak; it also warps, cracks, and becomes rotten: wood dried with too great a heat loses its toughness {{as well as its}} pliability: it becomes hard and brittle. Green wood is seasoned by washing out the sap, and then drying it thoroughly. The traveller's way of doing this by one rapid operation, is to dig a long trench and make a roaring fire in it; when the ground is burning hot, sweep the ashes away, deluge the trench with boiling water; {{and in the middle of}} the clouds of steam that arise, throw in the log of wood, shovel hot earth over it, and leave it to steam and bake. A log thick enough to make an axletree may thus be somewhat seasoned in a single night. The log would be seasoned more thoroughly if it were saturated with boiling water before putting it into the trench; that can be done by laying it in a deep narrow puddle, and shovelling hot stones into the water. All crowbars, wagon-lifters, etc., should be roughly seasoned as green wood is far too weak for such uses. The regular way of seasoning is to leave the timber to soak for a long time in water, that the juices may be washed out. Fresh water is better for this purpose than salt; but a mineral spring, if it is warm is better than cold fresh water. Parties travelling with a wagon ought to fell a little timber on their outward journey, and leave it to season against their return, in readiness to replace <b>strained</b> axletrees, broken <b>poles,</b> and the like. They might, at all events, cut a ring round through the bark and sap-wood of the tree, and leave it to discharge its juices, die, and become half-seasoned as it stands.|$|R
