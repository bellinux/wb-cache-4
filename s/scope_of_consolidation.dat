40|$|New {{trends in}} {{consolidation}} – challenging the changes of new IFRS rules Ildikó Büdy-Rózsa Received 2012 - 01 - 27 In 2011, the consolidation rules changed repeatedly and sub-stantially in IFRS. In earlier years, consolidation regulations have been modified many times, changing {{the impact of}} trans-actions with entities covered by the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation,</b> {{and that of the}} transactions with non-controlling interests, but in 2011 less technical, but rather significant changes took place, which altered the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the comparison of changes with earlier reg-ulations, and to examine how the financial statements of a group of companies would be modified as a result of these changes, and also to explore what effect this change makes on the financial in-dicators of a group of companies. It is shown that the financial statements of a group of companies may change substantially even if no modification occurs in the group of companies, and only the modification of the rules is executed. The paper points out the outstanding fact that as a result of the revised regula-tions, the consolidated financial statements are to be assessed from a different perspective, because the so far unambiguous rules which we have become accustomed to for years have been overwritten, and hence the liquidity, solvency and profitability of a consolidated group of companies may change significantly vis-á-vis the earlier years...|$|E

Of the different means of organization that are covered by the legislation on cooperatives, cooperative groups appear to be a similar concept to that of groups of corporations.

The paper reports detailed content analysis of submission letters to four related exposure drafts. These preceded two accounting standards that set out the concept of control used to determine the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> in the UK, except for reporting under international standards. Regulation on the concept of control provides rich patterns of lobbying behaviour due to its controversial nature and its significance to financial reporting. Our examination is conducted by dividing lobbyists into two categories, corporate and non-corporate, which are hypothesised (and demonstrated) to lobby differently. In order to test the significance of these differences we apply ANOVA techniques and univariate regression analysis. Corporate respondents are found to devote more attention to issues of specific applicability of the concept of control, whereas non-corporate respondents tend to devote more attention to issues of general applicability of this concept. A strong association between the issues raised by corporate respondents and their line of business is revealed. Both categories of lobbyists are found to advance conceptually-based arguments more often than economic consequences-based or combined arguments. However, when economic consequences-based arguments are used, they come exclusively from the corporate category of respondents...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the extent to which the clauses for the {{exclusion}} of subsidiaries from consolidation are used, in order to assess the degree of compliance with accounting regulation and the effectiveness of the statutory auditor as an enforcement mechanism in case of observed noncompliance. The presentation of consolidated financial statements by Portuguese companies was not regulated in detail before the implementation of the EU’s Seventh Directive and the general obligation to prepare consolidated accounts had not applied to Portuguese companies until 1991. Regulators have been responsible for the endorsement of accounting rules and managers ar responsible for the information disclosed by Portuguese companies regarding the scope of group accounting. In practice, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> depends on the judgment of makers and managers of the parent company. Auditors may play a key role in the process of guaranteeing the correct application of prevailing standards and thus encompassing the enforcement of accounting regulations and contributing to the quality of disclosed information. Our sample includes the consolidated financial statements of all the Portuguese companies listed in the Lisbon Stock Exchange on December 31 st for the year 1999, to which the Official Accounting Plan is applicable. Our conclusion is that diversity exists among accounting practices regarding the adopted group concept and the use of the clauses for excluding subsidiaries from consolidation. The role of the auditors as enforcement actors seems to be minor, as we did find few qualifications in their audit reports in the cases of observed non-compliance with the accounting regulation...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} explore in depth {{the ways in}} which rhetorical {{strategies}} are employed in the international accounting standard setting process. The study proposes that rather than simply detailing new accounting requirements, the texts and drafts of accounting standards are artefacts, i. e. deliberately and carefully crafted products, that construct, persuade and encourage certain beliefs and behaviours. The persuasive and constructive strategies are also employed by the constituents submitting comment letters on the regulatory proposals. Consequently, the international accounting standard setting process is an ‘interactive process of meaning making’ (Fairclough, 1989). The study regards accounting as a social construct based on intersubjectivity (Searle, 1995; Davidson, 1990, 1994) and posits language as a constitutive factor in the process (Saussure, 1916; Peirce, 1931 - 58). This approach to the use of language and the role of rhetoric as a persuasive tool to convince others to our perception of ‘accounting reality’ is supported by the sociological work of Bourdieu (1990, 1991). Bourdieu has drawn our attention to how language becomes used, controlled, reformed and reconstituted by the social agents for the purposes of establishing their dominance. In our study we explore in particular the joint IASB and FASB proposals and subsequent regulations on the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> and relevant disclosures that address issues of off-balance sheet financing, a subject that is very timely and of great topical importance. The analysis has revealed sophisticated rhetorical devices used by both the Boards and by the lobbyists. These reflect Aristotelian ethos, pathos and logos. The research demonstrates that those using accounting standards as well as those reading comment letters on the proposals for new standards {{should be aware of the}} normative nature of these documents and the subjectivity inherent in the nature of the text...|$|E
40|$|The article {{outlines}} the current budgetary situation, explains why consolidation plans are urgently needed and provides {{an answer to}} the question as to what form those plans should preferably take. It also contains an insight into the strategies aimed at consolidating public finances. The financial crisis and the resultant economic recession have seriously undermined the health of public finances in almost all the developed economies. Budget deficits and public debt have risen sharply and these budgetary problems will not disappear automatically once the economy has fully recovered from the recession. On top of this, the budgetary impact of the ageing of the population could drive up budget deficits and cause public debt to rise even more quickly. To restore the sustainability of public finances, extensive consolidation efforts are required {{in a wide range of}} countries. Although a rapid and significant consolidation effort implemented simultaneously by a large group of countries could act as a brake on the economic recovery to some extent, a postponement of consolidation efforts, on the other hand, could shake the confidence of economic agents, give rise to financing risks and trigger a strong rise in interest rates. To remove doubts about the creditworthiness of countries, it is therefore advisable not to delay the announcement of concrete and credible austerity plans, even if the measures will only be implemented in the years to come. The timing and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> efforts are dependent on country-specific circumstances. The scope of the consolidation efforts needed in most countries means that no limitations can be imposed with regard to the composition of consolidation plans. However, preference needs to be given to structural measures that reduce non-growth-promoting government expenditure or can dampen the increase in ageing-related expenditure. In spite of the already heavy burden of compulsory taxation in many countries, extra government revenues cannot be ruled out. Most countries have now begun preparing budgetary exit strategies. So there is some prospect of budgetary objectives that will herald a return to healthy public finances. In some countries, concrete austerity measures have already been worked out in the meantime. In other countries, plans of this type have yet to be detailed. However, firm government action is urgently required for this latter group of countries too, all the more so since postponing the necessary consolidation efforts would entail major risks. fiscal policy, budgetary consolidation, austerity plans, government debt...|$|E
