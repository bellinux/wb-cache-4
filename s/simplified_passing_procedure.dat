40|$|This paper {{studies the}} form and {{complexity}} of inference in graphical models using the abstraction offered by algebraic structures. In particular, we broadly formalize inference problems in graphical models by viewing them as a sequence of operations based on commutative semigroups. We then study the computational complexity of inference by organizing various problems into an "inference hierarchy". When the underlying structure of an inference problem is a commutative semiring [...] i. e. a combination of two commutative semigroups with the distributive law [...] a message <b>passing</b> <b>procedure</b> called belief propagation can leverage this distributive law to perform polynomial-time inference for certain problems. After establishing the NP-hardness of inference in any commutative semiring, we investigate the relation between algebraic properties in this setting and further show that polynomial-time inference using distributive law does not (trivially) extend to inference problems that are expressed using more than two commutative semigroups. We then extend the algebraic treatment of message <b>passing</b> <b>procedures</b> to survey propagation, providing a novel perspective {{using a combination of}} two commutative semirings. This formulation generalizes the application of survey propagation to new settings...|$|R

30|$|A recent {{direction}} {{of research in}} distributed algorithms {{is the use of}} particle filters. In [29], Ihler et al. formulated the sensor network localization problem as an inference problem on a graphical model and applied a variant of belief propagation (BP) techniques, the so-called nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) algorithm, to obtain an approximate solution to the sensor locations. The main advantages of the NBP algorithm are its easy implementation in a distributed fashion and sufficiency of a small number of iterations to converge. In [30], Bayesian inference is performed through an iterative local message <b>passing</b> <b>procedure</b> based on belief propagation and particle-filtering message representation.|$|R
