Masses of an organism’s protein biomarkers are experimentally determined and matched against sequence-derived masses of proteins, found together with their <b>source</b> <b>organisms</b> in proteome databases.

Statistical analysis of proteome uniqueness across organisms in a database enables evaluation of the probability of false identifications based on protein mass assignments alone.

50|$|There are {{physical}} {{limits on}} the practical size of organisms employing pheromones, because at small sizes pheromone diffuses away from the <b>source</b> <b>organism</b> faster than it can be produced, and a sensible concentration accumulates too slowly to be useful.

However, they do use them to determine the local population density of similar organisms and control behaviors that take more time to execute (e.g. pheromones are used in quorum sensing or to promote natural competence for transformation, i.e. sexual gene transfer). In similar manner, the simple animals rotifers are, it appears, also too small for females to lay down a useful trail, but in the slightly larger copepods the female leaves a trail that the male can follow.|$|E

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of peptidic material in five North Sea sediments that differ in organic matter quality {{has been investigated}} with an enzymatic approach measuring the digestibility (rate constant k of proteolysis by protease) {{and the proportion of}} bioavailable fraction of amino acids (%EHAA- i: THAA). The bioavailable fraction in sediments varied between 14 - 50 % EHAA-i:THAA and was generally lower than in potential <b>source</b> <b>organisms</b> such as algae (40 - 43 %), plankton (similar to 80 %) and bacteria (57 - 72 %). The rate of proteolysis of the amino acids varied among stations (k = 0. 3 - 3. 1 h(- 1)) with a systematic decrease when going from labile to more refractory organic matter. The concentration of both the total and the enzymatically hydrolyzable amino acid pool increased toward the north where fine-grained sediments accumulate whereas the relative contribution of the labile fraction (% EHAA-i:THAA) decreased. Differences were found between the amino acid composition of the EHAA. and the THAA pool in sedimentary organic matter, but these differences were minor in <b>source</b> <b>organisms.</b> Reasons for the selective liberation behavior of protease-k toward peptidic material in sediments include (A) specific cleavage pattern of protease-k preferring certain bounds CB) selection against amino acids protected by structural matrixes (holds for glycine and methionine) (C) protection by adsorptive binding to sediment particles (basic amino acids arginine, histidine, methionine). It is argued that arginine and histidine {{play an important role in}} deposit feeder nutrition since they are deficient in the sedimentary food source and therefore may be limiting growth. Their strong adsorption affinity, low susceptibility toward cleavage and occurrence in structural organic matter make them poorly available to deposit feeders. The relative content of basic amino acids also co-varies systematically with increasing nutritional quality.

The activity of repair enzymes carries its own risk, however, because the repair of two nearby lesions {{may lead to the}} breakup of DNA and result in cell death. We propose a mathematical theory of the damage and repair process in the important scenario where lesions are caused in bursts. We use this model to show that there is an optimum level of repair enzymes within cells which optimises the cell's response to damage. This optimal level is explained as the best trade-off between fast repair and a low probability of causing double-stranded breaks. We derive our results analytically and test them using stochastic simulations, and compare our predictions with current biological knowledge...|$|R
