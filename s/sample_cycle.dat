50|$|The Super Audio CD (SACD) format {{was created}} by Sony and Philips, who were also the {{developers}} of the earlier standard audio CD format. SACD uses Direct Stream Digital (DSD), which works quite differently from the PCM format discussed in this article. Instead of using {{a greater number of}} bits and attempting to record a signal's precise amplitude for every <b>sample</b> <b>cycle,</b> a DSD recorder uses a technique called sigma-delta modulation. Using this technique, the audio data is stored as a sequence of fixed amplitude (i.e. 1- bit) values at a sample rate of 2.884 MHz, which is 64 times the 44.1 kHz sample rate used by CD. At any point in time, the amplitude of the original analog signal is represented by the relative preponderance of 1's over 0's in the data stream. This digital data stream can therefore be converted to analog by the simple expedient of passing it through a relatively benign analog low-pass filter. The competing DVD-Audio format uses standard, linear PCM at variable sampling rates and bit depths, which at the very least match and usually greatly surpass those of a standard CD Audio (16 bits, 44.1 kHz).|$|E

We used mainly HARPS-N spectra, acquired over four years, and add HARPS spectra from the public ESO database and ASAS photometry light-curves as support data, extending the baseline of the observations of some stars up to 12 years. We provide log(R'hk) measurements for all the stars in the <b>sample,</b> <b>cycle</b> length measurements for 13 stars, rotation periods for 33 stars and we are able to measure the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity signal induced by rotation in 16 stars. We complement our work with previous results and confirm and refine the previously reported relationships between the mean level of chromospheric emission, measured by the log(R'hk), with the rotation period, and with the measured semi-amplitude of the activity induced radial velocity signal for early M-dwarfs. We searched for a possible relation between the measured rotation periods and the lengths of the magnetic cycle, finding a weak correlation between both quantities.

40|$|Chemical and {{biological}} contaminants can enter a drinking water distribution system {{through one of}} the many access points to the network and can spread quickly affecting a very large area. This is of great concern, and water utilities need to consider effective tools and mitigation strategies to improve water network security. This work presents two components that have been integrated into EPA?s Water Security Toolkit, an open-source software package that includes a set of tools to help water utilities protect the public against potential contamination events. The first component is a novel water quality modeling framework referred to as Merlion. The linear system describing contaminant spread through the network at the core of Merlion provides several advantages and potential uses that are aligned with current emerging water security applications. This computational framework is able to efficiently generate an explicit mathematical model that can be easily embedded into larger mathematical system. Merlion {{can also be used to}} efficiently simulate a large number of scenarios speeding up current water security tools by an order of magnitude. The last component is a pair of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations for efficient source inversion and optimal sampling. The contaminant source inversion problem involves determining the source of contamination given a small set of measurements. The source inversion formulation is able to handle discrete positive/negative measurements from manual grab samples taken at different <b>sampling</b> <b>cycles.</b> In addition, sensor/sample placement formulations are extended to determine the optimal locations for the next manual <b>sampling</b> <b>cycle.</b> This approach is enabled by a strategy that significantly reduces the size of the Merlion water quality model, giving rise to a much smaller MILP that is solvable in a real-time setting. The approach is demonstrated on a large-scale water network model with over 12, 000 nodes while considering over 100 timesteps. The results show the approach is successful in finding the source of contamination remarkably quickly, requiring a small number of <b>sampling</b> <b>cycles</b> and a small number of sampling teams.

Each {{sampling}} period included fifteen 25 h fixed-station <b>sampling</b> <b>cycles</b> beginning at intervals of 4 tide cycles. Within each 25 h <b>sampling</b> <b>cycle,</b> plankton <b>samples</b> were collected hourly at several depths using a pump. Analysis {{of the data}} from these sampling periods indicated tidal and diel cycles of abundance of first stage C. maenas larvae. A semilunar component was also identified. These patterns were expressed as peaks of abundance during ebb tides, with highest peaks during nocturnal neap ebb tides around {{the first and last}} quarters of the moon. Peaks of nocturnal abundance could occur {{at any time during the}} night but consistently followed high water. In contrast, megalopae were present in the samples primarily during nocturnal flood tides. Intermediate zoeal stages of C. maenas were not collected. As indicated by an analysis of variance, the main effects of phases of the tide and day on the abundance of first zoeae and megalopae were significant (p < 0. 05). These results provide evidence that a component with semilunar periodicity is associated with the release of C. maenas larvae. That the release activity occurs well after sunset is also an additional interesting feature of these observations, inasmuch as larval release in decapods is usually concentrated within the first few hours after dusk. These observations support earlier observations that it is the time during the day-night cycle of high tide, as opposed to tidal amplitude, which is the important factor promoting synchrony with the lunar cycle...|$|R

Conventional semen parameters, morphology (strict criteria), sperm DNA fragmentation and stability [evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) and acridine orange staining under both acid and acid + heat denaturing conditions respectively] were measured.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} evidence {{consistent with}} the proposal that the visual system contains a parallel array of size-tuned mechanisms sensitive to orientation texture-defined (OTD) form, and propose that the relative activity of these mechanisms determines spatial frequency discrimination threshold for OTD gratings. Using a pattern of short lines we measured spatial frequency discrimination thresholds for OTD gratings and luminance-defined (LD) gratings. For OTD gratings, the orientation of texture lines varied sinusoidally across {{the bars of the}} gratings, but line luminance was constant. For LD gratings, line orientation was constant, but line luminance varied sinusoidally across the bars of the grating. When the number of texture lines (i. e. spatial <b>samples)</b> per grating <b>cycle</b> was below about six, spatial sampling strongly affected both the spatial frequency discrimination and grating detection thresholds for OTD and LD gratings. However, when the number of spatial <b>samples</b> per grating <b>cycle</b> exceeded about six, plots of both discrimination threshold and detection threshold were different for OTD and LD gratings. For an OTD grating of any given spatial frequency, spatial frequency discrimination threshold fell as the number of <b>samples</b> per grating <b>cycle</b> was increased while holding texture line length constant: the lower limit was reached at six to ten <b>samples</b> per <b>cycle.</b> When we progressively increased the viewing distance (keeping the cycles per degree (cpd) constant), spatial frequency discrimination threshold reached a lower limit and increased thereafter. We propose that this minimum threshold represents a balance between opposing effects of the number of <b>samples</b> per grating <b>cycle</b> and the length of texture lines, and approaches the absolute physiological lower limit for OTD gratings. Spatial frequency discrimination was possible up to at least 7 cpd. Grating acuity for an OTD grating was considerably lower than the physiological limit for LD gratings, presumably because detectors of OTD form include a spatial integration stage following the processing of individual lines. For an LD grating, discrimination threshold fell as the number of <b>samples</b> per grating <b>cycle</b> was increased and asymptoted at six to ten <b>samples</b> per <b>cycle.</b> Spatial frequency discrimination thresholds for OTD and LD gratings were similar at low spatial frequencies (up to 3 – 4 cpd), but increased more steeply for OTD gratings at high spatial frequencies. For both OTD and LD gratings, discrimination threshold fell steeply as the number of grating cycles was increased from 0. 5 to ca. 2. 5 cycles, and thereafter decreased more slowly or not at all suggesting that, for both OTD and LD gratings, spatial frequency discrimination can be regarded as a special case of line interval or bar width discrimination. As orientation contrast was progressively increased, discrimination threshold for an OTD grating fell steeply up to about four to five times grating detection threshold, then saturated. This parallels the effect of luminance contrast on discrimination threshold for an LD grating...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Iterative Flattening Search (IFS) is a meta-heuristic {{strategy}} for solving multi-capacity optimization scheduling problems. Given an initial solution, IFS iteratively applies two-steps: (1) {{a subset of}} solving decisions are randomly retracted from a current solution (relaxation-step); (2) a new solution is incrementally recomputed (flattening-step). In this paper we present {{the results of an}} experimental investigation on IFS, which considers algorithmic variants of the flattening step endowed with different computational complexity and effectiveness. In particular, this paper considers flattening procedures using constraint propagation and studies its effect within the meta-heuristic framework. The current analysis is centered around the idea that given a time bound to the optimization process, the IFS optimization is composed by two different and contrasting mechanism: the random sampling performed by the application of the relaxation-flattening steps and the inner flattening search procedure. The more complex (and effective) is the flattening procedure, the lower is the number of iterative <b>sampling</b> <b>cycles.</b> The study is performed on four different flattening procedures of various complexity. ...|$|R

40|$|Shape memory {{materials}} are {{a class of}} smart materials able to convert heat into mechanical strain (or strain into heat) by virtue of a martensitic phase transformation. Some brittle materials such as intermetallics and ceramics exhibit a martensitic transformation but fail by cracking at low strains and {{after only a few}} applied strain cycles. Here we show that such failure can be suppressed in normally brittle martensitic ceramics by providing a fine-scale structure with few crystal grains. Such oligocrystalline structures reduce internal mismatch stresses during the martensitic transformation and lead to robust shape memory ceramics that are capable of many superelastic cycles up to large strains; here we describe <b>samples</b> <b>cycled</b> as many as 50 times and samples that can withstand strains over 7 %.
