The name itself is a fairly accurate description of the process. Literally, a grid of circles of known diameter is etched {{to the surface of}} the sheet metal to be formed.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{tailoring}} a hot stamping part, to achieve locally graded properties, can improve the crash behavior. Depending {{on the role of}} the structural part (carrying either bending or axial crash load), the best position for the local regions with lower strength and higher ductility can be different. The distribution of these local regions and their mechanical properties affects the crash behavior of the part in each loading case and therefore can be effectively designed to improve the crash performance. To investigate these effects and examine the improvement possibilities, a numerical thermalmechanical-metallurgical model of a hot stamping process and a representative side impact crash model were created and analysed. The hot stamping model was used to predict the consequent phase fractions and mechanical properties of tailored hot stamping parts produced with different tailoring scenarios. In the metallurgical model, a modified phase transformation model based on Scheil’s additive principle was incorporated. The geometry and mesh of the <b>stamped</b> <b>part</b> was exported to a crash numerical model with a 3 -point bending configuration. A constitutive model was used to define the plastic behavior of the <b>stamped</b> <b>part</b> corresponding to different hardness values.

40|$|Design for Manufacturability is a {{concurrent}} engineering strategy aimed at providing the manufacturability {{feedback to the}} designers at the early design stages. A group technology coding and classification system for stamping is integrated into a feature-based part representation system. A thin-walled part is designed with features such as flat walls, holes, and intersections. The integrated system can then automatically provide the manufacturability feedback {{in terms of the}} cost drivers present at the configuration stage, and in terms of GT part code, relative cost, and redesign suggestions at the parametric stage. A strip layout module can automatically generate the most acceptable strip layout of a manufacturable <b>stamped</b> <b>part</b> at the configuration stage. ^ The heart of the integrated system is the feature-converter. It defines the mapping between a set of design features with a set of manufacturing features.

The {{conventional}} and innovative surface technologies {{are applied to}} sheet metal stamping dies {{in order to produce}} a composite material with properties unattainable in either the base or surface material. To select proper materials for forming dies the systematic evaluation of dies materials, their heat treatment and coatings are required. This paper deals with evaluation of plasma sprayed coatings Cr 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 and WC 12 Co by pressure plate-ring test (tester T 05) and deep drawing process. Friction coefficients and seizure of these coatings were studied under dry and wet friction conditions. For different types of die rings (with and without ceramic coatings) the punching forces were measured during deep-drawing process. The results show that the main advantage of application of plasma sprayed coatings on the die contact surfaces under wet friction conditions compare to dies made of the tool steel may be the increase of seizure resistance of <b>stamped</b> <b>part</b> surface.

40|$|In {{assembly}} variation simulations a total sensitivity matrix, {{implicitly defined}} in a FEA-based simulation model describing all mating conditions, kinematic relations and non-rigid behavior, is used together with Monte Carlo simulation to predict variation in critical product dimensions. A major drawback {{with this kind}} of simulation is that form and shape variation of parts, stemming from their individual manu-facturing processes, are unknown. Therefore, better ways to predict form and size variation are needed. In this paper a five critical material and process parameters are varied in a full factorial computer experiment for two different test cases; one forged part and one <b>stamped</b> <b>part.</b> The geometrical deviation in each factori-al run is registered. These results are then used as input for construction of a meta-model, well suited for Monte Carlo based variation simulation.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of components in automotive structures are today made from advanced high strength steel (AHSS). Since AHSS demonstrates more severe springback behaviour than ordinary mild steels, it requires more efforts to meet the design specification of the stamped parts. Consequently, the physical fine tuning of the die design and the stamping process can be time consuming. The trial-and-error development process may be shortened by replacing most of the physical try-outs with finite element (FE) simulations of the forming process, including the springback behaviour. Still {{it can be hard}} to identify when a <b>stamped</b> <b>part</b> will lead to an acceptable assembly with respect to the geometry and the residual stress state. In part since the assembling process itself will distort the components. To resolve this matter it is here proposed to extend the FE-simulation of the stamping process, to also include the first level sub-assembly stage. In this study a methodology of sequentially simulating each step in the manufacturing process of an assembly is proposed. Each step of the proposed methodology is described, and a validation of the prediction capabilities is performed by comparing with a physically manufactured assembly. The assembly is composed of three sheet metal components made from DP 600 steel which are joined by spot welding. The components are designed to exhibit severe springback behaviour in order to put both the forming and subsequent assembling simulations to the test. The work presented here demonstrates that by using virtual prototyping it is possible to predict the final shape of an assembled structure.

40|$|Traditionally, {{industrial}} {{sheet metal}} forming technologies use rigid metallic tools to plastically deform the blanks. In {{order to reduce the}} tooling costs, rubber or flexible tools can be used together with one rigid (metallic) die or punch, in order to enforce a predictable and repeatable geometry of the stamped parts. If the complete tooling setup is built with deformable tools, the final part quality and geometry are hardly predictable and only a prototypal production is generally possible. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the development of an automatic tool design procedure, based on the explicit FEM simulation of a stamping process, coupled to a geometrical tool compensation algorithm. The FEM simulation model has been first validated by comparing the experiments done at different levels of the process parameters. After the experimental validation of the FEM model, a compensation algorithm has been implemented for reducing the error between the simulated component and the designed one. The tooling setup is made of machined thermoset polyurethane (PUR) punch, die, and blank holder, for the deep drawing of an aluminum part. With respect to conventional steel dies, the plastic tools used in the test case are significantly more economic. The proposed procedure is iterative. It allows, already after the first iteration, to reduce the geometrical deviation between the actual <b>stamped</b> <b>part</b> and the designed geometry. This methodology represents one step toward the transformation of the investigated process from a prototyping technique into an industrial process for small and medium batch sizes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHot {{stamping}} is {{a well-established}} process in car manufacturing today. However, the resulting mechanical properties {{of a hot}} <b>stamped</b> <b>part</b> and its behaviour during a crash are still open questions. The usual procedure includes destructive experiments to determine the mechanical properties resulting from the forming and quenching process. The gained information is then used for crash simulation. Using images from micrographs to determine the proportion of bainite and martensite resulting from the hot stamping process {{has proved to be}} difficult, as these structures are fairly similar and hard to distinguish. Sophisticated numerical simulations of the hot stamping process are available. The hardness resulting from the hot stamping process can be predicted fairly well from these process simulations. However, information like the tensile strength that is more relevant for the crash behaviour cannot be predicted that easily. It is not yet state of the art to map the results from the hot stamping simulation directly into the crash simulation. The approach to be presented in detail in this contribution uses the forming speed and the quenching velocity to predict the relevant mechanical properties of the hot stamped parts. Both input parameters, the forming speed and the quenching velocity, can be derived from the numerical hot stamping simulation. By means of experiments using a thermomechanical test system Gleeble well defined process parameters were used. Micro tensile test specimens were manufactured out of the Gleeble specimens to eliminate the effect of the Gaussian temperature profile created during the Gleeble experiments. Afterwards, tensile tests were carried out to derive a response surface for 22 MnB 5. The validated results allow the determination of the tensile strength of hot stamped parts from the numerical simulation of the hot stamping process with good accuracy...|$|E
