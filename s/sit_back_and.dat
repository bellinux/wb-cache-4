5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E
25|$|A djembe and dunun {{ensemble}} traditionally {{does not}} play music {{for people to}} simply <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> listen to. Instead, the ensemble creates rhythm for people to dance, sing, clap, or work to. The western distinction between musicians and audience is inappropriate in a traditional context. A rhythm is rarely played as a performance, but is participatory: musicians, dancers, singers, and onlookers {{are all part of}} the ensemble and frequently change roles while the music is in progress.|$|E
25|$|The land {{upon which}} the city was built, as well {{as much of the}} {{surrounding}} area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry. They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy the natural beauty of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the long strip of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watch the rolling surf.|$|E
50|$|The {{crouching}} glissade {{is similar}} to the standing method except the climber <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> drags the spike of their ice axe (held in self-arrest grip) in the snow. The method is slower but more controlled than the standing glissade. A disadvantage to this technique is the tiring of the legs.|$|R

25|$|In {{reaction}} to the desolation of the abandoned burnt-out buildings of the South Bronx, Fekner stenciled Last Hope in large letters above one crumbling structure so that every time you passed it you couldn’t block {{it out of your}} vision. Now you know you can’t change the world, but you can’t <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watch it implode either, so you’ll do your part, have your own little victory, and so will the next guy and the next, and maybe things will start to change.|$|E
25|$|The {{trail that}} splits from the {{snowmobile}} route {{a mile from}} the Platte Clove trailhead curves back another mile or so to Huckleberry Point, a steep and ledgy area which, due to past fires, offers many places to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> look down into the clove. Since the route is mostly level, and the roundtrip considerably shorter than that required for the whole mountain, it is popular with those who hike only occasionally. Care must be taken at the Point, however, since some of the ledges also sit above sharp drops.|$|E

25|$|The {{order of}} the program varies from club to club and country to country. Many noon-time clubs and other clubs that are {{constrained}} by time do their prepared speeches first, followed by Table Topics, followed by evaluations. Dinner clubs in the United States tend to do Table Topics first, <b>and</b> then everyone <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> relaxes for the after-dinner prepared speeches. Alternatively, some clubs that are very time-conscious do prepared speeches first, then evaluations, saving Table Topics for last.|$|R
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Courtney {{was part of}} a {{movement}} within the UDA that became frustrated with the directions being taken by the UDA leadership. He argued that too little was being done by the movement in terms of killing republicans as the leaders were too happy to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> become rich from extortion and racketeering. Courtney was soon involved in conspiracies to overthrow the UDA leadership. These however came to nothing as the fallout from the Stevens Inquiries saw the existing leadership swept aside. For his part, Courtney would go on {{to become part of the}} new leadership that emerged in the 1990s around Johnny Adair.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Wang Jian was recalled to lead {{a second}} invasion with 600,000 men. High in morale after their victory in the previous year, the Chu forces were content to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> defend against what they {{expected to be a}} siege of Chu. However, Wang Jian decided to weaken Chu's resolve and tricked the Chu army by appearing to be idle in his fortifications whilst secretly training his troops to fight in Chu territory. After a year, the Chu defenders decided to disband due to apparent lack of action from the Qin. Wang Jian invaded at that point, with full force, and overran Huaiyang and the remaining Chu forces. Chu lost the initiative and could only sustain local guerrilla-style resistance until it too was fully conquered with the destruction of Shouchun and the death of its last leader, Lord Changping, in 223 BC. At their peak, the combined armies of Chu and Qin are estimated to have ranged from hundreds of thousands to a million soldiers, more than those involved in the campaign of Changping between Qin and Zhao 35 years earlier.|$|E

500|$|On September 21, Brian {{completed}} the track after Tanner added a final Electro-Theremin overdub. In 1976 he elaborated on the event: [...] "It was at Columbia. I remember I {{had it right}} in the sack. I could just feel it when I dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It was a feeling of power, it was a rush.

50|$|Frank {{could be}} {{considered}} a foil to Esme, since he is rather easy going and doesn’t complain or get worked up easily. This contrasts greatly with Esme's strong emotional response to almost anything. Although she may remain cool, you can see that she is analyzing and calculating {{to take control of the}} situation. Frank just <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watches the action - often missing something in the conversation, or at least pretending to be uninvolved. Frank could also be considered the buffoon, since he creates an additional obstacle between Amy and Esme by screwing up Esme's finances.|$|R

500|$|The {{impact was}} a {{substantial}} news event reported and discussed online, in print, and on television.

Various experts debated whether the impactor would go straight through the comet and out the other side, would create an impact crater, would open up a hole in the interior of the comet, and other theories. However, twenty-four hours before impact, the flight team at JPL began privately expressing a high level of confidence that, barring any unforeseen technical glitches, the spacecraft would intercept Tempel 1.

Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic called it a [...] "tremendously enjoyable episode" [...] and [...] "mostly just a chance to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> spend time with these goofy, lovable individuals".

Matt Fowler of IGN praised the performance of Rashida Jones and Chris Pratt, and called Leslie's stress over failing {{to come up with a}} new idea a [...] "great little story". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said [...] "Camping" [...] was not as funny as previous third season episodes but was still an enjoyable episode that he found more [...] "slow and contemplative", which he found indicative of the fact that the series was still on a strong track.|$|E

Two minutes later, Amoroso was cautioned for diving in an attempt to win another spot kick. Just three minutes after Dortmund scored, Jon Dahl Tomasson who was playing his last game for Feyenoord before his move to Milan, [...] scored after beating the offside trap, and being put through by Shinji Ono.

[...] 238 tickets were sold through Groupon within minutes of the offer, and 5,000 tickets were sold for the UK shows {{by the time the}} offer expired. The move divided opinions in the music industry of the United Kingdom: festival organizer Melvin Benn said that discounted tickets work [...] "particularly well for an awful lot of concerts.
