5|$|As of year 2010, {{there were}} total 6.4 million {{government}} employees in India, {{and less than}} 50,000 civil <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> administer them. The civil service system in India is rank-based and does not follow the tenets of the position-based civil services.|$|E

5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had allowed his two <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> hear {{a case that}} should have been heard by the justice. The litigants charged that the two servants had wrongly decided the case, and after hearing the allegations, the royal justices at Westminster agreed and restored the disputed property to the litigants.|$|E
5|$|Bodily {{and spiritual}} needs were {{balanced}} symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, {{rising from the}} semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking <b>servants,</b> <b>to</b> be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these offices {{there was a need}} for <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> take care of the hunting animals. The master huntsman, or the veneur, held a central position in greater noble households. Likewise, the master falconer was a high-ranking officer, often of noble birth himself. There were spiritual needs to be cared for, and a chapel was a natural part of every large household. These household chapels would be staffed by varying numbers of clerics. The chaplains, confessors and almoners could serve in administrative capacities as well as the religious ones.|$|E
5|$|In the {{parliamentary}} democracy of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration {{rests with the}} elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and {{it is for the}} civil <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> carry out this policy.|$|E
5|$|Loyalist forces regained {{control of}} the radio station and {{broadcast}} an announcement claiming control and ordering students and public <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> go about their normal lives. In the meantime, air force planes continued to set off flares to show their alertness, and rocket launchers and more weapons were deployed around Tan Son Nhut. Three battalions of paratroopers were brought in to patrol the airfield's perimeter.|$|E

5|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} estates were managed by single families. The father acted {{as the head}} manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked with female <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> weave cloth and produce silk. Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a sharecropping system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands. Under this system, peasants would receive land, tools, oxen, and a house {{in exchange for a}} third or a half of their crop yield.|$|E
5|$|The Committee was {{installed}} by the Belgian government of Hubert Pierlot on 16 May 1940 as an administrative committee {{to oversee the}} basic functioning of the Belgian state {{in the absence of}} the official government. While the ministers departed for Bordeaux in France, the Secretaries-General (chief civil servants responsible for each department) of each ministry were ordered to remain in the country, along with all other civil <b>servants,</b> <b>to</b> allow the state to continue functioning.|$|E
5|$|The new queen had {{a larger}} staff of {{servants}} than Catherine. There {{were more than}} 250 <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> tend to her personal needs, everyone from priests to stable-boys, and more than 60 maids-of-honour who served her and accompanied her to social events. She also employed several priests who acted as her confessors, chaplains, and religious advisers. One of these was Matthew Parker, who {{would become one of}} the chief architects of Anglican thought during the reign of Anne's daughter, Elizabeth I.|$|E

5|$|There are 1,100 RNLI {{fundraising}} branches {{throughout the}} regions {{served by the}} Institution, many far from the sea, which may support a particular station, or a project such as a new lifeboat. The Institution estimated their volunteer network at 31,500 in 2014. The largest regular contributor is The Communications and Public Service Lifeboat Fund (known simply as 'The Lifeboat Fund') established in 1886 for civil <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> support the RNLI collectively; the Fund has provided the Institution with 52 lifeboats {{as well as other}} support.|$|E
5|$|When Faramir {{returned}} unconscious, Denethor {{believed him}} to be fatally injured. That blow, coupled with a vision in the palantír of the forces arrayed against him, drove him insane. He ordered his <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> build a funeral pyre in the House of Stewards {{for him and his}} son. Denethor's temporary servant, the Hobbit Peregrin Took, went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower Guards he had befriended. Gandalf and Beregond stopped the impending sacrifice just in time. Mad with grief, Denethor jumped onto the lit pyre, burning himself alive.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the July 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{in which the}} SLFP and its leftist allies achieved a majority in parliament. No longer needing ITAK's support in parliament, the SLFP reneged on its pledges to honour the B-C pact and commenced enacting anti-Tamil policies, announcing the full operation of the Sinhala Only Act from January 1961 and using Sinhala in courts of law throughout the country. ITAK launched a campaign of civil disobedience in January 1961, beginning in Jaffna. Chelvanayakam started distributing leaflets outside Jaffna Kachcheri in Old Park urging Tamil civil <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> boycott government offices and cease using Sinhala. The campaign was hugely successful and large crowds, including ITAK MPs, gathered {{in front of the}} Kachcheri and staged a protest rally.|$|E

5|$|Discrimination against Jews began {{immediately}} after the seizure of power and following a month-long series of attacks {{by members of the}} SA on Jewish businesses, synagogues and members of the legal profession, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish businesses. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service passed on 7 April and forced all non-Aryan civil <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> retire from the legal profession and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise and on 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one Jewish parent or grandparent was considered non-Aryan. As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un-German and a nationwide book burning was held on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{family and}} {{household}} slaves resided {{on the second}} floor of the mansion, while others lived in the stable. As with everywhere else had they lived, she cared nothing about public life, and instead worked with Eliza and the other <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> create a home that welcomed extended family members and personal friends of the Houstons. Houston would occasionally hire out some of his labor force. The first child born in the Texas governor's mansion was also the last of the Houston children; Temple Lea Houston was delivered on August 12, 1860. This last birth left the 41-year-old Margaret debilitated for almost two weeks, with a watchful Houston constantly by her side.|$|E
5|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of Old Louisville by the wealthy was {{a reflection of}} changing lifestyles brought on by technology. Many homes of Old Louisville were originally built as mansions that would require several <b>servants</b> <b>to</b> maintain. Because of the relatively high wages offered by manufacturing jobs, servants were no longer affordable to all but the wealthiest families by the mid-20th century. Interurban rail lines, and increasingly automobiles, meant that the wealthy {{no longer had to}} live so close to their businesses, and many chose to live in what had previously been summer homes in the county's east end. The lifestyle that created Old Louisville was effectively obsolete.|$|E
