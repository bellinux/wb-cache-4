5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were <b>Schottky</b> diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC <b>Schottky</b> diodes (also <b>Schottky</b> barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by <b>Schottky</b> in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, {{germanium}} {{was thought to}} be a poorly conducting metal. Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized. During World War II, small amounts of germanium were used in some special electronic devices, mostly diodes. The first major use was the point-contact <b>Schottky</b> diodes for radar pulse detection during the War. The first silicon-germanium alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year, {{but by the end of}} the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point defects, but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs. Frenkel defects {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. <b>Schottky</b> defects consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-stoichiometric compound. Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity. When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (<b>Schottky).</b> Defects in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, {{especially in the case of}} different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|E
25|$|The German {{inventor}} Walter H. <b>Schottky</b> also filed {{a patent}} in 1918.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Schottky</b> diode of U3O8 and a p-n-p {{transistor}} of UO2 were successfully manufactured in a laboratory.|$|E
25|$|As a dopant, gold (or platinum) acts as {{recombination}} centers, {{which helps}} a fast recombination of minority carriers. This allows the diode {{to operate at}} signal frequencies, {{at the expense of}} a higher forward voltage drop. Gold-doped diodes are faster than other p–n diodes (but not as fast as <b>Schottky</b> diodes). They also have less reverse-current leakage than <b>Schottky</b> diodes (but not as good as other p–n diodes). A typical example is the 1N914.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{junction}} diode, the <b>Schottky</b> diode, {{is formed}} from a metal–semiconductor junction {{rather than a}} p–n junction, which reduces capacitance and increases switching speed.|$|E
25|$|The MESFET (metal–semiconductor field-effect transistor) {{substitutes}} the p–n {{junction of}} the JFET with a <b>Schottky</b> barrier; {{and is used}} in GaAs and other III-V semiconductor materials.|$|E
25|$|Super barrier diodes are {{rectifier}} diodes {{that incorporate}} the low {{forward voltage drop}} of the <b>Schottky</b> diode with the surge-handling capability and low reverse leakage current of a normal p–n junction diode.|$|E
25|$|The N-V0 centers can be {{converted}} into N-V− by changing the Fermi level position. This {{can be achieved by}} applying external voltage to a p-n junction made from doped diamond, e.g., in a <b>Schottky</b> diode.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{striking}} applications of systoles is in the context of the <b>Schottky</b> problem, by P.Buser and P.Sarnak, who distinguished the Jacobians of Riemann surfaces among principally polarized abelian varieties, laying the foundation for systolic arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|In modern sets, a {{semiconductor}} diode {{is used for}} the detector, which is much more reliable than a cat's whisker detector and requires no adjustments. Germanium diodes (or sometimes <b>Schottky</b> diodes) are used instead of silicon diodes, because their lower forward voltage drop (roughly 0.3V compared to 0.6V) makes them more sensitive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Schottky</b> diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. <b>Schottky</b> diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|AMD {{went public}} in September 1972. The company was a second source for Intel MOS/LSI {{circuits}} by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers. By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products – of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (a static N-channel 1024-bit RAM) and three low-power <b>Schottky</b> MSI circuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, vacuum tube thermionic diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal rectifier stacks were used. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum tube rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, <b>Schottky</b> diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|E
25|$|The moving-coil {{principle}} {{commonly used}} today in speakers was patented in 1924 by Chester W. Rice and Edward W. Kellogg. The key difference between previous attempts and the patent by Rice and Kellogg is the adjustment of mechanical parameters {{so that the}} fundamental resonance of the moving system is below the frequency where the cone's radiation impedance becomes uniform. About this same period, Walter H. <b>Schottky</b> invented the first ribbon loudspeaker together with Dr. Erwin Gerlach.|$|E
25|$|Cold field {{electron}} emission (CFE) {{is the name}} given to a particular statistical emission regime, in which the electrons in the emitter are initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and in which most emitted electrons escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from electron states close to the emitter Fermi level. (By contrast, in the <b>Schottky</b> emission regime, most electrons escape {{over the top of}} a field-reduced barrier, from states well above the Fermi level.) Many solid and liquid materials can emit electrons in a CFE regime if an electric field of an appropriate size is applied.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Drs. Walter H. <b>Schottky</b> and Erwin Gerlach co-invented the first ribbon microphone. By turning the ribbon circuit in the {{opposite}} direction, they also invented the first ribbon loudspeaker. A few years later, Dr. Harry F. Olson of RCA started developing ribbon microphones using ﬁeld coils and permanent magnets. The RCA Photophone Type PB-31 was commercially manufactured in 1931, greatly impacting the audio recording and broadcasting industries. Condenser microphones at the time could not compare to its frequency response. Radio City Music Hall employed PB-31s in 1932. The following year, the 44A came on the scene. Its tone and pattern control helped reduce reverberation. Many RCA ribbon models are still in use and valued by engineers.|$|E
25|$|The {{major defect}} in silver halides is the Frenkel defect, where silver ions are located interstitially (Agi+) in high {{concentration}} with their corresponding negatively charged silver-ion vacancies (Agv−). What is unique about AgBr Frenkel pairs {{is that the}} interstitial Agi+ are exceptionally mobile, and that its concentration in the layer below the grain surface (called the space-charge layer) far exceeds that of the intrinsic bulk. The formation energy of the Frenkel pair is low at 1.16 eV, and the migration activation energy is unusually low at 0.05 eV (compare to NaCl: 2.18 eV {{for the formation of}} a <b>Schottky</b> pair and 0.75 eV for cationic migration). These low energies result in large defect concentrations, which can reach near 1% near the melting point.|$|E
25|$|After 1922, {{experimental}} interest increased, {{particularly in}} the groups led by Millikan at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, and by Gossling at the General Electric Company in London. Attempts to understand autoelectronic emission included plotting experimental current-voltage (i - V) data in different ways, {{to look for a}} straight-line relationship. Current increased with voltage more rapidly than linearly, but plots of type (log(i) vs. V) were not straight. <b>Schottky</b> suggested in 1923 that the effect might be due to thermally induced emission over a field-reduced barrier. If so, then plots of type (log(i) vs. V1/2) should be straight; but they were not. Nor is Schottky's explanation compatible with the experimental observation of only very weak temperature dependence in CFE – a point initially overlooked.|$|E
25|$|Nabarro–Herring creep is {{strongly}} temperature dependent. For lattice diffusion of atoms {{to occur in}} a material, neighboring lattice sites or interstitial sites in the crystal structure must be free. A given atom must also overcome the energy barrier to move from its current site (it lies in an energetically favorable potential well) to the nearby vacant site (another potential well). The general form of the diffusion equation is D = D0exp(E/KT) where D0 has a dependence on both the attempted jump frequency {{and the number of}} nearest neighbor sites and the probability of the sites being vacant. Thus there is a double dependence upon temperature. At higher temperatures the diffusivity increases due to the direct temperature dependence of the equation, the increase in vacancies through <b>Schottky</b> defect formation, and an increase in the average energy of atoms in the material. Nabarro–Herring creep dominates at very high temperatures relative to a material's melting temperature.|$|E
25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small <b>Schottky</b> diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E
500|$|Slotted {{lines are}} used for {{microwave}} measurements and consist of a movable probe inserted into a slot in a transmission line. [...] They are {{used in conjunction with}} a microwave power source and usually, in keeping with their low-cost application, a low cost <b>Schottky</b> diode detector and VSWR meter rather than an expensive microwave power meter.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} and {{improvements to the}} basic Dickson charge pump. [...] Many of these are concerned with reducing {{the effect of the}} transistor drain-source voltage. [...] This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. [...] With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will be far less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. [...] For a circuit using discrete components the <b>Schottky</b> diode would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state. [...] However, integrated circuit designers prefer to use the easily available MOSFET and compensate for its inadequacies with increased circuit complexity.Yuan, 14-21 ...|$|E
500|$|The {{detected}} {{voltage signal}} {{output of the}} <b>Schottky</b> barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly. [...] However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around [...] [...] This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the detector output, but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity. [...] Another technique {{is to reduce the}} range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum. [...] The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern. [...] This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.|$|E
500|$|The probe is {{connected}} to a detector and a display meter (not shown in figure 2). [...] These can be, respectively, a thermistor and power meter, or an envelope detector and VSWR meter. [...] The detector can be a crystal detector or a <b>Schottky</b> barrier diode. [...] The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance λ/4 from the probe tip {{as shown in figure}} 3. [...] This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the quarter-wave impedance transformer effect. [...] Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line. [...] The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector. [...] Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.|$|E

[...] There is a smooth diffeomorphism F of the [...] region [...] Ω1, given by the unit disk with k open disks removed, onto the closure of Ω. [...] It can be assumed that 0 lies in the interior of the domain. Again after a modification of the diffeomorphism and conformal change near the boundary, the metric can be assumed to be compatible with reflection. Let G be the group generated by reflections in the boundary circles of Ω1. The interior of Ω1 iz a fundamental domain for G. Moreover, the index two normal subgroup G0 consisting of orientation-preserving mappings is a classical <b>Schottky</b> group.
