2500|$|There is no {{definitively}} {{known cause}} of grisi siknis, {{although there are}} some theories which attempt to explain its origin. Although it has not discovered organic cause, <b>says</b> <b>Dennis,</b> grisi siknis still [...] "follow the classic model for contagious disease". Dennis claims that grisi siknis {{is the source of the}} emotionally volatile Miskito culture, saying [...] "it is clear that grisi siknis is related to emotional upset, worry, fear and general anxiety", while microorganisms, if involved, are intermediate. Dr. Ronald C. Simons, professor emeritus of psychiatry and anthropology at Michigan State University, as quoted by Nicola Ross in The Walrus magazine, upholds this argument, proposing that grisi siknis is caused by poverty and stress among the Miskito. Culturally bound syndromes, Simons says, are often strongly influenced by behavior and experience and have become a local way of expressing misfortune. Dr. Wolfgang Jilek, of the University of Columbia’s psychiatry department, also quoted by Ross in The Walrus, calls culturally bound syndromes [...] "real" [...] despite a general lack of evidence for organic causes. They are primarily the result of trauma and stress, Jilek claims, that end in mental dissociation problems. Susan Kellogg, Associate Professor and Chair of the History Department at the University of Houston, says that grisi siknis is the result of the cultural [...] "physical and emotional stresses" [...] that Miskito women endure. Shlomo Ariel, Co-Director of the Integrative Psychotherapy Center in Ramat Gan, Israel, says that such disorders are the product of the culture, delineates [...] acceptable coping mechanisms for dealing with external or internal changes. In a typical homeostatic function, Ariel says, [...] "emotional or behavioral disorders in the individual are defined as such by the culture", which culture subsequently imposes treatment in order to restore equilibrium. Grisi siknis can be considered a ritualized behavior associated with the adolescent to adult transition [...] among the Miskito, says Mark Jamieson, professor of social anthropology at the University of Manchester. Girls in Miskito culture, claims Jamieson, are faced with the culturally inconsistent task of attracting a husband sexually while remaining safe and pure to maintain societal status quo. The contradictory familial pressures to both protect and marry off the daughter adds to this. Thus, says Shlomo, [...] "the syndrome may be viewed as a safety valve" [...] to maintain equilibrium between these conflicting pressures. Miskito girls express transitional sexuality through the syndrome while maintaining social purity, with the culture holding the victims blameless for their actions while attacked by the disease.|$|E

[...] This objection, that [...] "motion is represented as exhibited by sculpture," [...] is said by Johnson, [...] "to be the most reasonable of Dennis' remarks," [...] but Dennis neutralised his own criticism when he added, that [...] "sculpture can indeed show posture and position, and from posture and position we may conclude that the objects are in motion."] ...|$|E

Why, in the reign of King Charles the Second, when that court was more gallant and more polite than ever the English court perhaps had been before; when there was at court {{the present and the}} late Duke of Buckingham, the late Earl of Dorset, Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, famous for his wit and poetry, Sir Charles Sedley, Mr. Saville, Mr. Buckley, and several others.|$|E

Even though Lam is not mentioned {{as one of the}} directors of the Hong Kong New Wave of the turn of the 70’s and 80’s, these two films display an identical approach to the films of <b>say</b> <b>Dennis</b> Yu or Johnny Mak. The only difference is that Lam was not an auteur in the classical sense, meaning he was the director and cinematographer of the films, but not the author of the script. Nevertheless, Brothers from the Walled City and Men from the Gutter, just like the contemporary New Wave films, combine popular genres with personal drama, their characters and conflicts are grounded in the everyday social reality of Hong Kong and they were filmed on actual locations, not just in a studio.|$|R

Ballads and poems have been composed in his memory, some of which are still sung today. Sri Aurobindo, the great yogi, mystic and revolutionary of the 20th century wrote a splendid poem dedicated to Baji Prabhu, which was used as a symbol to capture the spirit of sacrifice that was required of the young men in India’s freedom struggle which was then under way.|$|R

25|$|Grisi siknis is {{generally}} only cured by traditional Miskito healing methods, according to The Journal of the American Botanical Council. In treating the ailment, the Miskito typically follow {{a hierarchy of}} remedies, turning first to home-based remedies, second to modern health facilities and finally to curandero or witch doctors, the latter particularly, if evil spirits {{are believed to be}} involved. These healers use an assortment of vapor baths, anointing, teas and potions, all of which are organically derived. According to Dennis, the Miskito healers use a variety of undisclosed steamed herbal remedies that are generally more successful than any Western medicine. However, the cures can be counteracted, <b>Dennis</b> <b>says,</b> by exposure to dead people, pregnant women and various meats.|$|R
5000|$|The film uses {{extensive}} cuts of archived footage shot {{during the}} war, {{but all of}} it is of the many varied aspects of mission preparation, takeoffs and landings. Except for the sequence under the opening credits, of bomber formations leaving voluminous contrails and then dropping bombs, no combat footage is used in the movie. Only two exteriors were used, of Brockhurst driving up to the main gate of the base in a jeep, and of Martin <b>saying</b> farewell to <b>Dennis</b> at his bomber's dispersal hardstand, totalling little more than a minute of film.

Indeed this gentleman's stoicism was of that not uncommon kind, which enables a man to bear with exemplary fortitude the afflictions of his friends, but renders him, by way of counterpoise, rather selfish and sensitive in respect of any that happen to befall himself. It is therefore no disparagement to the great officer in question to state, without disguise or concealment, {{that he was at}} first very much alarmed, and that he betrayed divers emotions of fear, until his reasoning powers came to his relief, and set before him a more hopeful prospect.|$|R

2500|$|Jackson — in {{the late}} 1960s, Ketcham decided to add an African American {{character}} named Jackson to the cast. Ketcham designed Jackson {{in the tradition of}} a stereotypical cartoon pickaninny, with huge lips, big white eyes, and just a suggestion of an Afro hair style.

Protests erupted in Detroit, Little Rock, Miami, and St. Louis, and debris was thrown at the offices of the Post Dispatch. Taken aback, Ketcham issued a statement explaining that his intentions were innocent, and Jackson was not used again. However, another African American character named Jay Weldon appeared in the 1986 animated series to far less controversy, as he was not a stereotype.|$|R
