Currently, the first-line treatment for malaria is based on the association of an artemisinin-type compound with another drug. β-arteether (AE), the ethyl ether derivative of artemisinin, is highly effective against all species of Plasmodium. Curcumin (CC), a hydrophobic polyphenol from Curcuma longa, was recently proposed as one of the adjunctive therapy strategies in the AE-combination therapies to protect against parasite recrudescence and relapse. However, the oral delivery of AE and CC is limited by their poor water solubility and low stability in gastrointestinal medium. The main objective of this thesis was to develop lipid-based drug delivery systems (LBDDS) for the oral delivery of AE and CC in order to enhance their oral bioavailability and to provide an effective rapid cure for malaria at low cost. In the gastrointestinal medium, the developed LBDDS <b>self-emulsified</b> and increased the solubility and the stability of AE and CC. Additionally, AE-LBDDS and CC-LBDDS significantly increased the transport of AE and CC across intestinal cell monolayers. Using murine malaria model, complete cure was observed in mice treated orally with AE-LBDDS at 24 mg/kg for 4 days. At the same dose, this antimalarial efficacy was comparable to that of the marketed intramuscular injectable formulations of AE and significantly higher than that of an oily solution of AE given orally. The combination therapy of subtherapeutic dose of AE-LBDDS and CC-LBDDS increased protection and survival rate associated with a significant delay in recrudescence. In conclusion, the combination of oral AE and CC loaded in LBDDS may constitute a promising approach for the treatment of malaria at low cost.

Histopathologic studies on the rat intestine showed that SDEDDS can cause mucosal damage to a certain degree of toxicity, however this was not serious. These results suggest that SDEDDS can greatly improve the oral absorption of HSYA. Given the toxicity demonstrated to the small intestine, the formulation prescription should be improved to enhance security in the future.

40|$|Vijaya College of Pharmacy, Hayath nagar, Hyderabad- 501511 Efavirenz {{is a drug}} with an {{absorption}} window. Its oral bioavailability is 40 - 50 %. The aim of {{this work}} was to formulate solid <b>self-emulsifying</b> drug delivery system to improve the solubility and bioavailability of efavirenz. Solubility of Efavirenz was determined in various vehicles like oils, surfactants and co surfactants. Which, upon dilution with aqueous media, spontaneously form fine oil in water (micro) emulsion with less than 300 nm in droplet size. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the self (micro) emulsifying region. Seven S(M) EDDS formulations were prepared. The optimized liquid <b>self-emulsifying</b> drug delivery system formulation (F 3) was converted into solid S(M) EDDS with free flowing powder by adsorbing onto a solid carrier like Neusilin US 2 for encapsulation. X-ray diffraction studies showed no physicochemical interaction. The in-vitro dissolution characteristics and in-vivo bioavailability studies of optimized formulation and reference standard confirmed that better systemic absorption and bioavailability also found to be increased with optimized formulation...|$|E
40|$|Background: CSIC (5 -chloro- 3 -phenylsulfonylindole- 2 -carboxamide), a non-nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor (NNRTI) {{has not been}} advanced as a therapeutic anti-HIV candidate drug due to its low aqueous solubility and poor bioavailability. Objective: The objective of this work was to formulate CSIC into <b>self-emulsifying</b> oil formulations {{for the purpose of}} improving its aqueous solubility and evaluating in vitro antiretroviral activity. Methods: CSIC <b>self-emulsifying</b> oil formulations (SEFs) were formulated and evaluated for droplet size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), viscosity, emulsification time, stability and bioactivity. Results: Results showed significantly improved solubility of CSIC in the SEFs. The concentration of co-surfactant affected the droplet size, zeta potential and polydispersity index. In vitro bioactivity studies showed that the CSIC SEFs retained full anti-HIV activity. Conclusion: The in vitro data from this first attempt to formulate CSIC SEFs suggest that improvement on the aqueous solubility of CSIC through this delivery system may accentuate its antiretroviral effectiveness in vivo via bioavailability enhancement. The formulation is therefore intended as an oral anti-HIV agent for prophylactic and therapeutic uses. © 2013 Obitte et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

The {{ability of}} <b>self-emulsifying</b> drug {{delivery}} system (SEDDS), which {{is a mixture of}} oils, surfactants and co-surfactants, to improve dissolution rate of a poorly water-soluble drug, manidipine hydrochloride (MDP), was evaluated in this study.

40|$|For the {{therapeutic}} delivery of lipophilic active moieties (Class II drugs), lipid based formulations are inviting increasing attention. Amongst many such delivery options, like incorporation of drug in oils (1), surfactant dispersions (2), emulsions (3) and liposomes (4), {{one of the}} most popular approaches are the <b>self-emulsifying</b> drug delivery systems (SEDDS).

40|$|The {{application}} of novel emulsification technologies {{was investigated in}} order to improve the utilisation of oil, the production of oxytetracycline and the viscosity during industrial and non-industrial Streptomyces rimosus fermentations. Emulsifiers (Mergital Q 3 V® and Agnique RSO 10 ®) mixed with rapeseed oil were fed to industrial S. rimosus fermentations. In addition, the Phase Inversion Temperature technology (PIT rapeseed and sunflower oil emulsions) was applied on both industrial and non-industrial S. rimosus fermentations. Similarly, the <b>Self-Emulsifying</b> technology was used for the production of a rapeseed oil feed (Agnique RSO 3 ®) which contained a hydrophilic group and was fed to S. rimosus industrial and non-industrial fermentations. Increased oil utilisation was recorded in the above processes. A very significant decrease (55 - 65 %) in the final concentration of residual oil was achieved when PIT and <b>self-emulsifying</b> technologies were used. A significant decrease (50 - 75 %) in the viscosity was also observed in the <b>self-emulsifying</b> process. It was concluded that the increase in the utilisation of oil was due to the smaller and stable oil droplet size offered by such technologies and/or the lower viscosity which increased the mass transfer from the complex fermentation medium to the cells. The final antibiotic (oxytetracycline) concentration did not significantly increase in any of the industrial and non-industrial fermentations. However, the microorganisms was able to produce oxytetracycline after oil feed termination when oil emulsions were used to contrast to normal rapeseed oil where no production was observed. Morphological analysis of the dispersed mycelia was carried out providing information on the length and number of tips of the free mycelia. When oil was utilised at higher rates, the microorganisms showed higher metabolic activity which led to longer filaments. This was probably due to better carbon availability increasing production rate of elongation precursors inside the mycelia. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to design and characterize liquid and solid <b>self-emulsifying</b> drug delivery systems (SEDDS) for poorly soluble atorvastatin. To optimize the composition of liquid atorvastatin-SEDDS, solubility tests, pseudoternary phase diagrams, emulsification studies and other in vitro examinations (thermodynamic stability, droplet size and zeta potential analysis) were performed. Due to the disadvantages of liquid SEDDS (few choices for dosage forms, low stability and portability during the manufacturing process), attempts were also made to obtain solid SEDDS. Solid SEDDS were successfully obtained using the spray drying technique from two optimized liquid formulations, CF 3 and OF 2. Despite liquid SEDDS formulation, CF 3 was characterized by lower turbidity, higher percentage transmittance and better <b>self-emulsifying</b> properties, {{and based on the}} in vitro dissolution study it can be concluded that better solubilization properties were exhibited by solid formulation OF 2. Overall, the studies demonstrated the possibility of formulating liquid and solid SEEDS as promising carriers of atorvastatin. SEDDS, with their unique solubilization properties, provide the opportunity to deliver lipophilic drugs to the gastrointestinal tract in a solubilized state, avoiding dissolution—a restricting factor in absorption rate of BCS Class 2 drugs, including atorvastatin...|$|E
