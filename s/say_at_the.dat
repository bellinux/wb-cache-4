In May 2005, he {{found out it was}} actually Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are similar to Parkinson's disease. Osbourne will have to take daily medication {{for the rest of his}} life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition. Osbourne has also shown symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show, The Osbournes, where he often asks his family to repeat what they <b>say.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome joined Osbourne on stage to discuss their analysis of Osbourne's whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug abuse.|$|E
25|$|Akhtar's {{career has}} been plagued with injuries, controversies and accusations of poor attitude. After rising into {{international}} stardom {{at a young age}} due to his speed, due to his interesting personality and charisma glamour seemed to follow him, some <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> detriment of his sporting focus. Although he eventually crossed the 100mph barrier, his attitude took its toll on his reputation as well as his fitness. After a poor performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he got involved in a verbal conflict with former Pakistan captain and fast bowler Waqar Younis. Later on Akhtar was sacked along with other players, including Younis. In a triangular series in 2003 held in Sri Lanka, he was caught ball tampering making him the second player in cricket to be banned on ball tampering charges. The same year he was banned for one Test match and two One Day International matches for abusing South African spin bowler Paul Adams, during a match against South Africa.|$|E

Lancaster, Chief U.S. District Judge, and pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to distribute performance-enhancing drugs, specifically HGH and Erythropoietin (EPO). According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary McKeen Houghton, the retail value of the transactions brokered by Papp between Shandong Kexing Bioproducts Corp. and over 180 international clients approached $80,000USD from September 2006 to September 2007 None of the 187 customers, including cyclists, swimmers, runners, triathletes, mixed-martial artists and rowers, were identified in court. Houghton, Papp, and his attorney, William Ward, {{declined to comment on}} terms of the plea agreement, which had been sealed by the court – a measure often taken if a defendant is cooperating with the government in ongoing investigations, but neither Ward nor Houghton would <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time if that was the case. In October 2011, Papp was finally sentenced to serve a six-month period of house arrest, followed by two and half years probation.|$|E

500|$|In late 1269, {{after several}} months of {{deadlock}} during which the cardinals had met only intermittently, Ranieri Gatti, the Prefect of Viterbo, and Albertus de Montebono, the Podesta, ordered (some sources <b>say,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> urging of Saint Bonaventure) the cardinals sequestered in the Palazzo dei Papi di Viterbo until a new pope was elected.

While reading the script, he told Gowariker that some of his character's dialogue was what he would usually <b>say.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, Chopra described the film as the [...] "most difficult and important" [...] in her career. She found playing twelve characters equivalent to performing in twelve different films. She had to have a different look for each of them but had very little time to prepare and establish each character on screen, since each character had [...] "one song and about two scenes". Since all the characters except one were between ages eighteen and twenty-four, Chopra found it difficult to make every character look distinct. She said that there were not many options other than changing her hair and the characters' outfits to portray them. As a result, she chose to work on her body language and experimented with her voice and accent to make the characters distinct from one another, describing it as [...] "a real test".|$|E

Although the musical frequently mentions the Crusade, it is never actually shown, excepting Richard's imprisonment in Austria upon his return trip.

[...] The Ambassador for the United States stated: [...] "Foreign Minister Lavrov told United States Secretary of State Rice that the democratically elected President of Georgia — and I quote — 'must go'.

We do not use such expressions." [...] After the meeting, CNN reported, [...] "But Churkin drew a rebuke from other Security Council members, including its current president, after he questioned the objectivity of a top U.N. official who briefed ambassadors on the conflict in Georgia". Sergey Lavrov later claimed that Russian [...] "peace enforcement" [...] operation was not linked to the removal of Saakashvili from office. He said Condoleezza Rice [...] "incorrectly interpreted" [...] the phone conversation between them. He added if an agreement on non-use of military force is signed, [...] "peace will be restored independently of the further fate of Saakashvili".|$|E
