Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E

He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later.</b> He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of whether aversive outcomes are generally preferred at <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> at <b>later</b> times {{in the future is}} examined. Theories predicting choices of advanced and deferred aversive outcomes are summarized. A previous result suggesting overwhelming preference for more immediate aversive outcomes is challenged on the basis of problems endemic to experimental studies of decision making. An experiment that attempted to circumvent those problems is described. Subjects chose between sums of money that could be lost at various times in the future. The subjects were evenly divided in their preferences for advanced and deferred losses. Subjects in a control condition duplicated the results of the previous experiment that had demonstrated the predominance of preferences for advanced aversive outcomes. The implications of the conclusions for a representation of choice over deferred outcomes are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Delay {{discounting}} impacts {{every decision}} a human makes when {{given the option}} of a <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> a <b>later</b> receipt of a reward. This tendency results in individuals giving up bigger, later rewards for smaller, sooner ones. However, individuals differ in their level of discounting according to their innate tendency and the situation. For example, some individuals naturally discount future rewards more, resulting in preferring even smaller rewards sooner. Because delay discounting affects such {{a broad spectrum of}} decision making, the authors hypothesized that delay discounting affects when, or if, an individual intends on starting a business. If an individual starts too soon, it will affect the success of the business. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed the relationship between delay discounting and entrepreneurial intentions. To measure the discounting, we examined participant’s preferences regarding a series of scenarios of a smaller, sooner versus a larger, later reward. The results indicated that higher levels of delay discounting significantly increased the likelihood of intending to start a business within five years. It does not, however, increase the likelihood of intending to start a business in general. The findings suggest that some failed business ventures may be a result of high delay discounting...|$|R
