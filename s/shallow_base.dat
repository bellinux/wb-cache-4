40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel deep {{learning}} approach, deeply-fused nets. The central idea of our approach is deep fusion, i. e., combine the intermediate representations of base networks, where the fused output serves as the input of the remaining part of each base network, and perform such combinations deeply over several intermediate representations. The resulting deeply fused net enjoys several benefits. First, {{it is able to}} learn multi-scale representations as it enjoys the benefits of more base networks, which could form the same fused network, other than the initial group of base networks. Second, in our suggested fused net formed by one deep and one <b>shallow</b> <b>base</b> networks, the flows of the information from the earlier intermediate layer of the deep base network to the output and from the input to the later intermediate layer of the deep base network are both improved. Last, the deep and <b>shallow</b> <b>base</b> networks are jointly learnt and can benefit from each other. More interestingly, the essential depth of a fused net composed from a deep base network and a <b>shallow</b> <b>base</b> network is reduced because the fused net could be composed from a less deep base network, and thus training the fused net is less difficult than training the initial deep base network. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance over two closely-related methods, ResNet and Highway, and competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-arts...|$|E

40|$|Regional {{erosion of}} the Rock Garden ridge top, a {{bathymetric}} high within New Zealand’s Hikurangi Subduction Margin, is likely associated with its gas hydrate system. Seismic data reveal gas pockets that appear partially trapped beneath the <b>shallow</b> <b>base</b> of gas hydrate stability. Steady-state fluid flow simulations, conducted on detailed two-dimensional geological models, reveal that anomalous fluid pressure can develop close to the sea floor in response to lower-permeability hydrate-bearing sediments and underlying gas pockets. Transient simulations indicate that large-scale cycling of fluid overpressure may occur on time scales of a few to tens of years. We predict intense regions of hydro-fracturing to preferentially develop beneath the ridge top rather than beneath the flanks, due to more pronounced overpressure generation and gas migration through hydrate-bearing sediments. Results suggest that sediment weakening and {{erosion of the}} ridge top by hydro-fracturing could be owed to fluid dynamics of the shallow gas hydrate system...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, the north-west of England in the mid-fifteenth {{century has}} been seen as being under the total {{dominance}} of the NeviIles, the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, and their successor in the north Richard Duke of Gloucester. This thesis aims to correct that impression by examining the political structures that operated in the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland in the period between c. 1440 and 1485, and the relationships between the magnates in question and local society. In doing so, it finds an emphasis on continuity and co-operation within the local community that did not always go hand-in-hand with the magnates' expectations of service. The power-struggle at court eventually imposed factionalism on the region against its wishes. The magnates continued to emphasise the necessity of being served by men who had proved themselves loyal, and divided authority in the region by only extending it to men who had actively supported the Yorkists in 1459 - 61. After 1471, Edward IV showed more care in how he dealt with the region. Instead of allowing his brother the Duke of Gloucester carte blanche, he restricted his influence by using his own agent, Sir William Parr. Gloucester's interest was restricted to financial matters only until the Scottish war of 1480. After his usurpation the <b>shallow</b> <b>base</b> of his support in the region became apparent, and few men took part in the "northern plantations". Richard still had plans to conquer south-west Scotland and much of his patronage was geared towards this. His subsequent failure undermined his limited support in the north-west and, in 1485, the locality had little difficulty in adjusting to the Tudor regime...|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examines {{the impact of}} short-term study abroad programs on students at one small, religious, comprehensive university on the West Coast. In particular, four dimensions of influence are investigated: academic impact, personal impact, social impact, and spiritual impact. The primary objective of this investigation is {{to determine whether the}} short term study abroad programs at this institution provide substantive opportunities for student growth in these four dimensions. A secondary objective utilizes Astin’s Student Involvement Theory to discover the extent to which student engagement affects this student growth. The literature review examines the impact of study abroad experiences in each of this study’s four dimensions, as well as the implications of study abroad duration on student outcomes. All participants in this study attend the same university and enrolled in a short-term study abroad program nine-months prior to participating in this research. The survey instrument relied on student self-assessment. Findings revealed that the short-term study abroad experience did have a measurable impact on study participants. Each of the four dimensions studied exhibited areas of positive impact, with the greatest impact occurring in the areas of personal and social growth. While less substantial, some degree of impact was felt in the areas of academic and spiritual growth. Further, the research found a positive correlation between quality and quantity of student investment in the short-term study abroad experience and the impact that students realized as a result. This study builds on a <b>shallow</b> <b>base</b> of scholarship specifically pertaining to the impact of short-term study abroad. Due to its methodology, this study is limited in its universality. The findings and conclusions are directly applicable to the institution and participants studied, but are not intended to be representative of all short-term study abroad programs...|$|E

Methods: Retrospective evaluation of 125 consecutive lacrimal ostia post-DCR was performed. Medical records were screened, and photographs and videos were assessed to note the details of various ostial parameters. The major time points in evaluation were 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3  months, and 6  months post-DCR. The ostia were defined and parameters like shape, size, location, and evolution of ostium were noted. Evaluation parameters were defined for internal common opening (ICO), ostium stents, and ostium granulomas. Ostium cicatrix and synechiae were graded based on their significance. Surgical success rates were computed and ostium characteristics in failed cases were studied. Results: A total of 125 ostia were evaluated on the aforementioned ostium parameters. Because five ostia showed a complete cicatricial closure with no recognizable features, the remaining 120 ostia were studied. The ostium location was anterior to the axilla of middle turbinate in 85. 8 % (103 / 120) of the cases. Moreover, 76. 6 % (92 / 120) of the ostia were circular to oval in shape, with a <b>shallow</b> <b>base.</b> The ostium size was > 8 × 5  mm in 78. 3 % (94 / 120) of the cases. The ICO was found to be located in the central or paracentral basal area in 75. 8 % (91 / 120). The anatomical and functional success rates achieved were 96 % and 93. 6 %, respectively. All the five cases with anatomical failures showed a complete cicatrization and the ICO movements were poor in all the three cases of functional failure. Conclusion: The article attempts to standardize the postoperative evaluation of a DCR ostium and provides a systematic protocol and scoring system for possible use by surgeons and researchers alike.

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} acid {{deposition}} and tree harvesting on three lakes and their representative sub-catchments in the Muskoka-Haliburton region of south-central Ontario {{was assessed using}} a critical loads approach. As nitrogen dynamics in forest soils are complex and poorly understood, for simplicity and to allow comparison among lakes and their catchments, CLs (A) for both lakes and forest soils were calculated assuming that nitrate leaching from catchments will not change over time (i. e. a best case scenario). In addition, because soils {{in the region are}} <b>shallow,</b> <b>base</b> cation weathering rates for the representative sub-catchments were calculated for the entire soil profile and these estimates were also used to calculate critical loads for the lakes. These results were compared with critical loads obtained by the Steady State Water Chemistry (SSWC) model. Using the SSWC model, critical loads for lakes were between 7 and 19 meq m - 2 yr - 1 higher than those obtained from soil measurements. Lakes and forests are much more sensitive to acid deposition if forests are harvested, but two acid-sensitive lakes had much lower critical loads than their respective forested sub-catchments implying that acceptable acid deposition levels should be dictated by the most acid-sensitive lakes in the region. Under conditions that assume harvesting, the CL (A) is exceeded at two of the three lakes and five of the six sub-catchments assessed in this study. However, sulphate export from catchments greatly exceeds input in bulk deposition and, to prevent lakes from falling below the critical chemical limit, sulphate inputs to lakes must be reduced by between 37 % and 92 % if forests are harvested. Similarly, sulphate leaching from forested catchments that are harvested must be reduced by between 16 and 79 % to prevent the ANC of water draining the rooting zone from falling below 0 ?eq l - 1. These calculations assume that extremely low calcium leaching losses (9 ? 27 ?eq l - 1) from forest soils can be maintained without any decrease in forest productivity. Calcium concentrations in the three lakes have decreased by between ? 10 and 25 % over the past 20 years and calculations assume that calcium concentrations in lakes can fall to around 30 % of their current values without any harmful effects on biota. Both these assumptions require urgent investigation. Keywords: acid deposition, calcium, critical loads, forests, harvesting, lakes</p...|$|E
40|$|Earthquake {{response}} of a structure on relatively soft soil {{is influenced by}} the soil material properties and type of foundation i. e. shallow or deep foundation. The design recommendations of Eurocode 8 provide a conservative method to determine seismic loads for spectral analysis approach assuming a fixed base structure. This thesis attempts to evaluate the influence of the piles on the {{response of}} a structure in terms of acceleration and base shear force. The shear force induced at the <b>shallow</b> <b>base</b> is determined using finite element program PLAXIS 2 D and compared with the calculation based on Eurocode 8. The aim is to investigate the correspondence of numerical analysis in PLAXIS 2 D with simplified analysis method of Eurocode 8 (NS-EN 1998 - 1 : 2004 +A 1 : 2013 +NA: 2014). A representative soil model is constructed with proper boundary conditions for dynamic analysis in PLAXIS 2 D based on previous researches and recommendations. The choice of boundary conditions is tested with a simpler material model and a harmonic motion and verified with theoretical solution of amplitude factor. The next step is to perform a free field site response analysis of the main soil model for an input motion of 0. 1 g to evaluate the soil behavior during earthquake. The results are compared with one dimensional ground response analysis in DEEPSOIL and reasonable agreement is observed. The soil model is then provided with the structures to evaluate the effect of the piles. Four cases consisting of two different structures with two different foundation systems (shallow foundation and piled raft) are simulated on the given soil condition. Free vibration analyses are carried out for all the cases to determine natural frequencies or period of vibration of the structures. The obtained results are compared with logarithmic decrement and Eurocode 8. The resulting natural period of vibrations are 0. 33 seconds for the single-story structure and 0. 6 seconds for the four-story structure. This indicates that the numerical analysis results are consistent with theory and Eurocode 8. Results of full dynamic analyses show that the foundation type has considerable influence on seismic response of a structure. For a single-story structure, the acceleration increases over 40 % and the for the four-story structure it is over 45 %. Calculated shear force {{at the bottom of the}} rigid base is increased by almost 100 % due to the piles for both structures. This highlights the fact that specific analysis for design base shear is required for pile supported structures to ensure safety against earthquakes. However, the obtained values of base shear for all the cases are lower than the values calculated based on Eurocode 8 as expected. Although for shallow foundation, Eurocode 8 provides overestimation which may not be cost effective. Therefore, it can be inferred that the numerical analysis using PLAXIS 2 D demonstrates reasonable correspondence with Eurocode 8. Further studies can be conducted to obtain spectral behavior for different kinds of foundations...|$|E
