5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} <b>several</b> <b>times</b> <b>over</b> {{the choice}} of a subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S.

While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E

As they found lyrics that interested them, they had reproductions mailed to their homes from the Archives to work on the material at their leisure. The duo finished recording several songs throughout the year but did not have enough material to complete the album. The recordings were also made without a budget or record contract for release.|$|E

In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
5|$|The lake formed <b>several</b> <b>times</b> <b>over</b> {{during the}} Holocene when {{water from the}} Colorado River was {{diverted}} into the Salton Trough.

Such changes in river courses may have been caused by earthquakes among the numerous faults that cross the region, such as the San Andreas Fault. Conversely, {{it is possible that the}} weight of the water itself triggered earthquakes. During its existence, Lake Cahuilla formed strandlines and various beach deposits such as gravel bars and travertine deposits.|$|E

The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police.

5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met <b>several</b> <b>times</b> <b>over</b> the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and another section for whites and blacks. This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E
