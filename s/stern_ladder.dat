60|$|A man was guardedly, and, {{from his}} situation, with some difficulty, moving round the {{quarter of the}} ship by {{the aid of the}} ropes and mouldings, which afforded him {{sufficient}} means to effect his object. He, however, soon reached a <b>stern</b> <b>ladder,</b> where he stood suspended, and evidently endeavouring to discern which of the two forms, that were overlooking his proceedings, was that of the individual he sought.|$|E
6000|$|The dingey of the [...] "Lady Vain" [...] {{had been}} towing behind; it was half full of water, had no oars, and was quite unvictualled. I {{refused to go}} aboard her, and flung myself full length on the deck. In the end, they swung me into her by a rope (for they had no <b>stern</b> <b>ladder),</b> and then they cut me adrift. I drifted slowly from the schooner. In a kind of stupor I watched all hands take to the rigging, and slowly but surely she came round to the wind; the sails fluttered, and then bellied out as the wind came into them. I stared at her weather-beaten side heeling steeply towards me; and then she passed out of my range of view.|$|E
50|$|One {{shot from}} the Confederates carried away Shenandoah's <b>stern</b> <b>ladder.</b> She renewed the action with other ships of the fleet on Christmas morning to cover the landing of about 3,000 Army troops. Her {{deliberate}} and well directed fire silenced a four-gun battery {{to the west of}} Fort Fisher. She then turned her attention to a two-gun casemated battery. One shell from this battery fell a few yards short, and another passed over Shenandoah which retaliated by exploding a 150-pounder rifle shell {{near the top of the}} mound.|$|E

60|$|He was, accordingly, by {{no means}} pleased to see Jacinta and Miss Gascoyne stroll out from the deck-house as he drew in under the Estremedura's side, {{especially}} as there were no apparent means of getting on board quietly. The lancha had vanished round the <b>stern,</b> the <b>ladder</b> was triced up, and the open cargo gangway several feet above the brine. The steamer also hove up another four or five feet of streaming plates every time she rolled. Still, {{it was evident that}} he could not stay where he was on the chance of the ladies not noticing him indefinitely, and as he swam on again Miss Gascoyne broke into a startled scream.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 Robert Chicken {{patented}} a {{sheet to}} tiller {{system in the}} UK, known as The Steersman. It consists of two swinging platforms fitted on to the cockpit coamings {{either side of the}} boat,. The normal jib sheet winches are moved from their normal position and then re-bolted down on to the top of these platforms.With the sails set, the leeward jib sheet is cleated to the winch in the normal way, and the wind pressure in the jib, transmitted through the jib sheet, swings the platform forward. To balance this movement, a shock cord spring tensioned between the platform and a point at the stern of the boat, keeps the platform in a central neutral position. Once set, any slight changes in wind strength or direction, causes the platform to swing forwards or backwards. A simple linkage then transmits this movement to the helm to keep the boat on course.The pressure in the sails can vary hugely depending on the wind strength and the direction that the boat is travelling relative to the wind. To accommodate this, the spring is arranged in a ‘block-and-tackle’ form with a double block fitted to the stern of the boat, and a single block clipped to the platform. The fixed end, and tail end are also attached to the platform; the fixed end is clipped, and the tail end passes through a jamb cleat for fine adjustment. With this in place, the maximum spring tension is now made up of four lengths of shock cord. For a lower wind pressure in the jib, the fixed end, and the single block can be re-clipped to an attachment point on the base of the platform. This then gives a range of spring strengths from one to four shock cord lengths. For very light wind pressures, a single lighter length of shock cord is used instead.The claimed benefit of this design over a windvane system that it [...] "is far more sensitive because it uses the larger jib area to sense any changes in the wind" [...] is questionable. When the jib is in laminar flow, i.e. optimally trimmed and delivers maximum propulsion, the force at the sheet is biggest and decreases to both sides of course deviation from this optimum. Concluding from that, the ship must be sailed with sub-optimal sail trim in order to have the proper steering correction at the tiller. Its position in the cockpit area however leaves the stern of the boat clear for other purposes such as dinghy davits, <b>stern</b> <b>ladders</b> etc. In 2012, the invention won the Haven Academy Award in the UK. The chairman of the judging committee was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to complete a circumnavigation non-stop, single handed.|$|R
