25|$|Lamarck gave a {{detailed}} description of the species that he named Gastonia cutispongia. He named another species, but gave it only a cursory description. No one today is really <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the other species was. Some authors believe that it was not even a member of Araliaceae.|$|E
25|$|Survival International {{campaigns for}} the uncontacted tribes in the {{territory}} of Peru, many unidentified indigenous people in Brazil, Russia, West Papua, and about 30 tribes in several countries in South America, Africa and Asia. They select their cases based on a criterion the organisation has established, which depends {{on a wide range}} of factors, such as the reliability and continuity of the information, the gravity of the situation the tribe in question is facing, the degree to which they believe their work can make a real difference, the degree to which improvements in this area would have a knock on effect for others, whether any other organisation is already working on the case, and whether they are <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the people themselves want.|$|E

25|$|The {{route of}} {{transmission}} {{is important to}} epidemiologists because patterns of contact vary between different populations and different groups of populations depending on socio-economic, cultural and other features. For example, low personal and food hygiene {{due to the lack}} of a clean water supply may result in increased transmission of diseases by the fecal-oral route, such as cholera. Differences in incidence of such diseases between different groups can also throw light on the routes of transmission of the disease. For example, if it is noted that polio is more common in cities in underdeveloped countries, without a clean water supply, than in cities with a good plumbing system, we might advance the theory that polio is spread by the fecal-oral route. It can be minimised to a certain extent if we all consider being <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we do.|$|E
25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene was}} {{inspired}} by real-life Super Bowl commercials in which, according to Scully, [...] "you don't know what the product is" [...] because there is [...] "so much going on" [...] in Super Bowl commercials. It was also based on the music video for the American rock band ZZ Top's 1983 song [...] "Legs". Although they {{had come up with}} the commercial's premise, they were not <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> its tagline would be. Eventually, Martin, one of the episode writers, suggested [...] "The Catholic Church... we've made a few changes." [...] It got the biggest laugh from the other writers and was subsequently included in the episode.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't want to {{talk about}} that. It's so commonplace. I've thought of {{something}} that you don't know. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>What's</b> my name?" ...|$|R
6000|$|These {{words were}} whispered with an earnestness and {{agitation}} which surprised Penrose. His superior's equanimity was not easily overthrown. [...] "Are you <b>sure,</b> Father, <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you say?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... “Bah!” Ossipon contradicted. “Don’t be too <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> that. <b>What’s</b> {{to prevent}} half-a-dozen of them jumping upon you from {{behind in the}} street? With your arms pinned to your sides you could do nothing—could you?” ...|$|R
500|$|He also {{watches as}} the kidnappers board Enterprise, and how, {{in order to save}} Archer's life, Commander Tucker {{overloads}} two conduits and dies after becoming mortally wounded. He notices that Archer is troubled that he must write a speech about how worthwhile their explorations have been, despite his friend's death, but T'Pol assures him that Tucker would have considered it worthwhile. On Earth, Troi watches as Archer enters a crowded grand hall to give his speech and Riker joins her, now <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> course he should take. The final shot of the episode is a montage of the ships named Enterprise as Captains Picard, Kirk, and Archer recite the [...] "Where no man has gone before" [...] monologue.|$|E
2500|$|General Academic (GA) is {{a generic}} strand for {{students}} who are not yet <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to study in college or what track and strand to take with much like liberal arts subjects like electives from humanities and social sciences, applied business and science courses, and a freedom to choose electives from any track or strand offered by the school ...|$|E
2500|$|Boulez {{quickly became}} one of the {{philosophical}} leaders of the post-war modernist movement in the arts. As Alex Ross observed: [...] "at all times he seemed absolutely <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he was doing. Amid the confusion of postwar life, with so many truths discredited, his certitude was reassuring." [...] Many composers of Boulez's generation taught at the International Summer Course for New Music in Darmstadt, Germany, which Boulez attended {{for the first time in}} July 1952. As well as Stockhausen, Boulez was in contact there with other composers who would become significant figures in contemporary music, including Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, and Henri Pousseur. According to Scott Burnham, the so-called Darmstadt School composers created a style that, for a time, existed as an antidote to music of nationalist fervour; an international style that could not be co-opted as propaganda in the way that the Nazis had used, for example, the music of Beethoven.|$|E
50|$|Less than 24 {{hours before}} Diefenbaker’s first visit Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent {{stopped at the}} school. Diefenbaker drew a much larger and much more {{enthusiastic}} crowd (a <b>sure</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was {{to come in the}} election).|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll follow 'em, if {{it takes}} a week, {{to find out what}} we're after. My idee is that we'd better separate, so's to make <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> knowin' <b>what's</b> goin' on. You stay here, an' I'll creep over to the other side, then we shall be doublin' our chances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I'd let {{you know}} that I was <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>What</b> became <b>of</b> it after it was made, that, you know, is quite another question. I do think it must be in the house, and if so, search ought to be made. If they believe there is such a will, why don't they come and search more regularly? I shouldn't hinder them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Academics such as Diamond (2005) Wirthlin (2009) take {{exception}} {{to the role of}} [...] "hot lesbian" [...] in advertisements, and what has turned lesbianism into a commodity. As Diamond (2005) states, [...] "media representations signal a new appreciation and celebration of women's sexual freedom and diversity. On the other hand this is not necessarily the case...by portraying it as a fashionable 'add on' to otherwise conventional heterosexuality" [...] (p.105). They argue that women view these advertisements and images as a true reflection of {{what it is to be}} lesbian, thus making it much harder for real lesbians to acknowledge their sexuality. Furthermore, Wirthlin (2009) points out that, [...] "In order to resist this we must first recognize the ubiquitous presence of [...] "fad" [...] lesbian images and then problematize their use in popular culture. Next, there needs to be an active resistance against these images through counterculture advertisements and the performative act of resistance, such as through the act of writing as oneself, by utilizing multiple voices and subjectivities" [...] (p.113). In both academics view, lesbian or bi-sexual women must be <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> media means to them, and call into question things that do not appear [...] "authentic". Lesbians must also be educated on the topic of the [...] "hot lesbian", and ensure they do not fall into the [...] "heteronormative appropriation" [...] of advertising's effects.|$|E

6000|$|She had reseated {{herself with}} her arms crossed, and there sat {{perfectly}} mute. Robert Bolton stood up and repeated all his arguments, appealing even to her maternal love,--but she answered him never a word. She had not even yet succeeded in making the companion of her life submissive to her! That was the feeling which was now uppermost in her mind. He had said that Caldigate should be asked to the house, and should be acknowledged throughout all Cambridge as his son-in-law. And having said it, he would {{be as good as}} his word. She was <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> that. <b>Of</b> <b>what</b> avail had been all the labour of her life with such a result? ...|$|R

60|$|The Anne and Martha bore up, in company, as soon {{as these}} {{arrangements}} were completed, it being the plan now to go {{and look for the}} strangers. Once in view, the governor determined not to lose sight of the pirates, again, but to remain so near them, as to make <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> knowing <b>what</b> they were about, In such cases, a close look-out should always be kept on the enemy, since an advantage in time is gained by so doing, as well as a great deal of uncertainty and indecision avoided.|$|R

I didn't understand {{what it was all about}} but I could see it in his face. He was an ill-looking ruffian. I remembered then that Fenella had been frightened by some one hanging about the house, more than once. Well, there he was opposite to me, Chetwode, and by degrees I'd been moving a little nearer to him. He was after mischief--I was <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>What</b> should you have done, Chetwode?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 4. Again, God is fain {{to go this}} way, and all to make sinners make <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> Heaven. So long as souls are {{senseless}} <b>of</b> sin, and <b>what</b> a damnable state {{they are}} in by nature, so long they will even dally with the Kingdom of Heaven and the salvation of their own poor souls; but when God cometh and showeth them where they are, {{and what it is}} like to become of them if they miss of the crucified Saviour, O, then, saith the soul, would I were <b>sure</b> <b>of</b> Jesus; <b>what</b> shall I do to get assurance of Jesus? And thus is God forced, as I may say, to whip souls to Jesus Christ, they being so secure, so senseless, and so much their own enemies, as not to look out after their own eternal advantage.|$|R
