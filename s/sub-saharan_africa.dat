5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa,</b> many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species, {{based on its}} huge range across <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> and no {{documented}} decline.|$|E
5|$|Another {{clinical}} {{and public health}} concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging.

5|$|The Nok {{civilisation}} of Northern Nigeria flourished between 500 BC and AD 200, producing life-sized terracotta {{figures that}} {{are some of}} the earliest known sculptures in <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa.</b> Further north, the cities Kano and Katsina have a recorded history dating to around 999 AD.

40|$|Various {{arguments}} {{have been}} used to explain <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa's</b> economic decline. We find that a stress on investments in education as a prerequisite for more rapid growth is misplaced; that greater openness is far from sufficient to insure economic progress; that income inequality and urban bias are not so extreme as to foreclose prospects for more rapid growth and poverty alleviation; and that the constraints imposed by <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa's</b> human and physical geography are not core explanations for the regions poor performance. If African countries can establish an institutional environment that enables individuals to gain the rewards of their investments, the alleged barriers to the region's growth should prove surmountable. ...|$|R
50|$|Africa's deep {{interiors}} {{were not}} explored by Europeans until {{the mid to}} late 19th and early 20th centuries; this being {{due to a lack of}} trade potential in this region, and to serious problems with contagious tropical diseases in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa's</b> case.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people more {{susceptible}} to TB infections. The most important risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are infected by the virus. This is a particular problem in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa,</b> where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century Madagascar had {{the most}} {{developed}} and modern school system in pre-colonial <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa.</b> Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.|$|E
5|$|Educators face {{considerable}} challenges {{due to the}} nation's {{dispersed population}} and {{a certain degree of}} reluctance on the part of parents {{to send their children to}} school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, and more than half of the population is illiterate. Higher education is provided at the University of N'Djamena. At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates of <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa.</b>|$|E

Both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism dominated in the Ibibio, Annang, and the Efik kiosa lands.|$|E
5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively suggest that this reduction in solar radiation at the surface may have led to the failure of the monsoon in <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
