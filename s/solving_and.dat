5|$|In 2012 Bowling Green {{redesigned}} its undergraduate curriculum, {{creating an}} interdisciplinary program {{known as the}} BGeXperience (BGeX), that places a focus on personal growth and development, social connections, critical thinking, problem <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> diversity. First-year students begin the BGeX program during the BGeX Introduction Weekend {{prior to the start}} of the semester and continued taking courses designed to meet BGeX criteria throughout the four years of the undergraduate programs.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a third-person perspective, with a primary focus on Batman's melee combat, stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. Arkham Knight also introduces the Batmobile as a playable vehicle, {{which is used}} for transportation, puzzle <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> combat. The game expands Batman's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers a more open world structure than previous titles in the series, allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} eponymous detectives Alfe (Ben Jones), Horace (Kyle Kaplan), and Roba (also Jones). The trio take up <b>solving,</b> <b>and</b> {{sometimes}} creating, the numerous problems that plague their town, Farboro. To their aid is Tux Dog (John DiMaggio), an extremely wealthy dog who helps the Solverz {{in some of}} their cases but is just as often {{the source of their}} problems.|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} <b>solve</b> <b>and</b> {{estimate}} multivariate linear rational expectations models is described. The method {{is based on}} an iterative factorization of the polynomial matrix that describes the lags and expected leads in the model. Our experience is that the method works well in a variety of applications where other methods are either difficult or expensive to use. This note describes a method {{that can be used to}} <b>solve</b> <b>and</b> estimate multi-variate linear rational expectations models.

5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|Coon {{assumed the}} role of {{superintendent}} of shops in 1896. During his tenure at Georgia Tech, he moved the curriculum away from vocational training. Coon emphasized a balance between the shop and the classroom. Coon taught his students more modern quantification methods to solve engineering problems instead of outdated and more costly trial and error methods. He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis and problem <b>solving,</b> <b>and</b> mathematics.|$|E
5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes instead of having to write down clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu {{on the bottom of the}} game screen.|$|E

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle <b>solving</b> <b>and</b> to control the flashlight and cell phone.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Luria's {{earlier work}} on neuropsychological {{processes}} {{led to the}} PASS theory (1997). It argued that only looking at one general factor was inadequate for researchers and clinicians who worked with learning disabilities, attention disorders, intellectual disability, and interventions for such disabilities. The PASS model covers four kinds of processes (planning process, attention/arousal process, simultaneous processing, and successive processing). The planning processes involve decision making, problem <b>solving,</b> <b>and</b> performing activities and requires goal setting and self-monitoring.|$|E
25|$|The prefrontal lobe {{controls}} {{two related}} executive functioning domains. The first is mediation of abilities involved in planning, problem <b>solving,</b> <b>and</b> understanding information, {{as well as}} engaging in working memory processes and controlled attention. In this sense, the prefrontal lobe is involved with dealing with basic, everyday situations, especially those involving metacognitive functions. The second domain involves the ability to fulfill biological needs through the coordination of cognition and emotions which are both associated with the frontal and prefrontal areas.|$|E
