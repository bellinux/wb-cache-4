25|$|In 1946, the National Agricultural Advisory Service {{was set up}} {{to supply}} {{agricultural}} advice and information. The Hill Farming Act of 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings, land improvement, and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification. The Act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war. The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1948 enabled (in effect) tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies. In addition, the Livestock Rearing Act of March 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 Hill Farming Act to the upland <b>store</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep sector.|$|E

50|$|A fair, {{known as}} Ffair Llan, {{used to be}} held every year on 9 May, when <b>store</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep were sold to visiting dealers. Piglets were brought by horse and cart, with a mesh strung over to prevent their escape.|$|E
50|$|Lake George State Forest {{is formed}} from lands {{previously}} resourced for timber, production of naval <b>stores,</b> <b>cattle</b> grazing, and hunting. Cypress logging, {{by way of}} canals dug into the swampland, occurred up until 1910. The 1930s saw much of the land forested with longleaf and slash pine, or left in service of the Florida cracker cattle industry. After decades of aggressive harvesting, the 1960s saw reforestation efforts again plant slash pine.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{the simplicity of the}} daily fare of ordinary people, the cuisine of the royal courts of the ancient Near East was sophisticated, and it is assumed that the dishes served at the table of King Solomon and other Israelite kings were also elaborate. King David had officials who were in charge of wine cellars, olive <b>stores,</b> <b>cattle,</b> olive and fig trees (...) and the royal kitchen was a complex organization.|$|R
25|$|Following the Civil War, much of Florida's {{industry}} {{shifted to}} the south and east, a trend that continues to this day. The end of slavery caused the cotton and tobacco trades to suffer, and the state's major industry shifted to citrus, naval <b>stores,</b> <b>cattle</b> ranching, and even tourism, all of which occurred {{to the south and}} east due to climate and geography. This growth was especially noticeable around the Jacksonville area and the St. Johns River.|$|R

50|$|In 1910, {{he founded}} the Company and Commercial Cattle Behety Menendez, based in Punta Arenas. And then he formed the company with Import and Export of Patagonia. Its {{activities}} included convenience <b>stores,</b> <b>cattle</b> farms and shipping fleet. In the 1960s cleared most of {{the assets of the}} society were cleared and gave impetus to the chain of supermarkets La Anonima with over one hundred branches throughout Patagonia and the central Argentina province of Buenos Aires. Late in the 20th century, the stock package focused on the heirs of the Mauricio Braun family.|$|R
40|$|Disease {{and damage}} from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) {{continually}} threaten the livelihood of agricultural producers {{and the economy}} in the United States, as well as challenge state and federal wildlife managers. Threats can be partially addressed by excluding free-ranging deer from livestock-related resources. Throughout the year, use of stored livestock feed by deer in northern Lower Michigan (MI), USA fluctuates, though their presence is relatively consistent. Since 2008, use of livestock areas and resources by deer has been reduced through intensive efforts by livestock producers in cooperation with state and federal agencies. These efforts focused on excluding deer from <b>stored</b> <b>cattle</b> feed in areas where deer were abundant. We monitored deer activity from Jan 2012 to June 2013 on 6 cattle farms in northern MI using GPS collars to evaluate behavioral effects of excluding deer from stored feed. We characterized areas deer occupied before and after installing 2361 m of fences and gates to exclude deer from <b>stored</b> <b>cattle</b> feed. Following fence installation, 9 deer previously accessing stored feed shifted to patterns of habitat use similar to 5 deer that did not use stored feed. However, continued attempts to regain access to stored feed were made at low frequencies, emphasizing the need to maintain the integrity of fences and keep gates closed for damage prevention and biosecurity...|$|R
30|$|It is not {{possible}} to produce household waste compost with a specific fertilizer value (Ozores-Hampton et al. 1998) because household waste is heterogeneous and varies in composition with place and season (Kirchmann and Widen 1994). The composting substrate, methods and environmental conditions determine the quality of the composting product. Little research has been done on composting in the less-developed countries. In Zimbabwe, local work on composting has focused on effects of methods of treating or <b>storing</b> <b>cattle</b> manure with a major thrust on quality and nutrient release patterns (Murwira and Kirchmann 1993; Nzuma and Murwira 2000).|$|R
50|$|Pembroke cattle were {{described}} as being coal black. William Youatt said some had white faces and white about the udder, but this was ascribed to cross-breeding by Read. The horns which at first incline outwards and forwards, and then bend somewhat upwards and inwards, are light coloured with black tips. They were reported to be good milk producers, with many being sold to London town dairies. <b>Store</b> <b>cattle</b> of the breed were favoured for grazing in Sussex and Kent, especially on the Pevensey Levels, and many also went to the English Midlands.|$|E

50|$|The {{property}} {{was placed on}} the market by the trustees of the estate of D. F. MacKay in 1904. Stocked with about 15,000 Durham cattle and 187 horses the 934 sq mi station included managers house, men's quarters <b>store</b> house, <b>cattle</b> yards and two recently sunk bores.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to farming, lumbering and fishing {{were the primary}} pursuits {{in the area and}} the Wilson family in particular {{played a central role in}} the region since it was first settled. The wealth and stature of the family grew especially from the 1920s through the 1940s under the leadership of Willard Wilson who became the defacto mayor by way of developing the Wilson Homestead into the local lumber mill, post office, grocery <b>store,</b> <b>cattle</b> and dairy farm, and fly fishing lodge. Upon Willard's death in 1949 his son Murray focused the family business in particular on developing the homestead into a fly fishing lodge in response to the growing interest in Atlantic salmon from anglers based in particular in the northeast United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{established}} in 1877 along with several other well known properties in the Channel Country as pastoralists expanded westward from the grasslands at {{the headwaters of the}} Diamantina. Other properties established at the same time included Glenormiston Station, Headingly Station, Herbert Downs, Noranside and Roxburgh Downs.In 1878 the then owner, Mr F. Scarr, sold the property to a New South Wales investor, Mr Andrew Tobin, for £6000 cash. Tobi and company bought the property without any stock and without inspection, so well regarded was the country, thought to be particularly suited to sheep with its abundance of saline herbage and lime. Tobin thought otherwise and began to stock the area with cattle buying over 1,000 <b>store</b> <b>cattle</b> in an 1880 sale that were delivered shortly afterward. One of Tobin's partners in the station, John Leach Manning, died in 1883 leaving Tobin and the last partner, Daniel MacKinnon, with Marion Downs.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional droving {{could not}} have been done without horses. The horse plant was made up of work-horses, night-horses and packhorses, with each drover riding four or five horses during a trip. The horse tailer was the team member {{responsible}} for getting horses to water and feed, and bringing them to the camp in the morning. A good night-horse was highly prized for its night vision, temperament, and its ability to bring animals under control when a [...] "rush", known elsewhere as a stampede, occurred at night. [...] The standard team of men employed to move 1,200 cattle consisted of seven men: the boss drover, four stockmen, a cook and a horse-tailer. <b>Store</b> <b>cattle</b> were moved in larger mobs, of up to 1,500 head, while fat bullocks going to meatworks were taken in mobs of about 650 head, i.e. three train loads. The stockmen will ride in formation at the front, sides and back of the mob, at least until the mob has settled into a routine pace. Cattle are expected to cover about ten miles (16 km) a day, sheep about six miles (10 km), and are permitted to spread up to 800 metres (half a mile) {{on either side of the}} road. Occasionally mobs of horses were moved by drovers. A short camp is made for a lunch break, after which the cook and horse-tailer will move ahead to set up the night camp.|$|E

50|$|The {{price of}} butter on the Cork Market rose by 45% from 1851 and 1859 and <b>store</b> <b>cattle</b> by 50%. Guano a natural {{fertilizer}} from Peru was used together with mangolds turnips and improved grass varieties {{on the more}} progressive farms. Around this time the Royal Dublin Society was sending Inspectors around the area to teach best practice. Coral sand and seaweed were used to improve the soil. In Bantry Bay boats were engaged in coral sand, it would take three hours to load a boat and the cargo would fetch 8s. There were also twenty boats involved {{in the collection of}} seaweed, with a crew of two men and two boys earning 6-7s in the season. There was reorganisation of scattered land holdings. This tied in with the Bandon Estate taking over the Evanson holdings in Durrus. It is not clear if this was because of lease expiry or purchase. The Bandon Estate invested heavily, rebuilt the village in its present form in the 1850s and carried out land improvements. The records of the Dohertys, managers of the Estate would suggest a commercial and competent management, however the nature of the land and the poor condition of many of the tenants may have militated against the success of this. In 1860 a memorial was presented in Bantry to establish a branch of the National Bank, it was pointed out that {{there was a lack of}} coins and notes restricting commerce. Eventually in March 1865 the Munster and Leinster Bank established a branch in Bantry. There was a further period of distress in 1860. There were very large imports of Indian meal to Bantry in the 1860s as it had become a staple part of the diet.|$|E

25|$|After the Civil War much of Florida's {{industry}} {{moved to}} the south and east, a trend that continues today.

Data used in the analysis comes from interviews of a panel of feed lot operators regarding their intended 1974 throughput of cattle at different price combinations. Price combinations are identified at which no cattle would be placed in feed lots, at which feed lots would be used at maximum capacity, and at which price changes would induce changes in the number of cattle on feed.

40|$|Compensatory {{growth is}} an {{integral}} part ofNew Zealand beef production systems (Nicol and Kitessa, 1997) with restricted winter nutrition followed by good spring and summer feeding enabling a better fit with seasonal pasture production. Purchasers of <b>store</b> <b>cattle</b> (including feedlotters) often prefer animals with a previous history of perturbed growth because they believe they can benefit from higher liveweight gains. Twenty-eight Angus and twenty-eight Simrnental steers were purchased as weaners and allocated to two groups.

A computer model of the feeding and growth of a steer is constructed and used in conjunction with least-cost rations derived from a proxy schedule of feedstuff costs and qualities to identify feeding strategies which maximize the present nett discounted value of candidate steers.

5000|$|Within the Northern Bronze Age context, many {{important}} reasons are mentioned to {{the custom of}} <b>storing</b> <b>cattle</b> inside a building and, moreover, inside the proper house. This could point to a new emphasis on milk production and making cheese, especially since drinking milk {{was made possible by}} a gene against lactose intolerance, first to emerge amongst neolithic Northern European populations. Cattle stalling was necessary to avoid cows giving less milk in cold conditions (Sherratt, 1983; Zimermann, 1999, 314; Olausson 1999, 321). Social exchange and a role in the supernatural would have been important as well (Fokkens 1999), supported by, for instance, stacks of cowhides in graves and the offerings of animals attested in both Sweden and Denmark (Rasmussen 1999: 287). Protection against cattle raids would fit the circumstances—proven by grave goods, rock engravings and hoards—of a strong martial ideology in this era (Fokkens 1999).|$|R

40|$|Various {{antimicrobial}} agents were evaluated {{with the purpose}} of reducing the microbial fermentation in <b>stored</b> <b>cattle</b> waste and the resulting odor emissions. Duplicate sealed 2 -L flasks with 500 ml waste slurry, with and without antimicrobial inhibitors, were used to measure the production of short-chain volatile fatty acids, lactate, and total fermentation gas over 27 – 30 days. A combination of chlorhexidine diacetate (2 mM), iodoacetate (2 mM), and α-pinene (3. 8 mM) reduced gas production 80 % (1000 ml to 200 ml) and total volatile fatty acid production 50 % (145 mM to 72 mM). Pinene had little antimicrobial effect; rather, it served as an effective masking agent, giving the waste a less offensive odor. A combination of chlorhexidine diacetate and the deaminase inhibitor, diphenyliodonium chloride (1. 3 mM) had a similar effect in reducing short-chain volatile fatty acid production (145 mM to 80 mM). It is concluded that a combination of {{antimicrobial agents}} may be useful in controlling odor emissions and conserving organic matter in livestock wastes, therefore providing a potentially more useful byproduct waste when used as plant fertilizer...|$|R
