The nature of the cognitive processes involved in rapid naming is however still a topic of controversy.

A total 86 children with dyslexia and 31 normal readers were recruited. Our results revealed that in addition to phonological processing and processing <b>speed,</b> <b>interference</b> control predicts rapid naming in dyslexia, but in contrast to these other two cognitive processes, inhibition is not significantly associated with their reading and spelling skills.

The first one (D 1) {{is characterized by}} north-striking foliations that are gently dipping {{to the west and}} carry W- to WSW-plunging lineations, whereas the second one (D 2) is characterized by steeper foliations that are striking to the NNE and lineations that are either subhorizontal or gently plunging to the SSW. The younger pattern is related to late-Panafrican tectonics along the major Angavo shear zone that is about 1000 km in length and 40 km in width with apparently little offset. Deformation in the Angavo <b>zone</b> induced <b>interference</b> folding on both sides. The D 2 event is characterized by low pressures (ca 400 MPa) and high temperatures (up to 790 degrees C) responsible for prograde granulite facies conditions, that resulted from heat transfer due to magma and fluid advection in the Angavo shear zone. The D 2 event is pinned at 550 +/- 11 Ma by a new monazite age from a reoriented Andringitrean granite near Ankaramena. A new suite of amphibole and biotite Ar-Ar geochronological data enables to retrace the thermochronogical evolution inside and outside the Angavo shear zone. Combined with new structural results from the western <b>interference</b> <b>zone.</b> these ages yield {{a better understanding of the}} late-Panafrican history of central Madagascar. No diachronism is observed along the strike of the Angavo shear zone. Conversely, amphibole and especially biotite ages decrease from West to East, i. e. towards the shear zone.

A 1 -D conductive model constrains the thermal effect in relation with the Angavo shear zone to be restricted to a lateral distance of ca 60 km (in map view) for a maximum heating duration of 20 Myr.

Spintronics aims at using not only the electron's electric charge but also its quantum mechanical spin in order to develop novel device concepts beyond conventional charge-based electronics. Currently tremendous efforts are underway world-wide to achieve this goal and the theoretical research proposed here is part of it. In particular, the conditions are analyzed under which a device of nanometer size can deliver a beam of spin-oriented electrons using the spin-dependent reflection at a barrier. This work starts out from the fact that electrons can have two spin orientations, up and down. When the electrons in a tiny layer of a semiconductor like InSb hit a barrier, spin-up and spin-down electrons are reflected into different directions so that an appropriate set-up can select one or the other reflected beam. We study the conditions under which this set-up can be used to create a spin-polarized electron beam from a beam of initially unpolarized electrons. Inside the <b>interference</b> <b>zone</b> between the incoming and spin-flipped reflected beams parallel to the barrier, we get stripes of well-defined electron spin orientations...|$|R

Its consequence include a set of important processes which are active in arid and semi arid environment, where water is the main limiting factor of land use performance in such ecosystem. Desertification indicators or the groups of associated indicators should be focused on a single process. They {{should be based on}} available reliable information sources, including remotely sensed images, topographic data (maps or DEM'S), climate, soils and geological data. The current work aims to map the Environmental Sensitivity Areas (ESA's) to desertification in whole territory of Egypt at a scale of 1 : 1 000 000. ETM satellite images, geologic and soil maps were used as main sources for calculating the index of Environmental Sensitivity Areas (ESAI) for desertification. The algorism is adopted from MEDALLUS methodology as follows; ESAI = (SQI * CQI * VQI) 1 / 3 Where SQI is the soil quality index, CQI is the climate quality index and VQI is the vegetation quality index. The SQI is based on rating the parent material, slope, soil texture, and soil depth. The VQI is computed on bases of rating three categories (i. e. erosion protection, drought resistance and plant cover). The CQI is based on the aridity index, derived from values of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Arc-GIS 9 software was used for the computation and sensitivity maps production. The results show that the soil of the Nile Valley are characterized by a moderate SQI, however the those in the <b>interference</b> <b>zone</b> are low soil quality indexed. The dense vegetation of the valley has raised its VQI to be good, however coastal areas are average and <b>interference</b> <b>zones</b> are low. The maps of ESA's for desertification show that 86. 1 % of Egyptian territory is classified as very sensitive areas, while 4. 3 % as Moderately sensitive, and 9. 6 % as sensitive. It can be concluded that implementing the maps of sensitivity to desertification is rather useful in the arid and semi arid areas as they give more likely quantitative trend for frequency of sensitive areas. The integration of different factors contributing to desertification sensitivity may lead to plan a successful combating. The usage of space data and GIS proved to be suitable tools to rely estimation and to fulfill the needed large computational requirements. They are also useful in visualizing the sensitivity situation of different desertification parameters...|$|R

These studies were sponsored by organizations such as the U. S. Department of Energy, the Solar Energy Research Institute, and private developers of wind power stations. Research objectives were to identify the mechanisms by which wind turbines might adversely affect communication signals, estimate the severity of these effects for different types of signals (e. g. television, radio, microwave, and navigation), and formulate mathematical models with which to predict the sizes of potential <b>interference</b> <b>zones</b> around wind turbines and wind power plants. This work formed the basis for preliminary standards on assessing electromagnetic interference (EMI) by wind turbines. With the current renewal of interest in wind energy projects, it is appropriate that the many experimental and analytical aspects of this pioneering work be reviewed and correlated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to combine test data and theory from previously published and unpublished research reports into a unified and consistent set of equations which are useful for estimating potential levels of television interference from wind turbines. To be comprehensive, these equations will include both horizontal-axis and vertical-axis wind turbines (HAWT's and VAWT's), blade configuration parameters (e. g. number, size, material, twist, and coning), signal frequency and power, and directional characteristics of the receiving antenna. The approach that is followed in this report is as follows. First, some basic equations that describe electromagnetic signals with interference are presented without detailed derivations, since the latter are available in the references. Minor changes in terminology are made for purposes of consistency. Next, the concept of a signal scatter ratio is introduced, which defines the fraction of the signal impinging on a wind turbine that is scattered by its blades onto a nearby receiver. Equations from references are modified for the calculation of experimental scatter ratios (from measured signals containing interference) and idealized scatter ratios (from rotor characteristics and relative locations of the transmitter, the turbine, and the receiver). Experimental and idealized scatter ratios are then calculated and compared for 75 cases from the literature, in which TVI measurements were made around a variety of wind turbines. An empirical equation is then defined for estimating the probability that an actual scatter ratio will differ from an idealized ratio by a given amount. Finally a sample calculation of the size of a potential TV <b>interference</b> <b>zone</b> around a hypothetical wind power station is presented...|$|R

Normally, acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) that leak upward (and thus increase in amplitude) would find a negligible level of plasma density at the topside ionosphere. However, the tip of the equatorial fountain at the geomagnetic equator constitutes a significant amount of plasma at a topside-equivalent altitude. The combination of increased AGW amplitudes and a higher plasma density at such altitude would therefore result in higher-amplitude LSTIDs in this particular region, as demonstrated in our observations and analysis...|$|R

(Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 41, 940 – 957, 2015) found that crowding a target by adding adjacent flankers, in addition to OSM, had a more deleterious effect on performance than expected based on the combined individual effects of crowding and masking alone. The current experiments test why OSM and crowding interact in this way. In three experiments, target-flanker distance is manipulated whilst also varying mask duration in a digit identification task. The OSM effect—as indexed by the performance difference between unmasked and masked conditions—had a quadratic function with respect to target-flanker distance. Results suggest it is OSM affecting crowding rather than the converse: Masking seems to amplify crowding at intermediate target-distractor distances {{at the edge of}} the crowding <b>interference</b> <b>zone.</b> These results indicate that OSM and crowding share common mechanisms.

40|$|Routing in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) is a {{challenging}} task {{due to the}} dynamic nature of the network topology and resource constraints. Due to communication over wireless channel, participating nodes also experience interference and bandwidth constraints. Therefore {{it is essential to}} develop a robust and efficient routing protocol for MANETs. This research paper involves design and development of a multipath routing protocol for MANETs, called Load Sharing Multipath Routing (LS-MPR) uses dual polarized directional antenna to enhance network efficiency and provide load balancing. LS-MPR is an on-demand multipath routing protocol, which selects best possible multiple paths based on ascending order of hop count and availability of common polarization between neighboring mobile nodes. The performance of the LS-MPR is compared with that Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). The network performance is checked with and without node mobility, throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), least jitter, low interference and low end-to-end delay. Directional antenna is a very efficient and low cost smart antenna technology. It can achieve better performance, higher throughput, and better resource utilization with omnidirectional antennas multi-path routing cannot be exploited very well since packets routed on one of the paths cause an <b>interference</b> <b>zone</b> that typically encompasses the other paths an...|$|R
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with the above-wing engine installation, an unswept wing outfitted with a continuous trailing edge flap was also adopted; this possessed no unfavourable interaction with the engine flow. The continuous flap gave excellent low speed performance, however, during high <b>speed</b> travel, <b>interference</b> between the wing and pylon flow fields resulted in flow separation, which in turn limited the cruise Mn to 0.65. A recent aircraft, the HondaJet, which also featured an over-wing engine installation, used a supercritical wing which generated no unfavourable interference effects.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that late-life depression is associated with both systemic low-graded inflammation and cognitive impairment, the relation between inflammation and cognition in depressed older persons is still equivocal. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine the association between plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) concentrations and cognitive functioning in late-life depression, including the potentially moderating role of sex. METHODS: A total of 369 depressed older persons (>/= 60 years) from The Netherlands study of Depression in Older persons (NESDO) were included. Four cognitive domains, i. e. verbal memory, processing <b>speed,</b> <b>interference</b> control and attention were assessed with three cognitive tests (Stroop test, Wais Digit span test, and Rey's verbal learning test). Multiple linear regression analyses were applied with the four cognitive domains as dependent variables adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: The association between NGAL levels and specific cognitive domains were sex-specific. In women, higher NGAL levels were associated with impaired verbal memory and lower processing speed. In men, higher NGAL levels were associated with worse interference control. Higher NGAL levels were not associated with attention. No sex-specific associations of either high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) or interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) with cognitive functioning were found. CONCLUSION: This study shows sex-specific association of NGAL with cognitive functioning in late-life depression...|$|R
40|$|Conditioned {{responses}} to cues associated with drug taking play {{a pivotal role}} in a number of theories of drug addiction. This study examined whether attentional biases towards drug-related cues exist in recreational drug users who predominantly used ecstasy (3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Experiment 1 compared 30 ecstasy users, 25 cannabis users, and 30 controls in an attentional distraction task in which neutral, evocative, and ecstasy-related pictures were presented within a coloured border, requiring participants to respond as quickly as possible to the border colour. Experiment 2 employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the attentional distraction task and tested 20 ecstasy users and 20 controls. Experiment 1 revealed significant response <b>speed</b> <b>interference</b> by the ecstasy-related pictures in the ecstasy users only. Experiment 2 revealed increased prefrontal and occipital activity in ecstasy users in all conditions. Activations in response to the ecstasy stimuli in these regions showed an apparent antagonism whereby ecstasy users, relative to controls, showed increased occipital but decreased right prefrontal activation. These results are interpreted to reflect increased visual processing of, and decreased prefrontal control over, the irrelevant but salient ecstasy-related stimuli. These results suggest that right inferior frontal cortex may {{play an important role in}} controlling drug-related attentional biases and may thus play an important role in mediating control over drug usage...|$|R
40|$|N. A. C. A. Model 36, a {{hull form}} with {{parallel}} middle body {{for half the}} length of the forebody and designed particularly for use with stub wings, was tested according to the general fixed-trim method over the range of practical loads, trims, and speeds. It was also tested free to trim with the center of gravity at two different positions. The results are given in the form of nondimensional coefficients. The resistance at the hump was exceptionally low but, at high planing <b>speeds,</b> afterbody <b>interference</b> made the performance only mediocre...|$|R
