25|$|The furnace {{was placed}} in the space between the tube banks. Early boilers were {{manually}} coal fired, later oil fired. The boiler was enclosed in a sealed casing of steel, lined with firebricks. Brick-lined end walls to this casing housed the firedoors or oil burner quarls, but had no heating surface. The uptake flue from the boiler was in the centre top of the casing, the exhaust gases passing around the <b>steam</b> <b>drum.</b> To reduce corrosion from flue gases over the drum, it was sometimes wrapped in a simple deflector shroud. Usually {{the lower part of the}} water drums were exposed outside the casing, but only the ends of the <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> emerged. The water level was at around one-third of the <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> diameter, enough to cover the ends of the submerged water-tubes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> (as well as {{the super}} heater coils and headers) have air vents and drains needed for initial start up.|$|E
25|$|The water {{enters the}} boiler through a {{section in the}} {{convection}} pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers {{at the bottom of}} the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the <b>steam</b> <b>drum.</b> This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the <b>steam</b> <b>drum,</b> the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{aimed at}} studying fish flour processing,+particularly {{to determine the}} best method to produce fish flour that meets the requirements for a food product. Four methods were tried, (1) without steaming, spray drying; (2) without <b>steaming,</b> <b>drum</b> drying; (3) <b>steaming,</b> spray drying and (4) <b>steaming,</b> <b>drum</b> drying. The results indicated that the best quality was obtained by the third method which consisted o...|$|R
50|$|The tubes {{themselves}} are seamless-drawn steel and mostly straight, with gently curved ends. The {{setting of the}} boiler is a large brick-built enclosure, but the <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> are suspended from a separate girder framework inside this, so as to allow for expansion with heat. The tubes, and the water drums in turn, are hung from the <b>steam</b> <b>drums,</b> again to allow free expansion without straining the tube ends. Owing to their curved ends the water-tubes may enter the drums radially, allowing easy sealing, but this was also a feature considered, according to the fashion of the time, to be important on account of expansion.|$|R
50|$|Where a {{superheater}} is fitted, it {{is installed}} as straight or hairpin tubes {{in the upper}} part of the boiler between the first two <b>steam</b> <b>drums.</b> The baffles direct the gas-flow through this area first, so it may reach the highest temperature.|$|R
25|$|The <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> is circular, with {{perpendicular}} tube entry. The tube ends span {{a considerable}} circumference of the drum, {{so that the}} upper tubes enter above the water level. They are thus 'non-drowned' tubes.|$|E
25|$|Yarrow's {{production}} boiler had {{a simple}} and distinctive design that remained broadly unchanged afterwards. Three drums were arranged in a triangular formation: a single large <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> {{at the top and}} two smaller water drums below. They were linked by straight watertubes in a multi-row bank to each water drum.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 1863, Keystone State {{opened fire}} on a ship off Charleston. It {{returned}} fire, scoring hits on Keystone State, one of which struck her <b>steam</b> <b>drum,</b> rupturing it and scalding 20 men to death and injuring 20 others. After repairs, Keystone State took up a blockading station off St. Simons Sound, Georgia.|$|E
50|$|Flow in {{the first}} bank is upwards as the tubes are heated, {{encouraged}} by their almost vertical position. Cooler water in the later water-tubes descends. Circulation is completed by the link pipes between the <b>steam</b> <b>drums.</b> Circulation is more active in the earlier, hotter circuits.|$|R
50|$|All circulation, both up and down, {{is through}} the heating tubes {{and there are no}} {{separate}} external downcomers. The <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> and, (in a 5-drum boiler) the water drums, are however linked by short horizontal pipes and these form part of the circulation circuit.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{gas flow}} passes through each tube bank in turn, the later banks {{are at a}} {{significantly}} lower temperature. This encourages an [...] "extremely efficient" [...] circulation by the thermosyphon effect. Water level is maintained with the <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> approximately half-full, so the tubes operate in the [...] "drowned" [...] state with their upper ends permanently submerged.|$|R
25|$|The {{assumption}} was that flow through the water-tubes would be upwards, owing to their heating by the furnace, and that the counterbalancing downward flow would require external unheated downcomers. In most water-tube designs these were a few large-diameter external pipes from the <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> to the water drum. These large-diameter pipes were thus a problem for reliability owing to their rigidity and the forces upon them.|$|E
25|$|A {{fossil fuel}} steam {{generator}} includes an economizer, a <b>steam</b> <b>drum,</b> and the furnace with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and flue gas path equipment include: forced draft (FD) fan, air preheater (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors (electrostatic precipitator or baghouse) and the flue gas stack.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the boiler rested on the water drums, and thus on {{supports}} from the firing flat's deck. The <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> was only supported by the watertubes and was allowed to move freely, with thermal expansion. If superheated, the superheater elements were hung from this drum. Compared to the earlier Scotch and locomotive boilers, water-tube boilers with their reduced water volumes were considered lightweight and didn't require extensive supports.|$|E
50|$|Stirling boilers {{are one of}} {{the larger}} {{arrangements}} for a water-tube boiler: acceptable for stationary use, but impractical for mobile use, except for large ships with modest power requirements. They consist of a large brick-built chamber with a sinuous gas path through it, passing over near-vertical water-tubes that zig-zag between multiple <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> and water drums.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{placement}} of the engines proved to be unsatisfactory. In order {{to protect them from}} enemy shot, they had been crowded into shallow holds, causing the engines to work both water and steam. To remedy the problem, the <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> had to be moved {{to the top of the}} boilers. This meant that they were no longer fully protected.|$|R
25|$|The heated water-tubes were a {{large number}} of small {{diameter}} tubes mounted between large drums: the water <b>drums</b> below and <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> above. Fairbairn's studies had already showed the importance of tube diameter and how small diameter tubes could easily withstand far higher pressures than large diameters. The drums could withstand the pressure by virtue of their robust construction. Manholes fitted to them allowed regular internal inspection.|$|R
25|$|The Yarrow boiler {{design is}} {{characteristic}} of the three-drum boiler: two banks of straight water-tubes are arranged in a triangular row with a single furnace between them. A single <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> is mounted at the top between them, with smaller water drums {{at the base of}} each bank. Circulation, both upwards and downwards, occurs within this same tube bank. The Yarrow's distinctive features were the use of straight tubes and also circulation in both directions taking place entirely within the tube bank, rather than using external downcomers.|$|E
25|$|While {{with the}} Western Gunboat Flotilla, Mound City {{took part in}} combat at Island No. 10, at Fort Pillow, and in an {{expedition}} on the White River in Arkansas. At Fort Pillow, she was rammed by Confederate vessels of the River Defense Fleet and averted sinking only by retreating into shoals. On the White River during the Battle of Saint Charles, a chance Confederate shot penetrated the <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> of her engines, resulting in 105 of its sailors being killed. An additional forty-five crew members were reported wounded, primarily by scalding. The ship suffered only minor damage.|$|E
25|$|The first distilling {{plants that}} boiled a {{separate}} water supply {{from that of}} the main boiler, appeared around 1867. These were not directly heated by a flame, but had a primary steam circuit using main boiler steam through coils within a <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> or evaporator. The distillate from this vessel then passed to an adjacent vessel, the distilling condenser. As these evaporators used a 'clean' seawater supply directly, rather than contaminated water from the boiler circuit, they could be used to supply both feedwater and drinking water. These double distillers appeared around 1884. For security against failure, ships except the smallest were fitted with two sets.|$|E
50|$|The water {{resulting}} from this condensation of steam was suctioned by the extraction pumps and sent {{once again to}} the boilersâ€™ <b>steam</b> <b>drums,</b> passing first through the water heaters, feed tanks and pumps, and finally to the economiser. Recovery of the condensed steam for reuse as water to feed the boiler closes the water/steam cycle in a thermoelectric station, and as such, the Tejo Power Station was no exception.|$|R
50|$|High-pressure {{locomotives}} {{were much}} more complicated than conventional designs. It was {{not simply a matter of}} building a normal fire-tube boiler with suitably increased strength and stoking harder. Structural strength requirements in the boiler shell make this impractical; it becomes impossibly thick and heavy. For high steam pressures the water-tube boiler is universally used. The <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> and their interconnecting tubes are of relatively small diameter with thick walls and therefore much stronger.|$|R
5000|$|Various 19th-century {{investigations}} of boiler explosions, especially those by insurance companies, found causes {{to be most}} commonly the result of operating boilers above the safe pressure range, either to get more power or due to defective boiler pressure relief valves and difficulties of obtaining reliable indication of pressure and water level. Poor fabrication was also a common problem. [...] Also, {{the thickness of the}} iron in <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> was low by modern standards.|$|R
25|$|The Mumford boiler was {{a variety}} {{built by the}} {{boilermakers}} Mumford of Colchester, intended for use in smaller boats. The tube banks separated into two groups, with the short tubes slightly curved away from each other. Entry into the lower water drum was perpendicular, requiring an almost rectangular drum with the tubes entering on separate faces. The mechanical weakness of such a shape was acceptable in this small size, but limited the boiler's potential. The casing was small and only enclosed part of the upper <b>steam</b> <b>drum,</b> leading directly to a funnel. A single inverted tee-shaped downcomer linked the drums {{at the rear of}} the boiler.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Normand gave a {{particularly}} large heating area (tube surface area) {{in relation to the}} grate area. The cost of this was a dense nest of tubes, where each of the numerous rows of tubes was bent into a different and complex shape. Tube ends entered the cylindrical drums perpendicularly, for good sealing. The space needed for all these tubes filled the entire lower half of the <b>steam</b> <b>drum,</b> requiring both a large drum and a separate steam dome from which to collect dry steam. The external boiler casing entered the flue uptake at one end, usually enclosing this dome. The ends of the drums extended outside the casing as hemispherical domes. Cold downcomers outside the casing linked these drums, providing a path for the return circulation of cold water.|$|E
25|$|The first boilers {{suffered}} {{problems with}} the superheaters and with poor circulation for the tube rows in {{the centre of the}} bank, leading to overheating and tube failure. The circulation problems were addressed by re-arranging the feedwater pipes and by placing baffles inside the <b>steam</b> <b>drum,</b> so as to give a more clearly defined circulation. A circulation augmenter, a steel trough, was placed over the tops of the furnace-side tubes, encouraging a single central upwelling flow to above the water level, encouraging steam bubbles to escape and acting as a steam separator before the water re-circulated down the outer-side tubes. In a manner similar to work taking place around the same time on the LMS railway and the development of top feed for steam locomotives, the feedwater was also routed upwards through 'spray pots' and thus passed through the steam space as droplets. The cold feedwater was thus heated to the same temperature as the boiler water before mixing with it, avoiding disturbance to the circulation path.|$|E
5000|$|They are {{amongst the}} older, [...] "large-tube" [...] designs of {{water-tube}} boilers, having water-tubes that are around 3Â¼ inches (83 mm) in diameter. The tubes {{are arranged in}} near-vertical banks between a number of cylindrical, horizontal <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> (above) and water drums (below). The number of drums varies, and the Stirling designs are categorized into 3-, 4- and 5-drum boilers. The number of tube banks is one less than this, i.e. 2, 3 or 4 banks.|$|R
2500|$|Mound City had two engines, one driving {{each side}} of the paddlewheel, mounted 90 degrees apart. Each engine had a single {{cylinder}} of bore 22inches (0.56 m) and stroke 6 feet (1.83 m). These were able to drive her at a maximum speed of 8 knots (15km/h). The engines for the class were built by [...] Hartupee and Company of Pittsburgh, Eagle Foundry of St. Louis, or Fulton Foundry, also of St. Louis. The <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> were at first mounted so low that the engines worked with water rather than <b>steam,</b> so the <b>drums</b> had to be moved {{to the top of the}} boilers. In their new position, they were not protected by the extra armor that was given to the engines.|$|R
5000|$|Fletcher {{eventually}} {{prevailed in}} getting a survey made of Margaret to assess her condition. The survey, conducted in the Azores, found that her deck leaked, her condenser was irreparable, her <b>steam</b> <b>drums</b> were badly worn down and could generate {{less than half the}} steam pressure they were supposed to, her crew quarters were uninhabitable, and living conditions were very bad. The Commander, Azores Detachment, A. W. Osteshans, judged Margaret as unsuited for further service as a patrol vessel and as [...] "nothing more than a piece of junk." ...|$|R
25|$|With intent only to {{slow down}} the {{progress}} of the Union vessels and not to make a determined stand, the Confederates had set up a pair of batteries on the bluffs near St. Charles, Arkansas, some 80 miles (130km) above the river mouth. The guns were taken from a gunboat which they had then scuttled {{in the middle of the}} stream as a further impediment. On 17 June, the Federal flotilla arrived at that point; the soldiers went ashore to attack the batteries from the land side, while the two armored gunboats came up the river, Mound City leading. Shots were exchanged between the gunboats and the shore batteries, with nothing exceptional until a chance shot from the upper battery happened to penetrate the casemate of the lead gunboat. The shot killed some men in its passage, but most of the damage it caused occurred when it hit the vessel's <b>steam</b> <b>drum.</b> Hot steam immediately filled the entire boat, killing and scalding most of the crew. Those who could do so jumped overboard into the river, where Rebel sharpshooters shot them as they tried to swim to safety. By the time the carnage was over, 105 men were dead by the first shot, scalding, drowning, or being shot in the water. An additional 25 were injured by the steam. Among the wounded was Commander Kilty, who survived and later returned to service in the Navy, although he lost his left arm. Only 25 men of the entire crew escaped without major injury. Meanwhile, the soldiers had moved into position to assault the batteries, so the Confederates fled, leaving their wounded and their guns behind.|$|E
500|$|Moltke and Goeben were {{powered by}} four-shaft Parsons {{turbines}} in two sets and 24 coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers, {{divided into four}} boiler rooms. The boilers were composed of one <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> and three water drums apiece, and produced steam at [...] After 1916, the boilers were supplemented with tar-oil. The Parsons turbines were divided into high- and low-pressure pairs. The low-pressure turbines were the inner pair, and {{were placed in the}} aft engine room. The high-pressure turbines were {{on either side of the}} low-pressure pair, and were located in the forward wing rooms. The turbines powered four propellers, 3.74m (12.3ft) in diameter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{characteristic of the}} [...] "three-drum" [...] design is the arrangement of a <b>steam</b> <b>drum</b> above two water drums, in a triangular layout. Water tubes fill in {{the two sides of}} this triangle between the drums, and the furnace is in the centre. The whole assembly is then enclosed in a casing, leading to the exhaust flue.|$|E
50|$|After this treatment, {{the water}} had to be {{pre-heated}} {{before moving on to}} the boilers in order to increase the combustionâ€™s thermal output. For this, the steam recovered from the turbines was used inside the heating tanks, thereby provoking a thermal exchange and obtaining a temperature of 130Â°C. At this temperature, the only thing that remained was to get the water to a certain pressure before directing it to the boilers. The set of pumps in the Water Room guaranteed it would travel, since it placed the water at a pressure of 52kg/cm2, enough to overcome the opposing pressure in the boilersâ€™ <b>steam</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R
