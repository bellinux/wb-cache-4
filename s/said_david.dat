500|$|Off-screen Wolfenden, Hardwick and Chittel {{were thrilled}} by Amy's inclusion. Wolfenden said Halfpenny's acting skill has [...] "freshened {{the whole place}} up." [...] In comparison, David was {{initially}} hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family. However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens and results in Amy developing feelings for him. Wolfenden <b>said</b> <b>David</b> [...] "has {{a soft spot for}} Amy" [...] and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his [...] "little sister." [...] When David's girlfriend, Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson) as the thief. Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc. Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because [...] "she never had that sort of affection when she was growing up." [...] Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home.|$|E
500|$|When {{the special}} was first broadcast, it was watched by 1.7 million viewers, 11% {{of the total}} audience. However, these ratings are poor {{compared}} to other programmes. For example, an episode of Desperate Housewives shown the previous night attracted 2.8 million viewers. Responses from critics were mixed. Matt Baylis said, [...] "Like a homegrown ER on laughing gas, this show will be sorely missed," [...] and Ian Johns said, [...] "It was like a Richard Curtis romcom, albeit one force-fed magic mushrooms." [...] Sam Wollaston in The Guardian wrote {{that it was one}} of the funniest shows on British television, alongside the satirical sitcom The Thick of It, saying, [...] "The Thick of It is clever-funny, Green Wing is mad-funny." [...] Wollaston said that while the dramatic element of the show, such as Mac's death, were good, it was Alan and Joanna's storyline that was most entertaining. [...] "Mark Heap and Pippa Haywood, who play them, have been the shining lights in an already glittering show. They, and it, will be sorely missed," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>David</b> Butcher in the Radio Times said that, [...] "Green Wing's sublime comic acting and a vein of shrieking madness in the writing make it very hard to beat." ...|$|E
500|$|There were {{charges of}} favoritism in {{purchasing}} programs. Aubrey's friend Keefe Brasselle, who had bit parts in several {{movies in the}} 1940s and 1950s and met Aubrey when they both worked at KNXT, had no experience as a producer. [...] "A 1965 edition of George Raft," [...] <b>said</b> <b>David</b> Susskind, particularly apt as there were also rumors Brasselle had ties to the Mafia. Nevertheless, Aubrey scheduled three shows from Brasselle's Richelieu Productions for the 1964–65 season, all without pilots, still an almost unheard-of practice. (The shows were The Baileys of Balboa, a sitcom with Paul Ford; the newspaper drama The Reporter; and The Cara Williams Show, a sitcom starring red-head Williams, billed as the next Lucille Ball.) Brasselle would personally supervise The Reporter, shot in New York City. Costs skyrocketed on Brasselle's shows– after nine episodes, The Reporter was $450,000 over budget– and all three bombed– The Reporter running only three months, Baileys until April 1965; and Cara Williams finishing the season. Aubrey was later asked why he aired three untested programs. [...] "Arrogance, I guess" [...] he responded. In his book The Other Glass Teat, media critic Harlan Ellison alleges that a Mafia don had put out a contract on Aubrey for beating his daughter during consensual sex at a Las Vegas, Nevada hotel, and that Brasselle demanded the shows {{in exchange for his}} using his own Mafia connections to smooth things over.|$|E
