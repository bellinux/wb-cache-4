5|$|Canada has {{had many}} {{political}} debates between the French speakers and English speakers, {{particularly in the}} province of Quebec. Canada holds both French and English as official languages. The politics in Quebec are largely defined by nationalism as French Québécois wish to gain independence from Canada as a whole, based on ethnic and linguistic boundaries. The main separatist party, Parti Québécois, attempted to gain sovereignty twice (once in 1980 and again in 1995) and failed by a narrow margin of 1.2% in 1995. Since then, in order to remain united, Canada granted Quebec <b>statut</b> particulier, recognizing Quebec as a nation within the united nation of Canada. Canada is often described as a cultural mosaic.|$|E

Germany had built eight dreadnoughts and one battlecruiser and the United States had six built and four more building. Late that year, the French Navy laid down {{the first of the}} four [...] ships. To remedy the inferiority of the French fleet, the government passed the <b>Statut</b> Naval on 30 March 1912, authorizing a force of twenty-eight battleships, to be in service by 1920. The first three ships were to be laid down in 1912.|$|E
500|$|Several of Creangă's {{characteristic}} novellas are {{infused with}} themes from Christian mythology, fictionalizing God, Saint Peter {{and the army}} of devils, most often with the comedic intent of showing such personages behaving like regular people. A defining story in this series is [...] "Dănilă Prepeleac", whose eponymous peasant hero is characterized by what Șerban Anghelescu calls [...] "idiocy serving to initiate", or, according to Gabriela Ursachi, [...] "complete, and therefore sublime, stupidity." [...] The {{first part of the}} story shows Dănilă exchanging his oxen for an empty bag—a set of dialogues which, George Călinescu argued, is almost exactly like a comedy play. In what was described as a complete reversal in characterization, the hero uses intelligence and ruse to trick and frighten several devils. Contrarily, [...] "Stan Pățitul" [...] shows its hero fraternizing with a lesser demon. Following the opening episode, in which the latter accidentally eats a bit of mămăligă dedicated by Stan to those who honor God, Satan himself condemns his subordinate to service the peasant. Călinescu highlights the naturalness of exchanges between the two protagonists, the latter of whom assumes the endearing form of a frail boy, Chirică, who ends up moving in with Stan and entering his service. The writing was also noted for other realistic elements alluding to everyday life, such as the overtly colloquial exchange between Chirică and Satan, or the episodes in which the young devil helps Stan woo a peasant woman. Although relatively young, Stan himself is referred to as <b>stătut</b> ("frowzy" [...] or [...] "lacking in freshness"), and the wording reflects rural attitudes about men who fail to marry during a certain age interval. Toward the end, the story focuses on a corrupt old woman who tries to trick Stan's new wife into committing adultery, but fails and is banished to the remotest area of Hell. Viewed by Călinescu as Creangă's [...] "most original manner of dealing with the fabulous", and paralleled by him with Caragiale's Kir Ianulea on account of its realist approach to the supernatural, [...] "Stan Pățitul" [...] is, according to Vianu, untraceable in its inspiration: [...] " [...] folk origin could not be identified, but it is not dismissible".|$|E

2500|$|In March 1941, the Calvinist Pastor Marc Boegner {{condemned}} the Vichy <b>statut</b> des Juifs {{in a public}} letter, marking {{one of the first}} times that French anti-Semitism was condemned in public during the occupation. On 5 May 1941, the first SOE agent (Georges Bégué) landed in France in order to make contact with the resistance groups (Andrée Borrel was the first female SOE agent). The SOE preferred to recruit French citizens living in Britain (like Bégué and Borrel) or who had fled to the United Kingdom as they were able to blend in more effectively, and those British citizens sent in as SOE agents were people who lived in France {{for a long period of}} time, and could speak French without an English accent. Bégué suggested that the BBC's Radio Londres send personal messages to the Resistance. At 9:15 pm every night, the BBC's French language service would broadcast the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony (which sounded like the Morse code for V as in victory), which was followed by [...] cryptic messages, which were codes for the [...] "personal messages" [...] to the resistance. The SOE provided weapons, bombs, false papers, money and radios to the resistance and the SOE agents were trained in guerrilla warfare, espionage and sabotage. By end of May 1941, the SOE had a total of two radio stations operating in France. A major reason for young Frenchmen to become résistants was resentment of Collaboration horizontale ("horizontal collaboration") as the sexual relationships between German men and Frenchwomen were euphemistically described. Because the franc had devalued by 20% against the Reichmark and the German policies of requisitioning food ensured the occupation were years of great hardship for the French, which meant from the viewpoint of a Frenchwoman taking a German lover was a rational economic choice. [...] "Horizontal collaboration" [...] was very widespread with 85,000 Frenchwomen having bore children fathered by their German lovers by October 1943. [...] Many young Frenchmen deeply disliked the fact that Frenchwomen seemed to find German men more attractive than them and wanted to strike back at the hated boches who took all of the local girls for themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1940 anti-Semitic laws started to come into force in both the {{occupied}} and unoccupied zones. On 3 October 1940 Vichy introduced the <b>statut</b> des Juifs, requiring all Jews in France to register with the authorities and banned Jews from professions such as the law, the universities, medicine and the public service. Jewish businesses were [...] "Aryanized" [...] by being placed in the hands of [...] "Aryan" [...] trustees who engaged in the most blatant corruption while Jews were banned from cinemas, music halls, fairs, museums, libraries, public parks, cafes, theatres, concerts, restaurants, swimming pools and markets. Jews could not move unless informing the police first, own radios or bicycles, were denied phone service, could only use phone booths marked Accès interdit aux Juifs and were only allowed to ride the last carriage on the Paris Metro. The French people at the time distinguished between the Israélites (a polite term in French) who were [...] "properly" [...] assimilated French Jews and the Juifs (a derogatory term in French) who were the [...] "foreign" [...] and [...] "unassimilated" [...] Jews who were widely seen as criminals from abroad living in slums in the inner cities of France. All through the 1930s, the number of illegal Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe was vastly exaggerated, and popular opinion believed that the majority of Jews living in France were illegal immigrants who were causing all sorts of social problems. In a context where the number of Jews in France, and even more so the number of illegal Jewish immigrants were much exaggerated, Ousby noted about the introduction of the first anti-Semitic laws in 1940: [...] "There was no sigh of public opposition to what was happening, or even widespread unease at the direction in which events were heading [...] [...] [...] Many people, perhaps even most people, were indifferent. In the autumn of 1940 they had other things to think about; later they could find little room for fellow-feeling or concern for the public good in their own struggle to survive. What happened to the Jews were a secondary matter; it was beyond their immediate affairs, it belonged to that realm of the 'political' which they could not longer control or even bring themselves to follow with much interest".|$|E

40|$|Georges Dulac : Diderot {{as editor}} of the "plans et <b>statuts</b> des établissements de Catherine II" Since the Plans et <b>Statuts</b> were first {{published}} in 1775, scholars have attempted to judge {{how much of it is}} Diderot's; now a manuscript gives a convincing answer, for, written at the time of the philosopher's stay in St. Petersburgh, it gives a state of the text which precedes his alterations. At St. Petersburgh, Diderot revised the passages of his "feuillet sur l'école des cadets", which had been added on Clerc's, the translator's, authority; but the main corrections were done at The Hague, before printing. It was here that he transformed some of his declarations to Catherine. This discovery can perhaps throw light on the respective aims and tactics of the philosopher and the Empress. Finally, Diderot considerably improved the original text's quality by adding a dozen hitherto unidentified additions, the most important of which is six pages long. Dulac Georges.
