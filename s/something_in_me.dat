25|$|In her {{introduction}} to Bone Dance, she tells us, “I {{have often been}} identified as a ‘protest poet,’ and although <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> frowns at being so neatly categorized, that is largely the truth.” A huge element of her poetry is political, which is also unsurprising knowing her involvement in AIM and other Native American movements. As she puts it, “because the political is personal” it becomes a part of the poetry, whether intentionally so or not.|$|E

Gillard herself told the program that while she admired women who could balance child rearing with a career, [...] "I'm not sure I could have. There's <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> that's focused and single-minded and if I {{was going to do}} that, I'm not sure I could have done this." ...|$|E
500|$|Murray {{struggled}} with her sexual and gender identity {{through much of}} her life. Her marriage as a teenager ended almost immediately {{with the realization that}} [...] "when men try to make love to me, <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> fights". Although acknowledging the term [...] "homosexual" [...] in describing others, Murray preferred to describe herself as having an [...] "inverted sex instinct" [...] that caused her to behave as a man attracted to women would. She wanted a [...] "monogamous married life", but one in which she was the man. The majority of her relationships were with women whom she described as [...] "extremely feminine and heterosexual". In her younger years, Murray often was devastated by the end of these relationships, to the extent that she was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment twice, in 1937 and in 1940.|$|E

500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to the next page. I bet they put him in someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't put <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E
500|$|For the 1989 season, Thome was {{assigned}} to the Gulf Coast League Indians, a minor league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. He finished the year with a [...]237 batting average, no home runs, and 22 runs batted in (RBIs). After his rookie season, he met [...] "hitting guru" [...] Charlie Manuel, who later became his manager and mentor. Unlike most Indians staff, Manuel saw potential in Thome and worked hard with him, particularly on his hip motion while swinging the bat. Thome later said, [...] " [...] saw <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> I didn't." [...] During this work, Manuel suggested to Thome that he point his bat out to center field before the pitch to relax himself like Roy Hobbs did when batting in the baseball film The Natural. The work paid off; in 1990, Thome hit [...]340 and totaled 16 home runs and 50 RBIs playing at both the Rookie and Class A levels of the minor leagues. Thome spent most of the 1991 season splitting time between Double-A and Triple-A where, in combination, he hit [...]319 with 7 home runs and 73 RBIs.|$|E
2500|$|Oppewall {{obtained}} her master's {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1969 {{and moved to}} Los Angeles, California. At age 22, she was given a job answering phones at the Venice studio of Charles Eames. According to some sources, Paul Schrader arranged an interview between Oppewall and Eames when he was writing a magazine article about the Eameses. Oppewall, however, has claimed she got the job while visiting the Charles Eames office as a guest and, upon leaving, casually asked a secretary whether there were any jobs available. Upon taking the job, Charles Eames told Oppewall, [...] "I can {{teach you how to}} draw, I cannot teach you how to think or see. If you can think and you can see, you can stay." [...] Oppewall worked with him for eight years, during which time Eames, in Oppewall's words, [...] "saw <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> I didn't know was there." [...] By the end of her time with Eames, she was helping design and organize Eames museum exhibits. Eames made more than 100 small personal and educational films in that time and, {{as a result of her}} exposure to them, Oppewall said she got into the film business [...] "by accident." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second level}} of {{existence}} is the ethical. This is where an individual {{begins to take}} on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for good and evil and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls repentance. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with Dharma - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as [...] "dharma", though dharma is also a law). [...] "He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely." .... “I repent myself out of the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me {{and at the same time}} expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product." .... "It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam." ... "The Either/Or I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose eo ipso the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice." [...] Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219 ...|$|E

2500|$|In his allocution at {{sentencing}} {{he noted}} {{he had had}} misgivings on the way and had come home shortly afterward.

5000|$|It was, of course, a lie {{what you}} read about my {{religious}} convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated.

6000|$|... "Put {{a little}} pathos in it," [...] he added, [...] "give me {{a scene where}} I can show them I've <b>something</b> else <b>in</b> <b>me</b> besides merely humour.
