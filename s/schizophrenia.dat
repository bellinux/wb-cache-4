5|$|Latent <b>schizophrenia</b> (F21.1), {{schizophrenic}} reaction (F21.2), pseudoneurotic <b>schizophrenia</b> (F21.3), pseudopsychopathic <b>schizophrenia</b> (F21.4), “symptom-depleted” <b>schizophrenia</b> (F21.5) {{are in the}} Russian {{version of}} the ICD-10. They are {{in the category of}} “schizotypal” disorder in section F21 of chapter V.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of genetic {{and environmental factors}} {{play a role in}} the development of <b>schizophrenia.</b> People with a family history of <b>schizophrenia</b> who have a transient psychosis have a 20–40% chance of being diagnosed one year later.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} of <b>schizophrenia</b> {{is around}} 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to <b>schizophrenia</b> is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing <b>schizophrenia</b> is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with <b>schizophrenia</b> are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} <b>schizophrenia,</b> {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. <b>Schizophrenia</b> {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role <b>schizophrenia</b> has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have <b>schizophrenia</b> while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with <b>schizophrenia</b> had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in <b>schizophrenia,</b> each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for <b>schizophrenia.</b> Around 5% of cases of <b>schizophrenia</b> are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause <b>schizophrenia</b> and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
5|$|People with <b>schizophrenia</b> {{may have}} {{a high rate of}} {{irritable}} bowel syndrome but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked. Psychogenic polydipsia, or excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological reasons to drink, is relatively common in people with <b>schizophrenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of <b>schizophrenia.</b> <b>Schizophrenia</b> occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of <b>schizophrenia.</b> A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble <b>schizophrenia</b> and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schizophrenia</b> Genesis {{starts with}} the history of <b>schizophrenia.</b> Gottesman takes the view that <b>schizophrenia</b> is a disease of the {{industrial}} world. because it is not mentioned in the Bible, by the ancient Greeks, the ancient physicians, or authors including Shakespeare. He saw it first mentioned by physicians in 1809 and by Balzac in a short story in 1832, showing minimally the disorder had by then been recognized as such. In 1896, Kraepelin defined its symptoms, and his student Ernst Rüdin began a genetic study of its transmission in 1916.} The book noted that <b>schizophrenia</b> existed across cultures and its rates had stayed steady for fifty years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schizophrenia</b> {{and smoking}} {{have shown a}} strong {{association}} in studies worldwide. Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with <b>schizophrenia,</b> with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population. Those who smoke tend to smoke heavily, and additionally smoke cigarettes with high nicotine content. Among people with <b>schizophrenia</b> use of cannabis is also common.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schizophrenia</b> is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with <b>schizophrenia</b> have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with <b>schizophrenia</b> live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid <b>schizophrenia</b> may have a better prospect than other types of <b>schizophrenia</b> for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for <b>schizophrenia</b> appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle {{outlined}} the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman {{used in his}} study of <b>schizophrenia.</b> He co-wrote the book with James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing <b>schizophrenia</b> in a research setting, taking into account national differences in how the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting <b>schizophrenia,</b> and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} more recent {{scholars}} attempted {{to explain her}} visions in psychiatric or neurological terms. Potential diagnoses have included epilepsy, migraine, tuberculosis, and <b>schizophrenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} with <b>schizophrenia</b> use drugs or alcohol excessively.|$|E
5|$|Catatonia is {{no longer}} so {{strongly}} associated with <b>schizophrenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of <b>schizophrenia.</b> The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with <b>schizophrenia</b> {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with <b>schizophrenia,</b> and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with <b>schizophrenia</b> to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with <b>schizophrenia</b> tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with <b>schizophrenia</b> and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with <b>schizophrenia</b> shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with <b>schizophrenia</b> presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the prior}} belief that <b>schizophrenia</b> occurs at similar rates worldwide, its {{frequency}} varies across the world, within countries, {{and at the}} local and neighborhood level. This variation has been estimated to be fivefold. It causes approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years and resulted in 20,000 deaths in 2010. The rate of <b>schizophrenia</b> varies up to threefold depending on how it is defined.|$|E
5|$|Environmental factors {{associated}} {{with the development of}} <b>schizophrenia</b> include the living environment, drug use, and prenatal stressors.|$|E
5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} {{is typical of}} mania. Conversely, {{patients}} with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking. Poverty of thought {{is one of the}} negative symptoms of <b>schizophrenia,</b> and might also be a feature of severe depression or dementia. A patient with dementia might also experience thought perseveration. Formal thought disorder is a common feature of <b>schizophrenia.</b> Circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman {{authored}} nine books, {{all related}} to <b>schizophrenia</b> and psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|He {{has been}} {{suffering}} from serious {{physical and mental health}} issues, including <b>schizophrenia</b> and post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with <b>schizophrenia</b> may {{experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in <b>schizophrenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that in some}} people, development of <b>schizophrenia</b> is related to intestinal tract dysfunction such as seen with non-celiac gluten sensitivity or abnormalities in the intestinal flora. A subgroup of persons with <b>schizophrenia</b> present an immune response to gluten different from that found in people with celiac, with elevated levels of certain serum biomarkers of gluten sensitivity such as anti-gliadin IgG or anti-gliadin IgA antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, in {{combination}} with an antipsychotic drug, is indicated for the acute management of <b>schizophrenia</b> when it is associated with aggressive or out-of-control behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Other drugs may be {{used only}} as coping {{mechanisms}} by individuals who have <b>schizophrenia,</b> to deal with depression, anxiety, boredom, and loneliness.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of <b>schizophrenia</b> is {{difficult}} {{as there are}} no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder. There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent <b>schizophrenia.</b> While {{there is some evidence}} that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short-term outcomes, there is little benefit from these measures after five years. Attempting to prevent <b>schizophrenia</b> in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another preventative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has found}} a {{tentative}} benefit in using minocycline to treat <b>schizophrenia.</b> Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with <b>schizophrenia</b> to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, {{there is not enough}} evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area. There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, {{based on the premise that}} inflammation might play a role in the pathology of <b>schizophrenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of <b>Schizophrenia</b> and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop <b>schizophrenia</b> under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop <b>schizophrenia</b> where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E
5|$|Schizoaffective {{disorder}} is better defined to demarcate it more cleanly from <b>schizophrenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Schizophrenia</b> is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormal social behavior {{and failure to}} understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with <b>schizophrenia</b> often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Schizophrenia</b> {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with <b>schizophrenia.</b> They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen as central to the pathology of <b>schizophrenia,</b> both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying <b>schizophrenia.</b> Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that <b>schizophrenia</b> is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 {{systematic}} review examined antioxidant medications, such as allopurinol and acetylcysteine, as add on treatment for <b>schizophrenia.</b> Evidence was insufficient to determine benefits {{and there was}} potential for adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and <b>schizophrenia.</b> One of the most common is the dopamine hypothesis, which attributes psychosis to the mind's faulty interpretation of the misfiring of dopaminergic neurons.|$|E
5|$|About 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by <b>schizophrenia</b> during their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, <b>schizophrenia.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 30 to 50 {{percent of}} people with <b>schizophrenia</b> fail to accept {{that they have an}} illness or comply with their {{recommended}} treatment. Treatment may have some effect on insight.|$|E
5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} {{malnutrition}} {{in the mother}} during fetal development, {{may result in a}} slight increase in the risk of <b>schizophrenia</b> later in life. People diagnosed with <b>schizophrenia</b> {{are more likely to have}} been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E
