5000|$|A <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> is a spar used in sailboats (both dinghys and yachts) to {{help support}} and control a variety of headsails, {{particularly}} the spinnaker. However, it is also used with other sails, such as genoas and jibs, when sailing downwind with no spinnaker hoisted. (Since the load on a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> is very light on this point of sailing, sometimes a special light <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> called a whisker pole is used in these circumstances.) ...|$|E
50|$|Symmetric spinnakers {{have the}} {{windward}} clew secured to a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> The pole {{is attached to}} the mast and holds the windward edge of the sail in position. Lines that control the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> are called guys or braces. The <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> may be allowed to raise and lower with the force of the wind, or it may have lines attached to it to raise (the topping lift) and lower (the foreguy or downhaul) the angle of the pole. If these lines are used, they are generally set up before setting sail, and left in place even when the spinnaker is stowed.|$|E

60|$|Baby jib top-sails {{had been}} sent down before the rounding, and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> were now ready for the balloon sail.|$|R
50|$|Limitations to the {{equipment}} series for an FJ are; 1 mainsail, 2 jibs, 1 spinnaker (optional), 1 mast, 1 boom, 2 <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles,</b> 1 centerboard and 1 rudder.|$|R
50|$|Asymmetrical {{spinnaker}} resembling large jibs and flown from <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> {{are not a}} {{new idea}} and date back to at least the 19th Century. However in the 1980s a new concept appeared, starting with the Sydney Harbour 18ft Skiff fleet.|$|R
50|$|A special line, the topping lift, {{runs from}} the middle of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> up to a block on the mast, and is used to support the weight of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> Another line {{referred}} to as the downhaul or foreguy runs down so that the height of the pole is under positive control at all times.|$|E
50|$|Rig - Hollow spars, {{including}} <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> {{stainless steel}} rigging, galvanized tangs, bronze fittings and winches.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> is rigged to {{run from}} the base of the mast, where there is a special fitting for {{attaching}} one end of the pole, out to windward over the side of the boat. There, one of the control lines of whichever sail it is to be used with is run through a fitting on the other end of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> This allows for more precise control of the corner of the sail to which the line is attached.|$|E
50|$|The hullform is {{designed}} for bent wood, laid with overlapping ends (clinker-built), easy for amateur builders with low budgets. However, the association has been reasonably flexible. In 1949, they approved carvel-built boats (ends of the hull planking butt, rather than overlap). In 1976, an inexpensive (gun-shot flock) fiberglass hull was approved. In 1999, after persistent reasonable argument by a certain Swedish aerospace engineer, the association accepted a design for an aluminum mast, whisker and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Sydney and Brisbane Australia {{there has}} been a revival of the early days of 18’ skiff sailing. Replicas of famous 18’ skiffs from the period of 1930 through to 1950 have been built using {{original}} techniques, including wooden hulls and spars, gaff rigs, several-piece <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> and unrestricted sail area. These boats race under the rules of the Australian Historical Skiff Association, which bans wings, trapezes, cleats for controlling ropes for the mainsail, jib and spinnaker, and most of the other modern equipment which makes sailing easier.|$|R
50|$|Under such conditions, {{the crew}} might fashion {{makeshift}} masts and sails from spare materials carried aboard. This would allow limited propulsion and navigational control. If the ship {{managed to make}} landfall near forests with suitable wood, new masts could be constructed from the locally available material. The masts of a sailing ship should be regularly inspected and replaced if necessary due to storm damage and normal wear. Most ocean-going ships would carry a large supply of rope, sailcloth, and even spars for ordinary and extraordinary repairs. It is often possible to use part of the broken mast to create a jury rig. <b>Spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> and mizzen booms may even be used. A man-of-war would expect to carry out additional repairs due to battle damage.|$|R
50|$|In a keel boat, a {{death roll}} is {{the act of}} {{broaching}} to windward, putting the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> {{into the water and}} causing a crash-jibe of the boom and mainsail, which sweep across the deck and plunge down into the water. The Death Roll often results in destruction of the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and sometimes even dismasting of the boat. Serious injury to crew is possible due to the swift and uncontrolled action of the boom and associated gear sweeping across the boat and crashing to the (now) leeward side.|$|E
50|$|Race 4 was sailed {{in strong}} winds and rough seas and NZL 82s mast snapped {{on the third}} leg causing retirement. On the third leg in race 5, NZL 82 broke a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{topping lift}} may also {{refer to a}} line {{on the front of}} the mast used to rig the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> It is used to trim the pole to the proper height when {{hoisting}} the spinnaker.|$|E
50|$|Moveable {{lines that}} control sails or other {{equipment}} are known collectively as a vessel's running rigging. Lines that raise sails are called halyards while those that strike them are called downhauls. Lines that adjust (trim) the sails are called sheets. These are {{often referred to}} using {{the name of the}} sail they control (such as main sheet, or jib sheet). Sail trim may also be controlled with smaller lines attached to the forward section of a boom such as a cunningham; a line used to hold the boom down is called a vang, or a kicker in the United Kingdom. A topping lift is used to hold a boom up in the absence of sail tension. Guys are used to control the ends of other spars such as <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1952, he and {{his brother}} Jim persuaded Ralph Larrabee, the owner of the 161-foot {{schooner}} Goodwill, to enter it in the Transpacific Yacht Race from Los Angeles to Honolulu. The conversion of the recreational yacht to a racer included the creation of twin 72-foot aluminum <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> at Douglas Aircraft Company. They were so long that Jim Douglas created pole ends that could be severed by means of explosive bolts from fighter jet ejector seats to drop the sail in an emergency. The crew numbered 47, including 30 sailors, a cook and seven stewards. The Douglas brothers had major roles in crew leadership, and Don served as the Sailing Master in the 1959 race. The Goodwill was the first to finish the 1953 race, as well as in 1959.|$|R
50|$|The hulls {{of early}} 505s {{were built in}} cold-molded marine plywood. Many of these are still {{actively}} raced. New hulls are now built using composite molding: glass fibre and/or carbon fibre mats and vinylester or epoxy resin using either a wet layup technique or using heat-cured prepreg sheets. Hulls are usually cored with foam, balsa or Nomex to increase stiffness and durability: new hulls will remain competitive for well over ten years, and boats several times that age have won races in major championships. Spars traditionally were aluminum alloy, but recent rule changes have permitted the use of carbon fibre for booms and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>poles</b> (though not for masts.) The hull shape and sail plan are tightly controlled, while the spars, foils and rigging are more open. This allows the boat's rig and controls {{to be set up}} to the preferences of the sailor, rather than dictated by the class rules (as they are for the Laser class, for example.) The rig itself is highly adjustable for wind and sea conditions, with the result that the boat can be sailed in a relatively wide range of wind speeds and by crews of varying sizes. Successful teams come in many combinations, including all-female, all-male, mixed, and child/adult or child/teen. As of 2009, over 9000 505s had been built.|$|R
50|$|The {{symmetric}} one is {{the most}} classic type, running symmetrical alongside the boat controlled by lines known as a sheet and a guy running from the lower two corners of the sail. The windward line, or guy, {{is attached to the}} corner called the tack of the sail, and is stabilized by a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> The leeward (downwind) line is called the sheet. It attaches to the clew of the spinnaker and is used to control the shape of the sail. The <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> must be moved in each gybe, and is quite difficult for beginners to use. However, it can be sailed in all downwind wind directions.|$|E
5000|$|The Elliott 6m is an Olympic-class keelboat, {{designed}} by New Zealander, Greg Elliott. It {{was selected for}} the women's match racing event for the 2012 Olympics. [...] The Elliott 6m carries a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and symmetric spinnaker which is considered more suitable for match racing.|$|E
50|$|The hull, {{interior}} structure, and deck of Tiamat {{is built}} in foam cored Epoxy/E-glass, while the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and mast are carbon fibre. Mills has {{opted for a}} twin carbon wheel design rather than the standard single wheel as seen on most yachts of this size.|$|E
5000|$|The 505 {{is a big}} boat by dinghy standards, with a {{powerful}} sailplan, especially with the adoption in 2002(?) {{of a much larger}} spinnaker. It is generally considered a class for adults, with world class crews usually having a combined weight in the range of 150 to 185 kg. It is remarkably well-balanced under main and jib, even in big breeze: many boats use a fixed tiller/rudder requiring beach launched boats to be sailed without a rudder into deeper water. The 505 will plane upwind in windspeeds of around 10 knots or more. Offwind, the 505 is very exciting, but still well-behaved. In winds above 12 knots it is usually advantageous to [...] "tack downwind", utilizing the apparent wind advantages of broad-reaching, rather sailing downwind. With a big <b>spinnaker</b> and conventional <b>pole,</b> gybing in a breeze is a particularly challenging manoeuver and pulling it off consistently is the defining [...] "rite of passage" [...] between novice and skilled crews. Even after 60 years, the 505 {{remains one of the most}} sophisticated and rewarding sailboats to sail. The list of 505 [...] "alumnae" [...] includes many of the world's top professional sailors, many of whom attend major 505 events to keep their sailing skills sharp.|$|R
5000|$|A guy (probably from Dutch gei, [...] "brail") {{is a line}} (rope) {{attached}} to and intended to control {{the end of a}} spar on a sailboat. On a modern sloop-rigged sailboat with a symmetric spinnaker, the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> is the spar most commonly controlled by one or more guys.|$|E
50|$|Parrot beak-a {{stainless}} steel fitting {{on the end}} of a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> consisting of a mounting with a retractable spring-loaded pin that is controlled remotely by way of a cord. When the cord is pulled it releases the spinnaker sheet so the spinnaker can be recovered by crew on deck.|$|E
50|$|The {{class has}} since progressed with the times, {{including}} a new deck and cockpit layout and changing the construction from GRP to a foam sandwich. In {{the last few years}} the rules have allowed a bigger spinnaker, longer <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and the use of epoxy resin {{in the construction of the}} hull.|$|E
50|$|A spar is a pole of wood, {{metal or}} {{lightweight}} {{materials such as}} carbon fibre used in the rigging of a sailing vessel to carry or support its sail. These include booms and masts, which serve both to deploy sail and resist compressive and bending forces, {{as well as the}} bowsprit and <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
50|$|The modern 12s {{also have}} fixed bowsprits {{to carry the}} spinnakers from. This is a {{relatively}} recent innovation, with the older style of skiff having an 'end to end' <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> which {{would need to be}} positioned by the crew, and would be stored against the skiff's boom when it was not being used.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary boats weigh {{as little}} as 165 lb, and have as typical {{equipment}} a retractable <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> unlimited asymmetric spinnaker size, 200sq ft mainsail and jib area, a fully battened mainsail, an adjustable carbon rig, and a hydrofoil rudder that allows the boat to be trimmed fore and aft for different conditions, and as a drag reduction device.|$|E
5000|$|The Parasail was {{developed}} as {{a variant of the}} Parasailor, and is a great light wind performer. With very little tendency to roll, it is ideal for small crews. It can be used with a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> but it is not necessary. The Parasail has a single-skinned wing as opposed to the double-layer wing of the Parasailor ...|$|E
5000|$|Current Cherubs use an {{asymmetric}} spinnaker system but earlier boats used relatively large double luff spinnakers {{and used a}} notably long (9 foot) <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b> Cherubs have a high power-to-weight ratio and are very quick downwind in stronger breezes but can be slow upwind in lighter airs compared to longer boats. The Cherub has a RYA Portsmouth number of 930.|$|E
5000|$|The {{downhaul}} {{is a line}} {{which is}} part of the rigging on a sailboat; it applies downward force on a spar or sail. The most common downhaul on a modern sailboat is attached to the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole,</b> though this may be referred to as the foreguy in some rigging nomenclature. The term is also commonly applied to the cunningham on the mainsail.|$|E
50|$|A {{few were}} {{imported}} into the US in the mid-80's, and several now {{reside in the}} Pacific Northwest region. The boat is fractionally rigged, with a conventional <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> and symmetric spinnaker. An unusual feature of the rig, required for class racing, is that the jib is sheeted to a self-tacking traveler car. The Ross 930 has a PHRF rating between 96 and 120, depending on region.|$|E
50|$|From {{the tip of}} her {{bowsprit}} to the end of her 108 ft boom, Reliance measured 201 ft, and {{the tip of her}} mast was 199 ft {{above the}} water (the height of a 20-story building). Everything else was to an equally gargantuan scale; her <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> was 84 ft long, and her total sail area of 1501 m2 was the equivalent of eight 12 meter class yachts.|$|E
50|$|There is room in {{the cockpit}} for four to daysail, but a crew of three is {{employed}} when racing. On most racing teams, the skipper helms the boat and handles the mainsail. The front crew on a racing team handles the jib upwind and is responsible for <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> handling downwind. When racing, a middle crew is relied upon for trimming the spinnaker downwind and has boat balance as a primary responsibility upwind.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of a {{symmetrical}} spinnaker, each of the lower corners of the sail is a clew. However, under sail on a given tack, the corner to which the spinnaker sheet is attached is called the clew, and the corner attached to the <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole</b> {{is referred to as the}} tack. [...] On a square sail underway, the tack is the windward clew and also the line holding down that corner.|$|E
50|$|When running, the {{mainsail}} is eased out {{as far as}} it will go. The jib will collapse {{because the}} mainsail blocks its wind, and must either be lowered and replaced by a spinnaker, or set instead on the windward side of the sailing craft. Running with the jib to windward is known as 'gull wing', 'goose wing', 'butterflying' or 'wing and wing'. A genoa gull-wings well, especially if stabilized by a whisker pole, which is similar to but lighter than a <b>spinnaker</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
