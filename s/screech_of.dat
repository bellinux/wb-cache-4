5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E
500|$|The car {{has three}} {{monitors}} on the dashboard, the first monitors {{the status of}} important components, while the second controls the sound system, and the last is a rev counter, digital speedometer and the fuel gauge. CNET described the speed gauge monitor as clear and [...] "close to the driver's natural line of sight", but criticized the other two monitors for being unreadable and possibly dangerous if used by the driver while the car is moving. Some reviewers complained about the vehicle's soundproofing, which could not adequately conceal the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> the wind. The engine at high speed received mixed reviews, while a number of reviewers reported a fault with the screenwash bottle, which can freeze in cold weather and blow a fuse when used. The reviewer for European Car of the Year 2010 called the nominated C3 Picasso fuel efficient, but said it had [...] "dull steering".|$|E
6000|$|... "Peace, {{neighbour}} Proudfute--I prithee, peace," [...] said Craigdallie, who {{was obviously}} tired <b>of</b> the tuneless <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the worthy deacon.|$|R
50|$|A {{moment of}} silence may be {{accompanied}} by other acts of symbolic significance, such as the <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> death, the release of crows or guns, or a performance of the hatred period in life.|$|R
60|$|The {{scratching}} of his stylo {{against the}} paper was the only sound that struck Louisa's ear, {{the rest of the}} house seemed lonely and still. Only from far away came the shrill <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the cab-whistle.|$|R
500|$|... As {{she tries}} to sleep, Brahms's Lullaby plays softly in the background. She then levitates off her bed using her stomach muscles to move {{the top half of}} her body. Knowles said that the {{levitation}} shot was the hardest one as she had difficulties making her neck look straight. She added that the scene represents the nightmare and the white bird flying above her takes her into her dream, which unfolds after the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> an electric guitar. Knowles is transported to a desert and several clouds are present in the background. She wears a black Roberto Cavalli dress and boots; as the music begins, her two backup dancers wearing Gareth Pugh pieces appear. The scene changes into a computer-generated sci-fi landscape where Knowles is inscribed with a circle and square in a similar fashion to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. The first chorus is brought in by a subtle glass-breaking sound effect as the sci-fi special effects disappear and Knowles appears in a silver one-shouldered mini dress on a white background. Accompanied by her backup dancers, she performs sophisticated, street and hip-busting dance moves.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the film lead Koreyoshi Kurahara and Nobuo Yamada to write and direct a couple more {{original}} scripts, where Kurahara was primarily known for his adaptations of novels. This included the follow-up Black Sun (1964) which again featured Tamio Kawachi, who reprised his role from The Warped Ones, as did several of the other actors, {{and a lot of}} jazz music. In it, Kawachi's Akira shelters a black G.I., Gil, played by Chico Rolands, who goes A.W.O.L. after killing a white man in a bar fight. The film explores the two men's friendship and race relations. It was also the first reversal on rashamen-themed films, post-war, often American-Japanese co-productions focusing on friendships or romances between a Japanese and an American. Rashamen films were intended as to promote goodwill between the two nations but were generally less well received in Japan, seen as unrealistic or patronizing. Film historian Tadao Sato described Black Sun as the first film of this sort where Japanese pity Americans instead of the reverse as Akira's preconceptions of black Americans are undone. Mark Schilling characterized Kawachi as bringing an [...] "explosive energy" [...] to the film and Roland a [...] "piping <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> fear and desperation." [...] Acclaimed American jazz musician Max Roach contributed to the score.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone found {{similarities}} between the video for [...] "Sweet Dreams", Kanye West's video for [...] "Paranoid" [...] (2009) and the cover artworks of English rock band Yes. Canadian magazine Dose also compared the video with [...] "Paranoid" [...] due to their similar dream sequences. Nadia Mendoza of The Sun further compared Knowles' look in the video with Lady Gaga's. Vicki Lutas of the BBC did not appreciate the first 30 seconds of the video, writing that [...] "the dark, horror-type music, the pumping heartbeat, the equally spooky lullaby, the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> an electric guitar", gave her the impression that she was watching [...] "some 80s magician, with a Knowles soundtrack". However, she complimented {{the rest of the}} video writing that [...] "things (thankfully) move away from the Hallowe'en cheese and into familiar Beyoncé territory (right from the fact it's proper 80s pop through to the video essentially being 'Single Ladies' with Beyoncé and 2 dancers)". Lutas concluded that the video might not be remembered for long or hailed as Beyoncé's finest and more memorable work, but it remains one of the best music videos from Knowles she has seen since [...] "Crazy in Love". Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared the dancing moves in the video with those in [...] "Single Ladies".|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said Otto, {{with a grin}} so broad {{that his}} white teeth glistened even in the dark, [...] "and my {{cockatoo}} is the unsubdued <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the block-sheaves! They must be {{trying to get the}} ship off the reef." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first real}} track day was in 1997, {{attending}} the Ford RS Owners Club meeting at Nutts Corner in his Ford Cosworth Sierra. At these events, drivers {{would have to}} go as sideways as possible around the track. The <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the tyres would have the crowds going crazy for more.|$|R
5000|$|Hindemith also {{quotes from}} Till Eulenspiegel by Richard Strauss, and parodies the exotic sounds of Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde, using celesta, mandolin, harp and English horn. He {{contrasts}} tender music with [...] "the <b>screeches</b> <b>of</b> two trained monkeys", and parodies the [...] "neo-Baroque" [...] style of Max Reger with a grotesque [...] "choral fugue".|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was nothing,' replied {{her eldest}} sister; 'it {{was only the}} <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> the barn-owl that roosts {{in one of the}} turrets of the castle.' ...|$|E
60|$|A sudden <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> {{laughter}} {{came from}} the Evening Telegraph office. Know who that is. What's up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it is.|$|E
6000|$|The {{gates of}} London! Where was the {{multitude}} hurrying to the marts of trade {{after a night}} of pleasure or rest? Where was the clang of tramcar gongs, the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> motor horns, the vast murmur of a dense throng? ...|$|E
50|$|Kruthiks {{can only}} speak a clicking, <b>screeching</b> {{language}} <b>of</b> their own, but can understand Common.|$|R
25|$|There was a {{great variety}} of animal life in the wilderness. At night, the pioneers could hear the hoots and <b>screeches</b> <b>of</b> owls, the howls of wolves, and the cries of panthers and wild cats. Sometimes the Native Americans imitated these sounds. Venomous snakes such as copperheads and rattlesnakes blended into the leaves and {{undergrowth}} which were a danger to the pioneers, their horses and cattle.|$|R
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} be wrong in the chicken house, and when Dorothy looked through the slats in the door she saw a group of hens and roosters huddled in one corner and {{watching}} {{what appeared to be}} a whirling ball of feathers. It bounded here and there about the chicken house, and at first Dorothy could not tell what it was, while the <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the chickens nearly deafened her.|$|R
60|$|They {{swung around}} and {{commenced}} their journey. Quest {{stood with his}} watch in his hand. They were getting up the anchor of the Durham, and from higher up the river came the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> steamers beginning to move on their outward way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Open the door, our Ursula," [...] {{came the}} {{complaining}} cry. It was all over. She must open the door. She heard the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> the bucket downstairs dragged across the flagstones {{as the woman}} washed the kitchen floor. And the children were prowling in the bedroom, asking: ...|$|E
6000|$|Anna was {{a gentle}} {{feminine}} girl, with a most lovely and winning countenance, and I did inherently {{like to hear}} her pronounce the word [...] "Jack"--it was {{so different from the}} boisterous <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> the Eton boys, or the swaggering call of my boon companions at Oxford! ...|$|E
60|$|Ulrich {{was silent}} for a few minutes, and lay {{listening}} to the weary <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the wind. An idea was slowly forming and growing in his brain, an idea that gained strength every time that he looked across at the man who was fighting so grimly against pain and exhaustion. In the pain and languor that Ulrich himself was feeling the old fierce hatred seemed to be dying down.|$|R
60|$|The ringing {{voice of}} Boldheart {{was lost in}} the report of the guns and the <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the savages. Volley after volley awakened the {{numerous}} echoes. Hundreds of savages were killed, hundreds wounded, and thousands ran howling into the woods. The Latin- grammar master had a spare night-cap lent him, and a long-tail coat, which he wore hind side before. He presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance, and serve him right.|$|R
5000|$|Vincent Canby of the New York Times was not amused: [...] "Michael C. Gwynne {{has some}} good moments as a junkie, but neither Paul Wendkos, who {{directed}} the film, nor Don Gazzaniga, who wrote it, is very adept at melodrama and action. The film ends in a car chase {{of the sort that}} makes you realize that the <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> tires has become the most overused and boring sound in movies today." ...|$|R
60|$|The sight was {{received}} with a shout by the men, a shriller shout by the women, and a <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> surprise and delight by little Olaf, who {{would certainly have}} gone over the side in his eagerness, had not Biarne caught him by the skirts of his tunic.|$|E
60|$|The {{report of}} the firearm had not yet died away when there came the wild and unmistakable <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> a wounded bob cat--a wildcat well known in certain {{portions}} of our southern states. At {{the same time the}} dog began to bark furiously, and everybody on board the launch was aroused.|$|E
60|$|The {{sun rose}} {{and changed the}} gray world of forest. For {{the first time in}} her life Ellen hated the golden brightness, the {{wonderful}} blue of sky, the scream of the eagle and the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> the jay; and the squirrels she had always loved to feed were neglected that morning.|$|E
60|$|Eleven o'clock. Here we go, {{down the}} Saone. Cabin thirty feet by ten, papered and {{varnished}} in invitation of maple. Ladies knitting, netting, nodding, napping; gentlemen yawning, snoring; children frolicking; dogs whining. Overhead a constant tramping, stamping, and <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the steam valve. H. suggests an excursion forward. We heave up from Hades, and cautiously thread the crowded Al Sirat of a deck. The day is fine; {{the air is}} filled with golden beams.|$|R
60|$|Even {{while the}} man spoke the {{forest in the}} {{distance}} seemed to wake from its solemn silence, the wind on its wings brought sounds of life and movement different from the prowling of beasts or the <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> night-birds. It was the furtive advance of men, the quick whispers of command, of encouragement, of the human animal preparing to attack his kind. But all in the distance still, all muffled, all furtive as yet.|$|R
60|$|The centipede, {{driven by}} destiny, showed {{himself on the}} floor of the gallery, and then, the <b>screeches</b> <b>of</b> the two women giving him his cue, he scuttled with all his yellow legs through the open door into the furthermost west room, which was Teddy's. Arming {{themselves}} with domestic utensils selected with regard to their length, Octavia and Mrs. Maclntyre, with much clutching of skirts and skirmishing for the position of rear guard in the attacking force, followed.|$|R
60|$|Which he did, {{but without}} result. A cordial {{invitation}} to the criminal {{to come forward and}} be executed was received in wooden silence by the school, with the exception of Johnson III, of Outwood's, who, suddenly reminded of Sammy's appearance by the headmaster's words, broke into a wild <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> laughter, and was instantly awarded two hundred lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "All over: and {{the cry of}} mun, and the <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> mun! Oh, sir, up to {{the very}} heavens! And the king he screeched right out like any maid, 'Oh my gentlemen, oh my gallant men!' and as she lay on her beam-ends, sir, and just a-settling, the very last souls I seen was that man's father, and that man's. I knowed mun by their armor." ...|$|E
60|$|With a <b>screech</b> <b>of</b> {{surprise}} and pain the mate crumpled {{in the far}} corner of the forecastle, rammed halfway beneath a bunk by the force of the terrific blow. Like a tiger Billy Byrne was after him, and dragging the man out into the center of the floor space he beat and mauled him until his victim's blood-curdling shrieks echoed through the ship from stem to stern.|$|E
5000|$|Pierson had {{initially}} {{intended for the}} band only to perform live, a reflex reaction perhaps to the studio-bound fate <b>of</b> <b>Screeching</b> Weasel, which didn't play a live show between 1994 and late 2000. But in late 2002, EiB released its debut record, Myths & Imaginary Magicians. The album was originally released on Pierson's own label, limited to 2,000 copies, and sold exclusively through online independent music store Interpunk. When fans <b>of</b> <b>Screeching</b> Weasel heard <b>of</b> the album, they bought {{up all of the}} available copies and Pierson re-released the album with Lookout! Records in March 2003. The album featured covers <b>of</b> <b>Screeching</b> Weasel's [...] "Hey Suburbia," [...] Operation Ivy's [...] "Knowledge" [...] and Yazoo's [...] "Only You".|$|R
50|$|No {{more than}} two minutes had passed as Deirdre and Annie spoke in the back room. Suddenly, their {{conversation}} was halted by <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> brakes followed by a terrible crash, which shook the pub. Annie froze but Deirdre rushed through the pub and outside where she had left Tracy. In that very spot was a 6-foot pile of timber. Accompanying the pile was a lorry, turned on its side and smoking from the crash. Deirdre hysterically pulled away at the wood screaming for Tracy.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow stated [...] "Ayler {{works well with}} his backup group (pianist Call Cobbs, bassist Henry Grimes, and drummer Sunny Murray) and creates very {{emotional}} music (really hanging onto the themes)" [...] while Al Campbell noted [...] "These traditional compositions are treated with reverence {{and a lack of}} improvisation, played in a quietly passionate but respectful manner. They reveal a sensitivity that was obscured with the emotionally charged tenor <b>screeching</b> <b>of</b> the Ayler originals that were also recorded at this session".|$|R
