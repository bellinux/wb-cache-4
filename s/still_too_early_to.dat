30|$|To summarize, on {{the face}} of it, there have been some {{important}} changes in the field of legislation on employment protection, an institution that was considered highly path-dependent before the crisis. Overall, there is a trend {{in some of the most}} segmented countries towards lower dismissal costs for permanent workers in combination with a moderate (and sometimes ambiguous) re-regulation of temporary contracts. Overall, this tends to narrow the regulatory gap between permanent and temporary contracts at least to some extent. Nonetheless, have these changes contributed to reducing segmentation? Given that many of the reforms have only been implemented in the past three to 5  years—in a situation with limited labor demand in most of the countries—it might <b>still</b> be <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> evaluate their impact on hiring practices with currently available data. However, revisiting Fig.  1 casts some doubt on their effectiveness, showing that the share of temporary contracts has even increased in the countries that deregulated EPL during the crisis. Between 2010 and 2014, the share of workers aged 15 – 29 increased by roughly seven percentage points in Italy and Spain, three in France and Portugal and one in Greece. Of course, we do not have a counterfactual situation, thus making it difficult to assess the exact influence of the reforms.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of high-resolution, multi-proxy palaeoecological {{investigations}} of two parallel peat cores from the Baltic raised bog Mechacz Wielki in NE Poland. We aim to evaluate the role of regional climate and autogenic processes of the raised bog itself in driving the vegetation and hydrology dynamics. Based on partly synchronous changes in Sphagnum communities in the two study cores we suggest that extrinsic factors (climate) {{played an important role}} as a driver in mire development during the bog stage (500 – 2012 CE). Using a testate amoebae transfer function, we found exceptionally stable hydrological conditions during the last 2000 years with a relatively high water table and lack of local fire events that allowed for rapid peat accumulation (2. 75 mm/year) in the bog. Further, the strong correlation between pH and community-weighted mean of testate amoeba traits suggests that other variables than water-table depth play a role in driving microbial properties under stable hydrological conditions. There is a difference in hydrological dynamics in bogs between NW and NE Poland until ca 1500 CE, after which the water table reconstructions show more similarities. Our results illustrate how various functional traits relate to different environmental variables in a range of trophic and hydrological scenarios on long time scales. Moreover, our data suggest a common regional climatic forcing in Mechacz Wielki, Gązwa and Kontolanrahka.

40|$|PhDMost {{quantitative}} ecological {{research on}} aquatic insects has addressed their immature stages. To understand their population dynamics, however, {{information on the}} adult stage is essential. This study aimed to obtain quantitative estimates of life cycle features, such as emergence, adult life span and fecundity, and to develop further the methods used. Field studies on adult insects revealed patterns in spatial and temporal distribution {{and the effect of}} land use on lateral dispersal. Finally, methods used to estimate dispersal and gene flow were discussed. Studies on Leuctra nigra demonstrated that their emergence is associated with the quantity of emergent substratum locally available. Female L. nigra can be classified as "immature" and "mature", based on the maturity of their eggs, and this was used as an approximate age marker in studies of adult survival and spatial distribution, and to improve estimates of emergence by excluding mature females from catches in pyramidal traps. A female biased sex ratio observed in L. nigra stemmed from a discrepancy in the life span of the genders, with shorter-lived males, combined with a change in habitat by the females. Most adult aquatic insects stayed close to the stream. Thus, half of the stoneflies travelled less than 18 m lateral to the channel and the dispersal ranges of caddis flies and female of mayflies were even shorter. Comparison of the movement along the stream with the lateral dispersal suggests that most dispersal is in the 'stream corridor' itself. Little distinction was found between lateral dispersal in different catchment land uses. It is <b>still</b> <b>too</b> <b>early,</b> however, <b>to</b> conclude that dispersal is unaffected by land use.
