5|$|Han Sai Por {{was born}} on 19 July 1943 in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. She was one of six {{children}} of a poor couple, and her family were squatters living in Changi in a house made of cardboard boxes and coconut leaves. Nonetheless, Han had a happy childhood, {{and went to a}} nearby beach to make figurine animals out of sand. This experience helped her to appreciate nature and instilled in her a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure</b> and exploration. At ten years of age, Han was introduced to Michelangelo's sculptures through a book given to her by her mother.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force on 26 May 1915, and was posted to the 4th Light Horse Brigade as a private. He {{departed}} for Egypt aboard the transport A29 Suevic on 13 June. Serving as a driver first in the Middle East {{and then on the}} Western Front, his mechanical ability and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure</b> led him to volunteer for the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in December 1916. After qualifying as a pilot in England, he was commissioned a lieutenant and posted to No.2 Squadron. Commanded by Major Oswald Watt, No.2 Squadron's personnel included many former Lighthorsemen, as well as mechanics from the AFC's first combat formation, the Mesopotamian Half Flight. The force trained extensively in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying to the Western Front that September. Holden was involved in the AFC's first day of combat in France; just after noon on 2 October, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, he and his wingman engaged a German two-seater that managed to escape.|$|E
25|$|Captain Fracasse (1863) This {{book was}} promised {{to the public}} in 1836 but finally {{published}} in 1863. The novel represents a different era and is a project that Gautier had wanted to complete earlier in this youth. It is centered on a soldier named Fracasse whose adventures portray bouts of chivalry, courage and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure.</b> Gautier places the story in his favourite historical era, that of Louis XIII. It is best described as a typical cloak-and-dagger fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after.|$|E

25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to work off, which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure</b> for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in the}} past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to take the risk of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E

500|$|As {{a self-proclaimed}} [...] "fan of multitracking", Townsend has {{developed}} a trademark production style featuring an atmospheric, layered [...] "wall of sound". Townsend has drawn critical praise for his productions, which [...] "are always marked by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure,</b> intrigue, chaotic atmospherics and overall aural pyrotechnics", according to Mike G. of Metal Maniacs. Townsend mainly uses Pro Tools to produce his music, alongside other software suites such as Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live, and Logic Pro. Townsend's musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. Townsend has carried out the mixing and mastering {{for most of his}} solo work himself. He has also mixed and remixed work for other artists such as Rammstein, August Burns Red and Misery Signals.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{his songs}} have {{received}} very positive reviews, such as his doo-wop song [...] "Going Nuclear", based on the then-upcoming game Fallout 4, which drew praise from video game journalists for matching the tone and style of the game's aesthetic very well. His song [...] "The Lucky Ones" [...] was considered unique by being written {{from the point of}} view of the background characters, rather than the player characters of Tom Clancy's The Division. He has written two songs about the Uncharted franchise [...] "Keep Drifting" [...] and [...] "Here we go Again", inspired by the main character's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure</b> and being a drifter at heart. Nerdist reviewed his song [...] "Get the Gang Back", based on the popular Blizzard game Overwatch, and called it [...] "an incredibly catchy tune" [...] with the lyrics [...] "mirroring the gameâ€™s relentlessly positive outlook".|$|E
500|$|For Peel, Thunderbirds is [...] "without a {{doubt the}} peak of the Supermarionation achievement". Suggesting that the series is pitched at a [...] "more adult" [...] level than its predecessors, he adds that its <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure,</b> {{effective}} humour and [...] "gripping and convincing" [...] episodes ensured that [...] "everyone in the audience found something to love about it." [...] Simon Heffer, a fan of Thunderbirds in childhood, commented positively on the series for The Daily Telegraph in 2011: [...] "All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown-up television we had been allowed to watch were present in Thunderbirds: dramatic theme and incidental music; well-developed plots; goodies and baddies; swaggering Americans, {{at a time when the}} whole of Britain was in a cultural cringe to them; and, of course, glamorous locations... Then, of course, there was the nail-biting tension of the rescues themselves..." [...] Film critic Kim Newman describes the series as a [...] "television perennial".|$|E
500|$|Euston's 1960s {{style of}} {{architecture}} {{has been described}} as [...] "a dingy, grey, horizontal nothingness" [...] and a reflection of [...] "the tawdry glamour of its time", entirely lacking in [...] "the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> occasion, <b>of</b> <b>adventure,</b> that the great Victorian termini gave to the traveller". Writing in The Times, Richard Morrison stated that [...] "even by the bleak standards of Sixties architecture, Euston is one of the nastiest concrete boxes in London ... The design should never have left the drawing-board". Michael Palin, explorer and travel writer, in his contribution to Great Railway Journeys titled [...] "Confessions of a Trainspotter", likened it to [...] "a great bath, full of smooth, slippery surfaces where people can be sloshed about efficiently".|$|R

500|$|Among reviewers {{who were}} {{negative}} towards the new installments was Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune. The reviewer {{wrote that the}} [...] "gloomy, underwhelming Universe seems to have ditched many of the elements that the previous [...] "Stargate" [...] shows had, notably camaraderie and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure,</b> without adding {{much in the way}} of narrative suspense or complexity." [...] The only characters she felt were [...] "worth following" [...] were Eli Wallace (David Blue) and Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle). Vince Horiuchi from The Salt Lake Tribune started the review with [...] "Syfy Channel -- is one of the worst displays of the genre on television," [...] and attacked the television series, [...] "Battlestar Galactica". Having no interest in the previous Stargate series' including the feature film, while not overall positive to the series, he said the cast and characters were a [...] "little more likable and interesting." [...] Reviewer Laura Freis from Variety magazine concluded her review with [...] "Sure, SGU is grittier, darker and psychologically deeper than previous versions. But so far, it's also a lot less fun." [...] While negative towards the show, she called Robert Carlyle an [...] "excellent" [...] actor. The Hollywood Reporter noted a lack of [...] "intelligent" [...] and [...] "surprising stories" [...] and was overall negative towards Stargate Universe, and even more so on the previous Stargate franchise releases.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} {{development}} process as smooth as possible, Hataya tried {{to work in the}} same environment as Sasaki so that they could exchange data more efficiently. The main tools and software used during development were Digital Performer and Pro Tools, which, according to Hataya, were the standard tools used in music production. In order to stress that the atmosphere of Journey of Dreams was centred around surrealism and dreams themselves, Sasaki discarded tying the game's music down to a single genre and took the approach of not having a clear musical policy. Sasaki also ensured that each theme included the exhilaration of [...] "flying in the air", as it was a core element of gameplay. Hataya echoed that the music of the game was produced by focusing on being able to empathise with the feeling of flying, as well as to exemplify the game's atmosphere and characters. Since the team were aware that Journey of Dreams had a greater <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure</b> than the original, the team knew that they could incorporate a larger variety of music into it so that players would enjoy a wider range of emotions. In addition to composing the music itself, Hataya took the responsibility of re-arranging Sasaki's music in different ways so that the theme matched the in-game situation. Hataya said that he and Sasaki produced around 70 percent of the game's music between them; the rest was produced by Sega's sound team.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} using an in-house multi-platform proprietary engine called ASKA (tri-Ace Superlative Knowledge-based Architecture), {{developed by a}} team led by Gotanda. The engine was in development since 2005 and was used for three different games in tandem: Resonance of Fate, Infinite Undiscovery and [...] While the staff were satisfied with its performance, it had to be customized for this game's specific needs. The engine employs multiple advanced graphics and lighting techniques, including high-dynamic-range rendering, and multiple layered shader tools to manage graphical layers and shadow effects. Motion blur effects were implemented using techniques {{similar to those of the}} second-generation CryEngine. Creating realistic blurring during camera movement was complicated by graphical inconsistencies generated by ASKA's structure. A separate graphics buffer system was designed to address the issue. Environments and characters employ a relatively low number of polygons in order to free up resources to render the main cast, whose character models use at least four times as many polygons as models in the PlayStation 2 era. The main characters' faces use 40 bones for facial movement and their hair use 250. This enables more detailed facial expressions compared to the [...] "doll"-like facial movements of earlier video game characters. Character hair uses additional shaders and layered textures to give it a lifelike appearance and behavior. The physics simulation was similar to that used for , but improved and expanded to suit the new hardware's capacity. There were minor differences between the graphical effects and performances of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 titles. Shadow and blurring effects were more sophisticated on 360. The estimated frame rate of 30fps was identical across both versions. The team managed to fit all the game's content onto a single disc for both versions while keeping load times short. This was due to the staff not wanting players to know when they had reached the halfway point, prolonging the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} deliberately {{made the}} titles vague, {{so that they}} are not associated with specific tales or voyages of Sinbad. However, in the epigraph to the finale, he does make reference to the <b>adventure</b> <b>of</b> Prince Ajib. In a later edition, he did away with titles altogether, desiring instead that the listener should hear his work only as an Oriental-themed symphonic music that evokes a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the fairy-tale <b>adventure.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In his Allmusic review, critic Mark Deming {{praised the}} album {{and many of}} the performances, but also wrote [...] "... the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{creative}} <b>adventure</b> and musical risk that was {{so much a part of}} John Fahey's music is largely missing, and a number of the guitarists here offer renditions that are so close to the sound and style of the original that they seem almost pointless except as a show of technique..." [...] and that it is [...] "a well-intentioned labor of love, but its polished surfaces lack the edgy textures that were so important to Fahey's work" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Dave Lynch awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "The Infinite {{is a strong}} debut release from Douglas' New Quintet. Those with tastes tending toward post-bop and pre-fusion jazz should find much to like here, with the album perhaps serving as an entry point to the trumpeter's more chance-taking endeavors". On All About Jazz C. Andrew Hovan said [...] "The Infinite is the record I've been waiting for Dave to make for some time now. It's not too left of center, has a drummer on board, and allows Douglas' own eclectic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> musical <b>adventure</b> to run wild".|$|R
500|$|Upon its release, Hasta la RaÃ­z {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Beverly Bryan of The Village Voice {{stated that the}} album [...] "casts a spell with deep feeling, and melodies and lyrics that linger in the mind. Elegantly adorned with subtle strings and velvety production, it {{has the kind of}} warmth people are always saying they can hear on old vinyl records". Bryan also predicted that this release would be recognized in the future as the singer's [...] "most profound and enduring statement". In another positive review, Natalia Cano of the magazine Rolling Stone Mexico, referred to the album as [...] "fresh and honest pop, a reflection of her musical maturity", reiterating that the album [...] "continues to place her {{as one of the most}} important composer and performer of Latin America." [...] AllMusic's Mariano Prunes gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars ranking, and on his review stated that [...] "these are extremely well-written songs in the spirit of the great Latin America romantic tradition of which Lara was a founding father, but infused with a contemporary perspective". Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday said that the album is one of the best pop releases of the year, praising Lafourcade's evolution as a musician, but was critical of Lafourcade for not having extended [...] "her comfort zone", since it is too early in her career to become settled in one type of music, [...] "and the proof is that the best album tracks are those where she is helped by Leonel GarcÃ­a, Torreblanca and MarÃ­a Daniela". An editor from Televisa EspectÃ¡culos wrote a mixed review, commenting that the album has to be listened to twice to [...] "fall in love with at least one song", comparing positively the title track with Lafourcade's work on her previous album (Mujer Divina) and the songs [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] with her album Hu Hu Hu, creating a [...] "mix of sounds" [...] on which Lafourcade shows all the things she learned after working with AgustÃ­n Lara's catalog. Lissette Corsa, of MTVIggy, stated that [...] "despite moments of darkness and heartfelt sadness, Hasta la Raiz bristles with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure</b> and optimism", and noted the influence of Chilean songwriter Violeta Parra in the track [...] "VÃ¡monos Negrito", as part of Lafourcade's [...] "eclectic artistry". Corsa also noted that the singer [...] "drew from Joni Mitchell, Charles Bradley, and Amy Winehouse".|$|E

2500|$|Down Beat critic John Ephland {{commented that}} [...] "there {{is indeed a}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure,</b> of taking chances with so much talent, and with such {{skeletal}} designs", adding that [...] "Big Fun reinforces the notion that Miles' primary contributions to music have come via orchestrating, organizing, enabling. How this music was put together proves to be as interesting as any solo or ensemble work [...] Incidentally, the digital sound quality is consistently high throughout".|$|E

The next offerings, Charles Vildrac's Le Paquebot Tenacity ("The Steamboat Tenacity") and Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e's Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement elicited both critical and popular favor. The story of two young men, SÃ©gard and Bastien, waiting for the S.S.

The hardships of the voyage are not dismissed, with counts of the deaths from scurvy, whose cure was not yet understood, and the problems of navigation without the precise knowledge of location gained by chronometers to measure longitude, depicted in detail.|$|R

[...] Romana first appears in The Ribos Operation, and was intended as a contrast to her predecessor, the savage Leela. [...] Romana is initially haughty and somewhat arrogant, looking down on the Doctor (whom she considers to be her academic inferior) and responding to his initial resentment at her presence with icy put-downs.

2500|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} of the book are the narrator, Sal Paradise, and his friend Dean Moriarty, much admired for his carefree attitude and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure,</b> a free-spirited maverick eager to explore all kicks and an inspiration and catalyst for Sal's travels. The novel contains five parts, three of them describing road trips with Moriarty. The narrative {{takes place in the}} years 1947 to 1950, is full of Americana, and marks a specific era in jazz history, [...] "somewhere between its Charlie Parker Ornithology period and another period that began with Miles Davis." [...] The novel is largely autobiographical, Sal being the alter ego of the author and Dean standing for Neal Cassady.|$|E
2500|$|Directed by Mark Lamos {{the cast}} {{featured}} John de Lancie as Felix Barriaux, Daniel Davis, Chris Henry Coffey, Bruce Bohne, Dana Slamp and Jennifer Regan. The Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote: [...] "...the play is still flailing in several directions and not wholly achieving its goals...The proposed crucifixion victim appears {{only as a}} glowing light. Despite eyewitness accounts of his human form, he may be divine or at least an inspired figment of the imagination, Miller suggests. He must decide whether to be crucified or to disappear. This is an interesting tangent, but it further removes the play from the nitty-gritty of the political realities that drove Miller to write. His continuing <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>adventure</b> at age 88 is awe-inspiring, but the play itself isn't." ...|$|E
5000|$|In September 2009, Lerche {{released}} Heartbeat Radio, {{to critical}} acclaim.
