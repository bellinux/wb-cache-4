50|$|A cone wrench or cone spanner {{is a tool}} used in bicycle {{assembly}} and maintenance to tighten and adjust the cones on a bicycle wheel. Cone wrenches are thinner and lighter than most other open <b>ended</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{that are used to}} work on bicycles. They should be used only for making adjustments to wheel's cones or for other applications such as centering brakes. Using a cone wrench in high torque applications such as loosening outer axle nuts may easily damage the wrench. Cone wrenches are typically about 2 mm thick, compared to approximately 7 mm for a standard open-ended wrench.|$|R
40|$|The {{tethering}} of sockets and wrenches {{was accomplished}} {{to improve the}} safety of working over motor segments. To accomplish the tethering of the sockets to the ratchets, a special design was implemented in which a groove was machined into each socket. Each socket was then fitted with a snap ring that can spin around the machined groove. The snap ring is tethered to {{the handle of the}} ratchet. All open <b>end</b> <b>wrenches</b> are also tethered to the ratchet or to the operator, depending upon the type. Tests were run to ensure that the modified tools meet torque requirements. The design was subsequently approved by Space Safety...|$|R

40|$|Variable gain IF {{amplifier}} (VGA) {{based on}} <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> and Gilbert Cell topology {{have been designed}} and characterized. A comparative investigation {{has been carried out}} between the two topologies. The source feedback topology has been used for the <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> VGA and for the Gilbert Cell VGA, the gain is controlled by steering the drain current. Overall dynamic gain variation range is 13 dB with a maximum gain of 13 dB for the <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> VGA whereas for the Gilbert cell VGA, it is 16 dB and 10 dB, respectively. The - 3 dB bandwidth is 4 GHz and the maximum value of 1 dB output compression is - 6. 2 dBm for the <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> VGA. The measured IP 3 is 8. 2 dBm referred to the output. DC power consumption is 75 mW. For the Gilbert Cell VGA, the - 3 dB bandwidth is 2. 25 GHz and maximum dissipated DC power is 100 mW. Maximum value of 1 dB compression point and IP 3, both referred to the output, are 2 dBm and 9. 87 dBm, respectively. Both the circuits were implemented on 0. 15 &# 956;m GaAs pHEMT technology. The active circuit area of Gilbert Cell VGA is 1. 7 mm X 1. 6 mm and the <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> VGA is 1. 3 mm X 1. 3 mm...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSwitching audio {{amplifiers}} {{are widely used}} in H-Bridge topology thanks to their high efficiency; however low audio performances in <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> power stage topology is a strong weakness leading to {{not be used for}} headset applications. This paper explains the importance of efficient error correction in <b>Single</b> <b>Ended</b> Class-D audio amplifier. A hysteresis control for Class-D amplifier with a variable window is also presented. The analyses are verified by simulations and measurements. The proposed solution was fabricated in 0. 13 μm CMOS technology with an active area of 0. 2 mm². It could be used in <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> output configuration fully compatible with common headset connectors. The proposed Class-D amplifier achieves a harmonic distortion of 0. 01 % and a power supply rejection of 70 dB with a quite low static current consumption...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany of CMOS SRAMs (like 8 T-SRAMs), DRAMs, {{non-volatile}} {{memories and}} TFET SRAMs use <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> read. Optimization of such sensing schemes is critical. Conventional <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> sensing requires either full discharge of bitline (BL) or voltage/current reference {{in order to}} use differential sense amplifier. There is speed and/or power penalty because of either full discharge of BL or complex sense amplifier using references. In this paper, a TFET negative differential resistance property based skewed inverter single-ended read scheme has been proposed. This sensing scheme detects read with less than 200 mV BL discharge with inverter based sensing. This results in simplified <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> scheme with speed and BL discharge similar to differential sensing schemes. Less than 400 ps read delay is achieved for 200 mV BL discharge at 1 V supply...|$|R
40|$|What is {{required}} for several agents to intentionally φ together? I argue that each of them must believe or assume that their φ-ing is a <b>single</b> <b>end</b> that each intends to contribute to. Various analogies between intentional singular action and intentional joint action show that this doxastic <b>single</b> <b>end</b> condition captures a feature {{at the very heart}} of the phenomenon of intentional joint action. For instance, just as several simple actions are only unified into a complex intentional singular activity if the agent believes or assumes that there is a <b>single</b> <b>end</b> that each action is directed to, so several agents’ actions are only unified into an intentional joint activity if each agent believes or assumes that there is a <b>single</b> <b>end</b> that each intends to contribute to. Influential accounts of intentional joint action, including Christopher Kutz's and Michael Bratman's, implicitly include this condition only if participants must intend to contribute to the end under the same conception. While such a requirement successfully rules out some counterexamples, it also makes the accounts unable to appropriately accommodate and explain clear cases of intentional joint action that they ought to be able to accommodate and explai...|$|R
