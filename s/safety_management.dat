5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's <b>Safety</b> <b>Management</b> System. The instruction was later rescinded.

40|$|Construction {{industry}} has {{for many years}} developed a very bad reputation for coping with project schedule, cost, quality and safety. Not only does construction industry deliver expensive buildings late, it contributes to disproportionate numbers of work-related injuries and fatalities as well. Project <b>safety</b> risk <b>management</b> is acknowledged {{as one of the}} techniques that can be implemented on construction projects to enhance performance of the construction contractors in South Africa. This research report investigates the use of project <b>safety</b> risk <b>management</b> by contractors, and evaluates the relationship that exists between project <b>safety</b> risk <b>management</b> and project parameters relative to schedule, cost, quality and safety in the construction industry in South Africa. The research report adopted empirical study in order to achieve the objectives. An in depth literature review was carried out in order to identify <b>safety</b> project <b>management</b> processes that can be used by construction contractors. To establish how project <b>safety</b> risk <b>management</b> is currently being implemented in the South African construction industry and its importance to projects parameters, a research question was developed based on the information from literature review. The research questionnaire was sent out to 101 construction contractors in the Gauteng province of South Africa. Fifty eight (58) contractors completed the questionnaire. The study has established that positive relationship exists between projects <b>safety</b> risk <b>management</b> and project parameters in the construction industry in South Africa. This study recommends that construction contractors in South Africa should proactively implement project <b>safety</b> risk <b>management</b> processes in order to improve projects performance. Furthermore, the study recommends that project <b>safety</b> risk <b>management</b> should not be implemented only during the construction phase by contractors, but should be implemented on all phases of the project cycle by all the stakeholders including clients and professional team...|$|R
