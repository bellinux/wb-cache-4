40|$|Ground {{hardness}} {{is deemed}} {{an important consideration}} for player safety for sports played on natural turf surfaces. Currently, a ground hardness measure is being determined using a Clegg hammer, with the suitability for play dependent on an acceptable reading. This study aimed to examine whether a relationship between Clegg hammer readings and ground reaction forces (GRF’s) generated by a human during a drop landing exist. Fifteen male community level Australian football players were recruited for the study. Participants performed a single leg drop landing on the right leg from a 45 cm box onto the force plate to record GRF’s. Ten trials were conducted for three conditions: no <b>shock</b> <b>pad,</b> thin <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> (15 mm) and thick <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> (50 mm) under a synthetic turf sample. Four consecutive Clegg hammer readings were recorded following each set of ten trials. Variables of interest were maximum vertical GRF (Max vGRF), maximum rate of loading (Max RoL) and Clegg hammer (CH) readings. Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient was conducted {{to examine the relationship}} between variables and conditions. Slight to fair relationships were found between the Max vGRF and any of the four CH drops (0. 181 ≤r≥ 0. 189; p ≤ 0. 01). This finding was similar to the relationship with Max RoL (0. 209 ≤r≥ 0. 217; p ≤ 0. 01). When analysed for the specific <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> condition, the relationships remained poor (r < 0. 1; p ≥ 0. 29), with the exception of the Max RoL and the CH readings on the thick <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> (0. 1 ≤r≥ 0. 2; p ≥ 0. 03). The results of this study show that the ground reaction forces experienced by a human on different levels of surface hardness are significantly different to the forces on impact of the Clegg hammer. Consequently, the Clegg hammer may not be the most appropriate device for relating surface hardness to player safety, thus it is possible that the Clegg hammer alone is insufficient in globally determining ground safety. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Test {{procedures}} and their accuracy in determining critical fall height (CFH) on sporting grounds are paramount to player safety. The procedure currently adopted for synthetic turf in Australian football [1] {{consists of four}} consecutive drops at various drop heights at three test locations on the sample. The quantity and packing of the infill in third-generation turf and the pooling effect of the rubber particles with consecutive drops suggests that the current standard protocol may need re-assessment. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} pilot study was to investigate whether current methods of testing for CFH are appropriate for third-generation synthetic turf or whether an alternative or adapted method needs to be developed. CFH was measured, using a HISUN Uniaxe-II Impact Tester, on 12 combinations of synthetic turf samples (four different products with three <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> options). Three conditions were investigated on each sample; the existing protocol; an alternative 12 single-drop protocol and four single drops from the CFH determined from the existing protocol. A significant difference was found for both absolute and percentage difference between the existing and 12 single-drop protocol, with p = 0. 001 and t = 4. 33 and p < 0. 001 and t = 6. 03, respectively. There was also {{a significant difference between the}} CFH reached with and without a <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> for both the existing protocol and the 12 single-drop protocol.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{three studies}} investigating biomechanical responses {{to changes in}} shoe-surface combinations in soccer. In the first study, six male participants (21. 7 [S. D. 2. 2] yrs, 74. 0 [S. D. 6. 9] kg [March], 74. 6 [S. D. 6. 9] kg (May), footwear size 10 - 11) performed running and turning movements on natural and third generation artificial surfaces whilst wearing different soccer specific footwear. This was performed at two {{times of the year}} where contrasting weather conditions were experienced. It was observed that there were significant differences when the natural and third generation artificial turf surfaces were compared. These differences however, were dependent on the type of movement, time of year and biomechanical measurement used. Each surface was also compared between the two test occasions. The main finding was that for both running and turning peak pressures and peak pressure loading rates were significantly greater in May (when the surfaces were mechanically hard) compared with the same surface in March. It was concluded that comparisons of third generation surfaces with natural turf are dependent on the specific properties of the surfaces and cannot be generalized for all such surfaces. A critical design feature of third generation surfaces that will influence biomechanical comparisons with other playing surfaces is the <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> layer. In the second experimental chapter, ten male participants (20. 9 yrs [S. D. 2. 5], 83. 2 kg [S. D. 7. 1], footwear size 10 - 11) were used to assess the effect of two different <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> densities (55 g and 65 g) (Arpro® Expanded polypropylene BF 2455 W, 24 mm S. D. 0. 5 mm thick, Brock International) on the lower extremity loading. These participants were also used to assess the biomechanical adaptations that occur with the inclusion of a 10 mm Sorbothane® heel insert or a Sorbothane® cushioning insole (Sorbo products division, Lancashire, UK), which have been associated with reducing overuse injury including that to the Achilles tendon. The footwear was also assessed for the risk of sustaining lateral ankle ligament damage. It was shown that whilst turning, peak impact force (taken using in-shoe pressure system) was significantly lower on the more cushioned <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> as was peak pressure at the first metatarsal. Likewise, the time to peak impact force was significantly longer with the heel insert. However, despite the association between the heel insert and reduced dorsi-flexion, no significant differences were observed for this measurement between the footwear conditions. Peak plantar flexion was significantly greater with the heel insert whilst turning suggesting an increased loading of the lateral ankle ligaments, although rearfoot inversion was not significantly different. This study demonstrated the potential role of <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> cushioning in providing protection from impact related injury in soccer, whilst cushioning inserts were not found to provide a protective effect. For heel inserts, the possibility of a negative influence on rearfoot stability was highlighted. It was suggested that the estimation of internal loads may reveal more regarding the specific role of cushioning interfaces and heel inserts in protecting from injury. In the final research chapter, nine male soccer players (83. 4 kg [S. D. 5. 8], 23 yrs [S. D. 3. 7]) performed running and turning movements for the same conditions described in study two. The peak plantar flexion moment, Achilles tendon force and average loading rate of these measurements, were used to assess Achilles tendon loading. Likewise, peak dorsi-flexion and eversion moments were collected to assess the lateral ankle loading. Group analysis did not reveal any significant differences in these variables. Individual data showed that the response to heel insert intervention was specific to the participant. Some participants exhibited a reduced Achilles tendon force or average loading rate, suggesting a reduced risk of injury with the heel insert. However, it was observed that eversion and dorsi-flexion moment and average loading rates increased in some participants, suggesting that these participants were at an increased risk of lateral ankle ligament injury with the heel insert. Likewise, one participant experienced significantly greater peak Achilles tendon force, also indicating a greater risk of injury to this structure. The overall conclusions gained from these studies are that the design of the footwear and playing surfaces are worth considering in the quest to reduce injury risk. It was also highlighted that the choice of <b>shock</b> <b>pad</b> density for a third generation artificial surface can be influential in the protection of the athlete even when the surface is new, particularly when turning. Finally, although the use of heel inserts has proven successful in the reduction the Achilles tendon injury, the lack of significant differences for group comparisons suggests that the mechanisms behind the success is still unclear. However, although heel inserts may prove useful in the reduction of Achilles tendon injury, the observation that significant increases in the measurements associated with acute ankle ligament damage and chronic Achilles tendon injury, suggests that heel lift may not be suitable for some individuals.

40|$|Background - Biphasic {{rectilinear}} shocks {{are more}} effective than monophasic shocks for transthoracic atrial defibrillation and for ventricular arrhythmias during electrophysiological testing. We undertook the present study to compare the efficacy of 100 J rectilinear biphasic waveform shocks with 150 J monophasic damped sine waveform shocks for transthoracic defibrillation of true ventricular fibrillation during defibrillation threshold testing (DFT). The second aim {{of the study was}} to analyse the influence of patch positions on the efficacy of defibrillation. Methods - 50 episodes of 14 patients (age ranging from 37 to 82 years) who underwent DFT testing were randomised for back-up shocks with either a sequence of 100 and 200 J biphasic waveform, or a sequence of 150 and 360 J conventional monophasic shocks. A binary search protocol was used at implantation and before hospital discharge. Patients were also randomised to an anteroposterior position versus a right-anterior-apical position. A crossover was performed between implantation and pre-hospital discharge for biphasic versus monophasic sequence as well as for the 2 different positions. Results - After failed internal shocks, 27 episodes were treated with biphasic, and 23 with monophasic shocks. The first attempt by the external device did not terminate 11 episodes (2 biphasic, 9 monophasic). The first shock efficacy was significantly greater with biphasic than with monophasic shocks (p < 0. 02). The overall success rate was 93 % with biphasic shocks and 64 % with monophasic shocks. In multivariate regression analysis including patch position, arrhythmia duration, type of waveform, testing order and session, only waveform was associated with successful defibrillation (p < 0. 02). Conclusion - For transthoracic defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation, low-energy rectilinear biphasic shocks {{are more effective}} than monophasic shocks. The position of the defibrillation <b>shock</b> <b>pads</b> has no influence on the biphasic shock efficacy, but anteroposterior pad position is more effective using monophasic shocks...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, {{railways}} {{offer the}} most prominent transportation mode in terms of traffic tonnage serving the needs of bulk freight and passenger movement. Ballast is an essential constituent of conventional rail infrastructure governing track stability and performance. However in recent times higher traffic induced stresses due to dramatically increased tgrain speeds and heavier axle loads have caused excessive plastic deformations and degradation of ballast. This seriously hampers safety and efficiency of express tracks, for instance, enforcing speed restrictions and effecting more frequent track maintenance. Installing layers of synthetic materials such geogrids and rubber <b>pads</b> (<b>shock</b> mats) in rail tracks can significantly reduce ballast degradation.

40|$|A report proposes {{the use of}} cold hibernated {{elastic memory}} (CHEM) foam {{structures}} to cushion impacts of small (1 to 50 kg) exploratory spacecraft on remote planets. Airbags, which are used on larger (800 to 1, 000 kg) spacecraft {{have been found to}} (1) be too complex for smaller spacecraft; (2) provide insufficient thermal insulation between spacecraft and ground; (3) bounce on impact, thereby making it difficult to land spacecraft in precisely designated positions; and (4) be too unstable to serve as platforms for scientific observations. A CHEM foam pad according to the proposal would have a glass-transition temperature (Tg) well above ambient temperature. It would be compacted, at a temperature above Tg, to about a tenth or less of its original volume, then cooled below Tg, then installed on a spacecraft without compacting restraints. Upon entry of the spacecraft into a planetary atmosphere, the temperature would rise above Tg, causing the pad to expand to its original volume and shape. As the spacecraft decelerated and cooled, the temperature would fall below Tg, rigidifying the foam structure.

40|$|Railways in Australia {{still play}} a {{significant}} role in the intrastate transport of passenger and freight. In recent years, the increased demand for heavier and faster trains has posed greater challenges to railway industry to improve efficiency and stability of track while decreasing track maintenance costs. The ballast layer plays a key role in governing the stability and performance of rail tracks. However, high traffic induced stresses always result in large plastic deformations and degradation of ballast, which in turn leads to significant loss of track stability. This problem becomes severe under impact loading because it accelerates the breakage of ballast particles. Therefore, understanding the complex mechanisms involved with the transfer of impact loads on the substructure and their effect on ballast breakage and degradation is essential when designing new tracks and rehabilitating existing ones. The field trial in Bulli (near Wollongong) demonstrated that in case of train with wheel flats, extremely high pressure can be transmitted to the ballast bed. Installing resilient mats such as rubber <b>pads</b> (<b>shock</b> mats) in rail tracks can lead to attenuation of impact forces and subsequent mitigation of ballast degradation. In view of this, a series of laboratory tests using a high capacity drop-weight impact testing equipment has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of shock mats.

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{transportation infrastructure}} has become utmost priority for global economic reforms. Railways {{are designed to}} provide high speed passenger and heavy haul freight transportation. Ballast is one of important constituents of the rail track however, it experiences excessive deformation and degradation from trains operating at high speeds. In addition, tracks built along coastal areas often undergo large settlements due to soft compressible clay deposits. This leads to progressive track deterioration and necessitates frequent and costly track maintenance. The use of artificial inclusions such as geogrids, geocomposites, shock mats and prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) is often an attractive design alternative for track practitioners. However performances of these inclusions are predominantly governed by their technical specifications in addition to geotechnical characterization of the track substructure including ballast and subgrade. Therefore, full scale field trials were conducted on instrumented track sections built along the south-east coast of Australia (e. g. Bulli and Singleton). The performance of geogrids and geocomposite was demonstrated in terms of specific key parameters such as stiffness and aperture size of geogrids, placement location of geogrids, as well as subgrade types. Placement of <b>shock</b> mats (rubber <b>pads)</b> in rail tracks has also lead to the mitigation of particle breakage. Empirical approaches to relate ballast strains {{with the number of}} load cycles are presented. Bearing capacity analyses of track substructure is discussed.

40|$|Rail track {{substructure}} (ballast, subballast and subgrade) is {{the most}} essential component of the railway system in view of track stability. The ballast is the largest component of the track substructure {{and it is the}} key load-bearing stratum packed with rock aggregates underneath and around the sleepers, thereby providing structural support against dynamic stresses caused by moving trains. However under large dynamic stresses exerted by heavy haul and high speed trains, the degradation of track substructure including ballast becomes significant. This in turn affects the track stability and creates frequent maintenance, thus increasing the life cycle cost of the rail network. Therefore, mitigating degradation of the ballast layer is vital in view of track longevity. In recent years, the use of resilient soft <b>pads</b> (<b>shock</b> mats) above the ballast (i. e. Under Sleeper Pad, USP) and below the ballast (i. e. Under Ballast Mat, UBM) has become a common practice. Many countries, including Australia have adopted the use of resilient pads in the rail track foundation. Currently, the studies on resilient mats are mostly limited to the reduction of vibration and noise. There is a lack of proper assessment of the geotechnical behavior of ballast when used along with shock mats. This paper provides an assessment of the triaxial behavior of the track substructure with and without shock mats under dynamic loading condition. A numerical model was developed based on the modified stress-dilatancy approach to capture the stress-strain and volume change behavior of ballast during impact loading. Model predictions are compared with laboratory results. It was found that the shock mats provide significant advantages in terms of reduced particle breakage and enhanced track stability...|$|R
40|$|All {{over the}} world, {{ballasted}} railway tracks form {{one of the}} major transportation networks designed to provide heavy haul freight and passenger traffic. However, large cyclic loading from heavy axle trains operating at high speeds often causes excessive deformation and degradation of ballast, as well as unacceptable differential settlement of compressible foundation and, or pumping of the soft subgrade soils. The problem becomes more severe under high impact loads due to rail or wheel imperfections, causing accelerated ballast breakage. A proper understanding of load transfer mechanisms and their effects on track deformations are essential prerequisites for minimising maintenance costs. The field trial at Bulli demonstrated that for trains with wheel flats, extremely high stresses were transmitted to the ballast layer. Installing resilient mats such as rubber <b>pads</b> (<b>shock</b> mats) in rail tracks can attenuate impact forces and consequently mitigate particle degradation. In view of this, a series of laboratory tests were carried out using a unique large-scale drop-weight (impact) rig to evaluate the role of shock mats. The field trial also showed that the moderately-graded recycled ballast, when used with a geocomposite layer, could perform well in comparison with traditionally uniform fresh ballast. Both Class A predictions and field measurements at Sandgate proved that relatively short vertical drains would be sufficient to dissipate cyclically induced pore pressures, curtail the lateral movements, and increase the shear strength and bearing capacity of the subgrade. In summary, this invited Special Paper describes in detail the large-scale laboratory tests imperative for material characterisation, fullscale instrumented field trials for performance verification, elasto-plastic finite element analyses for predicting the behaviour of tracks stabilised using shock mats, and geosynthetic products including grids and prefabricated drains...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{railways}} {{offer the}} most prominent transportation mode in terms of traffic tonnage serving the needs of bulk freight and passenger movement. Ballast is an essential constituent of conventional rail infrastructure governing track stability and performance. However, in recent time, high traffic induced stresses due to dramatically increased train speeds and heavier axle loads cause excessive plastic deformations and degradation of ballast. This seriously hampers safety and efficiency of express tracks, for instance, enforcing speed restrictions and effecting more frequent track maintenance. The problem becomes severe under impact loading because it accelerates ballast breakage. Therefore, understanding the complex mechanisms involved with the transfer of impact loads on the substructure and their effect on ballast breakage and degradation are essential for predicting the desirable track maintenance cycle as well as improving new track design. The measurement of track settlement is well established practice in conventional track monitoring systems, however, {{it is also important}} to monitor lateral deformations (parallel to sleepers) that affect track stability especially in the absence of sufficient confinement. Therefore, a field trial was conducted on a section of rail track in the town of Bulli (north of Wollongong City) to measure deformations and cyclic stresses. It was demonstrated that in the case of wheel flats, extremely high stresses would be transmitted to the ballast bed. Installing layers of synthetic materials such as rubber <b>pads</b> (<b>shock</b> mats) in rail tracks can lead to the attenuation of high impact forces and thereby mitigate ballast degradation. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of shock mats, a series of laboratory tests using a high capacity drop-weight impact testing equipment was carried out. The field trial further proved that the moderately-graded recycled ballast when used with a geo-composite layer was found to perform better in comparison to traditionally utilized highly uniform fresh ballast, with clear implications on reduced track maintenance costs and longevity. The results of large-scale direct shear tests also revealed that the appropriate application of geogrids significantly improved the performance of ballast. This keynote paper describes in detail, the results of large-scale laboratory testing of ballast and the observations from a full-scale instrumented field trial characterising the behaviour of rail ballast improved by shock mats and synthetic grids...|$|R
50|$|On December 12, {{the second}} attempt {{to launch a}} {{complete}} Titan (Missile C-2) took place at LC-16. One pad umbilical failed to detach at ignition, and an automatic shutoff signal terminated thrust before the missile could be released by the launcher mechanism. Ground crews quickly repaired the umbilical, and a second launch attempt was made two days later. Their relief at having avoided certain disaster on December 12 was short-lived when the Titan exploded {{almost as soon as}} it was released by the launcher mechanism. The mishap was quickly traced to the Range Safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off, as Martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibration-prone area during repair work on the missile. Testing confirmed that the <b>shock</b> from the <b>pad</b> hold-down bolts firing was enough to set off the relay. Because the RSO charges had spilled out the propellants and minimized mixing of them, the explosion was not as powerful as that of Titan B-5, and so damage to LC-16 was less extensive. The pad was repaired in only two months. On February 2, 1960, LC-19 returned to action as Missile B-7 marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage. On February 5, LC-16 returned to action by hosting Missile C-4. The second attempt at a Lot C Titan failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed, causing the RVX-3 reentry vehicle to separate. The missile pitched down and the first stage LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads, blowing the stage to pieces. After the first stage destroyed itself, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30-40 miles downrange. After the successful flight of Missile G-4 on February 24, Missile C-1's second stage failed to ignite on March 8 due to a stuck valve preventing the gas generator from starting. On July 1, the newly opened LC-20 hosted its first launch when Missile J-2, an operational prototype, was flown. Unfortunately, a broken hydraulic line caused the Titan's engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared. The missile pitched over and flew onto a near-horizontal plane when Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The burning remains of the Titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball. The piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrieved—it had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic pressure. The sleeve was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place, and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose. Examination of other Titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines, and the Missile J-2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing.|$|R
