5|$|Presumably a {{few days}} later, Katy has since made friends with a monkey and uses her <b>stiletto</b> <b>heel</b> to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, {{with the help of}} an {{elephant}} who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bikini top, a grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.|$|E

2500|$|Today, {{high heels}} are {{typically}} worn with heights varying from a kitten heel of [...] to a <b>stiletto</b> <b>heel</b> (or spike heel) of [...] or more. Extremely high-heeled shoes, {{such as those}} higher than , are normally worn only for aesthetic reasons and are not considered practical. Court shoes have conservative styles and are often used for work and formal occasions, while more adventurous styles are common for evening wear and dancing.

2500|$|The {{stiletto}} blade's narrow cross-section and acuminated tip reduces friction upon entry, {{allowing the}} blade to penetrate deeply. [...] Some consider the stiletto {{a form of}} dagger, but most [...] stilettos are specialized thrusting weapons not designed for cutting or slashing, even with edged examples. [...] Over time, the term stiletto {{has been used as}} a general descriptive term for a variety of knife blades exhibiting a narrow blade with minimal cutting surfaces and a needle-like point, such as the U.S. V-42 stiletto, while in American English usage, the name stiletto can also refer to a switchblade knife with a stiletto- or bayonet-type blade design. [...] The term in plural [...] "stilettos", is also used as slang for a long, thin, high heel (<b>stiletto</b> <b>heel)</b> for certain boots and shoes, usually worn by women.|$|E
2500|$|The heel is {{the bottom}} rear part of a shoe. Its {{function}} is to support the heel of the foot. They are often made of the same material as the sole of the shoe. This part can be high for fashion or to make the person look taller, or flat for a more practical and comfortable use. On some shoes the inner forward point of the heel is chiselled off, a feature known as a [...] "gentleman's corner". This piece of design is intended to alleviate {{the problem of the}} points catching the bottom of trousers and was first observed in the 1930s. A heel is the projection at the back of a shoe which rests below the heel bone. The shoe heel is used to improve the balance of the shoe, increase the height of the wearer, alter posture or other decorative purposes. Sometimes raised, the high heel is common to a form of shoe often worn by women, but sometimes by men too. See also <b>stiletto</b> <b>heel.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{pressure}} under a <b>stiletto</b> <b>heel</b> {{is greater}} than that under the feet of an elephant. Thus, as the very narrow <b>stiletto</b> <b>heel</b> became more widespread in the 1950s, the owners of many types of buildings became concerned {{about the effects of}} large numbers of such heels on their floors, especially in historic and high-traffic public buildings. Specifically, there was concern that the heels would either damage certain types of floor covering or cause minor accidents through heels getting jammed in floor-grills, the gaps in planking, or uneven surfaces. Soft outdoor ground also caused problems, affecting both the surface and the wearer. Wood flooring was the most vulnerable, but carpets, linoleum, and mosaic floors were also considered at risk of damage. Signs were frequently posted attempting to ban stiletto heels, though they were generally ineffective. A 1963 article in a US building maintenance magazine stated, [...] "Replacement of floors is estimated to have cost at least half a billion dollars throughout the country since the advent of the <b>stiletto</b> <b>heel</b> fashion." ...|$|E
