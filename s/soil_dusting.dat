Data processing was applied with combinations of multivariate statistical methods: factor analysis, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis. Moss’ responsiveness to the atmospheric distribution of the selected elements was investigated in correlation to the specific geology of the region (<b>soil</b> <b>dusting).</b> Lithogenic distribution was characterized with the distribution of three dominant geochemical associations: F 1 : Al–Li–V–Cr–Ni– Co, F 2 : Ba–Ca–Sr, and F 3 : Cd–Zn–Pb–Cu.

Four experiments with the NASA GISS atmospheric general circulation model, which includes a <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> aerosol model, are compared, all using a prescribed climatological sea surface temperature as a lower boundary condition. In one experiment, dust is included as a dynamic tracer with no radiative effect, whereas dust interacts with radiation in the other simulations. The single-scattering albedo of dust particles is prescribed to be globally uniform in the experiments with radiatively active dust, although this albedo is varied from experiment to experiment. On a global scale the radiative forcing by dust generally causes {{a reduction in the}} atmospheric dust load, corresponding to a decreased dust source flux. The dust source flux and its changes are analyzed in more detail for the main source regions. This analysis shows that the reduction varies both with the season and with the single-scattering albedo of the dust particles.

To estimate dust concentration and radiative forcing by dust more accurately, dust size distributions and dust single-scattering albedo in the model should be a function of the source region, because dust concentration and the climate response to dust radiative forcing are sensitive to dust radiative parameters.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effects of particulate matter contamination from cement kiln and <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> on peach leaf physiological characteristics and functions. Cement kiln <b>dust</b> and <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> were applied periodically during the summer 2009 in 'Royal Glory' peach trees (fruit harvested early July) located away from contamination sources. Dust accumulation on treated peach leaves and various leaf physiological parameters were measured periodically over the summer period until late September. Specific leaf mass increased and chlorophyll content decreased after harvest and remained unchanged over the summer due to summer heat stress or, most probably, due to low 'sink' demand. Leaf gas exchange functions significantly decreased in June due probably to soil drying and transition of the functioning root system from the whole soil profile to the drip irrigated areas only. Contaminated leaves progressively accumulated <b>soil</b> and cement <b>dust</b> over the summer. This contamination resulted in increased specific leaf mass and decreased leaf chlorophyll content compared to leaves from control plants (uncontaminated).

Using an experimental methodology which is sensitive {{to a wide range of}} ice nucleation efficiencies, we have characterised the immersion mode ice-nucleating activities of dusts (d < 11 μm) extracted from fertile soils collected at four locations around England. By controlling droplet sizes, which ranged in volume from 10 − 12 to 10 − 6 L (concentration = 0. 02 to 0. 1 wt% dust), we have been able to determine the ice nucleation behaviour of <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> particles at temperatures ranging from 267 K (− 6 °C) down to the homogeneous limit of freezing at about 237 K (− 36 °C).

The chemical and mineralogical compositions, particularly Fe mineralogy, in <b>soil</b> samples as <b>dust</b> precursors collected from North African dust source regions were determined.

Fe(psol) of the <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> samples were compared with calculated predictions of Fe(psol) based on the amount of individual Fe-bearing minerals present in the samples and Fe solubilities of corresponding standard minerals. The calculated Fe(psol) deviated significantly from the measured Fe(psol) of the <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> samples. We attributed this to the variability in properties of Fe minerals (e. g. size of Fe oxides and heterogeneity of chemical compositions of clay minerals) in <b>soil</b> <b>dusts</b> in comparison to the standard minerals. There were, however, clear relationships between the degree of chemical weathering of North African soils and Fe(psol). The Parker index and ratio of ascorbate plus dithionite Fe to total Fe ((FeA+FeD) /FeT) are positively and negatively correlated with Fe(psol), respectively. In addition, the ratio of FeA/(FeA+FeD), which decreases with aging of the Fe oxides, was found to be positively correlated with Fe(psol) in the <b>soil</b> <b>dusts.</b> Overall, our results indicate that there is a significant regional variability in the chemical and Fe mineralogical compositions of dusts across North African sources, {{as a result of the}} differences in chemical weathering and aging of Fe oxides.

In one experiment, dust is included as dynamic tracer only (without interacting with radiation), whereas dust interacts with radiation in the other simulations. Although the single scattering albedo of dust particles is prescribed to be globally uniform in the experiments with radiatively active dust, a different single scattering albedo is used in those experiments to estimate whether regional variations in dust optical properties, corresponding to variations in mineralogical composition among different source regions, are important for the <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> cycle and the climate state. On a global scale, the radiative forcing by dust generally causes {{a reduction in the}} atmospheric dust load corresponding to a decreased dust source flux. That is, there is a negative feedback in the climate system due to the radiative effect of dust. The dust source flux and its changes were analyzed in more detail for the main dust source regions. This analysis shows that the reduction varies both with the season and with the single scattering albedo of the dust particles. By examining the correlation with the surface wind, {{it was found that the}} dust emission from the Saharan/Sahelian source region and from the Arabian peninsula, along with the {{sensitivity of}} the emission to the single scattering albedo of dust particles, are related to large scale circulation patterns, in particular to the trade winds during Northern Hemisphere winter and to the Indian monsoon circulation during summer.

The IN produced by M. alpina seem to be proteinaceous, < 300 kDa in size, and can be easily washed off the mycelium. Ice nucleating fungal mycelium will ramify topsoils and probably also release cell-free IN into it. If these IN survive decomposition or are adsorbed onto mineral surfaces, their contribution might accumulate over time, perhaps to be transported with <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> and influencing its ice nucleating properties...|$|R
50|$|Mycobacterium boenickei is {{a member}} of the Mycobacterium fortuitum third biovariant complex. They are rapidly growing {{ubiquitous}} environmental organisms that normally inhabit <b>soil,</b> <b>dust</b> and water. These organisms frequently are human pathogens that cause a wide spectrum of clinically significant disease. It is important for practitioners to be aware of these organisms as possible etiological agents, as they are resistant to most first-line anti-tuberculous agents.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{efforts to}} {{quantify}} known emission sources of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (''dioxin'') generally {{have only been}} able to account for approximately 10 percent of the estimated deposition. The sources most often evaluated are direct emissions of dioxins from combustion sources. One of the unquantified sources often mentioned when explaining the discrepancies between the estimated emissions and deposition is reentrained dioxin-containing <b>soil.</b> <b>dust.</b> Based on available data on typical levels of dioxins in soil and air, we estimate that ''old'' dioxin emitted into the atmosphere by crustal material reentrainment could account for {{only as much as}} 4 percent of the ambient dioxin concentrations. However, because the <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> particles (d(p) > 2. 5 mu m) have much higher deposition velocities that the particles associated with fresh emissions from combustion sources (d(p) < 2. 5 mu m), this ''old'' dioxin could potentially account for as much as 70 to 90 percent of the total deposition of dioxin to environmental surfaces in urban areas, and 20 to 40 percent in rural regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The St. Michael Archangel's Church in Szalowa, Poland, was {{selected}} for closer investigation {{with respect to the}} indoor/outdoor air exchange and its influence on the air quality and work arts preservation. Chemical composition, size and abundance of particulate matter and concentration of gases NO 2, SO 2, O- 3 inside and outside the church were determined. To study seasonal variation of the weather condition (temperature, inversion level, wind direction) and the influence of seasonal sources of the air pollution (like heating of the nearby houses), samples were collected in winter and summer time. It was stated that suspended particulate matter inside the wooden church has in general an outdoor source. Several groups of particles were distinguished such as the organic ones, <b>soil</b> <b>dust,</b> nitrates and sulphates. In case of organic and <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> particles, the concentration inside was higher than outside. From the results, in comparison to literature data, one can conclude that accumulation of particulate suspended matter in the church is more intense than in other types of buildings. Gaseous pollutants were detected but their concentration was negligible...|$|R
40|$|Major ion {{concentrations}} and strontium isotopic ratios ((87) Sr/(86) Sr) {{were measured}} in rainwater samples {{collected at the}} urban site of Lanzhou, a city located on the Loess Plateau in the and and semiarid areas of northwest China. The rainwater samples possessed alkaline pH, at a reference level of 5. 6, {{with a range of}} 6. 82 to 8. 28 and a volume-weighted mean (VWM) pH value of 7. 70. The alkaline character of rainwater in Lanzhou is due to the result of neutralization caused by the alkaline <b>soil</b> <b>dusts</b> which contain large amount of CaCO(3). It was observed that Ca(2 +) was the most abundant cation with a VWM value of 886 mu eq l(- 1) (115 - 2184 mu eq l(- 1)), accounting for 87. 8 % of the total cations. Without considering HCO(3) (-), SO(4) (2 -) and NO(3) (-) were dominant among the anions, accounting for 64. 2 % and 23. 0 %, respectively, of the total measured anions. Using Na as an indicator of marine origin and Al for terrestrial inputs, the proportions of sea salt and non-sea-salt elements were estimated from elemental ratios. The precipitation in this region has typical continental characteristics. The Sr concentrations varied from 0. 004 to 0. 885 mu mol l(- 1), and strontium isotopic ratios ((87) Sr/(86) Sr) lay in the range of 0. 71025 - 0. 71302, with an average of 0. 71143. The (87) Sr/(86) Sr ratios of Lanzhou rainwater are higher than that of seawater, which reflects contributions from the radiogenic Sr sources of the aerosols. The most suitable candidate for the source would be the <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> originating from local and distant loess and desert areas. The (87) Sr/(86) Sr ratios were used to characterize different sources of base cations in rainwater, suggesting that the samples could be interpreted in terms of combinations of at least three components: <b>soil</b> <b>dust</b> derived from the Loess Plateau and desert areas in northwest China (with (87) Sr/(86) Sr similar to 0. 7130), seawater (with (87) 5 r/(86) Sr similar to 0. 70917), and anthropogenic inputs (With (87) Sr/(86) Sr similar to 0. 7103). The high (87) Sr/(86) Sr ratio and Ca and Sr content in the rainwater from Lanzhou {{can be attributed to the}} dissolution of calcium carbonate in <b>soil</b> <b>dust.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
