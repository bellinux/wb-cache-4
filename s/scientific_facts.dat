5|$|While riders queue {{they are}} shown three {{briefing}} videos featuring actor Renny Krupinski as a sinister man surrounded in darkness, who explains at length {{the physical and}} psychological effects of riding on Oblivion. Although based on <b>scientific</b> <b>facts,</b> his speeches are deliberately exaggerated with hyperbole and dark humour to give riders a sense of intimidation while preparing for Oblivion. The man remains unnamed throughout the videos, although the character was originally {{referred to as the}} Lord of Darkness during production. The final preshow video features a second character whose image appears inverted and therefore glowing white, who argues with the Lord of Darkness as to whether Oblivion is really safe for riders to experience; to which he is repeatedly ignored. The Lord of Darkness maintains that the ride is safe, before the video ends with the sound of his ominous laughter.|$|E

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{construction}} of a <b>scientific</b> <b>fact</b> as a special case of construction of reality. Bruno Latour is connected to this in several perspectives through which will this thesis capture his position. It describes his concept of science, originating from his laboratory studies, and its later embedding under the actor-network theory. In both cases, the emphasis lays on withdrawal from explanation through complex invisible forces, used by contemporary sociology. Latour refuses to explain a <b>scientific</b> <b>fact</b> through reference to outside world and society. According to him, attention should shift to the local and empirically approachable level. On this level there are collectives of human and non-human actors, who act together. Latour's conception of {{the construction of}} a <b>scientific</b> <b>fact</b> is put to test by the critique from sociology of knowledge. The strong program of sociology of knowledge understands the <b>scientific</b> <b>fact</b> as a joint product of reality and society. Non-humans (principally laboratory technology) {{play a key role in}} this dispute. Sociology of knowledge does not include them in their analysis, because they are not taken as social actors. Technology is on the other hand a core element in the construction of <b>scientific</b> <b>fact</b> in Latour's conception. Readers of this thesis will [...] ...|$|R

Distinguishing <b>scientific</b> <b>facts</b> and theories from pseudoscientific beliefs, such as those found in astrology, alchemy, medical quackery, occult beliefs, and creation science combined with scientific concepts, is part of science education and scientific literacy.|$|E

25|$|Dembski's {{views on}} {{evolution}} {{have been a}} source of considerable controversy within both the mainstream scientific and creationist communities. Dembski does not accept universal common descent. His mainstream scientific critics have accused him of dishonesty in his representation of <b>scientific</b> <b>facts</b> and writing, and he has also been criticised by the traditional creationist community for not supporting the young Earth creationist position, though he is also defended on other grounds by the same creationist community.|$|E

25|$|In a 2015 {{retrospective}} on Kuhn, {{the philosopher}} Martin Cohen describes {{the notion of}} the ‘Paradigm Shift’ as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that <b>scientific</b> <b>facts</b> are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.|$|E
25|$|Beyond academia, the {{endorsement}} of biological explanations of sex differences in intelligence {{has been associated with}} greater modern day sexism. In their research on the theorization of gender, Morton and colleagues found that people shown scientific claims that males and females are hardwired to be different, compared to those told that such ideas are under debate, expressed more agreement that society treats women fairly. Additionally, male participants became more supportive of sex discrimination at work after reading the <b>scientific</b> <b>facts.</b> Other research indicates that shifting the focus from biological to environmental contributors of behavior can decrease endorsement of sexist hierarchies.|$|E
25|$|The American Council on Science and Health {{said that}} denialism {{of the facts}} of climate science and of climate change, means to {{misrepresent}} verifiable data and information as political opinion. In that vein, anti-intellectualism puts scientists in the public view and so forces them to align with either a liberal or a conservative political stance. One third of Americans believe that climate scientists know about climate change, while fewer than one third believe that scientists know how to end global climate change. Moreover, 53 per cent of Republican politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives and 74 percent of Republican senators deny the <b>scientific</b> <b>facts</b> and the occurrence of climate change.|$|E

50|$|Scientific misconceptions are {{commonly}} held beliefs about science {{that have no}} basis in actual <b>scientific</b> <b>fact.</b> <b>Scientific</b> misconceptions can also refer to preconceived notions based on religious and/or cultural influences.

25|$|In January 2003, the DCSD {{released}} {{a ruling that}} sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of <b>scientific</b> <b>facts,</b> but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question. That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationism {{directly}} {{contradicts the}} scientific {{consensus of the}} scientific community. A 2006 joint statement of InterAcademy Panel on International Issues (IAP) by 68 national and international science academies enumerated the <b>scientific</b> <b>facts</b> that young Earth creationism contradicts, in particular that the universe, the Earth, and life are billions of years old, that each has undergone continual change over those billions of years, and that life on Earth has evolved from a common primordial origin into the diverse forms observed in the fossil record and present today. Evolutionary theory remains the only explanation that fully accounts for all the observations, measurements, data, and evidence discovered {{in the fields of}} biology, ecology, anatomy, physiology, zoology, paleontology, molecular biology, genetics, anthropology, and others.|$|E
25|$|The {{global warming}} {{controversy}} concerns {{the public debate}} over whether global warming is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its effects will be, whether any action {{should be taken to}} curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions. Disputes over the key <b>scientific</b> <b>facts</b> of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.|$|E

500|$|Wilderness {{protection}} and the conservation movement, led by {{figures such as}} John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, also began to appear at this time. By {{the turn of the}} century, those in favor of recreational ideals of nature began to clash with conservationists such as Muir. Likewise, critics and natural scientists became skeptical of what they saw as a growing cult of nature, which was thought to wrongly champion sentimentality and aesthetics rather than <b>scientific</b> <b>facts.</b> Sympathy for animals and their survival also became a developing thought in the 19th century, due in part to wide acceptance of theories pertaining to organic evolution. In 1837, Charles Darwin wrote in his diary that [...] "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all melted together." ...|$|E
500|$|As well as fiction, {{there were}} some non-fiction departments, {{including}} readers' letters (even in the first issue—Gernsback obtained letters by advertising the magazine to readers who subscribed to his other magazines), book reviews, and miscellaneous crime or science-related fillers. [...] The first issue included {{a test of the}} readers' powers of observation: it showed a crime scene, which the readers were supposed to study, and then posed questions to see how much they could remember of the details. [...] There was also a questionnaire about science, which asked about <b>scientific</b> <b>facts</b> mentioned in the stories, and a [...] "Science-Crime Notes" [...] section containing news items about science and crime. [...] Gernsback's editorial argued that science would eventually end crime, and suggested that both the police and criminals would make growing use of scientific innovations in the future. [...] Gernsback included on the masthead the names of several experts on crime, such as Edwin Cooley, a professor of criminology at Fordham University; he also listed members of his staff on the masthead with made-up titles: C.P. Mason, a member of his editorial staff, was listed as [...] "Scientific Criminologist", for example.|$|E

I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
