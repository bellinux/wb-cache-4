40|$|A {{longitudinal}} cross-over feeding {{design was}} used to investigate the relationship of dietary lipid composition to the membrane lipid environment and activity of mitochondrial ATPase in vivo. Rats were fed a polyunsaturated fatty-acid-rich <b>oil</b> (<b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil)</b> for 12 days, crossed-over to a monounsaturated fatty-acid-rich oil (rapeseed oil) for the next 11 days, then returned to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> for 11 more days. Additional rats were fed either <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> or rapeseed oil throughout. Rats fed rapeseed oil had lower rates of ATPase-catalysed ATP/[32 P]Pi exchange than rats fed <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil.</b> Arrhenius plots showed higher transition temperature (Tt) and activation energy (Ea) for rats fed rapeseed <b>oil.</b> Switching from <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> to rapeseed oil was dynamically followed by changes in the thermotropic and kinetic properties of the mitochondrial ATPase exchange reaction. Returning to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> reversed these changes. The rapid and reversible modulation of Tt caused by a change {{of the type of}} fat ingested suggests that membrane physicochemical properties are not under rigid intrinsic control but are continually modified by the profile of exogenously derived fatty acids. The studies suggest that in vivo the activity of mitochondrial ATPase is in part determined by dietary lipid via its influence on the microenvironment of the enzyme. The rapidity and ready reversibility of changes observed for this subcellular-membrane-bound enzyme suggest that dietary fatty-acid balance may be an important determinant of other membrane functions in the body...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{longitudinal}} feeding {{design was}} used to investigate the controlling influence of dietary fatty acids on the dynamic incorporation of fatty-acyl chains into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin in inner membrane of cardiac mitochondria. Rats were fed a polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-rich <b>oil</b> (<b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil)</b> for 12 days, crossed-over to a monounsaturated-fatty-acid-rich oil (rapeseed oil) for the next 11 days, then returned to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> for 11 more days. Additional rats were fed either <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> or rapeseed oil only throughout. Rats were killed serially. Regression analysis {{was used to}} represent longitudinal flux in membrane lipid fatty-acid composition occurring with change in dietary fat. The fatty-acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin was influenced by dietary oil in a reversible way. Maximal diet influence was achieved in the 11 -day cross-over period. <b>Soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> to rapeseed oil cross-over caused the fatty-acid composition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin to resemble that of rats fed rapeseed oil only. These changes were reversed by crossing back to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil,</b> indicating the dynamic state and short half-life of membrane phospholipid fatty-acyl chains. This report demonstrates {{for the first time in}} the whole animal fed diets adequate in all nutrients that subcellular membrane lipids rapidly respond to change in dietary fatty-acid balance. The system may be used to assess in vivo the significance of dietary fat in determining membrane physicochemical properties and biochemical functions...|$|R

40|$|Male C 57 BL/ 65 mice {{received}} a basal diet supplemented with 4 % <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil,</b> linseed oil or fish oil, {{in which the}} major polyunsaturated fatty acids were linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid and long chain omega- 3 fatty acids, respectively. Groups of animals were injected into the right flank with EL 4 -lymphoma cells, others with thymoma cells. Tumour implantation caused a gradual decrease in food consumption with both types of tumour, while body weight increased, especially in the EL 4 -bearing animals receiving the soya-bean diet. The weight gain was due to body water accumulation and was accompanied by decreases in body fat and minor changes in carcass protein and ash contents. The dietary treatments did not produce significant differences in tumour incidence and mortality, but tumour size was decreased by diets supplying omega- 3 fatty acids: in the EL 4 mice tumour weight was markedly depressed by linseed <b>oil,</b> compared to <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil,</b> whereas thymoma tumour weight was lowest in mice receiving fish oil and highest in the <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> group. Both types of tumour caused pronounced hypoglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia in the hosts, and the effect was modulated by the diets in the EL 4 {{but not in the}} thymoma animals: the plasma glucose level was especially low in the linseed oil group and relatively highest in the <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil</b> treatment. The degree of hyperinsulinaemia depended on the diet only in the thymoma-bearing mice, with linseed and fish oils producing higher insulin levels than <b>soya-bean</b> <b>oil.</b> A slight hyperinsulinaemia was also observed in linseed and fish oil-fed control mice. Serum triglycerides were elevated in tumour-bearing animals, without consistent differences between dietary treatments. Although no clear pattern emerged concerning total cholesterol and LDL levels, HDL values were strongly affected by the type of oil: in the control animals linseed oil caused an increase in HDL-cholesterol compared to the other two oils. The thymoma-bearing mice responded to the linseed and fish oil diets with greatly elevated HDL-cholesterol levels. The results point to important differences in the responses of the two implanted tumours and hosts not only to the omega- 6 and omega- 3 fatty acids, but also to the type of dietary omega- 3 fatty acids, namely alpha-linolenic acid and long chain fish oil polyunsaturated fatty acids...|$|R
