500|$|The RLI, meanwhile, was redeployed by Southey, and {{positioned}} to seal off likely escape routes from the gully. Ambushes {{were set up}} on each ridge and {{at both ends of}} the gully. At dawn four guerrillas attempted to break through a 3 Commando <b>stop</b> <b>position</b> at the eastern end; unfortunately for the insurgents, this ambush was headed by Commando Sergeant Major Al Tourle, a particularly aggressive soldier nicknamed [...] "Bangstick", whose men shot and killed all four. Southey then led 12 and 14 Troops on a sweep of the gully from the west and found that the ZIPRA fighters had vacated their position, leaving most of their equipment. Two cadres hiding in a cave opened fire on Southey's men and were killed. Two insurgent bodies were found, burnt by the Frantans. By noon on 19 July the area was clear; 10 guerrillas had been killed while the security forces had lost one and suffered six wounded. Headquarters was moved to Kariba while 2 Commando was brought in from Salisbury to assist in locating the remaining cadres.|$|E
2500|$|North American locomotives, such {{as those}} built by EMD or General Electric, have nine {{throttle}} positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency <b>stop</b> <b>position</b> that shuts down the prime mover).

50|$|There {{are three}} simple <b>stop</b> <b>positions</b> in the Romani language. These {{come from the}} Indo-Aryan and are {{maintained}} in every dialect of this language. The positions are as follows; labial /p/, dental /t/, and velar /k/. Along with these <b>stop</b> <b>positions,</b> there are also palatal positions which are unique to the Romani language. Specific voicing alterations have changed grammatical endings and different dialects have different ways of interpreting vowels. Some have morphed into newer versions of the Romani language and others have implemented other elements like screams.|$|R
2500|$|The {{short-range}} radios were reasonably {{light and}} very reliable; most importantly they {{were easy to}} use. In most cases headsets were not the first choice; a telehand was just tied to a shoulder strap. An extremely efficient form of radio speech known as [...] "voice procedure" [...] was used. Troopers were {{expected to have a}} high degree of self-initiative and reliance; case in point, if a stop-commander desired, the two riflemen would be detached to perform a mini-sweep or <b>stop</b> <b>position</b> of their own (and perhaps even an individual go off on his own). The introduction of the second radio in 1979 merely confirmed this practice.|$|E

5000|$|The {{causes of}} {{locomotive}} wheelslip vary, but the predominant factor {{lies in the}} power-to-weight ratios. Ideally, locomotive designs will have roughly equal power-to-weight ratios that enable smooth acceleration from a 'cold start', or <b>stopping</b> <b>position.</b> However, if {{the power of a}} locomotive vastly exceeds its weight, then an imbalance ensues which causes the violent spinning of the wheels through loss of traction.|$|R

50|$|Continuous-rotation servos are servos that do {{not have}} a limited travel angle, instead they can rotate continuously. They {{can be thought of as}} a motor and gearbox with servo input controls. In such servos the input pulse results in a {{rotational}} speed, and the typical 1.5 ms center value is the <b>stop</b> <b>position.</b> A smaller value should turn the servo clockwise and a higher one counterclockwise.|$|E
40|$|A new sensor {{provides}} an absolute position measurement. A schematic {{view of a}} motorized linear-translation stage that contains, at each end, an electronic unit that functions as both (1) a non-contact sensor that measures the absolute position of the stage and (2) a non-contact equivalent of a limit switch that is tripped when the stage reaches the nominal limit position. The need for such an absolute linear position-sensor/limit-sensor unit arises {{in the case of}} a linear-translation stage that is part of a larger system in which the actual <b>stopping</b> <b>position</b> of the stage (relative to the nominal limit position) must be known. Because inertia inevitably causes the stage to run somewhat past the nominal limit position, tripping of a standard limit switch or other limit sensor does not provide the required indication of the actual <b>stopping</b> <b>position.</b> This innovative sensor unit operates on an electromagnetic-induction principle similar to that of linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs...|$|R
50|$|In Botball, the {{electric}} DC motors are generally used for powering wheels. Using the Wallaby, however, {{they can be}} commanded to run at an accurate speed and stop at a precise rotational position. This is provided at the operating system level in the CBC by periodically sampling the EMF as the motor turns and adjusting the power. The user code only needs to specify the desired speed (and <b>stopping</b> <b>position,</b> if required) using motor functions.|$|R
50|$|Factory 4-speed or 5-speed {{transmission}} ratios {{generally have}} a greater difference between gear ratios and tend to be effective for ordinary driving and moderate performance use. Wider gaps between ratios allow a higher 1st gear ratio for better manners in traffic, but cause engine speed to decrease more when shifting. Narrowing the gaps will increase acceleration at speed, and potentially improve top speed under certain conditions, but acceleration from a <b>stopped</b> <b>position</b> and operation in daily driving will suffer.|$|R
5000|$|North American locomotives, such {{as those}} built by EMD or General Electric, have nine {{throttle}} positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency <b>stop</b> <b>position</b> that shuts down the prime mover).

50|$|Early dials {{worked by}} direct or forward action. The pulses were {{generated}} as the dial {{turned toward the}} finger <b>stop</b> <b>position.</b> When the user's hand motion was erratic, it produced wrong numbers. In the late 19th century, the dial was refined to operate automatically by a recoil spring. The user selected the digit to be dialed, rotated the dial to the finger stop, then released it. The spring caused the dial to rotate back to its home position during which time constant speed was maintained with a centrifugal governor.|$|E
50|$|A {{contributing}} factor was {{the failure of}} the express engineman to properly observe the train order signal at Shepherdsville. However the system (in which all signals were held in the <b>stop</b> <b>position</b> until an approaching train, within 600 yards of the signal sounded four short blasts to request the signal be cleared) was unworkable since, if the engineman fails to see the clearing of the signal, then he is required to stop at the signal; but high-speed trains such as the Flyer required considerably more distance than 600 yards to come to a halt.|$|E

25|$|Trains are {{programmed}} {{to stop at}} certain station positions with a precise odometer (accurate to plus or minus five centimetres). They receive their braking program and station <b>stop</b> <b>positions</b> orders (one-third, two-thirds, or end of station) from track beacons prior to entering the station, with additional beacons in the station for ensuring stop precision. The last beacon is positioned at precisely 12 turns of wheels {{from the end of}} the platform, which help improve the overall precision of the system.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considered}} the secured level crossing Signaling system and Train tracking system. This paper adopted a switching logic methodology {{to meet the}} challenges of the tracking system. This work also focused to map the train on the display screen. If the train moving close to the level crossing system the signaling system causes to release the green signal that causes to close the rail gate to avoid the unauthorized entry on the rail track. The open state of the gate is influenced by the signaling system by means of a ‘Red’colour signal. The train is allowed to move on the track only by considering the green signal. The rail track is organized with four <b>stop</b> <b>positions.</b> <b>Stop</b> 1, stop 2, stop 3 and stop 4. The locations of the train at various <b>stop</b> <b>positions</b> are sensed by using IR sensors. The detected signal is transmitted to the control room using RF transmitter operating at 433 MHZ. An Atmel micro controller is used to regulate the entire process to meet the desired state of the work. This proposed methodology had been successfully implemented on the 30 feet length of the scaled model of the rail track in the laboratory. The system results progressive response while tracking the position of the train. The results are recorded and analyzed. The proposed system may keep alert the monitoring mechanism. So, the collision of the train and unexpected human errors can be minimized...|$|R
