It contains an organ chamber and a vestry.|$|R
50|$|Among other characteristics, First Period {{houses have}} a steeply pitched roof; a {{slightly}} asymmetrical plan; and a central chimney. The first period house is distinguished from later houses by its exposed (often decorated or <b>chamfered)</b> <b>frame</b> in the interior. Some early windows in modest houses {{may have had}} no glazing, but the standard first period window, until at least 1700, was the diamond-paned casement. No example {{of this type of}} window survives in situ; all current examples date to (at the very earliest) the late 19th century. Multiple-light, sliding sash windows started to appear around 1700, and by about 1750 had supplanted the earlier type.|$|R
25|$|The <b>single</b> <b>chamfered</b> bay is {{particularly}} ornate, as it recesses slightly and then curves outward in a baroque fashion. At the ground floor, a wide, segmental arch opening with a hood-mould accesses secondary office space. At the upper level, a rectangular doorway is crowned by an intricate cameo with angel figures {{on either side}} of it. The upper level bay is framed by Tuscan columns which spring from a string-course at the baluster level and support a projection of the building cornice.|$|R

50|$|The precise {{load-out}} {{of tools}} may change {{according to a}} particular job's needs. The CAD stage is also optimised for turret punching: an operation such as rounding a corner may be much quicker with a <b>single</b> <b>chamfered</b> cut than a fully rounded corner requiring several strokes. Changing an unimportant dimension such as {{the width of a}} ventilation slot may match an available tool, requiring a single cut, rather than cutting each side separately. CAD support may also manage the selection of tools to be loaded into the turret before starting work.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in red sandstone, with a plinth, chamfered quoins, and other dressings in grey sandstone. The roof is slate. [...] It {{is a simple}} building, long and low. [...] On the west gable is a double bellcote. The church has five bays. On the south front is a single row of windows with round heads and a <b>single</b> <b>chamfered</b> mullion. In the westernmost bay is a door over which is a smaller similar window, but with no mullion. The door has a keystone inscribed with the date 1717, over which is a sandstone sundial with a plaque including the date 1766. The east window {{is similar to the}} windows in the south wall, but with two mullions. The north wall has two tiers of five windows; the lower windows have flat lintels, and the upper row consists of lunette windows.|$|R

This is a good little build¬ing, adding much to the town's seafront, and worthy of careful renovation. Happily the James Butcher Housing Association is now undertaking this work.|$|R

40|$|When PFCs have {{castellated}} structure, co-deposition of fuel inside {{gaps between}} castellated blocks {{is an important}} issue. Four different shapes of castellated tungsten blocks were fabricated to study corresponding issues in KSTAR: Conventional “basic” rectangular shape, <b>single</b> <b>chamfer</b> leading edge, double-chamfer and rounded edge, with two different poloidal gap distances of 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm. These tungsten blocks were exposed plasma of L- and H-mode discharges during a whole campaign in 2014. The blocks were taken out from the vacuum vessel after the campaign. Gap deposition was analyzed by Electron Probe X-ray Micro Analyzer (EPMA) to obtain carbon surface density (atoms/cm 2), and by Raman spectroscopy to identify chemical bonding structure of carbon deposits in gaps. The carbon surface density in toroidal and poloidal gaps was in a range from 0. 5 × 1015 atom/cm 2 up to 6. 7 × 1015 atom/cm 2. At the gap entrance, contribution of ions is 6. 0 – 6. 7 × 1015 atom/cm 2, decreased down to 1. 0 × 1015 atom/cm 2 {{at a depth of}} 0. 5 mm, and remains constant afterwards. The contribution of charge exchange neutral is about 3. 0 × 1015 atom/cm 2 at the gap entrance, and then gradually decreases as a function of distance from the entrance. Deposition in 1. 0 mm wide gaps show much larger deposition patterns and that particles have reached much deeper inside the gap. Raman spectra show that the intensity ratio I(D) /I(G) decreases from top to the depth of 5 mm indicating the increase of hydrogen contents...|$|R
50|$|The House is a Grade II listed {{building}} made of rock-faced limestone with ashlar dressings and steeply pitched Welsh slate roofs, with decorative ridge tiles. Ashlar coped gables with moulded kneelers and finials. North front entrance has central projecting gabled wing, with single storey, lean to, porch to the left. The doorway has a pointed arched moulded ashlar surround, with marble shafts, and hood mould. Above is a moulded ashlar parapet pierced with quatrofoils. To the right a 2-light chamfered window, with tracery, above a single plain sash, {{in a flat}} headed chamfered surround, with a pointed inner arch. Above again a 3-light, chamfered mullion window, with a taller central light with cusped heads. At the north-west corner a circular or 'candle wick' tower, of 3 storeys, the lower 2 storeys have 3 <b>single</b> light <b>chamfered</b> lancets, with quatrefoil tracery. The building stands in 4 acre of mature grounds with over 40 preserved trees.|$|R
50|$|The west {{verandah}} is {{approached by}} a central set of timber stairs. The corners of the verandah have been enclosed to the north for toilets and to the south for a small kitchen. Both enclosed areas open to the verandah. There are four timber casement windows to {{the west in the}} south corner and three timber casements windows to the west in the north corner. The open middle portion of the verandah has a timber handrail and two horizontal midrails and a <b>single</b> stop <b>chamfered</b> verandah post {{at the top of the}} stair. The west verandah has exposed stud framing and is lined with chamfer boards. There are three sets of triple sash windows to the centre with timber doors to each side and an additional timber door near the north enclosure. There are tilting fanlights above all doors. The panel and sheeted French doors to north of the windows are stop chamfered to the interior. Tusk tenon joints to the framing of the windows and doors.|$|R
5000|$|The design varies between makers, {{mostly in}} its details. Gimson's tables are {{considered}} the finest and the canonical example of the design. Their edges are heavily chamfered, a typically Gimson feature, which {{is derived from the}} finishing of the original agricultural tools. This chamfer also has the practical benefit for a table stretcher of reduced wear from feet on an otherwise sharp edge. Gimson's distinctive use of gentle stopped <b>chamfers</b> evokes the <b>framing</b> of Gloucestershire wagons. Gimson's tables also have their edges finished with bands of chip carving or sometimes with inlaid bands of light holly and dark bog oak. [...] Peter Waals produced the tables for some time after the death of Gimson and, as with many of his pieces, updated their Arts and Crafts detailing to follow the post-war fashions of Modernism and Art Deco.|$|R
50|$|Identified as {{standard}} type C/T2, Block C retains important fabric that identifies {{it as an}} early Department of Public Works design. It is a high-set, timber-framed building with a northern and southern verandah and a gable roof. Four sets of timber stairs provide access to the verandahs and the northern verandah is connected to Block D to the east. The walls are clad with weatherboards and the roof with corrugated metal sheeting. Both the gable end walls have a panel of ventilating weatherboards. The verandah walls are single-skin, lined internally, with <b>chamfered</b> stud <b>framing</b> exposed externally. The verandah walls have a ventilation flap at floor level and retain original double leaf doors with pivoting fanlights. The southern verandah retains a hat room enclosure at its southern end. The interior is partitioned into two rooms connected by a large opening; this partition is not of cultural heritage significance. The interior walls and ceiling are lined with v-jointed tongue and groove timber boards. The ceiling is coved and has a latticed ventilation panel. Timber tie beams at cornice level are exposed in the space. The fenestration pattern remains intact with windows only in the eastern and western walls sheltered by original timber hoods with timber brackets and battened cheeks. The northern verandah is enclosed at the western end. A small teacher's room projects from both verandahs. A small enclosure of the northern verandah accommodates a store room that is not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} date of {{this house}} is not known, but {{it seems likely that}} the oldest portion of the house was built about 1680 by John Kingsley, as a three-bay [...] "stone ender" [...] house. This is based on the presence of a basement only under the eastern three bays. Differences in roof construction and window placement on either side of the central chimney indicate different construction periods, although both parts of the main block exhibit First Period construction methods, including heavy timber <b>framing,</b> <b>chamfered</b> beams, and gunstock posts. The stairs of the staircase were made by splitting square-cut timbers diagonally in half, and there is a chimney tree consisting of a single square-cut oak beam 16 in in thickness. The rear leanto section was added before 1785, and the western ell is of 19th century construction. The house is probably the oldest in Rehoboth, and is one of its best-preserved 17th-century houses.|$|R
5000|$|The limewashed box-framed house, four bays long, {{sits on a}} stone {{platform}} {{built into}} the hillside, under a broad half-hipped roof (now replaced with tiles rather than slates, for which evidence {{was found in the}} archaeological excavations thatch). The principal timbers are tree-ring dated to 1460: dendrochronology has also provided dates of 1594, when a first floor was inserted within the hall, and 1631 when the internal timber-framed smoke-hood was added. [...] The restoration has retained the smoke-hood, but has otherwise restored the three-unit plan of storeyed units {{at either end of the}} open, aisled hall. The two trusses within the hall are a <b>single</b> pair of <b>chamfered</b> wooden speres or posts set in the floor and forming a box-frame which carries the roof, and a pair of arch-braced base-crucks with two tiers of cusped struts above the tie-beam, which spanned the whole width of 7.5 m. The analogies are with the partly aisled halls of important houses in north-east Wales and north-west England. Gable and partition trusses, also aisled. Wind-braces were employed both below the wall-plate and along the purlins ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} was to gather the outcomes of zirconia single crowns made by 16 members of the Italian Academy of Prosthetic Dentistry (AIOP) over a time period of up to 5 years. Materials and Methods: A total of 398 patients treated in private practices with 1, 132 zirconia-based single-crown restorations made on natural teeth from January 2005 to July 2010 were included. Three hundred forty-three anterior restorations (30. 3 %) and 789 posterior crowns (69. 7 %) were made with 16 types of zirconia, using primarily chamfer or knife-edge tooth preparation, and examined according to the esthetic, functional, and biologic criteria. To evaluate the relationship of parafunction with mechanical failure, patients with clenching or bruxism were not excluded from the study group. Results: The cumulative survival rate of all restorations was 98. 1 %, while the cumulative success rate was 94. 3 %. Functional criteria had the highest number of failures. The odds ratio (OR) for all restorations was calculated to clarify the relationship between patients who were subject/not subject to parafunctions and technical complications; the OR was 2. 60. An association between parafunction and mechanical failure was found in patients with severe parafunction. Conclusions: Porcelain-veneered zirconia <b>single</b> crowns with <b>chamfer</b> and knife-edge preparations showed good clinical results over a period of up to 5 years. Technical complications were few and were limited primarily to patients with parafunction. © 2013 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fracture strength of teeth with different cavosurface margin cavity preparations and restored with composite resin and different adhesive systems.

D.; G 3 - Single Bond sem bisel; G 4 - Single Bond com bisel reto; G 5 - Single Bond com bisel chanfrado; G 6 - Clearfil SE Bond sem bisel; G 7 - Clearfil SE Bond com bisel reto e G 8 - Clearfil SE Bond com bisel chanfrado. Os grupos 3 - 8 foram restaurados com resina composta Z 250, pela técnica incremental. Os corpos-de-prova foram submetidos ao teste de resistência à fratura em máquina {{universal}} de ensaios, a uma velocidade de 0, 5 mm/min. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente pelos testes ANOVA, Tukey e exato de Fisher (α= 0, 05). O grupo 2 apresentou resistência inferior aos demais e o grupo 4 mostrou-se mais resistente à fratura do que os demais grupos (p< 0, 05). Concluiu-se que o bisel reto foi o preparo mais efetivo quando associado a adesivos dentinários com condicionamento ácido prévio.
