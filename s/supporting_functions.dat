However, in the early 1990s then–Commander in Chief of U.S. Special Operations Command, General Carl Stiner identified both Delta Force and SEAL Team Six as permanently assigned special missions units in congressional testimony and public statements. In 1998 Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Walter B.

40|$|The <b>support</b> <b>function</b> of a free-form-surface {{is closely}} related to the {{implicit}} equation of the dual surface, and the process of computing both the dual surface and the <b>support</b> <b>function</b> can be seen as dual implicitization. The <b>support</b> <b>function</b> can be used to parameterize a surface by its inverse Gauss map. This map makes it relatively simple to study isophotes (which are simply images of spherical circles) and offset surfaces (which are obtained by adding the offsetting distance to the <b>support</b> <b>function).</b> We present several classes of surfaces which admit a particularly simple computation of the dual surfaces and of the <b>support</b> <b>function.</b> These include quadratic polynomial surfaces, ruled surfaces with direction vectors of low degree and polynomial translational surfaces of bidegree (3, 2). In addition, we use a quasi-interpolation scheme for bivariate quadratic splines over criss-cross triangulations in order to formulate a method for approximating the <b>support</b> <b>function.</b> The inverse Gauss maps of the bivariate quadratic spline surfaces are computed and used for approximate isophote computation.

Multi-site <b>support</b> <b>functions,</b> {{which are}} linear combinations of pseudo-atomic orbitals on a target atom and those neighbours within a cutoff, have been recently proposed {{to reduce the}} number of <b>support</b> <b>functions</b> to the minimal basis while keeping the accuracy of a large basis [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2014, 10, 4813]. The coefficients were determined by using the local filter diagonalization (LFD) method [Phys. Rev. B, 2009, 80, 205104]. We analyse the effect of numerical optimization of the coefficients produced by the LFD method. Tests on crystalline silicon, a benzene molecule and hydrated DNA systems show that the optimization improves the accuracy of the multi-site <b>support</b> <b>functions</b> with small cutoffs.
