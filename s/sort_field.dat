50|$|This {{hierarchy}} {{is used as}} {{the physical}} order of records in storage. Record access is done by navigating downward through the data structure using pointers combined with sequential accessing. Because of this, the hierarchical structure is inefficient for certain database operations when a full path (as opposed to upward link and <b>sort</b> <b>field)</b> is not also included for each record. Such limitations have been compensated for in later IMS versions by additional logical hierarchies imposed on the base physical hierarchy.|$|E
50|$|In a {{hierarchical}} model, data is organized into a tree-like structure, implying {{a single parent}} for each record. A <b>sort</b> <b>field</b> keeps sibling records in a particular order. Hierarchical structures were widely used in the early mainframe database management systems, such as the Information Management System (IMS) by IBM, and now describe the structure of XML documents. This structure allows one one-to-many relationship between two types of data. This structure is very efficient to describe many relationships in the real world; recipes, table of contents, ordering of paragraphs/verses, any nested and sorted information.|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} passive optical sorting of plasmon nanoparticles {{and explore}} the trajectories of nanoparticles in <b>sorting</b> <b>fields</b> with the optimal wavelength and the optimal beam shape. The optimal wavelength is determined from speed difference to temperature increase ratio of the system. The optimal beam shape for arbitrary size of sorting region is determined using the force optical eigenmode (FOEi) method.

50|$|Vayreda is {{typically}} {{identified as a}} landscape painter or as a costumbrista, though his works fall into four major topic categories: landscapes, religion, history and customs, often combining some {{if not all of}} the above. Landscapes are deeply set in the hilly Alt Garrotxa ambience, presenting local rural countryside with meticulous and accurate description. Featuring sunlighted <b>sorted</b> <b>fields</b> and wooded mountains they avoid any sign of decay or derangement. Despite what is described as their realism, they deliver impression of perfect natural order; due to neat and clean landscape contemporaries compared them to Japanese drawings. Some value his landscapes higher than those of his brother Joaqu√≠m, others deem them inferior. In a number of paintings landscape is the setting for local rural scenes, always scrupulously implanted in local customs and never containing a tiny hint of discord.Religious and historical scenes are often presented in medieval architectural setting, usually also related to Alt Garrotxa; it is reproduced with competent attention to detail, though at times also with some creativity. Historical paintings, tending to be academic in style, often reveal a sophisticated factual context; they tend to focus on medieval history of Spain, however initially Vayreda painted works also related to the Third Carlist War. Religious works, usually designed for private use or for local sanctuaries, reveal references - at times bordering quotations - to Italian Quattrocento; contemporaries valued them for color and chiaroscuro refinement, today they are appreciated for composition and context.|$|R
