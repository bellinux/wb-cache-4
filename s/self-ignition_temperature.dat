40|$|International audienceEvaluation of {{self-ignition}} hazard of {{bulk materials}} requires experimental determination of self-ignition temperatures {{as a function}} of volume. There are two standardised methods : determination of the <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of dust samples in oven and measurement of the <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of a dust layer deposited on a hot surface. Sometimes, the sample behaviour during these tests makes the second method difficult to apply. The self-ignition phenomena in these two tests rely on the same principles. Their results are interpreted with the help of theoretical relations. The correlation described in this paper can be considered acceptable to deduce <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of a dust layer, based on results of self-ignition of the same dust in heating ovens, if the Biot number (alpha) can be estimated. Uncertainty on the correlation is near 30 K. This uncertainty is on the same order of magnitude as the difference in the <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> on a hot surface for thickness between 5 and 15 mm...|$|E

The apparatus used {{was similar to the}} one described by the 79 / 831 European Commission Directive for measuring the relative <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> (minimum ambient temperature at which a certain volume of a substance ignites under defined conditions). The forest materials examined were: Cupressus sempervirens (Italian cypress), Olea europaea (Olive tree), Pinus brutia (Calabrian pine), Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine), Pistacia lentiscus (Mastic tree), Quercus coccifera (Holly oak). These species are very common in the Mediterranean region and frequently devastated by forest fires. The relative data determined (<b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature,</b> ignition delay times, combustion duration, etc.) provide a simple screening test on the fire hazard properties of forest species, which could be used for comparison purposes. Among the forest species examined, Pinus brutia had the highest relative ignition temperature and the longest ignition delay time, while Pistacia lentiscus had the lowest and shortest ones. Also, Quercus coccifera and Pistacia lentiscus had the highest heat content and Olea europaea the lowest one. Finally, Cupressus sempervirens was the most combustible and Pinus halepensis the most sustainable fuel. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|E

In this work, we develop a numerical method, using the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics, to investigate self-ignition behaviour of coal dust accumulations with a main emphasis on the roles of oxygen, diluent gas and dust volume. A one-step 2 nd-order reaction kinetic model consid- ering both coal density and oxygen density is used to estimate reaction rate using the kinetic parameters from previously conducted hot-oven tests. This model is validated to predict the transient temperature and concentration profiles of South African coal dusts until ignition. The computed self-ignition temperatures of dust volumes show a good agreement with experimental results. In addition, it is found that the inhibiting effect of carbon dioxide is comparatively small and oxygen consumption increases dramatically after ignition. Parameter analysis shows that the heating value and kinetic parameters have a comparatively pronounced effect on <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature.</b> The model provides a satisfactory explanation for the dependence of self-ignition behaviour on gas atmospheres, thus helping to further understand the fire risk of self-ignition in oxy-fuel combustion systems. status: publishe...|$|E

Autoignition of the combustible mixture can occur only upon reaching the characteristic <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> Tz. It should take place during (near end) the load compression. In order to achieve the fuel mixture ignition temperature Tz in the system, usually it is proposed adjusting the engine compression ratio,H. However, it is quite cumbersome especially in case of frequent changes of engine load (there are also difficulties with the precise advance angle adjusting of fuel mixture ignition). According to our conception, the other method of autoignition adjustment can be successfully applied. The essence of the new idea consists in proper selection, according to engine load, of the exponent N of charge polytropic compression. Introducing the defined dose of monoatomic gas (e. g. argon Ar, N | 1. 667) to air-fuel mixture, the higher values of the polytropic compression exponent N of working medium can be achieved.

Eight Spanish plants located in Madrid, Barcelona and Málaga were considered and several sludge samples were taken in different seasons. The base for the assessment of the spontaneous ignition behaviour of dust accumulations is the experimental determination of the <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> under isothermal conditions. Self-ignition temperatures at four volumes were obtained for one sample of sewage sludge, allowing their extrapolation to large storage facilities. A simple test method, based also on an isothermal study of samples, is the UN classification of substances liable to spontaneous combustion. Two different samples were so tested, obtaining unlike results if transported in packages of different volumes. By means of thermogravimetric techniques it is possible to analyse the thermal susceptibility of dried sewage sludge. Apparent activation energy can be obtained from the rate of weight loss. It is also applied to the study of self-ignition susceptibility by modifying test conditions when oxygen stream is introduced. As a consequence of this oxidant contribution, sample behaviour can be very different during testing and a step drop or sudden loss of weight is observed at a characteristic temperature for every substance, associated to a rapid combustion. Plotting both the activation energy and the characteristic temperature, a map of self-ignition risk was obtained for 10 samples, showing different risk levels for samples taken in different locations and at different seasons.

A promising solution is storing hydrogen in the form of ammonia that is liquid at roughly 9 bar at environmental temperature and therefore involves relatively small volumes and requires light and low-cost tanks.

As a matter of fact, the best (and carbon-free!) promoter is hydrogen, which has very high combustion velocity and wide flammability range, whereas ammonia combustion is characterised by low flame speed, low flame temperature, narrow flammability range (combustion is impossible if mixture is just slightly lean), high ignition energy and high <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature.</b> The experimental activity shown in the paper was aimed at determining proper air-ammonia-hydrogen mixture compositions for the actual operating conditions of a twin-cylinder 505 cm 3 S.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. Combustion processes are essential for power generation, since {{an overwhelming majority of}} energy-producing devices rely on the combustion of fossil or renewable fuels. Thus the development of a combustion technology able to accomplish improvement of efficiency with reduction of pollutant emissions, such as NOx, is a main concern. MILD combustion is one of the promising techniques proposed to achieve these goals. In this combustion regime the reactants are preheated above the <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> and enough inert combustion products are entrained in the reaction region. As a result, the characteristic times of chemical kinetics and turbulent mixing are comparable and the combustion region is no longer identifiable in a flame front but extended over a wide region, so that MILD combustion is often denoted as flameless combustion. Importantly, pollutants emissions can easily reduce because of the small temperature difference between burnt and unburnt and of the lean conditions in the combustion chamber. In this work Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of a Hydrogen/Air burner operating in the MILD combustion regime is performed. Turbulent mixing controls most of the global flame properties, so computing large scale structures by means of LES is an important key to capture mixing properties. The filtered mass, momentum, energy and species equations are discretized with a 2 nd order accurate central finite difference scheme over a cylindrical non-uniform grid. Unclosed terms due to subgrid-scales are modeled using a fractal model approach (FM). Radiant transfer of energy is taken into account.

In this paper, a typical palm oil mill with annual capacity of 300, 000 ton oil palm production and 3 MW electricity demand is considered as a pilot plant and feasibility of power generation by POME biogas is modeled by Aspen Plus considering flameless mode in combustion system. A new design of lab-scale flameless reactor called self-preheated flameless combustion (SPFC) system is presented and employed in power generation modeling. In SPFC system, the flameless chamber is employed as a heater to preheat an oxidizer over the <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of the fuel. A helical stainless steel pipe (called self-preheating pipe) is installed inside the chamber to conduct the oxidizer from exhaust zone to the combustion zone inside the chamber and preheat oxidizer.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} scientific studies exploring the oxidation chemistry of carbon disulfide (CS 2) and its interaction with hydrocarbons in combustion systems. The results illustrate the extreme flammability of CS 2 even at low temperature (<b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> at 363 K under ambient pressure). The thesis proposes a comprehensive oxidation mechanism that works {{over a wide range}} of atmospheric and combustion conditions with and without moisture. The thesis also provides experimental validation on the promotion of CS 2 on the ignition of methane. Experiments involving CS 2 oxidation in combustion processes have been conducted with tubular-flow (TFR) and jet-stirred (JSR) reactors to provide experimental validation for the proposed mechanism. Online Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy served to identify and quantitate the product species and to obtain the detailed species conversion profiles during the combustion process. Low ignition temperature of CS 2 of 860 K in TFR and 710 K JSR, with residence time at 0. 3 s under ambient pressure, implies the extreme flammability of CS 2. The presence of moisture exhibits no effect on the oxidation of CS 2 for ignition temperature and species profile at below 1100 K, although moisture converts CO into CO 2 at higher temperature (> 1200 K). Co-oxidation experiments of CH 4 /CS 2 /O 2 in JSR illustrate the promotion effect of CS 2 on the ignition of methane. Quantum calculations afford the investigation of primary steps governing the OH-initiated oxidation of CS 2 in the atmosphere. We also propose a comprehensive oxidation mechanism of CS 2 in combustion systems. The thesis suggests the intersystem crossing (ISC) between triplet and singlet pathways to explain the extreme flammability of CS 2, in analogy to the controlling steps operating for other reduced sulfur species. DFT calculations examine the interplay between the SH radical and C 1 - C 4 hydrocarbons to demonstrate the distinct inhibition and promotion effects of H 2 S/SH on alkanes and alkenes/alkynes in pyrolysis processes.

Today hydrogen can be compressed and stored at 200 or 350 bar (it is foreseen that in a near future storage pressure will reach 700 bar, according to new expected regulations and using tanks in composite materials) or cryogenically liquefied. An alternative solution is storing hydrogen in the form of ammonia that is liquid at roughly 9 bar at environmental temperature and therefore involves relatively small masses and volumes and requires light and low-cost tanks. Moreover, ammonia contains almost 18 % hydrogen by mass and, by volume, liquid ammonia contains 1. 7 times as much hydrogen as liquid hydrogen. It is well known that ammonia can be burned directly in I. C. engines, however a combustion promoter is necessary to support combustion especially in the case of high-speed S. I. engines. Among the potential promoters, {{hydrogen is}} worthy of note, since it is carbon free and counteracts ammonia combustion characteristics. As a matter of fact, hydrogen has high combustion velocity and wide flammability range, whereas ammonia combustion is characterized by low flame speed, low flame temperature, narrow flammability range, high ignition energy and high <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature.</b> The experimental activity shown in this paper is correlated with a project that is focused on a range-extended electric vehicle involving an ammonia-plus-hydrogen I. C. engine and where hydrogen is obtained from ammonia by means of on-board catalytic reforming. Accordingly, the test engine is a 505 cm₃ Lombardini twin-cylinder S. I. engine that is well suited to power the onboard electric generator and the activity is aimed at determining proper air-ammonia-hydrogen mixture compositions at actual operating speeds and loads of the engine connected to the electric generator. Hydrogen and ammonia are separately injected in the gaseous phase. The only mechanical modification of the engine involves the intake manifold, where electro-injectors for hydrogen and for ammonia (conventional ones for CNG application with appropriate modification to inner parts) are added to the original ones for gasoline. The experimental results confirm that it is necessary to add hydrogen to air-ammonia mixture to improve ignition and to increase combustion velocity, with ratios that depend mainly on load and less on engine speed. Brake power is less than with gasoline, due to mixture poor volumetric heating value and to ammonia low flame speed that penalizes engine brake thermal efficiency.

40|$|Improvements in engine {{efficiency}} {{are necessary for}} the advancement of modem engine technology. Fuels and lubricants used in internal combustion (IC) engines {{play an important role in}} governing the {{engine efficiency}}. In IC engines some amount of fuel spray can eventually end up on the cylinder liner. This fuel spray mixes with the oil (lubricant) present on the liner. Now the liquid layer on the liner consists of fuel and oil (fuel-oil film is formed) which interacts with the piston rings and the up-scraping of the fuel-oil film can cause the release of oil droplets into the combustion chamber. The released oil droplets lower the <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of the fuel vapor which might lead to pre-ignition. Pre-ignition is a phenomenon in which the fuel vapor ignites before the spark plug fires causing huge pressure rise which can be detrimental for the engine. The fuel spray on the liner can also pass through the piston rings during the compression stroke and can cause oil dilution in the crank case. The current work is mainly focused on analyzing the fuel-oil interaction on the cylinder liner. A numerical model has been developed in which fuel was modeled as a mixture of 10 hydrocarbon components and oil was modeled as a single n-alkane hydrocarbon. In this model, diffusion in the film, heat transfer in the film, and vaporization at the film-air interface have been coupled. Moving boundary (due to vaporization) was handled by solving the time required to remove the outermost layer while utilizing regular meshing. Implicit method and Newton's iteration method were used to ensure numerical stability and efficiency. Eventually the model calculates the remaining mixture thickness and content before the piston comes back to the specified location in the compression stroke. Some of the main inputs to the model are timing and location of the fuel droplets depositing on the liner, initial fuel film thickness, initial oil film thickness, liner temperature, and cylinder gas pressure. The results showed that with typical engine operational parameters, substantial portion of the initial film mixture still remains when the piston comes back if the initial fuel film thickness is in the range of 20 pm. Further studies were made to examine the consequences of the remaining mixture on the liner. A brief quantitative study was performed to compare the fuel-oil scraped volume and crevice volume. Additionally, the increase in ring-liner contact force due to local oil dilution on the liner was examined using an existing ring-liner lubrication model. by Vinayak Teja Kalva. Thesis: S.

40|$|Dust {{accumulation}} including dust {{volume and}} dust layer often occurs in coal mills and power plants. Once {{in contact with}} the oxidant and a mild heat source, the accumulated dust may self-heat to initiate smouldering fires, which can further generate hot spots to trigger dust explosion. However, {{little is known about the}} combined effect of and CO 2 diluent gas on self-ignition characteristics and subsequent smouldering combustion behaviour. In the first phase of this dissertation, experimental materials including three different coal dust samples and gas atmospheres (both air and O 2 /CO 2 mixtures) are presented. The standardized experimental apparatuses including hot-oven test (European norm EN 15188) and hot-plate test (European norm EN 50281 - 2 - 1) are elaborately introduced to determine the <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> (SIT) of coal dust and the minimum ignition temperature of coal dust layer (MITL), respectively. In addition, a modified hot-oven test is used to look into the characteristics of self-heating ignition and the subsequent smouldering of a bituminous coal dust in oxy-fuel atmospheres with an emphasis on mass loss rate and gas emissions. In the second phase of the dissertation, the focus is on the determination of SIT and MITL of coal dust in oxy-fuel combustion atmospheres via standard apparatuses introduced in the first phase. Both the self-ignition risk and dust explosion risk have been found to increase significantly with increasing O 2 mole fraction. Moreover, the self-ignition risk of coal dust accumulation slightly decreases when replacing N 2 with CO 2 under the same conditions. The modified hot-oven test shows that a higher O 2 mole fraction leads to a shorter ignition delay, a shorter burn-out duration, a faster O 2 chemisorption at low temperature as well as a higher peak smouldering temperature. The emission-gas measurements show that the CO to CO 2 ratio increases significantly after self-ignition, and CH 4 counts for 1 ~ 8 % of the total carbon emission. The third part of the dissertation develops a 2 D numerical model, using the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics, to investigate self-ignition behaviour of coal dusts for both hot-oven test and hot-plate test with a main emphasis on the roles of oxygen, diluent gas and characteristic length. A one-step global 2 nd-order reaction kinetic model considering both coal density and oxygen density is used to estimate the reaction rate of the self-heating process until ignition. Based on the hot-oven test results, the kinetic parameters are further calibrated for hot-oven tests are used for the simulation of both dust volume and dust layer. The accuracy of the numerical simulations has been discussed via varying the diameter of grid, time step and calculation termination time. In the last part of the dissertation, the developed model has been validated to predict the transient temperature and concentration profiles of South African coal dusts until ignition. Both the computed critical ignition temperature and the ignition delay time related to the mole fraction of oxygen and the dust volume show a good agreement with experimental results. The ignition delay time and the most sensitive ignition position (MSIP) of dust layer has been found to vary with varying ambient gas conditions, hot plate temperatures and ambient temperatures using the verified model. Parameter analysis shows that the heating value has a comparatively pronounced effect on both SIT and MITL, and the heat transfer coefficient have a stronger effect on MITL. This is the first time that a physics-based model of ignition of coal dust layers has been developed in the oxy-fuel atmospheres, thus helping to understand the fire risk in this promising combustion technology. status: publishe...|$|E

Among the several options, micro gas turbines (mGT) are particularly interesting. Beside theuse of natural gas, other fuels like landfill gas, ethanol, industrial waste off-gases and other bio-based gases can be used. Moreover, it is possible to further improve the efficiencies and reduce the emissions for mGTs by paying particular attention at the design of the combustion chamber. To this goal, flameless combustion could be an interesting solution. Flameless combustion is able to provide high combustion efficiency with low NOx and soot emissions. The increasing interest in flameless combustion is motivated by its large fuel flexibility, representing a promising technology for low-calorific value fuels, high-calorific industrial wastes as well as in presence of hydrogen. Moreover, flameless combustion is very stableand noiseless, so it is suited for gas turbine applications where conventional operations may lead to significant thermo-acoustic instabilities (“humming”) and stresses. Flameless combustion needs the reactants to be preheated above their <b>self-ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> and enough inert combustion products to be entrained in the reaction region, in order to dilute the flame. As a result, the temperature field is more uniform than in traditional combustion systems, and it does not show high temperature peaks. Hence, NOx formation is suppressed as well as soot formation,due to the lean conditions, low temperatures and the large CO 2 concentration in the exhausts. mGTs operating in flameless combustion regime represent a promising technology for the combined production of heat and power with increased efficiency, reduced pollutants emission and high fuel flexibility. The objective of the present Thesis is the design of a combustion chamber for amGT for residential applications. The design is performed employing CFD-tools. Thus, it is necessary to develop a reliable numerical model to use in the design process. Therefore, the first step of the Thesis consists in a series of validation studies, with the goal of selecting the most appropriate and reliable models to describe flameless combustion. The validation will be carried on three differenttest cases, which have different nominal powers and employ different gaseous fuels. The second part of the Thesis focuses on the design and optimization of the combustion chamber. Finally, the third part shows the experimental investigation of the aforementioned chamber. The study of those three cases shows that, to correctly predict the behavior of those systems, it is necessary to take into account both mixing and chemical kinetics. The best results have been obtained with the Eddy Dissipation Concept model, coupled with detailed kinetic schemes. As far as the NOx emissions are concerned, it is fundamental to include all the formation routes, i. e. thermal, prompt, via N 2 O and NNH route, to estimate properly the NOx production in flameless conditions. The aforementioned models have been used for the design and optimization of a combustion chamber for a mGT operating in flameless combustion regime. Both the design and the optimization have been carried out by means of CFD simulations and both are goal-oriented, meaning that they are carried out with the purpose of improving one or more performance indicators of the chamber, such as pollutants emissions, efficiency or pressure losses. The configuration that satisfies the criteria on the performance indicators has been built and investigated experimentally. The combustion chamber is stable and performs well in terms of emissions {{for a wide range of}} air inlet temperature and air-fuel equivalence ratio, lambda, values. Except for the condition closer to the stoichiometric one, both CO and NOx emissions are extremely low for all !and air inlet temperatures. Thechamber performs the best at its nominal operating condition, i. e. lambda = 3. 5 and air inlet temperature 730 °C, In this case CO is 0 ppm and NOx is 5. 6 ppm. The numerical model employed to describe the combustor performs quite well, except for the CO prediction, for all the conditions investigated. The final step of the present work is the application of a different kind of fuel, namely biogas. First the feasibility of such application has been evaluated using CFD calculations, and then the experimental evidence has been discussed. Due to a calibration error on the gas flow meter, it has not been possible to investigate the conditions of the design point (lambda = 3. 5). Three other conditions have been examined,characterized by lower values of !closer to the stoichiometric conditions. Despite the relatively high values of NOx emissions due to the lower air excess and to the consequently higher temperatures, the combustion chamber has proven to be fuel flexible. Both ignition and stable combustion can be achieved also when biogas is burnt. Numerical simulations have also been performed; the results are in good agreement with the experimental evidence.
