5|$|Contemplating {{advocacy}} {{work and}} a run for city council in Newark after graduation from law school, Booker {{lived in the city}} during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as <b>staff</b> <b>attorney</b> for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.|$|E

50|$|Instead, California {{has largely}} {{switched}} to using permanent <b>staff</b> <b>attorneys</b> {{at all levels}} of the judiciary; a few judges do use law clerks, but they are quite rare. For example, the Supreme Court of California has over 85 <b>staff</b> <b>attorneys,</b> of whom about half are attached to particular justices and the rest are shared as a central staff. The California system has been heavily criticized for denying young attorneys the chance to gain experience, and low turnover has resulted in a lack of ethnic and gender diversity among the <b>staff</b> <b>attorneys.</b> But most California judges prefer <b>staff</b> <b>attorneys</b> because it avoids the problem of having to bring new law clerks up to speed on pending complex cases, particularly those involving the death penalty.|$|R

5000|$|Each {{justice has}} five {{assigned}} law clerks. Since the late 1980s, the Court has {{turned away from}} the traditional use of law clerks, and has switched to permanent <b>staff</b> <b>attorneys.</b> [...] Justice Goodwin Liu, however, has returned to the traditional use of recent law school graduates as one-year clerks. The Court has about 85 <b>staff</b> <b>attorneys,</b> some of whom are attached to particular justices; the rest are shared as a central staff.

25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the clerk of the court. Petitions are assigned to a law clerk or <b>staff</b> <b>attorney</b> for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. If the law clerk, <b>staff</b> <b>attorney,</b> or brief in opposition identify any procedural defects in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may dismiss it with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner has an opportunity to correct the procedural error and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on the docket for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|E
