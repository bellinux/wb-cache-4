5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but said that Sharp had denied paternity of the child {{on the grounds that it}} was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.|$|E
5|$|A NAC {{meeting was}} held outside Blantyre on 25 January. It was {{alleged that the}} meeting {{discussed}} in detail {{a plan for the}} overthrow of the territorial government and the massacre of the territory's whites and any blacks who collaborated with them. (although a subsequent Royal Commission found there was insufficient evidence to make <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim).</b> Welensky obtained the meeting's proceedings in early February and decided to act, calling a meeting of the federal and territorial governments. Federal troops were deployed to Nyasaland on 21 February, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency on 3 March and the nationalist leaders were arrested and flown to jails in Southern Rhodesia. In the subsequent fortnight, riots broke out and troops used force to end the violence. Almost 50 people died in the unrest.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of work, Fermi's group had {{tentatively}} determined that lighter elements would disperse {{the energy of the}} captured neutron by emitting a proton or alpha particle and heavier elements would generally accomplish the same by emitting a gamma ray. This latter behavior would later result in the beta decay of a neutron into a proton, thus moving the resulting isotope one place up the periodic table. When Fermi's team bombarded uranium, they observed this behavior as well, which strongly suggested that the resulting isotope had an atomic number of 93. Fermi was initially reluctant to publicize <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim,</b> but after his team observed several unknown half-lives in the uranium bombardment products that did not match those of any known isotope, he published a paper entitled Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92 in June 1934. In it he proposed the name ausonium (atomic symbol Ao) for element 93, after the Greek name Ausonia (Italy).|$|E
25|$|There is a {{divergence}} {{of views}} within Buddhism {{on the need for}} vegetarianism, with some schools of Buddhism rejecting <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claimed</b> need and with most Buddhists in fact eating meat. Many Mahayana Buddhists - especially the Chinese and Vietnamese traditions - strongly oppose meat-eating on scriptural grounds.|$|R

However, <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claimed</b> plan was not {{possible}} with the exile of Sheikh Jaber and his government to Saudi Arabia within hours of the invasion where they ran the Kuwaiti exiled government from a hotel in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia.|$|R
5000|$|The bergrå {{could be}} either male or female. It {{lived in the}} {{mountain}} with a court of relatives and sometimes surrounded by trolls. It was a common phenomena in the mythology about the bergsrå for humans to be bergtagen (literary: [...] "taken into the mountain"), spend time with the bergså in the mountain. A typical description of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claimed</b> occurrence was given by Sven Andersson in 1691, {{when he was on}} trial for having sexual intercourse with a female bergrå.|$|R
5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that Sharp had fathered a stillborn {{illegitimate child}} with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation {{that the child was}} a mulatto. Whether Sharp made <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim,</b> or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{affected}} William, {{since he}} had been appointed chancellor by Raymond and may have fallen out of favour after Raymond {{was removed from the}} regency. When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180, the two most obvious choices for his successor were William and Heraclius of Caesarea. They were fairly evenly matched in background and education, but politically they were allied with opposite parties, as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay's supporters. It seems that the canons of the Holy Sepulchre were unable to decide, and asked the king for advice; due to Agnes' influence, Heraclius was elected. There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers, but this information comes from the partisan 13th-century continuations of the Historia, and there is no other evidence to substantiate <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> William himself says almost nothing about the election and Heraclius' character or his subsequent patriarchate, probably reflecting his disappointment at the outcome.|$|E
5|$|While Beauchamp's primary motive {{in killing}} Sharp was {{to defend the}} honor of his wife, {{speculation}} raged that Sharp's political opponents had instigated the crime. Sharp was {{a leader of the}} New Court party during the Old Court – New Court controversy in Kentucky. At least one Old Court partisan alleged that Sharp denied paternity of Cooke's son by claiming the child was a mulatto, the son of a family slave. Whether Sharp made <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> has never been verified. New Court partisans insisted that the allegation was concocted to stir Beauchamp's anger and provoke him to murder. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy served as the inspiration for numerous literary works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished Politian and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E

25|$|The Ngarrindjeri's {{traditional}} {{areas are}} {{claimed to have}} extended from Mannum, South Australia downstream through Murray Bridge and Victor Harbor and along the coast through Goolwa to Cape Jervis, including Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert but {{this is based on}} an amalgamation of the territories of several distinct groups. For example, asserting territorial extent over the region from Encounter Bay to Cape Jervois appropriates or subsumes the area well documented as being that of the Ramindjeri, without substantive evidence to support <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim,</b> and despite evidence to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|Foster also {{contends that}} Moore hated tobacco and would, therefore, never have {{depicted}} Saint Nicholas with a pipe. However, Kaller notes, {{the source of}} evidence for Moore's supposed disapproval of tobacco is , another poem by him. In actuality, that verse contradicts <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> Moore's The Wine Drinker criticizes self-righteous, hypocritical advocates of temperance who secretly indulge in the substances which they publicly oppose, and supports the social use of tobacco in moderation (as well as wine, and even opium, which was more acceptable in his day than it is now).|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the British and Russian Empires were competing for supremacy in Central Asia. Under the pretext to forestall the Russians, in 1904, a British expedition led by Colonel Francis Younghusband was sent to Lhasa to force a trading agreement and to prevent Tibetans from establishing a relationship with the Russians. In response, the Chinese foreign ministry asserted that China was sovereign over Tibet, the first clear statement of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> Before the British troops arrived in Lhasa, the 13th Dalai Lama fled to Outer Mongolia, and then went to Beijing in 1908.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the British and Russian Empires were competing for supremacy in Central Asia.

In response, the Qing foreign ministry asserted that China was sovereign over Tibet, the first clear statement of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> Before the British troops arrived in Lhasa, the 13th Dalai Lama fled to Outer Mongolia, and then went to Beijing in 1908.|$|E

CIA analysts prior to the Iraq invasion were quoted by the White House as believing that Iraq was trying to acquire nuclear weapons and that these aluminum tubes could be used in a centrifuge for nuclear enrichment. David Corn and Michael Isikoff argued that the undercover work being done by Plame and her CIA colleagues in the Directorate of Central Intelligence Nonproliferation Center strongly contradicted <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim.</b> However, the CIA was concerned enough to send Plame's husband, Joseph C.
