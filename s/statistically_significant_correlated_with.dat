40|$|Introduction. Although it is {{well known}} that BMP- 2 and BMP- 7 play {{significant}} roles in cartilage metabolism, data about intra-articular expression and localization of these proteins and their receptors in humans are rare. Methods. Biopsies of synovia and debrided cartilage were taken in patients undergoing autologous chondrocyte implantation. Expression of BMP- 2, BMP- 7, and their receptors BMPR- 1 A, BMPR- 1 B and BMPR- 2 were semiquantitatively evaluated by immunohistological staining. Results. BMP- 7 was equally highly expressed in all cartilage and synovial biopsies. Increased levels of BMPR- 1 A, but not of BMPR- 1 B, and BMPR- 2, were found in all synovial and 47 % of all cartilage samples (P = 0. 002). BMP- 2 was positively scored in 47 % of all cartilage and 40 % of all synovial specimens. Defect size, KOSS, Henderson or Kellgren-Lawrence score did not <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> the expression of the analyzed proteins or Mankin and Pritzker scores. Duration of symptoms and localization of lesions were associated with KOSS (P < 0. 02), but there was no influence of these parameters on protein expression. Conclusions. BMP- 2, BMP- 7, and BMPR- 1 A were expressed in cartilage and synovia of knees with focal cartilage lesions. Although defect localization and duration of symptoms decisively influence KOSS, there was no associated alteration of protein expression observed...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of research on the use of barley caryopses hardness for prediction of the malting quality. Grain hardness was determined by three methods: Particle size index (PSI), hardness according to Brabender (BRA) and grain milling energy (GME). The correlations among methods for determining the kernel hardness were estimated as well among selected technological traits of barley and malt and kernel hardness. Significant correlations were found among PSI values and Final attenuation of laboratory wort from malt (0. 73 *) a Glycidic extract (0. 70 *). Values of kernel hardness measured by BRA significantly correlated with Final attenuation of laboratory wort from malt (– 0. 80 *) and Soluble nitrogen of malt (0. 64 *). Grain milling energy values were <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> Nitrogen content in malt (0. 64 *).

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is characterized by}} hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance {{in the setting of}} inadequate beta-cell compensation. Recent studies indicate that for attaining a well-functioning &#x 000 df;-cell mass, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is a very promising candidate among several insulinotropic peptides. In order to elucidate its role, we determine the levels of PTHrP, insulin and c-peptide in type 2 diabetics and in normal subjects in the fasting state. We enrolled 28 patients (16 men and 12 postmenopausal women) with type 2 diabetes and twenty eight aged-matched healthy individuals as control subjects (15 men and 13 women). PTHrP was <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> glucose in type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects in the fasting state. Additionally, PTHrP serum levels exhibited a significant increase in type 2 diabetes compared to control subjects. Interestingly, PTHrP showed a positive correlation with insulin levels only among healthy individuals presumably due to defective glucose stimulated insulin secretion known to occur in type 2 diabetics. In conclusion, the strong positive relation of PTHrP with glucose in the fasting state in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus raises several questions for further experimentation concerning its exact role and physiological significance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Heart {{disease is}} the number one leading cause of death in the United States (CDC, 2016). People who have {{hypertension}} are at greater risk for other heart disease (World Heart Federation, 2017). Preventing hypertension through education of health numbers can greatly reduce the hypertension prevalence in the United States. Objective: Determine the relationship between blood pressure and other health status indicators used in worksite wellness health fairs including; body mass index, waist circumference, stress, and time management. Design: 156 participants at the University of Nebraska attended a wellness fair, in which blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, time management, and stress were assessed. Once data was obtained, analyses were performed to determine the relationship between blood pressure and all other assessments Results: Stress and time management were not <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> blood pressure. Waist circumference and body mass index were statistically significant and positively correlated with blood pressure. Lastly, the odds ratio for BMI was the only significant ratio; the odds of having high blood pressure increase by 1. 244 times for every one unit that BMI increases, holding the other variables constant.

It has been reported that 72 % of fish caught are captured by sport fishers. Yet, little is known about the characteristics and expenditures of sport fishers in the Pantanal. We provide an analysis of the principal <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> sport fishing expenditures in the southern Pantanal region. We analyze the results of a formal oral survey of 493 sport fishing visitors during the high fishing season of 1994. Visitors were polled regarding costly aspects of their vacation decision, travel history in the region, reasons for choosing the Pantanal as a tourism destination, and aspects of their experience, in addition to demographic information. Three first order linear regression models are explored to reveal the principal features of Pantanal sport fishing expenditures. We find <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> relationships between visitor and trip characteristics and their total and daily expenditures for sport fishing in the Pantanal and for a proxy for fishing success. <b>Statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> total and daily expenditures include respondent income, mode of transportation, fishing success, education level and motivations for visiting the Pantanal.

Receptive physicians are discriminated from non-receptive {{on the basis of their}} attitudes toward the computerized systems and their attitudes toward working conditions. The physicians in this study are employed in state psychiatric and mental retardation facilities in which computerized drug ordering, along with an automated review of their prescribing practices, was introduced. Receptivity to these systems of physicians who have begun to use them was examined and related to their opinions on the benefits and drawbacks of the systems and to attitudes toward their clinical role and working conditions. The results show that the sample of physicians is equally divided in terms of their receptivity. Physicians who saw relative advantages in the systems tended to be receptive, while those who were threatened by the computer applications tended to be non-receptive. Attitudes of physicians towards their working conditions, also <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> receptivity.

Zakat institution and BISP provide free cash to needy and poor as living allowances. ZI, PBM and NGOs provide financing for human capital development through education and training to manage poverty reduction. These institutions facilitate the poor people directly to manage poverty reduction on sustainable basis. The research presented in this study, hence, aims to explore and evaluate the financial dimensions of managing poverty reduction in rural Pakistan through a micro level study to evaluate the outcome and effectiveness of poverty reduction programmes in Pakistan {{by focusing on the}} impact of such programmes in DG Khan and Rajanpur Districts. For this purpose, primary data is collected through a questionnaire survey to measure the perceptions of the households, in the form beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, on the outcome and efficiency of the poverty reduction programmes in DG Khan and Rajanpur. The data is analyzed through non-parametric (Mean U Whitney tests and Kruskal Wallis) and parametric inferential statistics techniques, such as logit model, to draw the result for research questions. The findings from the non-parametric test have shown that institution, employment, marital status, working female members, working male members, assets like land, livestock, business assets, savings and loan are significant and ranked at 1 for income related questions. Training, education, gender, age, child dependency and district variables are also significant and causing for poverty but ranking at second number. The results from Logit model show that beneficiaries and households are <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> and positively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> probability of being poor. It also concluded that education, institution, gender, age, employment, working male member, and working female member as variables are <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> and negatively <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> probability of being poor.

BACKGROUND Patients with PPH are often difficult to diagnose until several years after the onset of symptoms. Despite the seriousness of the disorder, the diagnosis of PPH is often delayed because it is unsuspected and requires invasive measurements. Although PPH often causes abnormalities in resting lung function, these abnormalities have not been shown to be <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> when <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> other measures of PPH severity. METHODS Resting lung mechanics and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide DLCO were assessed in 79 patients whose findings conformed to the classical diagnostic criteria of PPH and who had no evidence of secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension. These findings were <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> severity of disease as assessed by cardiac catheterization, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. RESULTS When PPH patients were first evaluated at our referral clinic, the DLCO and lung volumes were decreased in approximately three-quarters and one-half, respectively.

Gender differences for all measures were negligible and not considered further. One aspect of HP (personal standards) overlapped moderately with NFC but HP and NFC appeared to be different constructs.

40|$|The Zellweger {{spectrum}} disorders (ZSDs) {{are characterized}} by a generalized loss of peroxisomal functions caused by deficient peroxisomal assembly. Clinical presentation and survival are heterogeneous. Although most peroxisomal enzymes are unstable in the cytosol of peroxisome-deficient cells of ZSD patients, a few enzymes remain stable among which alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). Its deficiency causes primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH 1, MIM 259900), an inborn error of glyoxylate metabolism characterized by hyperoxaluria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal insufficiency. Despite the normal level of AGT activity in ZSD patients, hyperoxaluria {{has been reported in}} several ZSD patients. We observed the unexpected occurrence of renal stones in a cohort of ZSD patients. This led us to perform a study in this cohort to determine the prevalence of hyperoxaluria in ZSDs and to find clinically relevant clues that correlate with the urinary oxalate load. We reviewed medical charts of 31 Dutch ZSD patients with prolonged survival (> 1 year). Urinary oxalate excretion was assessed in 23 and glycolate in 22 patients. Hyperoxaluria was present in 19 (83 %), and hyperglycolic aciduria in 14 (64 %). Pyridoxine treatment in six patients did not reduce the oxalate excretion as in some PH 1 patients.

Chronic macrovascular complications were present in 74. 58 %, while chronic microvascular complications were present in 61. 87 % of patients with T 2 DM who associated mild and moderate cognitive impairment (p = 0. 013). The most common form of depression was mild depression (90. 2 %), present in most patients with DM, regardless of progression and type of treatment. MADRS depression test scores were <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the presence of peripheral artery disease - PAD (p < 0. 001), ischemic heart disease - IHD (p < 0. 001) and chronic kidney disease - CKD (p = 0. 05). We did not find a statistically significant correlation with HbA 1 c and serum lipid values (p˃ 0, 05). Conclusion: Chronic diabetes macrovascular complications (PAD, IHD) and CKD were more frequently associated with cognitive disorders and depression in patients with T 2 DM independent of the degree of metabolic control...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{research}} was to reevaluate the normative data on the eyeball diameters. Methods. In a prospective cohort study, the CT data of consecutive 250 adults with healthy eyes were collected and analyzed, and sagittal, transverse, and axial diameters of both eyeballs were measured. The data obtained from the left eye and from the right eye were compared. The correlation analysis was performed with the following variables: orbit size, gender, age, and ethnic background. Results. We did not find <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> differences <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> gender of the patients and their age. The right eyeball was slightly smaller than the left one but this difference was statistically insignificant (P= 0. 17). We did not find <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> differences of the eyeball sizes among the ethnicities we dealt with. Strong correlation was found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit (r= 0. 88). Conclusion. The size of a human adult eye is approximately 24. 2 [*]mm[*](transverse) [*]×[*] 23. 7 [*]mm[*](sagittal) [*]×[*] 22. 0 – 24. 8 [*]mm (axial) with no significant difference between sexes and age groups. In the transverse diameter, the eyeball size may vary from 21 [*]mm to 27 [*]mm. These data might be useful in ophthalmological, oculoplastic, and neurological practice...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) and {{beta blockers}} (BB) {{are effective in}} advanced heart failure (HF). Often, due to side effects, BB are not used or dose not increased. We evaluated the titration of BB therapy with carvedilol (Carv) in CRT Responders (R) and Not Responders (NR), recruiting 65 HF outpatients (pts) with CRT indication and on optimal treatment [70 % males; age 67. 9 ± 12. 6 years, ys; NYHA 2. 7 ± 0. 7; aetiology 44 % coronary artery disease (CAD), 43 % dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) ]. All underwent ECG, echocardiography, NYHA evaluation before and after 1 y of CRT. Considering NYHA response and improvement of systolic left ventricular function (EF,%), R (ΔNYHA> 1 and/or ΔEF> 5 %) and NR were defined. During follow-up, Carv was titrated. Basally R and NR were similar for age, sex, HF aetiology (R 40 % CAD, 42. 5 % DCM; NR 48 % CAD, 40 % DCM), QRS duration (168 ± 32 vs 178 ± 29 msec), end-diastolic (EDV, ml), end-systolic (ESV) volume, EF (R 25. 1 ± 7. 9 NR 27. 4 ± 8. 2), BB treatment (85 vs 88 %) and Carv dose (16. 3 ± 18. 6 vs 13. 2 ± 10. 3 mg/day). Only basal NYHA (R 2. 9 ± 0. 7 NR 2. 4 ± 0. 6, p= 0. 002) was significantly different. There {{was no significant difference}} in QRS duration postCRT (R 123 ± 32, NR 127 ± 36 msec). After 1 y, R showed greater variation of EDV and ESV (ΔEDV - 45 ± 46 vs - 2 ± 56 p= 0. 01; ΔESV - 46 ± 46 vs - 1 ± 45 p= 0. 003) and mitral regurgitation entity (- 0. 5 ± 0. 7 vs 0 ± 0. 7 p= 0. 02). After 1 y there was an overall increase of pts on BB (92. 5 vs 92 %), but R achieved a greater Carv dose (25. 1 ± 20. 4 vs 14. 5 ± 7. 3 mg/day p= 0. 002, Δdose 8. 7 ± 11 vs 1. 2 ± 10. 7 p= 0. 009). Carv dose increase and EF improvement were correlated (r= 0. 40, p= 0. 02), while dose increase and ventricular remodeling (LVR) were negatively related (ΔEDV r= 0. 42 p= 0. 02; ΔESV r= 0. 45 p= 0. 01). In both groups CRT allows to introduce and augment BB dose, but only in R dose increase is <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> <b>correlating</b> <b>with</b> LVR regression. Such results suggest an addictive role of BB titration in determining CRT positive response...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the therapeutic assessment (TA; Finn, 2007) of a traumatized {{young woman named}} Claire. Claire reported feeling debilitated by academic demands and the expectations of her parents, and was finding it nearly impossible to progress in her studies. She was also finding it difficult to develop and sustain intimate relationships. The emotional aspects of close relationships were extremely difficult for her and she routinely blamed herself for her struggles in this arena. The assessor utilized the TA model for adults, {{with the exception of}} not including an optional intervention session. The steps of TA, particularly the extended inquiry and the discussion of test findings along the way, cultivated a supportive and empathic atmosphere with Claire. By employing the single-case time-series experimental design used in previous TA studies (e. g., Smith, Handler, & Nash, 2010; Smith, Wolf, Handler, & Nash, 2009), the authors demonstrated that Claire experienced <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> improvement <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the onset of TA. Results indicated that participation in TA coincided with a positive shift in the trajectory of her reported symptoms and with recognizing the affection she held for others in her life. This case illustrates the successful application of case-based time-series methodology in the evaluation of an adult TA. The potential implications for future study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging {{has been}} used for the detection of cerebral vasospasm (VSP) related infarction in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (eSAH) in rats. Conventional angiography is generally used to visualize VSP, which is an invasive technique with a possible increase in morbidity and mortality. In this study we evaluated the validity of MR-angiography (MRA) in detecting VSP and its feasibility to define VSP severity grades after eSAH in rats. SAH was induced using the double-hemorrhage model in 12 rats. In two rats, saline solution was injected instead of blood (sham group). MR was performed on day 1, 2 and on day 5. T 1 -, T 2 -, T 2 *-weighted and time-of-flight MR sequences were applied, which were analyzed by two blinded neuroradiologists. Vessel narrowing of 25 - 50 % was defined as mild, 50 - 75 % as moderate and > 75 % as severe VSP. We performed a total of 34 MRAs in 14 rats. In 14 rats, MRA was performed on day 2 and day 5. In six rats MRA was additionally performed on day 1 before the blood injection. A good visualization of cerebral vessels was possible in all cases. No VSP was seen in the sham group neither on day 2 nor on day 5. We found vasospasm on day 2 in 7 of the 14 rats (50 %) whereas all 7 rats had mild and one rat had additionally moderate and severe vasospasm in one vessel, respectively. On day 5 we found vasospasm in 8 of the 14 rats (60 %) whereas 4 rats had severe vasospasm, 1 rat had moderate vasospasm and 3 rats demonstrated mild vasospasm. In 4 of the 14 rats (30 %) an ischemic lesion was detected on day 5. Three of these rats had severe vasospasm and one rat had mild vasospasm. Severe vasospasm on day 5 was <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the occurrence of ischemic lesions (Fisher's Exact test, OR 19. 5, p = 0. 03). MRA is a noninvasive diagnostic tool, which allows a good visualization of the cerebral vasculature and provides reproducible results concerning the detection of VSP and the differentiation into three severity grades in rats. Future studies are needed to directly compare MRA with conventional angiography...|$|E
40|$|Background. Although Cohen's {{convention}} regarding small (∼ 0. 2), medium (∼ 0. 5), {{and large}} (∼ 0. 8) effect sizes (ES) that {{originated in the}} socio-behavioral sciences approximately 40 years ago has been used heuristically in medicine as well, {{the extent to which}} it characterizes the range of ES for various medical therapies remains unknown. Objectives. (1) To calibrate the robustness of current interventions in medicine using different ES indices as the underlying metric, and (2) to examine whether the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in medicine have changed over the years. Methods. Three complementary studies have been conducted. Study I, which provides an indication of the range of ES in medicine currently, is a meta-meta analysis that summarizes 91 different meta-analyses of various treatments, from medicine to surgery to psychology. Study II used a pool of 250 different ES computed from 52 original clinical trials published over the last 25 years to examine time trends associated with ES. Study III used traditional and cumulative meta-analyses of 76 trials representing 30 different treatments for sepsis. Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) was calculated and adjusted for different control death rates to assess systematically objectives (1) and (2). Results. Study I: The mean ES for continuous variables was d 0. 50 (SD 0. 35, 95 %CI 0. 32 - 0. 69) and for dichotomous variables odds ratio 1. 51 (SD 1. 39, 95 %CI 0. 9 - 2. 13; p > 0. 05). Study II: A parsimonious theory-specified model accounted for 93. 2 % of the variance associated with ES estimates over the years. ES was <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> many design features but not with year of publication. Study III: Neither traditional meta-analysis nor cumulative meta-analysis found most treatment categories for sepsis to be effective. Whereas the pooled relative risk estimate for the entire cohort of almost 22, 000 patients was statistically significant with very narrow confidence interval (RR 0. 92; 95 %CI 0. 88 - 0. 96; p = 0. 00028), the NNT adjusted analysis had a wide range, including the potential for harm. Conclusion. Cohen's convention applies well to medicine. Most therapeutic interventions in this study had a small to moderate ES, indicating they have not changed dramatically over the years. These findings suggest that the ever-increasing biomedical knowledge does not result in ever-improving therapeutic efficacy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInterleukin- 33 (IL- 33) is a {{recently}} described {{member of the}} IL- 1 family of cytokines, which {{was identified as a}} ligand for the ST 2 receptor. Components of the IL- 33 /ST 2 system were shown to be expressed in normal and pressure overloaded human myocardium, and soluble ST 2 (sST 2) has emerged as a prognostic biomarker in myocardial infarction and heart failure. However, expression and regulation of IL- 33 in human adult cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts was not tested before. In this study we found that primary human adult cardiac fibroblasts (HACF) and human adult cardiac myocytes (HACM) constitutively express nuclear IL- 33 that is released during cell necrosis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interferon (IFN) -γ and IL- 1 β significantly increased both IL- 33 protein and IL- 33 mRNA expression in HACF and HACM as well as in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC). The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor dimethylfumarate inhibited TNF-α- and IL- 1 β-induced IL- 33 production as well as nuclear translocation of p 50 and p 65 NF-κB subunits in these cells. Mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor U 0126 abrogated TNF-α-, IFN-γ-, and IL- 1 β-induced and Janus-activated kinase inhibitor I reduced IFN-γ-induced IL- 33 production. We detected IL- 33 mRNA in human myocardial tissue from patients undergoing heart transplantation (n= 27) where IL- 33 mRNA levels <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> IFN-γ (r= 0. 591, p= 0. 001) and TNF-α (r= 0. 408, p= 0. 035) mRNA expression. Endothelial cells in human heart expressed IL- 33 as well as ST 2 protein. We also reveal that human cardiac and vascular cells have different distribution patterns of ST 2 isoforms (sST 2 and transmembrane ST 2 L) mRNA expression and produce different amounts of sST 2 protein. Both human macrovascular (aortic and coronary artery) and heart microvascular endothelial cells express specific mRNA for both ST 2 isoforms (ST 2 L and sST 2) and are a source for sST 2 protein, whereas cardiac myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts and vascular SMC express only minor amounts of ST 2 mRNA and do not secrete detectable amounts of sST 2 antigen. In accordance with the cellular distribution of ST 2 receptor, human cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes as well as HCASMC did not respond to treatment with IL- 33, as recombinant human IL- 33 did not induce NF-κB p 50 and p 65 subunits nuclear translocation or increase IL- 6, IL- 8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP- 1) level in HACF, HACM and HCASMC. In summary, we found that endothelial cells seem to be the source of sST 2 and the target for IL- 33 in the cardiovascular system. IL- 33 is expressed in the nucleus of human adult cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes and released during necrosis. Proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL- 1 β increase IL- 33 in these cells in vitro, and IL- 33 mRNA levels correlated with TNF-α and IFN-γ mRNA expression in human myocardial tissue...|$|E

Capitalization, trade volume and economic growth are highly positively <b>correlated</b> in Kenya, <b>with</b> capitalization and trade volume jointly explaining 91 % of the variations in the economic growth, over the period under study. Further, the study found that a 1 % increase in both trade volume and capitalization causes 0. 025 % and 0. 115 % increase in gross domestic product respectively. Thus, empirical evidence shows that stock market development (measured by trade volume and/or capitalization) impacts positively on the economic growth in Kenya. </p...|$|R
40|$|CONCLUSION: Our results {{indicate}} that repeated treatment courses with tobramycin 10 mg/kg (twice daily for 3 weeks) may be safely applied in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with respect to ototoxicity. The risk of hearing loss in this patient group is less than expected, which {{could be explained by}} either unfavourable baseline audiometry or the use of unidentified protective medication, or both. However, due to large inter-individual variations, audiometry screening remains important with respect to the detection of individual outliers. OBJECTIVES: Tobramycin is frequently prescribed for CF patients. In this study, hearing loss due to cumulative tobramycin exposure in adult CF patients was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 19 patients with both baseline and follow-up audiometry before and after repeated courses of intravenous tobramycin (10 mg/kg/day in twice daily administrations for 3 weeks). Pure tone audiometry was performed at 0. 250 - 16 kHz. RESULTS: After repeated courses of tobramycin (median 3, range 1 - 8), the mean increase per frequency was 2. 1 dB (median 0. 5 dB, SD 12. 6) with large (inter-individual) variations (range - 23. 5 to 34. 5 dB). The pure tone averages (PTA) at 1 - 2 - 4 kHz and 8 - 10 - 12 kHz increased 1. 4 dBHL and 2. 3 dBHL, respectively, but were neither <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> nor <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the cumulative tobramycin exposure...|$|R
