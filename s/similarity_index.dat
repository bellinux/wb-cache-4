Employing first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory for a set of database systems, namely unary atomic clusters in the shape of regular polyhedra and the bulk solids of C, Si, Pd and Pt, we explore the correlations between the energy difference μ and <b>similarity</b> <b>indices.</b> We find that there exists an interconnection between nanocrystal energetics and quantum similarity measures. Accordingly, we develop a means for computing total energy differences from the <b>similarity</b> <b>indices</b> via interpolation, and utilize a test set comprising a variety of unary nanocrystals and binary nanoalloys/nanocompounds for validation.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} indexing high-dimensional data for answering (approximate) similarity-search queries. <b>Similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> prove {{to be important in}} a wide variety of settings: Web search engines desire fast, parallel, main-memory-based <b>indexes</b> for <b>similarity</b> search on text data; database systems desire disk-based <b>similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> for high-dimensional data, including text and images; peer-to-peer systems desire distributed <b>similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> with low communication cost. We propose an indexing scheme called LSH Forest which is applicable in all the above contexts. Our index uses the well-known technique of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), but improves upon previous designs by (a) eliminating the different data-dependent parameters for which LSH must be constantly hand-tuned, and (b) improving on LSH's performance guarantees for skewed data distributions while retaining the same storage and query overhead. We show how to construct this index in main memory, on disk, in parallel systems, and in peer-to-peer systems. We evaluate the design with experiments on multiple text corpora and demonstrate both the self-tuning nature and the superior performance of LSH Forest...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{combined}} impact of habitat filtering and dispersal limitation on species turnover patterns. To gain new insights, we constructed a spatially explicit community model wherein we controlled dispersal distances, the strength of habitat filtering, and the grain of habitat heterogeneity to study the distance decay of several (dis) <b>similarity</b> <b>indices.</b> The impact of habitat filtering is dependent on the ratio between the grain of habitats and the mean dispersal distance. The behavior of (dis) <b>similarity</b> <b>indices</b> varies. First, incidence-based measures of species overlap are less affected by habitat filtering than are abundance-based indices. Second, species identity-based indices, derived from population genetics' F-ST, show interesting capacities to infer dispersal processes under neutrality but are also highly sensitive to habitat filtering. All indices except F-ST-related indices under neutrality are very sensitive to overall species richness. Hence, community patterns showing contrasted diversity levels should be compared with caution. Partitioning <b>similarity</b> <b>indices</b> within and between habitats appears to be an efficient approach to assess the strength of habitat filtering, and we show that a torus-translation test is powerful for this purpose. We finally highlight the need for further analytical studies to achieve theoretical expectations of similarity decay under dispersal and niche processes.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design of}} a maintenance and operations recommender. The recommender uses information from computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) and energy management and control systems (EMCS) to recommend what maintenance personnel should do in response to a maintenance service request or other event requiring a maintenance or control system action. The recommender integrates text information from a CMMS database and sensor information from an EMCS to provide recommendations. Text is processed using the Extended Boolean model, which is a simple text processing method commonly used to retrieve information from large databases. The recommender compares text problem descriptors and sensor data descriptors to estimate the similarity between previous maintenance actions and the maintenance action that will be taken. Actions with a high predicted similarity are more highly recommended than those with a low predicted similarity. The recommender uses reported maintenance actions to learn to improve its recommendations. It compares predicted <b>similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> with <b>similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> computed by comparing maintenance actions.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of the membrane-bound nitrate reductase (narG) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes in fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from soil and rhizosphere environments was characterized together {{with that of the}} 16 S rRNA gene by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Fragments of 1, 008 bp and 1, 433 bp were amplified via PCR with primers specific for the narG and nosZ genes, respectively. The presence of the narG and nosZ genes in the bacterial strains was confirmed by hybridization of the genomic DNA and the PCR products with the corresponding probes. The ability of the strains to either reduce nitrate or totally dissimilate nitrogen was assessed. Overall, there was a good correspondence between the reductase activities and the presence of the corresponding genes. Distribution in the different ribotypes of strains harboring both the narG and nosZ genes and of strains missing both genes suggests that these two groups of strains had different evolutionary histories. Both dissimilatory genes showed high polymorphism, with <b>similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> (Jaccard) of between 0. 04 and 0. 8, whereas those of the 16 S rRNA gene only varied from 0. 77 to 0. 99. No correlation between the <b>similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> of 16 S rRNA and dissimilatory genes was seen, suggesting that the evolution rates of ribosomal and functional genes differ. Pairwise comparison of <b>similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> of the narG and nosZ genes led to the delineation of two types of strains. Within the first type, the <b>similarity</b> <b>indexes</b> of both genes varied in the same range, suggesting that these two genes have followed a similar evolution.
