50|$|In a {{continuous}} reactor, {{the product is}} continuously pumped through the reactor. This pump {{can also be used}} to promote mixing. If the fluid velocity is sufficiently high, turbulent flow conditions exist (which promotes mixing). The disadvantage with this approach is that it leads to long reactors with high pressure drops and high minimum flow rates. This is particularly true where the reaction is slow or the product has high viscosity.This problem can be reduced with the use of <b>static</b> <b>mixers.</b> <b>Static</b> <b>mixers</b> are baffles in the flow channel which are used to promote mixing. They are able to work with or without turbulent conditions. <b>Static</b> <b>mixers</b> can be effective but still require relatively long flow channels and generate relatively high pressure drops.The oscillatory baffled reactor is specialised form of static mixer where the direction of process flow is cycled. This permits static mixing with low net flow through the reactor. This has the benefit of allowing the reactor to be kept comparatively short.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{significant}} improvements in agitator blade and baffle design, mixing in large batch reactors is ultimately constrained {{by the amount of}} energy that can be applied. On large vessels, mixing energies of more than 5 Watts per litre can put an unacceptable burden on the cooling system. High agitator loads can also create shaft stability problems. Where mixing is a critical parameter, the batch reactor is not the ideal solution. Much higher mixing rates can be achieved by using smaller flowing systems with high speed agitators, ultrasonic mixing or <b>static</b> <b>mixers.</b>|$|E

A new SVLX <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> is {{original}} {{designed by}} the author with the structure of alternative connection of the SV static mixing unit and cross shaped stationary helical fin. The two-phase flow is sheared, separated, impinged and rotated by SV static mixing unit, as well as whirled by the cross shaped stationary helical fin. Hence the mixer efficiency is enhanced. The most advantage of this design is the mixer efficiency is more enhanced with none applied force.

50|$|Liquid {{silicone}} rubbers are supplied in barrels. Because {{of their}} low viscosity, these rubbers can be pumped through pipelines and tubes to the vulcanization equipment. The two components are pumped through a <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> by a metering pump. One {{of the components}} contains the catalyst, typically platinum based. A coloring paste {{as well as other}} additives can also be added before the material enters the <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> section. In the <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> the components are well mixed and are transferred to the cooled metering section of the injection molding machine. The <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to solid silicone rubber materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by transfer molding and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, solid silicone rubber materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times.|$|R

The commercial software: COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS TM Version 3. 3 was used to simulate flow fields of mixed-gas reactants i. e. CO and H 2. The packed-bed was a single tube with the inside diameter of 0. 8 cm {{and the length of}} 1. 2 cm. The <b>static</b> <b>mixer</b> was inserted inside the tube.

Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations were used to model the gas flow inside the beds at steady state condition, in which the inlet Reynolds Number (Re) was 2. 31.

This could help improving the overall performance of the packed-bed, which could be utilized for heterogeneous catalytic reaction such as reforming and Fischer-Tropsch reactions...|$|R
5000|$|A {{static mixer}} is a {{precision}} engineered device for the continuous mixing of fluid materials. [...] Normally the fluids to be mixed are liquid, but <b>static</b> <b>mixers</b> {{can also be}} used to mix gas streams, disperse gas into liquid or blend immiscible liquids.

Mixer size can vary from about 6 mm to 6 meters diameter. Typical construction materials for static mixer components included stainless steel, polypropylene, Teflon, PVDF, PVC, CPVC and polyacetal.
