25|$|In {{computer}} network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a spoofed denial-of-service attack. In {{this kind of}} attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the <b>source</b> <b>address</b> in IP packets sent to the victim. In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.|$|E
25|$|A {{smurf attack}} relies on misconfigured network devices that allow packets {{to be sent}} to all {{computer}} hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network, rather than a specific machine. The attacker will send large numbers of IP packets with the <b>source</b> <b>address</b> faked to appear to be the address of the victim. The network's bandwidth is quickly used up, preventing legitimate packets from getting through to their destination.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a large scale}} longitudinal study of the spatial and temporal features of malicious <b>source</b> <b>addresses.</b> The basis of our study is a 402 -day trace of over 7 billion Internet intrusion attempts provided by DShield. org, which includes 160 million unique <b>source</b> <b>addresses.</b> Specifically, we focus on spatial distributions and temporal characteristics of malicious sources. First, we find {{that one out of}} 27 hosts is potentially a scanning source among 2 32 IPv 4 addresses. We then show that malicious sources have a persistent, non-uniform spatial distribution. That is, more than 80 % of the sources send packets from the same 20 % of the IPv 4 address space over time. We also find that 7. 3 % of malicious <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> are unroutable, and that some <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> are correlated. Next, we show that most sources have a short lifetime. 57. 9 % of the <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> appear only once in the trace, and 90 % of <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> appear less than 5 times. These results have implications for both attacks and defenses. I...|$|R

2500|$|A {{distributed}} {{denial-of-service attack}} may involve sending forged requests of some type to {{a very large number}} of computers that will reply to the requests.

2500|$|... 6to4 embeds an IPv6 packet in the payload {{portion of}} an IPv4 packet with {{protocol}} type 41. To send an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network to a 6to4 destination address, an IPv4 header with protocol type 41 is prepended to the IPv6 packet. [...] The IPv4 destination address for the prepended packet header {{is derived from}} the IPv6 destination address of the inner packet (which is in the format of a 6to4 address), by extracting the 32 bits immediately following the IPv6 destination address's 2002::/16 prefix. The IPv4 <b>source</b> <b>address</b> in the prepended packet header is the IPv4 address of the host or router which is sending the packet over IPv4. The resulting IPv4 packet is then routed to its IPv4 destination address just like any other IPv4 packet.|$|E

2500|$|As stated above, the ETSI {{architecture}} is equally applicable to IP-based services where IRI (or CD) {{is dependent on}} parameters associated with the traffic from a given application to be intercepted. [...] For example, {{in the case of}} email IRI would be similar to the header information on an email message (e.g., destination email address, source email address, time email was transmitted) as well as pertinent header information within the IP packets conveying the message (e.g., source IP address of email server originating the email message). [...] Of course, more in-depth information would be obtained by the interception system so as to avoid the usual email address spoofing that often takes place (e.g., spoofing of <b>source</b> <b>address).</b> [...] Voice-over-IP likewise has its own IRI, including data derived from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that are used to set up and tear down a VOIP call.|$|E
50|$|While the IETF {{document}} BCP 38 on ingress filtering {{does not}} specify {{a method of}} implementing <b>source</b> <b>address</b> filtering, some router vendors have implemented a mechanism which employs lookups in the router's tables to perform this check.

If the interface has no route to the <b>source</b> <b>address,</b> the packet {{is assumed to be}} part of a denial of service attack, using a false or spoofed <b>source</b> <b>address,</b> and the router discards the packet.|$|E

If fraudsters move to using <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> at a major interconnect partner, it may become unfeasible to block these addresses, due to the potential impact on normal interconnect services.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Internet {{background}} radiation, the fundamentally unproductive {{traffic that}} arises from misconfigurations and malicious activities, is pervasive and has complex characteristics. Understanding the network locations of hosts that generate background radiation {{can be helpful}} in the development of new techniques aimed at reducing this unwanted traffic. This paper presents an initial investigation of the network locations of hosts that generate malicious background radiation using <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> in packet traces from network telescopes, firewalls and intrusion detection systems distributed throughout the Internet. We characterize background radiation <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> across the IPv 4 address space for / 8, / 16 and / 24 aggregates. Using a conservative multiscale density estimation method, we find that <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> of background radiation form {{a relatively small number of}} tight clusters – i. e., that the distribution of <b>source</b> <b>addresses</b> exhibits characteristics of a highly irregular multifractal with a broad spectrum that is consistent over all of our data. We verify that the distributional properties are consistent with multifractals, and propose a multiscale multiplicative innovations (MMI) model for host locations that can be used to generate random variates with the same distributional properties as our empirical data. This model is targeted for use in analytic, simulation and emulation evaluations of methods for reducing unwanted traffic as well as potential real time monitoring and detection applications. ...|$|R

30|$|For the Field Rewrite Problem, {{we assume}} a {{scenario}} where the FlowVisor is configured {{so that a}} given network controller has only access to packets with a specific header field value, for example only packets with <b>source</b> IP <b>address</b> 192.168. 1.1. If this controller tries to create a flow to control packets with any <b>source</b> IP <b>address,</b> using a wildcard value, FlowVisor rewrites the controller’s request so that the flow’s <b>source</b> IP <b>address</b> is the allowed value 192.168. 1.1. The problem is that any types of actions are still allowed to the controller, such as header field modification actions. As a consequence, a malicious controller could modify the header of its own packets, disguising them as packets belonging to another slice. This would allow a malicious controller to inject packets in other virtual network’s traffic. Although we have used <b>source</b> IP <b>address</b> in our example, the problem also exists for other fields: destination IP <b>address,</b> <b>source</b> MAC <b>address,</b> destination MAC <b>address,</b> <b>source</b> Transport port, destination Transport port or any combination of the these fields.|$|R
