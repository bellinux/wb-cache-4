40|$|Page layout {{analysis}} {{is a fundamental}} step of any document image understanding system. We introduce an approach that segments text appearing in page mar-gins (a. k. a <b>side-notes</b> text) from manuscripts with com-plex layout format. Simple and discriminative features are extracted in a connected-component level and sub-sequently robust feature vectors are generated. Multi-layer perception classifier is exploited to classify con-nected components to the relevant class of text. A voting scheme is then applied to refine the resulting segmenta-tion and produce the final classification. In contrast to state-of-the-art segmentation approaches, this method is independent of block segmentation, as well as pixel level analysis. The proposed method has been trained and tested on a dataset that contains a variety of com-plex <b>side-notes</b> layout formats, achieving a segmenta-tion accuracy of about 95 %. ...|$|R

5000|$|Israeli {{military}} historian Uri Milstein {{wrote in}} 1998 that Pa'il {{was not in}} Deir Yassin on April 9. Milstein said there were contradictions in Pa'il's claims and an absence of any mention of Pa'il in other Haganah accounts of the incident. All Irgun and Lehi veterans Milstein interviewed denied having seen Pa'il in Deir Yassin, and the Lehi intelligence officer who Pa'il claimed invited him to Deir Yassin denied having done so. In addition, Haganah members {{who were in the}} area (including the deputy commander of the Palmach force that took part in the attack), some of whom personally knew Pa'il and were specifically mentioned in his account, denied having seen him there. Milstein argues that there was no organized massacre, though according to Morris he acknowledges that whole families were gunned down during the fighting. According to Milstein, Pa'il said he despised the [...] "dissidents" [...] of the Irgun and Lehi, thus giving him a political motive to submit a falsified report. Milstein also wrote that Haganah intelligence reports on the incident were doctored by the authors or their superiors to discredit the Irgun and Lehi because of political in-fighting within the Jewish community. Morris challenges Milstein's version that Pa'il was not at Deir Yassin that day with his observation that part of Pa’il’s report, that he saw the bodies of five Arabs in a quarry, [...] "is apparently reinforced by a report by two Jewish doctors, who also report having found five male bodies in a house by the village quarry". In a presentation to the PEACE Middle East Dialog Group, Ami Isseroff, translator of Milstein's book into English, provided <b>side-notes</b> critical of many aspects of Milstein's work, including much of his information about Pa'il and also about the incompleteness of his sources - [...] "Both Milstein and Yitzhak Levi leave out key testimony by Yehoshua Gorodenchik, from the Jabotinsky archives, in which he admits that Irgun troops murdered about 80 prisoners - mostly men - corresponding to accounts of refugees." ...|$|R

He thereby derives the term 'General Systemantics' in deference to the notion of a sweeping theory of system failure, but attributed to an intrinsic feature based on laws of system behavior.
