5|$|Crazy Taxi City Rush was {{announced}} by Sega in March 2014 as a free-to-play mobile title for iOS and Android systems. City Rush is a mission-based runner similar in concept to Temple Run, where the player {{does not have}} direct control {{of the speed of}} the taxi but can use touch motions to <b>swerve</b> in traffic and make turns.|$|E
5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would <b>swerve</b> through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E
5|$|The undercard {{included}} {{a match for}} the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Diesel and Razor Ramon, which Ramon won to regain the title. The other major angle going into SummerSlam was a feud in which Tatanka accused Lex Luger of joining the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. This storyline {{turned out to be}} a <b>swerve,</b> as Tatanka was revealed to have secretly joined the corporation.|$|E
60|$|Always moving on--from {{place to}} place, friend to friend: and always {{swinging}} away from sympathy. As soon as sympathy, like a soft hand, was {{reached out to}} touch him, away he <b>swerved,</b> instinctively, as a harmless snake <b>swerves</b> and <b>swerves</b> and <b>swerves</b> away from an outstretched hand. Away he must go. And periodically he went back to Winifred.|$|R
50|$|The route was {{established}} in the 1920s, with the eastern end <b>swerving</b> north then east, ending at Boyero. By 1954, the eastern end no longer <b>swerved</b> north, and by 1970 the eastern end was extended to US 40/287 near Aroya with the entire highway paved.|$|R
60|$|In {{the silence}} and obscurity, in the sudden pause of action while I now waited and watched, my Thought rose to my lips, and my speech {{mechanically}} formed it into words. I whispered softly to myself: I will kill him when he comes out. My mind never <b>swerved</b> for an instant from this thought--never <b>swerved</b> towards myself; never <b>swerved</b> towards her. Grief was numbed at my heart; and the consciousness of my own misery was numbed with grief. Death chills all before it--and Death and my Thought were one.|$|R
5|$|Famed writer Paul Sheldon (Brian) {{has just}} {{finished}} his latest and final installment in his series entitled Snuggly Jeff, a series of children's books in which he kills off the titular character so he can focus on more serious work, despite objections from his agent, Marcia (Lois). While driving through a snowstorm, Paul accidentally hits Stephen King with his car, causing Paul to <b>swerve</b> {{off the road and}} crash into a snowbank, while King gets the idea for another novel within seconds and manages to finish writing the plot in just a few seconds before hitting the ground completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to <b>swerve</b> onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations {{to see how the}} cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to <b>swerve</b> to avoid him).|$|E

5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to <b>swerve</b> his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|E
5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault of the warehouse was filmed by three separate units. Kono's fight sequence was included to assert to the audience {{that she would be}} a valuable asset to the team. In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a shipping container was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The car would <b>swerve</b> away. The second take saw the car crash into the container with O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part of the sequence, McGarrett jumps over the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car. To make the scene a reality, the film crew made a three-part composite shot to ensure no harm came to O'Loughlin.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, aged 24, {{was killed}} in a {{motorcycle}} accident a day after returning to the band's home of Macon, Georgia. Allman was riding at a high speed in his motorcycle at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The flatbed truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to <b>swerve</b> his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing several internal organs. Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries. The loss devastated all who knew Allman, just as At Fillmore East climbed into the top 15 of the national album charts.|$|E

5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session on Friday was held {{before the two}} races. The session was held on a dirty track with lap times gradually improving over the 45-minute period when the cars cleaned the circuit. Nato set the fastest lap {{with a time of}} 1:55.392, ahead of Giovinazzi in second and Sirotkin third. Gasly was fourth-fastest; Rowland was fifth and Luca Ghiotto sixth. King, Arthur Pic, Marciello, and Sergio Canamasas rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was disrupted when King went onto the turn 15 run-off area and was required to <b>swerve</b> to avoid hitting a van parked at the corner. It prompted the activation of the virtual safety car (VSC) to allow the vehicle to be moved. Two further VSC periods were necessitated late in the session when Marciello and Gustav Malja slid off the track at the same corner, ending their sessions prematurely.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to <b>swerve</b> to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to <b>swerve</b> into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten months}} of training, Miller {{was offered a}} {{commission}} as a pilot officer. His best friend missed out, so he arranged for Flight Lieutenant Keith Johnson an Australian cricket official, to pull some strings, ensuring his friend's promotion. The pair were posted to 12 Advanced Flying Unit in Grantham, Lincolnshire in on 15 August 1944, which was an Operations Training Unit {{for the purpose of}} familiarising officers with flying aircraft. However, on a trip back to Ouston to visit their colleagues, a night of drunken revelry led to property damage and injury to another airman. Miller and his friend were charged with eight offences and faced possible expulsion. Luckily for Miller, the Commanding Officer (CO) at his new posting at Cranfield, Buckinghamshire was his old CO at Ouston. Miller was given another three-week disciplinary course, but his pleas convinced the CO to reduce the sentence to a fine for the property damage. Miller was allowed to resume his training in Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. Again he had a near miss, when some instruments on his plane failed and he was forced to land his Beaufighter for repairs. After the repairs, another pilot used the plane and the problem recurred. The second pilot crash-landed and was killed. Later, Miller was returning from a training mission over France and misjudged the runway, bouncing his plane on the tarmac. Trying to lift off again, only one engine responded and the unequal power supply caused the plane to <b>swerve,</b> missing the hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment that he had agreed to attend. A V1 rocket hit the venue and killed many of the patrons inside. In October, he went AWOL to watch violinist Yehudi Menuhin perform in London and was dismissed, but the CO revoked his decision on the condition that Miller play for his cricket team.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{attacked}} Heidfeld but {{collided with}} the rear-end of his car at turn eight, send him spinning {{into the path of}} his teammate Rosenqvist, who was unable to <b>swerve</b> to avoid him, and ploughed into his vehicle. It came after Rosenqvist was sent airborne following contact with Evans's rear wheel. Despite his vehicle's back-end sustaining damage, Evans told his team over the radio that he could continue, but Rosenqvist was forced to retire. Prost however was delayed long enough to allow Evans move ahead of him for fifth place. Heidfeld was unhurt and was able to rejoin the race. On lap 44, D'Ambrosio lost third position to Bird who passed him around the outside at turn three. D'Ambrosio then ran out of electrical energy, allowing Gutiérrez into tenth. Di Grassi conserved his electrical energy usage and crossed the start/finish line after 45 laps to win the race. Vergne finished second, 1.966 seconds behind with Bird in third, Evans fourth and Prost fifth. López recovered from his lap 35 spin to secure sixth place, and Abt took seventh. Carroll, Piquet and Gutiérrez completed the top-ten points-scoring positions. Frijns, Heidfeld, Buemi and d'Ambrosio filled the next four positions with Sarrazin and Rosenqvist the last of the classified finishers. It was di Grassi's first victory of the season and the fifth of his career. Di Grassi's win ended e.Dams-Renault's streak of six consecutive victories, extending back to the 2016 Berlin ePrix. Four drivers led the field and the lead changed three times {{during the course of the}} ePrix. Di Grassi led once for a total of 19 laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E
5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, <b>Swerve,</b> Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E
