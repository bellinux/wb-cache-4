5|$|In September 2009, Dixon {{became a}} {{judge on the}} seventh series of <b>Strictly</b> Come Dancing, {{replacing}} Arlene Phillips. The replacement of Phillips by Dixon attracted criticism, as some questioned the extent of Dixon's dancing knowledge. In 2010, Dixon returned for the eighth series of <b>Strictly</b> Come Dancing and released her third studio album, The Entertainer. In January 2012, shortly after completing the ninth series and her third year as a judge on <b>Strictly</b> Come Dancing, Dixon quit to become a judge on Britain's Got Talent. Her third studio album, Do It for Love, was released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group {{is defined as a}} group in which every <b>strictly</b> ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every <b>strictly</b> ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every <b>strictly</b> ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other tests have probed the {{validity}} of various versions of the equivalence principle; <b>strictly</b> speaking, all measurements of gravitational time dilation are tests of the weak version of that principle, not of general relativity itself. So far, general relativity has passed all observational tests.|$|E
5|$|According to 2006's Tattoos and Body Piercing, {{corporate}} dress codes {{can also}} <b>strictly</b> limit piercing displays.

5|$|Also, Newton {{describes}} QR as the {{versed sine}} of the arc with P at its centre and length twice QP. Although {{this is not}} <b>strictly</b> {{the same as the}} QR that he has in the diagram (Fig.1), in the limit, they become equal.|$|E

5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but the latter has larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm). The two can be distinguished in the field by their substrate preferences: while A.serialis usually fruits on coniferous wood, A.serialiformis grows <b>strictly</b> on old decorticated oak trunks.|$|E
5|$|As in all {{occupied}} {{countries in}} Europe, food, fuel and clothing were <b>strictly</b> rationed by the German authorities. Even with the stringent rationing, {{the food and}} materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available. A significant black market also existed in the country, supplying food illegally at very high prices to those that could afford it. Information and the press were <b>strictly</b> controlled by the German government and news was greatly restricted. Nevertheless, the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro-collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained high. A large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30,000.|$|E

5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be <b>strictly</b> massless. If the photon {{is not a}} <b>strictly</b> massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
