40|$|Aluminium foil in {{combination}} with laser fired contacts (FolMet) as rear side electrode for highly efficient passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) has proven a high efficiency potential of up to 21. 3 % using an optimized and simplified cell process. Two objectives towards industrialization are the acceleration of the laser process and the feasibility of module assembly. An ultrafast polygon scanning system and comprehensive simulations enabled process times tpro < 0. 8 s for 156 x 156 mm² wafers, which corresponds to an acceleration of processing speed {{by a factor of}} 20. An easy-to-apply possibility to realize the electrical interconnection between foil metallized cells, is the <b>single-side</b> <b>coating</b> of the aluminium foil using a special treatment. This process could be carried out before the foil attachment to the solar cell, which allows the usage of a fast and cheap role to role production tool. The created soldering pads are compatible with conventional interconnection techniques and modules assembled with this technique passed the humidity-freeze (HF 10) and temperature-cycle (TC 200) test successfully...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} cathode gas {{diffusion}} layer (GDL) with double-side microporous layer (MPL) coating {{on the performance}} of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) are tested under different relative humidity (RH) at air inlet. Standard commercial SGL ® 10 BA carbon paper is used as the substrate of GDL and it is coated with MPL {{on both sides of the}} paper with different carbon loadings and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) contents. Acetylene black is used as the carbon powder in the MPL composition. A single cell testing apparatus with adjustable RH at air inlet is constructed to measure the cell performance. The results show that the cell performance could be enhanced greatly under low air RH conditions by the employment of such a GDL with double-side MPL coating. The peak power density obtained at extremely low air RH condition may be increased more than 85 % in comparison with that of conventional GDL with <b>single-side</b> MPL <b>coating.</b> The optimal compositions of MPL on the surfaces facing to the catalyst layer and flow-channel plate are found to be 1. 2 mg/cm 2 and 0. 3 mg/c...|$|R
40|$|DE 102009004158 A 1 UPAB: 20100723 NOVELTY - The {{process for}} coating {{functional}} surfaces of symmetrically toothed components such as tooth flanks (3) of toothed wheels (1) using a coating source (2) rotating {{relative to the}} component and emitting a coating material {{in the form of}} electrically charged particles {{in the direction of the}} component, comprises shielding the component during the coating process in a peripheral area with a flat functional surface alignment inclined to a beam direction through an aperture (4) from coating beam arranged between the component and coating source transverse to the beam direction. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The process for coating functional surfaces of symmetrically toothed components such as tooth flanks (3) of toothed wheels (1) using a coating source (2) rotating relative to the component and emitting a coating material in the form of electrically charged particles in the direction of the component, comprises shielding the component during the coating process in a peripheral area with a flat functional surface alignment inclined to a beam direction through an aperture (4) from coating beam arranged between the component and coating source transverse to the beam direction. The component and the coating source are rotated relative to each other around a component axis irregularly with longer dwell times in the rotating position of the functional surfaces steeply engaged to the beam direction. The component is completely coated on half-side over the limit of the peripheral area through the aperture for <b>single-side</b> functional surface <b>coating</b> of the component. The coating is carried out with ion beam or plasma beam. The coating beam is deflected and/or bundled with magnetic and/or electric field. For toothed flanks coating of the bevel wheels, the bevel wheel is rotated around a bevel axis during the coating process and the bevel axis is obliquely engaged in the direction of the coating source. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for coating functional surfaces of symmetrically toothed components such as tooth flanks of toothed wheels. USE - Process for coating functional surfaces of symmetrically toothed components such as tooth flanks of toothed wheels. ADVANTAGE - The process is capable of simply and effectively coating the functional surfaces of the components with high-quality in a less time-consuming manner...|$|R
