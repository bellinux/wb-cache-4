50|$|Rural Free Delivery (RFD) is {{a service}} {{which began in}} the United States in the late 19th century, <b>to</b> deliver <b>mail</b> {{directly}} <b>to</b> rural farm families. Prior to RFD, individuals living in more remote homesteads had <b>to</b> pick <b>up</b> <b>mail</b> themselves at sometimes distant post offices or pay private carriers for delivery. RFD became a political football, with politicians promising it to voters and using it themselves to reach voters. The proposal to offer free rural delivery was not universally embraced. Private carriers and local shopkeepers feared a loss of business. The United States Post Office Department began experiments with Rural Free Delivery as early as 1890. However, it was not until 1893, when Georgia Congressman Thomas E. Watson pushed through legislation, that the practice was mandated. However, universal implementation was slow; RFD was not adopted generally in the United States Post Office until 1902. The rural delivery service uses a network of rural routes traveled by carriers to deliver and pick <b>up</b> <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> and from roadside mailboxes.|$|R

It is advocated that virtuality is mandatory to disseminate public health information, but that several crucial issues must be solved before the objective can be reached, among them the cultural, political and ethical issues of the endeavor. This paper includes a critical appraisal of the consequences for under-developed countries of the worldwide telecommunication expansion in the field of public health...|$|R
