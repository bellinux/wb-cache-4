25|$|<b>SMPTE</b> 297-2006 defines {{an optical}} fiber system for {{transmitting}} bit-serial digital signals It {{is intended for}} transmitting <b>SMPTE</b> ST 259 signals (143 through 360Mbit/s), <b>SMPTE</b> ST 344 signals (540Mbit/s), <b>SMPTE</b> ST 292-1/-2 signals (1.485Gbit/s and 1.485/1.001Gbit/s) and <b>SMPTE</b> ST 424 signals (2.970Gbit/s and 2.970/1.001Gbit/s). In addition to optical specification, ST 297 also mandates laser safety testing and that all optical interfaces are labelled to indicate safety compliance, application and interoperability.|$|E
25|$|The SDTI {{interface}} is {{specified by}} <b>SMPTE</b> 305M. The HD-SDTI interface is specified by <b>SMPTE</b> 348M.|$|E
25|$|The 1035-line HD {{standards}} {{specified by}} <b>SMPTE</b> 260M (primarily used in Japan and now largely considered obsolete), used a colorimetry matrix specified by <b>SMPTE</b> 240M. This colorimetry is nowadays rarely used, as the 1035-line formats have been superseded by 1080-line formats.|$|E
50|$|<b>SMPTE's</b> first {{standard}} in 1917 was for {{speed at which}} film is shown.|$|R
5000|$|The regular {{projection}} of technical test films, e.g. the <b>SMPTE's</b> RP-40 and Dolby's [...] "Jiffy" [...] films, {{to evaluate the}} image and sound quality in the theater.|$|R
50|$|The Progress Medal, instituted in 1935, is <b>SMPTE's</b> {{oldest and}} most prestigious medal, and awarded {{annually}} for technical contributions to the progress of engineering phases {{of the motion picture}} and/or television industries.|$|R
25|$|Additional SDI {{standards}} {{have been introduced}} to support increasing video resolutions (HD, UHD and beyond), frame rates, stereoscopic (3D) video, and color depth. Dual link HD-SDI consists {{of a pair of}} <b>SMPTE</b> 292M links, standardized by <b>SMPTE</b> 372M in 1998; this provides a nominal 2.970Gbit/s interface used in applications (such as digital cinema or HDTV 1080P) that require greater fidelity and resolution than standard HDTV can provide. 3G-SDI (standardized in <b>SMPTE</b> 424M) consists of a single 2.970Gbit/s serial link that allows replacing dual link HD-SDI. 6G-SDI and 12G-SDI standards were published on March 19, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>SMPTE</b> 259M, <b>SMPTE</b> 292M {{supports}} the <b>SMPTE</b> 291M standard for ancillary data. Ancillary data is provided as a standardized transport for non-video payload within a serial digital signal; {{it is used}} for things such as embedded audio, closed captions, timecode, and other sorts of metadata. Ancillary data is indicated by a 3-word packet consisting of 0, 3FF, 3FF (the opposite of the synchronization packet header), followed by a two-word identification code, a data count word (indicating 0 - 255 words of payload), the actual payload, and a one-word checksum. Other than in their use in the header, the codes prohibited to video payload are also prohibited to ancillary data payload.|$|E
25|$|<b>SMPTE</b> ST 299-2:2010 {{extends the}} 3G SDI {{interface}} {{to be able}} to transmit 32 audio channels (16 pairs) on a single link.|$|E
5000|$|Under these circumstances, <b>SMPTE's</b> {{inaugural meeting}} was {{essentially}} a call for proposals for 3D television; more than 160 people from 80 companies signed up for this first meeting. Vendors that presented their respective technologies at the task force meeting included SENSIO Technologies, [...] Philips, Dynamic Digital Depth (DDD), TDVision, and Real D, all of which had 3D distribution technologies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract MPEG- 21 BSDL {{provides}} {{a solution for}} discovering {{the structure of a}} binary media resource to generate its XML description, and for the generation of an adapted media resource using a transformed description. So far, most literature related to XML-driven video content adaptation deals with the exploitation of temporal scalability by dropping certain pictures. This paper takes it a step further by focusing on how description-driven exploitation of temporal scalability can be realized by replacing coded pictures by placeholder pictures. Such an approach allows for a transparent integration with the systems layer in modern multimedia architectures. Our XML-based replacement technique will be discussed from a high-level point of view for MPEG-{ 1, 2 } Video, MPEG- 4 Visual, and <b>SMPTE’s</b> Video Codec 1 (VC- 1). A more detailed analysis, including some performance measurements, will be provided for H. 264 /MPEG- 4 AVC as its technical design is the most challenging one. ...|$|R
25|$|For HDTV applications, {{the serial}} digital {{interface}} is defined by <b>SMPTE</b> 292M. Two bit rates are defined, 1.485Gbit/s, and 1.485/1.001Gbit/s. The factor of 1/1.001 is provided to allow <b>SMPTE</b> 292M to support video formats with frame rates of 59.94Hz, 29.97Hz, and 23.98Hz, {{in order to be}} compatible with existing NTSC systems. The 1.485Gbit/s version of the standard supports other frame rates in widespread use, including 60Hz, 50Hz, 30Hz, 25Hz, and 24Hz. It is common to collectively refer to both standards as using a nominal bit rate of 1.5Gbit/s.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} <b>SMPTE</b> 349M: Transport of Alternate Source Image Formats through <b>SMPTE</b> 292M, specifies a {{means to}} encapsulate non-standard and lower-bitrate video formats within an HD-SDI interface. This standard allows, for example, several independent standard definition video signals to be multiplexed onto an HD-SDI interface, and transmitted down one wire. This standard doesn't merely adjust EAV and SAV timing {{to meet the requirements}} of the lower-bitrate formats; instead, it provides a means by which an entire SDI format (including synchronization words, ancillary data, and video payload) can be encapsulated and transmitted as ordinary data payload within a 292M stream.|$|E
25|$|Both the HD and SD serial {{interfaces}} provide for 16 channels of embedded audio. The two interfaces use different audio encapsulation methods— SD uses the <b>SMPTE</b> 272M standard, whereas HD uses the <b>SMPTE</b> 299M standard. In either case, an SDI signal may contain up to sixteen audio channels (8 pairs) embedded 48kHz, 24-bit audio channels {{along with the}} video. Typically, 48kHz, 24-bit (20-bit in SD, but extendable to 24 bit) PCM audio is stored, in a manner directly compatible with the AES3 digital audio interface. These are placed in the (horizontal) blanking periods, when the SDI signal carries nothing useful, since the receiver generates its own blanking signals from the TRS.|$|E
25|$|Mashpee High School {{is home to}} the Mashpee Chapter of <b>SMPTE,</b> the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. This {{chapter is}} the first and only high school chapter in the world {{to be a part of}} this {{organization}} and has received much recognition within the Los Angeles broadcasting industry as a result.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{expanded}} specification called SDTI (Serial Data Transport Interface), which allows compressed (i.e. DV, MPEG and others) video streams {{to be transported}} over an SDI line. This allows for multiple video streams in one cable or faster-than-realtime (2x, 4x,...) video transmission. A related standard, known as HD-SDTI, provides similar capability over an <b>SMPTE</b> 292M interface.|$|E
25|$|For {{standard}} definition applications, {{as defined}} by <b>SMPTE</b> 259M, the possible bit rates are 270Mbit/s, 360Mbit/s, 143Mbit/s, and 177Mbit/s. 270Mbit/s {{is by far the}} most commonly used; though the 360Mbit/s interface (used for widescreen standard definition) is sometimes encountered. The 143 and 177Mbit/s interfaces were intended for transmission of composite-encoded (NTSC or PAL) video digitally, and are now considered obsolete.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the first}} major change was the advent of music {{sequencer}} technology. Prior to its introduction all synchronisation was achieved by adding <b>SMPTE</b> time code to analogue tape. This acted as a reference point so that individual tracks could be easily synchronised. With the advent of MIDI hardware, devices {{could be used to}} synchronise any MIDI device and eventually MIDI Time Code or MTC became an alternative method of synchronising studio activity. Continuing development in this area has led to computer-controlled sequencing.|$|E
25|$|VPID (or video payload identifier) packets are {{increasingly}} {{used to describe}} the video format. In early versions of the serial digital interface, it was always possible to uniquely determine the video format by counting the number of lines and samples between H and V transitions in the TRS. With the introduction of dual link interfaces, and segmented-frame standards, this is no longer possible; thus the VPID standard (defined by <b>SMPTE</b> 352M) provides a way to uniquely and unambiguously identify the format of the video payload.|$|E
500|$|The {{beginning}} {{opens with}} Patchy the Pirate, {{as he has}} presumably lost the [...] "Lost Episode of SpongeBob" [...] prior to the episode. After laminating that he lost the episode, he sets off to find it using a treasure map. Throughout several difficulties, he eventually finds a slightly dirty VHS tape which holds the episode. He then returns home in glee, and watches the episode. However, the tape only shows a clip of SpongeBob doing a series of walk cycles to techno music before abruptly showing the <b>SMPTE</b> color bars. Patchy gets angry, thinking SpongeBob betrayed him, and gets rid of his SpongeBob merchandise, including his SpongeBob underwear, which results in him running away. The real episode then begins to start playing, and Patchy returns, fixes all of his stuff, then enjoys the episode.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used <b>SMPTE</b> timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'. But it really shoulda been much better. If we had more time and we didn't {{have to deal with the}} situation of nobody talking".|$|E
2500|$|Serial digital {{interface}} (SDI) {{is a family}} of digital video interfaces first standardized by <b>SMPTE</b> (The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) in 1989. For example, ITU-R BT.656 and <b>SMPTE</b> 259M define digital video interfaces used for broadcast-grade video. [...] A related standard, known as high-definition serial {{digital interface}} (HD-SDI), is standardized in <b>SMPTE</b> 292M; this provides a nominal data rate of 1.485Gbit/s.|$|E
2500|$|A nominal 3Gbit/s {{interface}} (more accurately, 2.97Gbit/s, but {{commonly referred}} to as [...] "3 gig") was standardized by <b>SMPTE</b> as 424M in 2006. Revised in 2012 as <b>SMPTE</b> ST 424:2012, it supports all of the features supported by the dual 1.485Gbit/s interface, but requires only one cable rather than two.|$|E

2500|$|For very high-definition applications, {{requiring}} greater resolution, frame rate, {{or color}} fidelity than the HD-SDI interface can provide, the <b>SMPTE</b> 372M standard defines the dual link interface. As the name suggests, this interface {{consists of two}} <b>SMPTE</b> 292M interconnects operating in parallel. In particular, the dual link interface supports 10-bit, 4:2:2, 1080P formats at frame rates of 60Hz, 59.94Hz, and 50Hz, as well as 12-bit color depth, RGB encoding, and [...] colour sampling.|$|E

2500|$|Special {{effort has}} been made to build {{accessibility}} features into digital projection systems (see digital cinema). Through <b>SMPTE,</b> standards now exist that dictate how open and closed captions, as well as hearing-impaired and visually impaired narrative audio, are packaged {{with the rest of the}} digital movie. This eliminates the proprietary caption distributions required for film, and the associated royalties. <b>SMPTE</b> has also standardized the communication of closed caption content between the digital cinema server and 3rd-party closed caption systems (the CSP/RPL protocol). As a result, new, competitive closed caption systems for digital cinema are now emerging that will work with any standards-compliant digital cinema server. These newer closed caption devices include cupholder-mounted electronic displays and wireless glasses which display caption text in front of the wearer's eyes. [...] Bridge devices are also available to enable the use of Rear Window systems. As of mid-2010, the remaining challenge to the wide introduction of accessibility in digital cinema is the industry-wide transition to <b>SMPTE</b> DCP, the standardized packaging method for very high quality, secure distribution of digital movies.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (<b>SMPTE)</b> {{inducted}} Logie Baird into The Honor Roll, which [...] "posthumously recognizes {{individuals who}} were not awarded Honorary Membership during their lifetimes but whose contributions would have been sufficient to warrant such an honor".|$|E
2500|$|Scores for the {{acoustic}} tracks were emailed to his Berlin scoring stage, and would require from four musicians {{to the full}} orchestra, with a maximum of 24 present at any one time. One of three conductors would also be required for any score that involved more than 6 musicians. Franke would direct recording sessions via six fibre optic digital telephone lines to transmit and receive video, music and the <b>SMPTE</b> timecode. The final edit and mixing of the tracks would take place in his Los Angeles studio. Initially concerned composing for an episodic television show could become [...] "annoying because of the repetition", Franke found the evolving characters and story of Babylon 5 afforded {{him the opportunity to}} continually [...] "push the envelope".|$|E
2500|$|On April 26, 1986, MacDougall {{worked at}} his shop as normal, and closed at 4:00p.m. EST. After eating dinner, he {{reported}} to Central Florida Teleport with one other engineer on duty. The second engineer left at 6:00p.m., leaving MacDougall {{to operate the}} building on his own. MacDougall oversaw the uplink of the movie Pee-wee's Big Adventure {{as part of the}} evening's programming for the pay-per-view network People's Choice, which used Central Florida Teleport's facilities. After the film ended, he went through his regular routine. Before logging off, MacDougall set up <b>SMPTE</b> color bars and punched buttons on a Microgen MG-100 character generator that placed letters on the television screen. He spent a couple of minutes composing his message. MacDougall began his message with a polite greeting as he did not wish to be insulting. He selected the name [...] "Captain Midnight" [...] from a film he had recently seen: On the Air Live with Captain Midnight (not associated with the popular Captain Midnight radio show of the 1940s).|$|E

2500|$|HBO became {{involved}} in several lawsuits during the 1980s, involving legal statutes imposed by state and city laws that {{would have resulted in}} some programs on HBO and other pay television networks being censored by cable systems, if not forcing the pay services to edit inappropriate content from the programming they aired. In January 1986, HBO became the first satellite-delivered television network to encrypt its signal from unauthorized viewing by way of the Videocipher II system; this initially resulted in a mass lodge of complaints from television receive-only (TVRO) satellite users that previously received HBO's programming without a subscription. The objections by TVRO users over having to now pay for HBO as cable subscribers had long done (requiring dish subscribers to purchase an expensive descrambler to unencrypt the signal) came to a head four months later, as HBO became a victim of broadcast signal intrusion when satellite television dealer John R. MacDougall, a Florida man calling himself [...] "Captain Midnight", redirected a receiver dish towards the network's transponder on Galaxy 1 and intercepted its signal during a movie presentation of The Falcon and the Snowman; MacDougall overrode the telecast of the film with a text-based message placed over <b>SMPTE</b> color bars in protest of the channel's decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers. The Federal Communications Commission subsequently prosecuted MacDougall for committing the intrusion.|$|E
50|$|<b>SMPTE</b> 372M is a {{standard}} published by <b>SMPTE</b> which expands upon <b>SMPTE</b> 259M, <b>SMPTE</b> 344M, and <b>SMPTE</b> 292M allowing for bit-rates of 2.970 Gbit/s, and 2.970/1.001 Gbit/s over two wires.
