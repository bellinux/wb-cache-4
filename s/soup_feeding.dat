Dylan had a tune, {{the last line of}} each verse (i.e., the title), and the chorus." ...|$|R

50|$|Markievicz {{also joined}} James Connolly's socialist Irish Citizen Army (ICA), a small {{volunteer}} force formed {{in response to}} the lock-out of 1913, to defend the demonstrating workers from the police. Markievicz recruited volunteers to peel potatoes in a basement while she and others worked on distributing the food. As all the food was paid out of her own pocket, Markievicz was forced to take out many loans, at this time, and sold all her jewellery. That same year, with Inghinidhe na hÉireann, she ran a <b>soup</b> kitchen to <b>feed</b> poor school children.|$|R
50|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands on}} the Association led to Strzelecki being appointed Executive Director in May 1847, and several extra volunteer agents were taken on {{to assist in the}} relief effort. Lord Robert Clinton, Lord James Butler and Matthew James Higgins were among those who offered their services. By summer 1847 a temporary relief measure {{in the form of an}} Ireland-wide network of <b>soup</b> kitchens was <b>feeding</b> 3 million people a day. At this point, the BRA decided to reduce the scope of its own operations, and only Strzelecki remained in Ireland on the Association's behalf at the end of June.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was also}} {{well known for}} his philanthropy. During the Great Irish Famine in April 1847, he {{implemented}} a network of <b>soup</b> kitchens to <b>feed</b> the poor. His [...] "famine soup" [...] was served to thousands of the poor for free. Soyer wrote a number of bestselling books about cooking, one of them even selling {{over a quarter of}} a million copies. His 1854 book A Shilling Cookery for the People was a recipe book for ordinary people who could not afford elaborate kitchen utensils or large amounts of exotic ingredients. Other works included The Gastronomic Regenerator [...] (1846), The modern Housewife or ménagère (1849) and Soyer's Culinary Campaign (1857).|$|R
5000|$|At the hospital, {{they are}} unable to find any record and learn Travers is waiting there for them. He reveals that he has no Earth {{certificate}} because he has not been born yet — he is a time traveler. He will be born in this hospital tomorrow. In the future, with the fence erected, there are no aliens to do the menial work on Earth. This causes Earth's economy to collapse and starvation and civil unrest becomes common around the globe. Nixon then eliminates the remaining working class and turns them into [...] "Soylent Majority" [...] <b>soup</b> to <b>feed</b> the poor. Nixon assigns those tasks to the robots. The robots, led by Bender, turn against humanity. Travers was sent back from fifteen years in the future (using a copy of the time travel code from Futurama: Bender's Big Score) to stop Nixon from winning this election. Travers, after arriving in the past, had spent the last several years becoming the best candidate to run against Nixon to prevent this future from happening. Leela realizes that this is a compelling story, and arranges for Travers' birth to be broadcast live to the world to prove definitively that he was born on Earth.|$|R
5000|$|Plankinton died in {{his home}} {{on the evening of}} March 29, 1891, {{attended}} by his family, close friend Jeremiah Quin, and his long-time doctor. He was buried in the Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee [...] and a large monument and pillar is built on the site. [...] Other family members buried there include both of John's wives and all of three of his children. [...] The obituary began: [...] "Milwaukee today mourns the loss of her foremost citizen, whose generous public spirit and many deeds of benevolence, whose great business ability and modest, upright life are imperishably written on the pages of Milwaukee's history." [...] Acts of philanthropy include Plankinton's donation of two lots for the formation of the First Holland Presbyterian Church, which subsequently became the Perseverance Presbyterian Church. [...] Plankinton also supported the formation of a <b>soup</b> house to <b>feed</b> the poor, by providing the building rent-free, along with a generous amount of money, and a daily supply of meat.|$|R
40|$|Problem Statement: Each semester, the OMIS 498 Capstone course {{creates a}} new SharePoint site in order to {{facilitate}} team collaboration, causing wasted time and lost resources. When a new site is created, it a standard, featureless site that must be rebuilt from the ground up. The gap that my work addressed was to find ways to easier facilitate the SharePoint site in such a way to better utilize its features, and make transitions to future semesters more seamless. Methods: My work consisted of a four-phase process. It started with envisioning an optimal state of functionality. This was done by working with Dr. Aase to determine a desired state, and working with team leaders within our class. Then I planned my approach, which included research and working to get the SharePoint web server configured to allow features and maximum functionality. Next, I developed team sites, pages, templates and started enabling features such as alerts and calendars to improve class productivity. The class began using the SharePoint site early in the development phase. Finally, during the stabilization phase, I troubleshot any quirks, took requests for added features and made sure optimal features were being used. Results: As a result of the above process, the team collaboration portal has been used successfully by our class {{for the majority of the}} semester. Large quantities of data have been uploaded to the SharePoint site without issue, alerts and calendars are working and information is flowing as it should through the site. We also used the website to coordinate community service efforts with a local <b>soup</b> kitchen, <b>Feed</b> em' <b>Soup.</b> Conclusion: Overall, I am very satisfied with the results of the SharePoint team collaboration portal. There were some kinks in the beginning of the project relating to server configuration and settings within SharePoint itself. Once these issues were addressed, operations ran very smoothly. Ultimately, the class was able to fully utilize the team sites and its features, creating a better, more efficient flow of information for the teams. B. A. (Bachelor of Arts...|$|R
