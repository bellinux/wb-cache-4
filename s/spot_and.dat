5|$|After World War II, {{the vacant}} {{site of the}} former synagogue {{was used as a}} {{makeshift}} volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building, constructed in 1959. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same <b>spot,</b> <b>and</b> a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it remains to this day.|$|E

5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty <b>spot,</b> <b>and</b> grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{including}} bacteria, fungi, {{and viruses}} are important as plant pathogens, causing disease to crop plants. Fungi cause serious crop {{diseases such as}} maize leaf rust, wheat stem rust, and powdery mildew. Bacteria cause plant diseases including leaf <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> crown galls. Viruses cause plant diseases such as leaf mosaic. The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes potato blight, contributing to the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s.|$|E

In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 season {{opened with}} the Devils' roster {{suffering}} with injuries, and consequently the team accumulated losses. On December 26, Peter DeBoer {{was fired from}} the head coach position. To replace him, Lamoriello invested in two head coaches, former Devils player Scott Stevens (who had been DeBoer's assistant for two years) and Adam Oates, with Lamoriello himself supervising the team during the first months. The Devils finished the season as the sixth-worst team in the League, 20 points away from a playoff <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> with just one victory in the last 11 games.|$|E

However, Benko (and the reserve Lombardy) gave up his <b>spot,</b> <b>and</b> FIDE President Max Euwe controversially allowed Fischer to participate instead. A compensation of US$1,500 was paid to Benko for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{wash the}} beans {{several times to}} remove {{the remains of the}} skin and coating and put them out on shaded racks to dry. Cooperative employees turn the beans regularly as technicians <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> remove bad beans.

This last process reduces the water content of the bean from 40 percent to 12 percent.|$|E

5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Before {{training}} camp, it was {{not expected}} he would start the season with the Avalanche, but rather for an affiliate team of the Avalanche. However, Steve Konowalchuk's career-ending heart problem opened a roster <b>spot</b> <b>and</b> Stastny's play impressed Avalanche coach Joel Quenneville. Stastny started the season with the jersey number 62 until his teammate John-Michael Liles (switching to #4) changed his to let Stastny use #26, the same his father wore when he played for the franchise while it was in Quebec. Stastny had his first NHL assist on a goal by Wojtek Wolski in his third NHL game, on October 8 against the Vancouver Canucks. On October 21, in his eighth NHL game and first wearing number 26, Stastny scored his first NHL goal in Montreal against David Aebischer of the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E
