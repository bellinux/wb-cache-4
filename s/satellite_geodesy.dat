The current time-delay equation of satellite laser ranging given by International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service is in agreement with this accuracy.

The accuracy of our model arrives at the micrometer (similar to 0. 01 ps) level.

30|$|Meanwhile, a new {{topographic}} {{field is}} established around LMS by merging Global Topography V 18.1 (Smith and Sandwell 1997) data with GPS measurements using a similar method. Global Topography V 18.1 is a {{digital elevation model}} (DEM) data, and it is updated continuously by the recent <b>satellite</b> and <b>geodesy</b> data. Specifically, the terrestrial data of the DEM are based on SRTM 30 PLUS with 30 ″ resolution. Though the accuracy of SRTM is higher than Aster GDEM 2011, not every area is covered well by SRTM data. Therefore, the areas filled by void still persist in the SRTM (Jing et al. 2013). After testing Global Topography V 18.1 data with 30 ″, we find no void areas exist in the study area. Considering the updated frequency and accuracy, we chose Global Topography V 18.1 as the DEM data in flexure analysis. On the other hand, due to the high resolution (1 ′′ ×  1 ′′) of Aster GDEM 2011, this DEM data can support more detail near field elevation information than global topography V 18.1 around the observation points. Thus, Aster GDEM 2011 is more suitable than SRTM 30 PLUS for terrain correction.|$|R

The physical and optical properties are used to determine proper position of the solar image on the satellite's surface, resulting in more precise geometric geodesy.

We describe the various actions planned in this project. We first detail the actions planned in gravimetry which consist in two main surface gravity experiments: {{on the one hand}} the periodic repetition of absolute gravity measurements along a north-south monsoonal gradient of rainfall in West Africa, going from Tamanrasset (20 mm/year) in southern Algeria to Djougou (1200 mm/year) in central Benin; on the other hand the continuous measurements at Djougou (Benin) with a superconducting gravimeter to monitor with a higher sampling rate the gravity changes related to an extreme hydrological cycle. Another section describes the actions planned in GPS which will maintain and develop the present-day existing network in West Africa. The third type of actions deals with hydrology and we review the three sites that will be investigated in this joint hydro-geophysics project namely Wankama (near Niamey) and Bagara (near Diffa) in the Niger Sahelian zone and Nalohou (near Djougou) in the Benin monsoon zone. We also address the question of the ground truth of satellite-derived missions; in this context the GHYRAF project will lead to test the hydrology models by comparison both with in situ and satellite data such as GRACE, as well as to an important increase of our knowledge of the seasonal water cycle in Africa. We finally present preliminary results in GPS based on the analysis of the vertical motion of the Djougou site.

40|$|Geodesy is a {{suite of}} {{powerful}} earth observation techniques (and associated methodologies and analysis tools) that is making a vital contribution to science and society. Yet geodesy is not a new, child-of-today’s-technology science – dating back hundreds of years (some would claim thousands of years, and that the Ancient Greeks, and other pre-Christian cultures shaped its direction). This is illustrated by its classical definition as the science of measuring and mapping the geometry, orientation and gravity field of the earth (these days we include their variations with time). At a pragmatic, or engineering level geodetic practice is the foundation for surveying, navigation and mapping (and the digital datasets underpinning these activities). What has enabled geodesy to change from an esoteric “natural science ” that underpins the making of maps to today’s cutting edge geoscience? There {{are a number of}} explanations. Firstly modern geodesy relies on space technology, and enormous strides have been made in accuracy, resolution and coverage due to advances in satellite sensors and an expanding portfolio of <b>satellite</b> missions. Secondly, <b>geodesy</b> can measure earth parameters that no other remote sensing technique can, such as the position and velocity of points on the surface of th...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{velocity}} and acceleration information {{is required for}} many real time applications. A standalone GPS receiver {{can be used to}} derive such information; however, there are many unsolved problems in this regard. This thesis establishes the theoretical basis for precise {{velocity and}} acceleration determination using a standalone GPS receiver in real time. An intensive investigation has been conducted into the Doppler effect in GPS. A highly accurate Doppler shift one-way observation equation is developed based on a comprehensive error analysis of each contributing factor including relativistic effects. Various error mitigation/elimination methods have been developed to improve the measurement accuracy of both the Doppler and Doppler-rate. Algorithms and formulae are presented to obtain real-time satellite velocity and acceleration in the ECEF system from the broadcast ephemeris. Low order IIR differentiators are designed to derive Doppler and Doppler-rate measurements from the raw GPS data for real-time applications. Abnormalities and their corresponding treatments in real-time operations are also discussed. In addition to the velocity and acceleration determination, this thesis offers a good tool for GPS measurement modelling and for design of interpolators, differentiators, as well as Kalman filters. The relativistic terms presented by this thesis suggest {{that it is possible to}} measure the geopotential directly using Doppler shift measurements.

40|$|With {{residual}} uncertainties at the 10 − 18 level [1], modern {{atomic frequency}} standards constitute extremely precise measurement devices. Besides frequency and time metrol-ogy, they provide valuable tools {{to investigate the}} validity of Einstein’s theory of general relativity, to test a possible time variation of the fundamental constants, and to verify predictions of quantum electrodynamics [2, 3, 3, 4]. Furthermore, applications as diverse as <b>geodesy,</b> <b>satellite</b> navigation, and very long base-line interferometry may benefit from steadily improving precision of both microwave and optical atomic clocks [5]. Clocks ticking at optical frequencies slice time into much finer intervals than microwave clocks and thus provide increased stability. It is expected that this {{will result in a}} re-definition of the second in the International System of Units (SI) [6]. However, any frequency measurement is based on a comparison to a second, ideally more precise frequency. A single clock, as highly developed as it may be, is useless if it is not accessible for applications. Unfortunately, the most precise optical clocks or frequency standards can not be readily transported. Hence, in order to link the increasing number of world-wide precision laboratories en-gaged in state-of-the-art optical frequency standards, a suitable infrastructure is of cru-cial importance. Today, the stabilities of current satellite based dissemination techniques using global satellite navigation systems (such as GPS, GLONASS) or two way satellite time and frequency transfer reach an uncertainty level of 10 − 15 after one day of com-parison [7]. While this is sufficient for the comparison of most microwave clock systems, the exploitation of the full potential of optical clocks requires more advanced techniques. This work demonstrates that the transmission of an optical carrier phase via telecommu-nication fiber links can provide a highly accurate means for clock comparisons reaching continental scales: Two 920 km long fibers are used to connect MPQ (Max-Planck...|$|R
40|$|The German Antarctic Receiving Station (GARS) O’Higgins at the {{northern}} tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is a dual purpose facility for earth observation and has existed for more than 20 years. It serves as a satellite ground station for payload data downlink and telecommanding of remote sensing satellites as well as a geodetic observatory for global reference systems and global change. Both applications use the same 9 m diameter radio antenna. Major outcomes of this usage are summarised in this paper. The satellite ground station O’Higgins (OHG) is part of the global ground station network of the German Remote Sensing Data Centre (DFD) operated by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). It was established in 1991 to provide remote sensing data downlink support within the missions of the European Remote Sensing Satellites ERS- 1 and ERS- 2. These missions provided valuable insights into the changes of the Antarctic ice shield. Especially after the failure of the on-board data recorder, OHG became an essential downlink station for ERS- 2 real-time data transmission. Since 2010, OHG is manned during the entire year, specifically to support the TanDEM-X mission. OHG is a main dump station for payload data, monitoring and telecommanding of the German TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X <b>satellites.</b> For space <b>geodesy</b> and astrometry the radio antenna O’Higgins significantly improves coverage over the southern hemisphere and plays an essential role within the global Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network. In particular the determination of the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) and the sky coverage of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) benefit from the location at a high southern latitude. Further, the resolution of VLBI images of active galactic nuclei (AGN), cosmic radio sources defining the ICRF, improves significantly when O’Higgins is included in the network. The various geodetic instrumentation and the long time series at O’Higgins allow a reliable determination of crustal motions. VLBI station velocities, continuous GNSS measurements and campaign-wise absolute gravity measurements consistently document a vertical rate of about 5 mm/a. This crustal uplift is interpreted as an elastic rebound due to ice loss {{as a consequence of the}} ice shelf disintegration in the Prince Gustav Channel in the late 1990 s. The outstanding location on the Antarctic continent and its year-around operation make GARS O’Higgins in future increasingly attractive for polar orbiting satellite missions and a vitally important station for the global VLBI network. Future plans call for the development of an observatory for environmentally relevant research. That means that the portfolio of the station will be expanded including the expansion of the infrastructure and the construction and operation of new scientific instruments suitable for long-term measurements and satellite ground truthing...|$|R
