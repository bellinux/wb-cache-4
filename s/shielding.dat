5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW) – {{also known as}} TIG (tungsten, inert gas), uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by an inert <b>shielding</b> gas such as argon or helium.|$|E

5|$|<b>Shielding</b> gas {{mixtures}} {{of three or}} more gases are also available. Mixtures of argon, carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels.

Helium also sometimes serves as the base gas, with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added. However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at <b>shielding</b> the weld than argonwhich is denser than air. It also can lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other <b>shielding</b> gases. Other specialized and often proprietary gas mixtures claim even greater benefits for specific applications.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use braided {{copper wire}} forming the <b>shield.</b> This allows the cable to be flexible, {{but it also means}} there are gaps in the <b>shield</b> layer, and the inner dimension of the <b>shield</b> varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better <b>shield</b> performance, some cables have a double-layer <b>shield.</b> The <b>shield</b> might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil <b>shield</b> covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two <b>shield</b> layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other <b>shield</b> designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some <b>shields</b> are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the <b>shield</b> will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil <b>shield</b> is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the <b>shield</b> termination easier.|$|R

5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the <b>shielding</b> gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert <b>shielding</b> gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|A {{neutrino}} detector {{was installed}} {{deep inside the}} Mont Blanc Tunnel in the early‑1980s {{in order to take}} advantage of the <b>shielding</b> from background radiation provided by the 4,800meter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of solid rock surrounding it in every direction. In February 1987, the underground neutrino observatory reported the detection of a neutrino event, believed to have originated from the explosion of the SN 1987A supernova.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another <b>shielding</b> gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular <b>shielding</b> gas additive.|$|E

5|$|Boron carbide's {{ability to}} absorb {{neutrons}} without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants.

5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a <b>shielding</b> {{material}} in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a <b>shielding</b> material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the <b>shielding</b> provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the <b>shielding</b> produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
