500|$|In 1924 J.

[...] J. Jovanović's account changed {{back and forth over the}} years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement. [...] Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but there was no mention of an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I <b>said</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E
500|$|The film's story {{originated}} from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind {{over a period}} of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only [...] "a feeling" [...] and the title Blue Velvet, Lynch told Cineaste in 1987. The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. [...] "I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect," [...] Lynch remarked in an interview. The third idea was Bobby Vinton's classic rendition of the song Blue Velvet and [...] "the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time." [...] Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> [...] "there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Section of Foreign Affairs {{said that}} as it was now too late to renegotiate the Treaty, the best way out, despite what it <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Argentina must not obtain [...] "a handbreadth of territory" [...] above the Pilcomayo River. [...] The Pilcomayo flows through the Gran Chaco into the right bank of the River Paraguay (see map), but Argentina's claim to the Chaco went far north of that, indeed {{according}} to Article XVI she was to receive territory up to Bahia Negra, near the Bolivian border. [...] After the War of the Triple Alliance by a long-drawn out process Brazil did succeed in preventing Argentina from getting territory {{to the north of}} the Pilcomayo. [...] Hence today that river constitutes the international boundary between the Argentine province of Formosa and the Paraguayan department of Presidente Hayes.|$|E
2500|$|Yet The Watchtowers public {{coverage}} of the same series of conventions was notable for its far more cautious tone. In its summary of the convention talks, the magazine reiterated the teaching that Bible chronology showed 6000 years of human existence would be completed in the mid-1970s, then pointed out: [...] "These publications have never said that the world's end would come then. Nevertheless, there has been considerable individual speculation on the matter." [...] What was certain, the magazine <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the end would come within the generation of those who saw the beginning of world tribulations in 1914. [...] "So we can be confident that the end is near; {{we do not have}} the slightest doubt that God will bring it about ... we have to wait and see exactly when, in the meantime keeping busy in God's service." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{year after}} his dismissal, in July 1991, Adler {{filed a lawsuit against}} his former Guns N' Roses band mates, contending that he was fired because the opiate-blocking drug he had been taking to aid his detox {{interfered}} with his concentration. He also alleged that the contract he had been made to sign took away his financial interest in the band, stating, [...] "I was told that every time I did heroin, the band would fine me $2,000. ... What these contracts actually <b>said</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the band were paying me $2,000 to leave. They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn't like me any more and just wanted me gone." [...] The case was settled out of court in 1993; Adler received a back-payment check of $2,250,000 and was granted 15% of the royalties for everything he recorded prior to his departure.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{said his}} {{comments}} about homosexuals {{have been taken}} out of context, and that they were directed not towards the general LGBT community, just its more politically active, fringe members. Of past comments that homosexuality [...] "poisons culture", he clarified, [...] "What I really <b>said</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the gay rights movement, so called, the homosexual activists, engage in some behavior that is absolutely horrendous, and that’s true, everybody knows that; from going into Catholic churches and desecrating the Sacraments to engaging in all kinds of demonstrative behavior to try to call attention to what they view as their plight." [...] He added, [...] "I respect every human being, I don't believe that there's any second-class citizens in Virginia, I don't treat anybody any differently because of their sexual orientation." [...] He also says that his statements on homosexuality should be seen as a preacher talking about what he believes the Bible says, not a political candidate's views on how he would govern.|$|E
2500|$|A {{month later}} the four ousted {{directors}} {{responded with a}} self-funded rebuttal of Rutherford's statement. The publication, Light After Darkness, contained a letter by Pierson, dated July 26, in which the vice-president declared he was now siding with the old board. Although he believed {{both sides of the}} conflict had displayed [...] "a measure of wrongs", Pierson had decided Rutherford had been wrong to appoint new directors. The ousted directors' publication disputed the legality of their expulsion, stating that the clause in the Pennsylvania law prohibiting life memberships on boards had been only recently introduced and was not retroactive, exempting existing corporations from the statute. They also claimed that the Watch Tower Society's charter allowed only directors to be elected as officers, and that therefore the election of Rutherford, Van Amburgh and Pierson as officers was void because none had been directors in January. Their advice from several lawyers, they <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Rutherford's course was [...] "wholly unlawful".|$|E

5000|$|When confronted {{about her}} [...] "out of business" [...] {{statement}} while campaigning in West Virginia, Clinton stated [...] "I don't {{know how to}} explain it other than what I <b>said</b> <b>was</b> totally out of context for what I meant because I have been talking about helping coal country for a very long time. It was a misstatement because what I was saying is {{the way things are going}} now, they will continue to lose jobs. It didn't mean <b>that</b> we <b>were</b> going to do it.

2500|$|The Judge next {{discussed}} {{the example of}} William Penn (an example noted also by Vattel) and his many negotiations with the Lenape Native Americans, but said that his example had [...] "hitherto been neglected". The position of those Native Americans, he <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they had by treaty become dependent states, but according to Vattel, they had not in doing so surrendered their sovereignty. Considering {{the position of a}} dependent state that [...] "does not resist the encroachments of the superior power... preserves a profound silence when it may and ought to speak", the Judge said that over time such silence may become consent. However, the silence must be voluntary, and if such silence is the result of fear or oppression, then that is not the case. In any event, he concluded, the many violent clashes between the Aboriginal people and the white settlers [...] "make it... sufficiently manifest that the Aboriginal tribes are neither a conquered people, nor have tacitly acquiesced in the supremacy of the settlers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fleming {{described}} the first {{results of the}} insurgent movement as [...] "good," [...] and the later ones as [...] "both good and bad." [...] According to Fleming (1907), the KKK [...] "quieted the Negroes, made life and property safer, gave protection to women, stopped burnings, forced the Radical leaders to be more moderate, made the Negroes work better, drove {{the worst of the}} Radical leaders from the country and started the whites on the way to gain political supremacy." [...] The evil result, Fleming <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> lawless elements [...] "made use of the organization as a cloak to cover their misdeeds... the lynching habits of today [...] are largely due to conditions, social and legal, growing out of Reconstruction." [...] Historians have noted that the peak of lynchings took place years after Reconstruction ended as whites were imposing Jim Crow laws and that they were more often used to keep black men down, with a rate associated with settlement of sharecropper accounts {{at the end of the}} season, than for any other reason.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013 in Manassas, Jackson held a {{press conference}} in which he sought to clear the air about his past and counter what he called distortions of his past words and {{statements}} by his opponents. Jackson addressed a number of claims about his theology, which he says has been [...] "twisted and distorted," [...] and said, [...] "I'm not going to spend the campaign talking about these issues, so let's {{get it out of the}} way now." [...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and your colleagues some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor. What I <b>said</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Christian meditation does not involve emptying oneself but filling oneself ... with the spirit of God. That is classic Biblical Christianity." ...|$|E

2500|$|His fast bowling {{gave him}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Typhoon Tyson", and despite his short career he achieved status as the fastest England bowler in living memory. Don Bradman called him [...] "the fastest bowler I have ever seen" [...] and Richie Benaud agreed, writing [...] "For a short time, Frank Tyson blasted all-comers". Tom Graveney wrote 'I cannot believe any bowler was faster than Tyson at that time'. When fielding in the slips he had 'to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still. the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots'. His Northants colleague Jock Livingston said 'When really firing, Tyson was the quickest of all {{over a period of}} three or four overs'. Livingston had seen Harold Larwood bowl Bodyline and batted against the Australian fast bowlers Miller and Lindwall in the Sheffield Shield. At the Aeronautical College in Wellington, New Zealand in 1955 metal plates were attached to a cricket ball and a sonic device was used to measure their speed, with Tyson's bowling measured at [...] 89mph (142km/h), but he was wearing three sweaters on a cold, damp morning and used no run up, Brian Statham bowled at 87mph (139km/h). He certainly bowled faster than 89mph in matches, and Tyson claimed that he could bowl at 119mph (190km/h), but this cannot be proven. The best that can be <b>said</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he was noticeably faster than his contemporaries Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham, Peter Heine and Neil Adcock. His great fast bowling rival Fred Trueman ‘was forever being told that when it came to bowling I was very fast, but on his day Frank Tyson was faster than me' and it was Tyson who kept Trueman out of the England team in 1954–55. When they played together in a Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough in 1957 the captain Godfrey Evans insisted Trueman bowl into the headwind so as to give the faster Tyson the advantage of the tailwind. Dickie Bird, the famous England umpire, wrote [...] "he was certainly the quickest bowler I ever seen through the air, and on one occasion the quickest bowler I never saw through the air". When playing for [...] at Scarborough in 1958 [...] "I opened the innings against him and hit his first three deliveries through the off side for four. With supreme confidence I went on to the front foot for the fourth ball. Tyson dropped one short. It reared up and hit me on the chin. I went down as if I'd just been {{on the receiving end of}} a right hook...I still carry the scar to show my folly that day. There was blood all over and I saw stars. I could hear bells ringing in my head...". Dickie came back to score his then highest first class score of 62 and Tyson took 4/30. When they met in Australia in 1998–99 Tyson joked 'You're looking well Dickie. See you still have the scars though'.|$|E
