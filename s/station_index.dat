The scent <b>station</b> <b>index</b> remained relatively constant at a mean value of 0. 025 from May through mid-August; increased to a mean value of 0. 043 in September; then decreased to {{a mean of}} 0. 038 in October. Reduced scent effectiveness due to weathering was not evident. Between-line and within-line variability of the index remained relatively constant throughout the study period. Between-line variability accounted {{for more of the}} total variation in indices than between-month variability. Up to four-fold, statistically significant, differences in index values between lines were evident throughout the study. The mean percent of coyotes that scored at a scent station, once they were on a segment of the road surface that extended 30 feet on each side of a scent post, was 28. 8 percent over all lines and periods. There was statistically significant variation in the percent scoring between lines and this variation partially explained the between-line differences for the scent <b>station</b> <b>index.</b> The percent scoring did not change significantly between months, however. An alternate index in which the stations read were 60 foot long segments of the road surface at 0. 3 mile intervals was found to give an approximate four-fold increase in mean indices and a significant reduction in coefficient of variation compared to the standard scent <b>station</b> <b>index.</b> The relative merits of these two indices were compared. A functional relationship between coyote numbers, coyote activity and index values was proposed and evaluated in terms of observed index values.

40|$|The scent-station {{survey method}} {{has been widely}} used to {{estimate}} trends in carnivore abundance. However, statistical properties of scent-station data are poorly understood, and the relation between scent- <b>station</b> <b>indices</b> and carnivore abundance has not been adequately evaluated. We assessed properties of scent- <b>station</b> <b>indices</b> by analyzing data collected in Minnesota during 1986 - 93. Visits to stations separated by 3 ̆c 2 km were correlated for all species because individual carnivores sometimes visited several stations in succession. Thus, visits to stations had an intractable statistical distribution. Dichotomizing results for lines of 10 stations (0 or ≥ 1 visits) produced binomially distributed data that were robust to multiple visits by individuals. We abandoned 2 -way comparisons among years in favor of tests for population trend, which are less susceptible to bias, and analyzed results separately for biogeographic sections of Minnesota because trends differed among sections. Before drawing inferences about carnivore population trends, we reevaluated published validation experiments. Results implicated low statistical power and confounding as possible explanations for equivocal or conflicting results of validation efforts. Long-term trends in visitation rates probably reflect real changes in populations, but poor spatial and temporal resolution, susceptibility to confounding, and low statistical power limit the usefulness of this survey method...|$|R

We show {{that it is possible}} to detect unusual events in multiple disjoint cameras as context-incoherent patterns, through incremental learning of time delayed dependencies between distributed local activities observed within and across camera views. Specifically, we model multi-camera activities using a Time Delayed Probabilistic Graphical Model (TD-PGM) with different nodes representing activities in different decomposed regions from different views and the directed links between nodes encoding their time delayed dependencies. To deal with visual context changes, we formulate a novel incremental learning method for modelling time delayed dependencies that change over time. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a synthetic dataset and videos captured from a camera network installed at a busy underground <b>station.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Unusual event detection, multi-camera activity modelling, time delay estimation, incremental structure learning. ...|$|E

While fairness issues in 802. 11 networks have been studied before, this paper is the first to focus on TCP fairness in 802. 11 networks in the presence of both mobile senders and receivers. In this paper, we evaluate extensively through analysis, simulation, and experimentation the interaction between the 802. 11 MAC protocol and TCP. We identify four different regions of TCP unfairness that depend on the buffer availability at the base station, with some regions exhibiting significant unfairness of over 10 in terms of throughput ratio between upstream and downstream TCP flows.

First of all, data are statistically analysed to check main relationships between farms. The second analysis goes further in the characterisation of wind farm relationships. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) provide a powerful tool to classify data automatically. They are very useful in finding patterns of productions of a zone. The patterns are obtained only with data of the power of wind farms through competitive neural networks and selforganizing feature maps (SOFM). Time variations of wind farm output have been studied in the third analysis. Only hourly data is available, so only slow variations can be analysed (such as down and dusk variations). Two tools have been used in the time study: correlogram and spectrogram of each wind farm. In addition to this, those patterns found by ANN have been compared in the forth analysis with meteorological data of a nearby <b>station.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — wind energy, wind farm, artificial neural network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—TCP {{does not}} perform {{well in a}} {{connection}} that includes a lossy wireless link. Techniques intended to improve the performance of TCP for such connections can be grouped into three categories: end-to-end, link layer and split-connection approaches. Some simulations and experimental results indicate that split-connection protocols yield better performance {{than the other two}} approaches. Although analytical modeling of the end-to-end and link-layer approaches has been presented, no comparable performance analysis for split-connection protocols has been reported previously. In this paper, a stochastic model is developed and used to analyze the performance of a class of split-connection protocols which deploy TCP on the wire-line network and a light-weight transport protocol on the wireless final hop. The final hop is provided by a digital TDMA cellular system. The condition of heavy source traffic to the wireless terminal is considered. The model relates the throughput and some useful auxiliary performance measures to key system parameters such as propagation delays, the base-station buffer size, the ARQ protocol and channel-error process of the wireless link. The usefulness of the analysis is illustrated by its application to the problem of sizing the TCP receiving buffer in a base <b>station.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Queueing analysis, split-connection transport protocol, wireless Internet access.

Alternative variables selection based on independent component analysis (ICA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to obtain subsets of the predictor variables to be imputed into the linear model. The data was taken from five monitoring stations in Surabaya City, Indonesia with data period between March-April 2002.

40|$|Abstract—Target {{tracking}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important appli-cation of sensor networks. Most existing solutions require sensor nodes to actively participate in the tracking process. As a conse-quence, target tracking is fairly energy consuming and implies a high message and energy consumption overhead. Furthermore, this type of approach does not always scale well, particularly in low density scenarios where the network is composed of sparsely deployed sensors. This paper presents an approach originally proposed in [7], [6] that tries to overcome those limitations. The protocol we present is a lightweight target tracking protocol where sensor nodes record the detection of the target when it passes in their vicinity. A trace spreading algorithm is used to passively propagate traces of the target’s passage through the network. This spreading algorithm is shown to be lightweight in terms of message overhead and to scale well to different typical network regimes such as density, speed of the target and message transmission frequency. A mobile agent approach is used to track the target. The target follows the traces and it is shown that the agent frequently and regularly localizes the target for most network regimes. Furthermore, the important inverse tracking problem is considered where localization information may have to be sent back to a mobile base <b>station.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Wireless sensor networks, target tracking.

40|$|In {{multi-station}} manufacturing systems, {{the quality}} of final products is significantly affected by both product design as well as process variables. Historically, however, tolerance research has primarily focused on allocating tolerances based on the product design characteristics of each component. Currently, there are no analytical approaches to optimally allocate tolerances to integrate product and process variables in multi-station manufacturing processes at minimum costs. The concept of process-oriented tolerancing expands the current tolerancing practices, which bound errors related to product variables, to explicitly include process variables. The resulting methodology extends the concept of “part interchangeability” into “process interchangeability,” which is critical due to increasing requirements related to the selection of suppliers and benchmarking. The proposed methodology {{is based on the}} development and integration of three models: (i) the tolerance-variation relation; (ii) variation propagation; and (iii) process degradation. The tolerance-variation model is based on a pin-hole fixture mechanism in multi-station assembly processes. The variation propagation model utilizes a state space representation but uses a <b>station</b> <b>index</b> instead of a time index. Dynamic process effects such as tool wear are also incorporated into the framework of process-oriented tolerancing, which provides the capability to design tolerances for the whole life-cycle of a production system. The tolerances of process variables are optimally allocated through solving a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. An industry case study is used to illustrate the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the efforts}} of the space weather {{community}} is to find better near real-time indices of geomagnetic activity. Many models developed for, and used by, space weather forecasters rely on the Kp/ap indices. However, the 3 -h time interval between index computations is now considered a shortfall with regard to specifying and forecasting phenomena known to have faster time constants, e. g., auroral electrojet variations during a substorm. Therefore these indices have been targeted for high-time resolution development. Our study addresses this question by attempting to develop a “K-like” <b>station</b> <b>index</b> with a variable time interval. By comparing the distributions of these different time interval indices with the traditional 3 -h K index an immediate difficulty is uncovered. Namely, the new distribution has a markedly different average index value. Hence no straightforward use of these indices in lieu of the traditional K index is possible. However, we demonstrate that, through a simple re-normalization process, the frequency distribution of our variable-time indices can be made to approximate the 3 -h K index distribution. Further, when the temporal variability of the 3 -h K index is compared against both a “sliding” 3 -h index and a 15 -min index, it is found that the 15 -min index is significantly better at reproducing the station geomagnetic variability. The question not addressed here, but one that needs to be raised, concerns the possible difference in physical processes reflected by the 3 -h index vs the shorter time interval indices. If there is no difference, then after a suitable range-to-index conversion these higher time resolution indices could potentially be used in place of the traditional 3 -h station K index...|$|E
