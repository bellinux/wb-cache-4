It is observed that various strategies for enhancing capacity building for abused children, most of whom are victims of the mal-adjustment and inadequacies of the formal educational system, have suffered neglect and unsustainable. The study adopted the survey research design. Using a sample size of 898 participants selected purposively from trainees, instructors and organizers of technical capacity building programmes for abused children, a 4 -point rating scale validate questionnaire tagged: “Non-Formal Education Reintegration Scale (NERS), (0. 56) was used for data collection complemented with focus Group Discussion (FGD).

40|$|Abstract Background In Italy, a large {{cohort study}} (VEdeTTE 1) was {{conducted}} between 1998 – 2001 {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of treatments in reducing mortality and increasing treatment retention among heroin addicts. The follow-up of this cohort (VEdeTTE 2) was designed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of treatments on long-term outcomes, such as rehabilitation and <b>social</b> <b>re-integration.</b> The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol of the VEdeTTE 2 study, and to present the results of the pilot study carried out to assess the feasibility of the study and to improve study procedures. Methods The source population for the VEdeTTE 2 study was the VEdeTTE 1 cohort, from which a sample of 2, 200 patients, traced two or more years after enrolment in the cohort, were asked to participate. An interview investigates drug use; overdose; family and <b>social</b> <b>re-integration.</b> Illegal activity are investigated separately in a questionnaire completed by the patient. Patients are also asked to provide a hair sample to test for heroin and cocaine use. Information on treatments and HIV, HBV and HCV morbidity are obtained from clinical records. A pilot phase was planned and carried out on 60 patients. Results The results of the pilot phase pointed out the validity of the procedures designed to limit attrition: the number of traced subjects was satisfactory (88 %). Moreover, the pilot phase was very useful in identifying possible causes of delays and attrition, and flaws in the instruments. Improvements to the procedures and the instruments were subsequently implemented. Sensitivity of the biological test was quite good for heroin (78 %) but lower for cocaine (42. 3 %), highlighting the need to obtain a hair sample from all patients. Conclusion In drug addiction research, studies investigating health status and <b>social</b> <b>re-integration</b> of subjects at long-term follow-up are lacking. The VEdeTTE 2 study aims to investigate these outcomes at long-term follow-up. Results of the pilot phase underline the importance of the pilot phase when planning a follow-up study. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the long-term resumption of leisure and social activities {{in patients with}} aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) and to determine the role of executive dysfunction and aneurysms in anterior brain regions in particular. Method: Leisure and social functioning of 200 patients with aSAH having anterior or posterior aneurysms was determined using the Role Resumption List (RRL). Executive functioning was investigated using the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) and sub-scales Social Convention (SC) and Executive Cognition (EC). Mood, fatigue and cognitive problems were investigated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Brain Injury Symptom Checklist (BISC). Results: Of all patients, 46. 5 % reported complete return to previous leisure activities and 61. 5 % reported no changes in social interactions. HADS depression score, fatigue, DEX-EC sub-scale score and work status post-aSAH were predictors of leisure resumption. For <b>social</b> <b>re-integration,</b> HADS depression score, cognitive problems and fatigue were predictors.

40|$|THESIS 7465. 1 THESIS 7465. 2 An Investigation {{into the}} Potential Benefits of Introducing Guidance and Counselling to Corrective Educational Programmes. Many {{offenders}} {{long for the}} day when they might be accepted back into society. In fact, some work towards achieving a state of full <b>social</b> <b>re-integration.</b> Unfortunately, despite their best efforts to re-socialise, those once convicted of criminal offences often become entrapped by their own past histories. In reality, the materialisation of that great dream of liberation not only lies in the hands of offenders themselves. Society itself may be the ultimate provider of solutions to the problem of <b>social</b> <b>re-integration</b> for offenders. Regrettably, several offenders would argue that, while the prison doors may eventually open for them, the gateways to social inclusion remain closed. However, as this study illustrates, the transformation from ?offender? to ?ex-offender? is considered a complex process. To begin with, offenders must assume some measure of self-responsibility by participating in a process of self-initiated reform. Certainly, social reintegration and personal rehabilitation must be earned as opposed to being conferred as a gift. It is generally accepted that education constitutes a critical ingredient within this method of reform for offenders. In reality, education incorporates within its constructs, a degree of re-education for offenders. This ?re-education? formula may include the shedding of old habits, attitudes, opinions, beliefs, practices and criminal associations. In return, educators seek to ingrain, within offenders, the necessaiy skills and personal qualities {{that would allow them to}} function normally in society. Consequently, the author considers the essential ingredients within any comprehensive guidance and counselling programme that would facilitate this process...|$|E

In this paper the characteristics of nine models of specialist employment are described, and their similarities and differences are portrayed on three dimensions: productivity, integration, and permanence. Within this proto-typology it is hoped that clearer distinctions may be made between work schemes and what they have to offer. Recognition of fundamental differences between work opportunities should aid matching needs to services, facilitate more effective use of rehabilitation resources, and guide the commissioning of mental health services...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{parameters}} of the right to rehabilitation of war criminals and veterans under international criminal law and seeks to identify specific rights in relation to health, in this context mental health, as means towards <b>social</b> <b>re-integration</b> and ultimately, reconciliation. The paper highlights inherent problems associated with immediate post-war inequalities in accessing mental health resources between military personnel, veterans and convicted war criminals on one hand and victims of the conflict on the other, who {{are more likely to be}} recipients of reconstruction efforts and help from international organisations. Dealing with mental health issues of those who have or are perceived to have committed crimes, or have been convicted of war crimes, is more difficult, as this requires greater social and political will as well as infrastructure. The paper then explores roles and scope of mental health professionals in post-conflict rehabilitation process of war criminals and veterans as well as the role of those professionals in facilitating social reconciliation. Generally, military rules provide little privilege on information offered by those seeking therapy, such as admissions of war crimes, which may result, through the suppression of guilt, anxiety or depression for instance, in misdiagnosis and/or aggravation of symptoms for which help is sought in the first place. Two issues are considered here. Firstly, the extent to which military confidentiality rules hinder psychotherapist-patient relationship and secondly, the impact this has on the effectiveness on collective reconciliation, coupled with issues of stigmatization of mental health...|$|E

40|$|Inclusion {{has been}} embraced in many {{communities}} as a useful strategy in addressing learner diversity. Juveniles in correctional centres are usually different and have various needs. Applying inclusion in such a setup is envisaged {{to address the needs}} of diverse learners. The study focuses on how inclusion can be used as a strategy to promote social wellness of juvenile offenders in a bid to reduce recidivism and to facilitate smooth <b>social</b> <b>re-integration.</b> The aim of the study was to investigate and explore ways in which inclusion can be used to promote social wellness among juvenile offenders. The ecosystemic theoretical framework was used as a lens to explore the impact of social systems in the development of juvenile offenders. Qualitative research design was used and data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews. Ten juveniles and teachers were selected in a Gauteng correctional centre on the basis of availability and willingness. Participants were informed that their participation was voluntary and all the information concerning the study was communicated to them. They were given consent forms to complete after they had agreed to participate. Findings revealed that education at the centre promotes social wellness and had resulted in positive behavioural change among most juveniles. Relationships among juveniles and with stakeholders also improved with education received at the centre. The major challenges faced were that teachers had not received adequate training in inclusion and inadequate psycho-social support was given to inmates. It was recommended that teachers be given in-service training in inclusion and how to deal with learners with behavioural challenges. More psycho- social support should be provided and family involvement to be intensified. Inclusive EducationM. Ed. (Inclusive Education...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of modern {{therapeutic}} and technological advances, the surgeon {{has the ability to}} salvage even the most severely injured lower limbs. However, the success of replantation nowadays is no longer measured simply on the basis of restoration of viability but also on functional outcome compared with primary amputation with early prosthetic fitting, the risk to the patient during and after replantation and the overall time of treatment which should not exceed 2 years. Although every major limb replantation has to be considered individually, the decision-making process for reconstruction (replantation/revascularisation) versus amputation with subsequent early prosthetic fitting should be determined by objective criteria. Based on personal experience and an extensive literature search, an algorithm for treatment of amputation or amputation-like injuries to the lower leg has been developed and tested in a clinical study. A 100 % viability success rate was achieved. There was not only {{a significant increase in the}} percentage of ''functional extremities'' but also a doubling in grade I results. Moreover, there was a 50 % reduction in patients presenting a ''non-functional extremity'', and no patient required a secondary re-amputation. The replantation risk (e. g., risk of severe systemic disturbance during and/or after replantation) was about 16. 6 % (2 / 12) in our study. There was a significant decrease in the postoperative complication rate and no patient died during or after replantation. Based on our experience, if reconstruction in subtotal or total lower leg amputation is done for a well-selected patient group, good functional results with a reasonable replantation risk and a reasonable time for <b>social</b> <b>re-integration</b> can be achieved.

In the last two decades, and especially in recent years, former extreme-right terrorists have started to talk about their past involvement in terrorist violence, including, for the first time, acts of violence which have for decades been considered taboo, that is to say, bomb attacks against innocent civilians. Surprisingly, these narratives have not been systematically examined, yet they form a unique and extremely rich source of first-hand testimony, providing invaluable insight into processes of youth radicalisation and de-radicalisation, <b>social</b> <b>re-integration</b> of ex-terrorists, as well as personal and collective healing through cultural dialogue among perpetrators, victims and survivors. The memoirs construct ‘myths and plots’ about the past, that can be self-justificatory or indeed self-critical or penitent.

Post incarceration, the study further asks what was the specific role of the former Italian communist party (PCI, then PDS, DS, PD) on the one hand, and the former Neofascist party (MSI, then AN), on the other, in the process of disengagement and reintegration of the ‘terrorist subject’ back into the non-violent community.

40|$|M. A. [...] San Diego State University, 2011 The {{economic}} history of Mexico {{has been accompanied}} by a parallel history of consequential biological events that have vastly enabled the intentions of colonization and development. These events created conditions that ruined local economies, instituted wage dependency and class disparity, destroyed the environment and forced of millions of indigenous people into migration. Extreme economic asymmetry remains the status quo in Mexico, at the precise moment in history when the exponential effects of climate change and economic globalization stand to recreate this history on a vast scale. Precedent would suggest that culturally and economically, the United States is positioned more to exploit this perpetual disaster than we are to mitigate or even acknowledge it. This thesis examines these parallel histories and argues that over time the disparity created by these events evolved from unintended consequence to engineered goal. Policies and language concerning trade, immigration, security and the environment have evolved to re-enforce and naturalize that asymmetry. I argue that laws and their contextualization constitute an authorized ideological re-telling of our national stories that criminalizes dependency and punishes dissent, and in so doing validates necessary imposition as beneficence or protection. Militarization of US immigration and border policies then serve not to mitigate against trafficking in drugs and laborers, but rather to capitalize on their illegality so as to perpetuate a message that re-validates the imposition. Finally, I make the case for small-scale agriculture, education, food and water sovereignty and protection of natural systems in Mexico as a tactical approach to mitigating the effects of climate change via basic poverty reduction and <b>social</b> <b>re-integration.</b> The United States and Mexico could be supporting immigration, labor and border policies that help migrants to "stay home. " This concept serves as well to contradict the ideological framing of labor migration as criminal and its production as beneficent. This contradiction then offers Americans an opportunity to re-claim our own story of freedom and democracy and so negate the popular perception that climate change is a political hoax and migrants are terrorists...|$|E

The book interrogates a wide array of published memoirs and a considerable number of new face-to-face interviews with both former terrorists and first and second generation victims. In the last two decades, and especially in recent years, former extreme-right terrorists in Italy have started to talk about their past involvement in terrorist violence, including, for the first time, acts of violence which have for decades been considered taboo, that is to say, bomb attacks against innocent civilians. These narratives add to the perspectives offered by members of left-wing terrorist groups, such as the Red Brigades and Prima Linea. Surprisingly, these narratives have not been systematically examined, yet they form a unique and extremely rich source of first-hand testimony, providing invaluable insights into processes of youth radicalization and de-radicalization, the <b>social</b> <b>re-integration</b> of ex-terrorists, as well as personal and collective healing. Even less {{attention has been paid to}} the victims' narratives or stories. Indeed, the views and activities of the victims and their associations have been seriously neglected in the scholarly literature on terrorism, not just in Italy, but elsewhere in Europe. The book therefore examines the perspectives of the victims and relatives of victims of terrorism, who over the years have formed dedicated associations and campaigned relentlessly to obtain justice through the courts, with little or no support from the state and, especially in the case of the bombing massacres, with increasing awareness that the state played a role in thwarting the course of justice.

40|$|Abstract Background After a {{long and}} {{controversial}} debate methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) was first introduced in Germany in 1987. The number of patients in MMT – first low because of strict admission criteria – increased considerably since the 1990 s up to some 65, 000 {{at the end of}} 2006. In Germany each general practitioner (GP), who has completed an additional training in addiction medicine, is allowed to prescribe substitution drugs to opioid dependent patients. Currently 2, 700 GPs prescribe substitution drugs. Psychosocial care should be made available to all MMT patients. Results The results of research studies and practical experiences clearly indicate that patients benefit substantially from MMT with improvements in physical and psychological health. MMT proves successful in attaining high retention rates (65 % to 85 % in the first years, up to 50 % after more than seven years) and {{plays a major role in}} accessing and maintaining ongoing medical treatment for HIV and hepatitis. MMT is also seen as a vital factor in the process of <b>social</b> <b>re-integration</b> and it contributes to the reduction of drug related harms such as mortality and morbidity and to the prevention of infectious diseases. Some 10 % of MMT patients become drug-free in the long run. Methadone is the most commonly prescribed substitution medication in Germany, although buprenorphine is attaining rising importance. Access to MMT in rural areas is very patchy and still constitutes a problem. There are only few employment opportunities for patients participating in MMT, although regular employment is considered unanimously as a positive factor of treatment success. Substitution treatment in German prisons is heterogeneous in access and treatment modalities. Access is very patchy and the number of inmates in treatment is limited. Nevertheless, substitution treatment plays a substantial part in the health care system provided to drug users in Germany. Conclusion In Germany, a history of substitution treatment spanning 20 years has meanwhile accumulated a wealth of experience, e. g. in the development of research on health care services, guidelines and the implementation of quality assurance measures. Implementing substitution treatment with concomitant effects and treatment elements such as drug history-taking, dosage setting, co-use of other psychoactive substances (alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine), management of 'difficult patient populations', and integration into the social environment has been arranged successfully. Also psychosocial counseling programmes adjuvant to substitution treatment have been established and, in the framework of a pilot project on heroin-based treatment, standardised manuals were developed. Research on allocating opioid users to the 'right' form of therapy at the 'right' point in time is still a challenge, though the pilot project 'heroin-based treatment' brought experience with patients who do not benefit from methadone treatment. There is also expertise in the treatment of specific co-morbidity such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and psychiatric disorders. The promotion and involvement of self-help groups plays an important part in the process of successful substitution treatment. </p...|$|E
