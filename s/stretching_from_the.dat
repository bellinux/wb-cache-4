5|$|Another, short {{wall was}} added in later times, {{probably}} in the reign of Theophilos, <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> junction {{of the land and}} sea walls to the sea itself, and pierced by the so-called Wooden Gate (Ξυλίνη πύλη, Xylinē pylē, or Ξυλόπορτα, Xyloporta).

5|$|Zimbabwe is a {{landlocked}} country in southern Africa, lying between latitudes 15° and 23°S, and longitudes 25° and 34°E. Most {{of the country}} is elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high veld) <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southwest northwards with altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 m. The country's extreme east is mountainous, this area being known as the Eastern Highlands, with Mount Nyangani as the highest point at 2,592 m.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs was {{appointed}} to a vacancy in the Colorado State Senate in late 2007, won election to a Senate term of his own in 2008, and represented a multi-county region <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Colorado Front Range near Boulder into Rocky Mountain ski country west of Denver. Gibbs rose quickly to chair the Colorado Senate's Transportation Committee, but {{announced that he would}} seek election to a Summit County Commissioner seat in 2010 rather than run for another term in the legislature. Gibbs was elected a Summit County Commissioner in 2010 and has been serving in that office since then.|$|E

5|$|In 1963 Hydro-Québec {{purchased}} {{the shares of}} nearly all remaining privately owned electrical utilities then operating in Québec and undertook construction of the Manicouagan-Outardes hydroelectric complex. To transmit the complex's annual production of about 30 billion kWh over a distance of nearly 700km, Hydro-Québec had to innovate. Led by Jean-Jacques Archambault, it became the first utility {{in the world to}} transmit electricity at 735 kV, rather than 300–400kV which was the world standard at that time. In 1962, Hydro-Québec proceeded with the construction of the first 735kV power line in the world. The line, <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Manic-Outardes dam to the Levis substation, was brought into service on 29 November 1965.|$|E
5|$|In August 1916, a {{combined}} Ottoman and German Empire army {{had been forced}} to retreat to Bir el Abd, after the British victory in the Battle of Romani. During the following three months the defeated force retired further eastwards to El Arish, while the captured territory <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Suez Canal was consolidated and garrisoned by the EEF. Patrols and reconnaissances were carried out by British forces, to protect the continuing construction of the railway and water pipeline and to deny passage across the Sinai desert to the Ottoman forces by destroying water cisterns and wells.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to discuss the MSA of Africa without first considering the immense size of the continent. There are archaeological sites and evidence from across the continent, and, {{for the sake of}} ease, it has often been divided into five regions: northern Africa, which is often, though not without controversy, taken into consideration more so with Southwest Asia and Europe than with the rest of Africa; eastern Africa, stretching roughly from the highlands of Ethiopia to the southern part of Kenya; central Africa, which is arguably the least explored region, <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> borders of Tanzania and Kenya to include Angola; southern Africa, which includes the numerous cave sites of South Africa; and western Africa.|$|E

5|$|The first {{border between}} Wales and England was zonal, apart {{from around the}} River Wye, {{which was the first}} {{accepted}} boundary. Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} evolutionary theory before Darwin's {{was that of}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.|$|E
5|$|The new {{structure}} consists of two-stories, the lower in Western {{style and the}} top level in Thai design. The central pavilion has a wooden balcony, which {{is used by the}} king and royal family for the granting of public audiences. The roof over the central pavilion is topped by a five-tier prasat in Mondop style, decorated in glass mosaic. The hall's wings <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north to the south, each has nine large windows along the exterior. Later in the reign of King Rama V, the entire structure was refurbished and finally given its present name.|$|E

5|$|The species {{used for}} the hull planks was not {{positively}} identified but {{is thought to be}} Amoora of the Meliaceae family. The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of Amoora or of the Afzelia genus of the Fabaceae family. Afzelia is interesting in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.|$|E
5|$|This period, {{between the}} eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a {{tripartite}} {{struggle for the}} resources of the rich Gangetic plains, each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} city at Yonkers to 14th Street. It would be a two-track line south to Dyckman Street, a three-track line to 162nd Street, and then-on it would be a four-track line. The line would have two {{southern}} branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Bridgwater Bay forms {{a portion}} of the {{coastline}} of Somerset on the southern side of the Bristol Channel <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Quantock Hills at the south western end to Brean Down at the northern end. Around the coastline is a wave-cut platform of Jurassic Blue Lias. Several rivers flow into the bay, the main ones being the Parrett, Brue and Washford, along with the man-made River Huntspill. Major features and settlements along the coastline, running from north east to south west, include: Brean, Berrow, Burnham on Sea, the mouth of the River Parrett, the Steart Peninsula, Lilstock, East Quantoxhead and Watchet. Sand dunes at Berrow and a shingle ridge at Steart have been created by winds blowing from the west. On the beach near Stogursey are the remains of a submerged forest dated to 2500 B.C. - 6500 BC.|$|E
5|$|By 24:00 on 20 September {{the front}} of the XXI Corps {{described}} a virtual straight line, <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie at Rafat to the northwest, to Tulkarm. The 54th (East Anglian) Division held Bidya, Kh. Kefar Thilth and Azzun through Jiyus. On their left the 3rd (Lahore) Division was at Felamiye with the 7th (Meerut) Division at Et Taiyibe, Irta. They had taken the village of Beit Lid and controlled the cross roads at Deir Sheraf, while the 60th Division was at Tulkarm and Anebta with the 5th Light Horse Brigade across the railway line to the south of Arrabe. At this time the 75th Division came into XXI Corps reserve at Et Tire.|$|E
5|$|By the Union of Lublin {{a unified}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita) was created, <b>stretching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Sea and the Carpathian {{mountains}} to present-day Belarus and western and central Ukraine (which earlier had been Kievan Rus' principalities). Within the new federation {{some degree of}} formal separateness of Poland and Lithuania was retained (distinct state offices, armies, treasuries and judicial systems), but the union became a multinational entity with a common monarch, parliament, monetary system and foreign-military policy, in which only the nobility enjoyed full citizenship rights. Moreover, the nobility's uppermost stratum was about to assume the dominant role in the Commonwealth, as magnate factions were acquiring the ability to manipulate and control the rest of szlachta to their clique's private advantage. This trend, facilitated further by the liberal settlement and land acquisition consequences of the union, was becoming apparent at the time of, or soon after the 1572 death of Sigismund Augustus, the last monarch of the Jagiellonian dynasty.|$|E
