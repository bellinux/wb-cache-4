5|$|Final Fantasy {{has been}} remade several times for {{different}} platforms and has frequently been packaged with Final Fantasy II in various collections. While {{all of these}} remakes retain the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> story and battle mechanics, various changes {{have been made in}} different areas, including graphics, sound, and specific game elements.|$|E
5|$|Fortune's novels all {{follow the}} <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> theme: a heroine — a priestess and initiatrix who is magically {{experienced}} and assertive — who meets {{a man and}} saves him from himself. In her later novels this entails the duos reconstructing or revitalising a ritual space and working magical rituals to channel cosmic forces and bring them into balance.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{provides}} {{a variety of}} female characters to explore the place of women in a patriarchal society. Writing all characters as human beings with the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> needs, dreams, and influences, his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits as the males.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Xiao blowing hole (the hole faces {{away from}} the player, against the lower lip, making sure the top lip is not concealing the hole, when the {{instrument}} is played. Works on the <b>same</b> <b>basics</b> as blowing air over an empty bottle to create noise.) ...|$|R
2500|$|PHEVs {{are based}} on the <b>same</b> three <b>basic</b> {{powertrain}} architectures as conventional electric hybrids: ...|$|R
50|$|The game modes include 1 player mode {{where the}} player can race on 25 tracks in 5 {{distinct}} worlds. There is 2 player mode {{which consists of}} the <b>same</b> <b>basics</b> as in one player mode. Weapons and defences are used to help the player win races. There are Five Pilots to choose from with each having a different background from one another.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on Blu-ray on July 26, 2011, with the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> contents as the 25th-anniversary DVD. In a March 2011 interview with Ain't it Cool News, Landis also mentioned he had approved the Blu-ray's remastered transfer.|$|E
5|$|The same {{material}} also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), which use the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000tons of manganese dioxide {{was used for}} this purpose.|$|E
5|$|All these {{distributions}} have no or {{only minor}} changes {{when compared with}} the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with Linux distributions, which are all binary compatible because they use the same kernel and also use the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.|$|E
50|$|Engine must {{be of the}} <b>same</b> manufacturer, <b>basic</b> {{design with}} a maximum of 6 cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The {{site also}} shows groups of {{companies}} which are legally {{part of the}} <b>same</b> conglomerate. <b>Basic</b> company information is available as open data in XML or JSON format.|$|R
50|$|It was a 4/2/4 {{photographic}} sound encoding and {{decoding procedure}} compatible with (and using the <b>same</b> technical <b>basic</b> structure, with identical sound quality as) its competitor Dolby Stereo Matrix.|$|R
5|$|Dialects of {{killer whales}} not only {{distinguish}} them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All {{members of the}} North American west coast transient community express the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{it being}} {{based on the}} <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> {{equipment}} as the original Mk. IV AI, BABS {{could also be used}} with the Rebecca equipment, originally developed to home on ground transponders for dropping supplies over occupied Europe. The later Lucero unit was essentially an adapter for a Rebecca receiver, mating it to any existing display; AI, ASV, or H2S.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> characteristics. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district.|$|E
50|$|Acid {{medication}} are, {{because of}} pH partition, secreted {{to a higher}} extent when urine is <b>basic.</b> In the <b>same</b> way, <b>basic</b> medications are secreted to a higher extent when urine is acidic.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, HarperCollins {{announced}} that it would merge Basic Books into its trade publishing program, effectively closing the imprint. That <b>same</b> year, <b>Basic</b> was purchased by the newly created Perseus Books Group.|$|R
5000|$|Brown alga zoids {{have the}} <b>same</b> two <b>basic</b> flagella {{discussed}} in the heterokont section. However, orientation of the flagella is unique in the Phaeophyceae. In general, the flagella are both inserted laterally.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Vice Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, {{the head of}} the Marinesektion (Admiralty), ordered four torpedo cruisers. Pöck was unable to secure funding for new ironclads, and so he turned to less {{expensive}} vessels to modernize the fleet. The ships would fill several roles, including scouting for the ironclad fleet and leading flotillas of torpedo boats. The first three of the new vesselsthe were built to the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> design.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{evidence}} for common descent {{has come from}} the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> set of nucleotides and amino acids. The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations. For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.|$|E
5|$|SH-34 {{has always}} been a lengthy highway, {{starting}} with its commissioning in June 1931, when it was a border-to-border highway stretching from Texas to Kansas. Most of SH-34 has followed the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> corridor since its inception, {{with the exception of the}} portion of highway north of Woodward. The southernmost portion of highway, connecting it to Texas, became solely SH-6 in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{local street}} food found in such pastizzerias is the [...] "qassatat". This is a ball-shaped pie crust {{with an open}} top, with the <b>same</b> two <b>basic</b> {{fillings}} of ricotta or peas, and sometimes a tuna and spinach mixture.|$|R
50|$|ARD 3.0 has {{the option}} of using AES 128 bit, the <b>same</b> as a <b>basic</b> SSH server.|$|R
25|$|In 1980, Douglas was {{involved}} in a serious skiing accident which sidelined his acting career for three years. On September 17, 1992, the <b>same</b> year <b>Basic</b> Instinct came out, he began a 30-day treatment for alcoholism and drug addiction at Sierra Tucson Center.|$|R
5|$|The 1970s saw a {{resurgence}} {{in the use}} of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft used the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> design, such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew ejection systems. On the B-52D, the pilots and electronic countermeasures (EDM) operator ejected upwards, while the lower deck crew ejected downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out.|$|E
5|$|The CIA's California campus {{also runs}} an {{accelerated}} culinary program {{for students who}} already have at least four {{years of experience in}} foodservice. The program includes the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> classes as the school's associate degree programs, however the accelerated program does not include the externship requirement, and several classes are run with a faster-paced curriculum or including more in-depth material.|$|E
5000|$|When a warrantless arrest occurs {{based on}} {{information}} provided by a confidential informant or anonymous source, for the arrest to be lawful, the police must establish that the information relied on in making the arrest meets the <b>same</b> two <b>basic</b> elements described above.|$|R
50|$|High strains, {{caused by}} the high {{operating}} speed (up to 4 m/s) {{and the frequency of}} openings, have {{to be taken into account}} during construction.In the <b>same</b> way, <b>basic</b> conditions like size and installation location add up to considerable requirements regarding safety and control technique.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>same</b> {{ranks and}} <b>basic</b> {{insignia}} {{are used in}} the other militarised institutions. They differ in color and branch insignia: ...|$|R
5|$|The bomb sight {{was also}} {{supplied}} with the Emergency Computor, a simple circular slide rule for use when the main computor stopped working. In {{this case the}} bomb aimer would dial in the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> parameters on the various disks, and read out the proper sighting angle at the bottom. Wind had to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E
5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs {{have always been}} questionable. The <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> effect can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Queer Eye episodes use the <b>same</b> <b>basic</b> format. The episode {{begins with the}} Fab Five in an SUV (usually in New York City, where the series was based) discussing their heterosexual subject. The Five review details of the subject's personal life and note problems in their various areas of expertise. The Five usually have a specific event for which they plan to prepare the subject. These included everything from throwing a backyard barbecue for friends to preparing {{to ask for a}} salary increase to proposing marriage.|$|E
30|$|We {{propose to}} account for that {{in a similar way}} as it was done in the case of {{photocatalytic}} properties of TiO 2. In fact, the fundamental phenomena such as surface oxidation in the first step of gas sensing have the <b>same</b> physical <b>basic</b> as in photocatalysis.|$|R
50|$|The University of Hagen {{supports}} focus- and profile-oriented research. Interdisciplinary and cross-faculty collaboration {{leads to}} the grouping together of competencies and {{to the formation of}} competitive research focal points. At the <b>same</b> time, <b>basic</b> and applied research is the basis for promoting the new generation of academics.|$|R
50|$|The 0-10-0 type was the {{principal}} standard freight locomotive in Russia and was manufactured in very large numbers. The E class freight locomotive {{was made up of}} several sub-classes, all developed from the <b>same</b> original <b>basic</b> machine. The sub-classes included E, Em, , Esh, Eu, and Er.|$|R
