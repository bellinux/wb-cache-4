This marked {{the start of a}} successful period for London-based clubs, with 11wins in 22seasons. Teams from the second tier of English football, at the time called the Second Division, experienced an unprecedented run of cup success between 1973 and 1980. Sunderland won the cup in 1973, Southampton repeated the feat in 1976, and West Ham United won in 1980, the most recent victory by a team from outside the top division.|$|E
5|$|The Whitby Gazette {{was founded}} in 1854 by Ralph Horne, a local printer. The first issues were records of {{visitors}} and lodgings rather than a newspaper. The publication became a weekly newspaper in 1858, with a short <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> being published twice weekly between 2000 and 2012. Local radio stations are BBC Tees and Yorkshire Coast Radio.|$|E

5|$|After a long <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> hot and {{dry weather}} through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane. Fanned by a strong easterly wind and fed by {{stockpiles}} of wood and fuel that had been prepared for the coming colder months, the fire eventually consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the fire-fighting effort. The public blamed Catholic conspirators for the fire, and one Frenchman, Robert Hubert, was hanged {{on the basis of a}} false confession even though he had no hand in starting the fire.|$|E
5|$|Hutton and Washbrook {{took the}} score to 42—England's highest opening {{partnership}} {{of the series}} thus far—before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, they survived Lindwall's <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back {{to put pressure on}} Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.|$|E
5|$|Hutton then edged a {{ball from}} left-arm medium pacer Ernie Toshack through the slips, and was dropped by Lindsay Hassett on 25 after {{flicking}} the ball behind square leg from the medium pace of Sam Loxton. Hutton then hit a square drive past point and Washbrook pulled a ball {{along the ground}} past Harvey, who was patrolling the midwicket boundary. England were 88 without loss at the lunch interval, with Hutton and Washbrook on 46 and 41 respectively. After a slow start, they had scored at almost a run a minute after passing 50, and five boundaries were hit from a <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> six overs by Lindwall.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs in {{the season}} for the first time, in the process {{completing}} his first double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. However, after bowling {{a large number of}} overs against Worcestershire early in the season, he had little success as a bowler for a <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> three weeks. Pelham Warner, a leading amateur cricketer and later captain of England, noted that Rhodes was comparatively unsuccessful {{at the start of the}} year but came back well to take 193 wickets. Warner wrote that Rhodes at this time was accused of being easy to face on a wicket which suited the batsmen, although Warner himself did not agree.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> the {{competition}} only being won by Brazilian clubs {{for four years}} began with Internacional defeating Guadalajara. In 2011, Santos won their third Copa, overcoming Peñarol by 2–1 in the final. In 2012, Corinthians won the tournament undefeated, beating Boca Juniors 2–0 in the final. It was Corinthians' first title. In 2013, Atlético Mineiro needed to beat Olimpia 2–0 in the second leg to take the match to penalties and did so; Victor, the goalkeeper, performed spectacularly and helped secure the title for the club. It was Atlético Mineiro's first title.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920 season, Jardine {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut, played eight first-class matches and scored two fifties. Playing mainly as an opening batsman, {{he won his}} Blue, appearing in the University Match against Cambridge but fell short of expectations, and continued to be criticised for over-caution with the bat. In all, he scored 217 runs {{at an average of}} 22.64. In the match for Oxford against Essex, he took six wickets for six runs in a bowling <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> 45 balls, bowling leg breaks, to have bowling figures of six for 28. It was the only occasion in his career where he took five or more wickets in an innings.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>spelling</b> <b>of</b> Pittsburgh as Pittsburg {{derives from}} the company’s origins in thePittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad. That company was {{chartered}} in 1899 when the official <b>spelling</b> <b>of</b> the name of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was without the [...] "h". Thecity name was spelled Pittsburg from 1891 to 1911 due to an effort by the United States government to standardize the <b>spelling</b> <b>of</b> place names in the United States.|$|R
5|$|In {{the opening}} match of the 1931–32 season, which was against Queensland, New South Wales were in trouble. Gilbert famously knocked the bat out of Donald Bradman's hand, before {{removing}} {{him for a}} duck. Gilbert cut down the New South Wales top order with a <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> 3/12 and forced Alan Kippax to retire hurt after hitting him in the upper body. Fingleton {{was going to be}} twelfth man before Archie Jackson—who was to die of tuberculosis just over a year later—collapsed just {{before the start of the}} match. Undeterred, Stan McCabe came in and counterattacked; Fingleton assisted him with a stubborn 93 and featured in a 195-run fourth wicket partnership. New South Wales reached 432 and won by an innings.|$|E
5|$|It was contested by Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in {{a repeat}} of the 2008 Football League Cup Final, which the latter team won. Chelsea won 2–0 in the 2015 final, with a goal from captain John Terry {{at the end of the}} first half, and a second from Diego Costa in the 56th minute. It was Chelsea's fifth League Cup win, and their first {{silverware}} in the second managerial <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> José Mourinho at the club. Chelsea qualified for the next season's UEFA Europa League by winning the match, but eventually qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Premier League. The Europa League place went to Liverpool, who finished sixth in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{depicted}} by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father {{for her own}} and her husband's gain. In {{the early years of}} their reign, she was often seen as completely under the <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate's A Present for the Ladies (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as A Dialogue Concerning Women (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.|$|E

5|$|Suharto {{finished}} {{middle school}} {{at the age of}} 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes. Following a <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> unemployment, he joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) in June 1940, and undertook basic training in Gombong near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese.

5|$|The Butler Stand {{roof was}} blown {{off in a}} storm in January 1976. The ground damage meant the club's next home game against Middlesbrough had to be played at Vale Park, the home of local rivals Port Vale. The repair bill, {{in the region of}} £250,000, put the club in {{financial}} trouble, which was eased by the sale of Alan Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff for a combined sum of £440,000. With the team depleted, relegation proved inevitable in the 1976–77 season. Waddington, after a <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} related {{that the}} <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> the banner {{meant that it}} would vanish when it was displayed for the third time. The final unfurling of the banner would either gain the clan a complete victory over their enemies or meant that the clan was to suffer total extinction. The writer of the c.1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for {{the third and final}} time was always resisted; and {{that at the time of}} his writing, there was not much chance of it ever being unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state. The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained, he himself possessed a fragment.|$|E

5|$|The fourth Test {{followed}} on 6 January, and England took a 93-run victory {{with two}} wickets to Willis, before {{a repeat of}} the first ODI was attempted and again abandoned after 7.2 overs. England then played three first-class matches before a second ODI on 24 January. Australia, batting first, were routed for 101 all out by Hendrick and Botham, Willis bowling a wicketless but economic <b>spell</b> <b>of</b> eight overs for 15 runs and four maidens. England reached the target with seven wickets to spare. In the fifth Test that followed, Willis picked up 3/41 in Australia's second innings, however with the bat he made 24 from 20 balls, with three fours and a six. With this cameo knock, he both surpassed his previous best Test score, and passed 1,500 first-class runs.|$|E

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, the <b>spelling</b> <b>of</b> a name {{registered}} with the Jockey Club is considered definitive, {{even if it is}} an obvious error.
