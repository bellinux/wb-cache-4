40|$|Common Bunt (Tilletia caries) is a mainly seed borne {{disease and}} causes high losses in organic wheat and <b>spelt</b> <b>production.</b> Due {{to the basic}} role of seed health in disease prevention, seed quality aspects have to be {{focussed}} strictly in organic farming. In the scope of these studies, Tilletia results of 1291 wheat seed lots and 298 spelt wheat lots obtained from officially organic seed production from 2000 to 2012 have been analysed. The data indicated significantly the increasing spread of Tilletia caries in seed production in the last years, nevertheless in 2012 {{a high rate of}} more than 90...|$|E
40|$|The work is {{dealt with}} the {{analysis}} of the structure of genetic resources of spelt (Triticum spelta L.), then the current state of cultivation and utilization of this cereal. The review of literature focuses on the orign, distribution, agricultural engineering and breending programmes of spelt. In the Czech Republic spelt is usually grown in organic farming. Data from the statistics of organic farming and data from the database EVIGEZ are used to present the results of this work. The results of this work show an obvious increase of production areas, <b>spelt</b> <b>production</b> and increased interest in products of this crop...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{process towards}} the setting up of strategies of valorisation of typical local products. The case of Garfagnana spelt. The {{aim of this}} paper is to analyse the evolution process that has occurred in a small mountain production system, in the north of Tuscany, i. e. the Garfagnana <b>spelt</b> <b>production,</b> which has survived over time into the local cultural tradition but has recently undergone an intense revitalisation process. The authors intend to analyse the central aspects of that evolution process, with particular attention to the role of the relations among the various actors involved, their quality and their changing over time, in view of their importance in influencing the organisation and hence the development potential of the local system...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in <b>spelt</b> wheat <b>production</b> {{has grown in}} recent years but there is hardly any information on pest development on that wheat species in storehouses. The influence of common and spelt wheat and their products on the reproduction and offspring of confused flour beetles Tribolium confusum Du Val was studied under laboratory conditions (22 - 25 Â°C and 40 - 60...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was the comparison of economic feasibility of most common conventional and organic farm production in Slovenia. The methodology of an integrated deterministic technologic-economic simulation system KARSIM 1. 0 (DSM) application for cost analysis and decision-making support on farms is described in this article. The direct simulation model result is an individual conventional or organic farm product enterprise budget. The DSM consists of 148 deterministic production simulation models that enable different types of costs and financial feasibility calculations for conventional and organic production and food processing. The developed simulation model enables economical evaluation of some most important economic parameters (breakeven price, breakeven yield, financial result, total revenue and coefficient of economics). In conventional farming system the most suitable farm product is potato (Ke = 1. 52), followed by milk and maize production (Ke = 1. 10), wheat production (Ke = 1. 06) and suckling cows production (Ke = 1. 02). The husked <b>spelt</b> <b>production</b> is in conventional farming system economically infeasible (Ke= 0. 82). In organic farming system the most feasible farm product is husked spelt (Ke = 1. 56), followed by potato (Ke = 1. 15), milk (Ke = 1. 04) and suckling cows production (Ke = 1. 03). Maize (Ke = 0. 90) and wheat production (Ke = 0. 83) are economically infeasible...|$|E
