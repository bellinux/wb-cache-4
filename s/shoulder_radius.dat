2500|$|Like all Weatherby {{cartridge}}s, the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge has {{a double}} <b>radius</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{where the body}} and the neck are connected with a continuously curving shoulder; the curve of which reverses at the point of tangency. SAAMI defines the length to the shoulder as the demarcation point where the bottom of inside curvature radius (corresponding roughly to CIP's r1) [...] of the shoulder begins and the length to the neck as where the outside curvature radius (approximating CIP's r2) meets the neck. However, CIP does not define the location of the centers of the r1 and r2 whereas SAAMI provides this as being in inline with the length to the <b>shoulder</b> (inside <b>radius)</b> and length to neck (outside radius). This is due to the CIP treatment of r1 and r2 values as fillet radii as they do with many other cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]257 Weatherby Magnum {{features}} the Weatherby double <b>radius</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The shoulder continuously curves and transitions {{from the body}} radius to the neck radius {{at the point of}} tangency at the shoulder between the two radii.

While the CIP recognizes the correct radii for both the r1 and r2 values, they treat the transition from the body to shoulder and neck to <b>shoulder</b> as filet <b>radii.</b> For this reason the body and neck dimensions are lengthened and a shoulder angle provided. The treatment of the body-shoulder-neck transition zone accounts for the inconsistencies between SAAMI and CIP official dimensions for the cartridge.|$|R

30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{parameters}} (namely ridge height, ridge clearance, ridge nose radius, ridge <b>shoulder</b> <b>radius,</b> ridge-to-punch nose distance, {{and number of}} ridges) were specified for the microridge punch. An excessively high ridge height induces the ridges to be deeply pressed into the blank, whereas an extremely low ridge height causes the ridges to generate unsatisfactory drawing effects. Moreover, an extremely high ridge clearance results in the excessive distribution of the ridge drawing force to the blank. The minimum ridge clearance {{is limited to the}} thickness of the grinding blade. An extremely long ridge nose radius reduces the drawing force of the ridges; however, an excessively short ridge nose radius causes the ridge to be deeply pressed into the blank. In addition, an excessively long ridge <b>shoulder</b> <b>radius</b> induces the ridges to deliver limited drawing force. The minimum ridge <b>shoulder</b> <b>radius</b> is limited to the nasal fillet radius of the grinding blade. An extremely long ridge-to-punch nose distance results in increased thickness difference percentages, whereas an excessively short ridge-to-punch nose distance leads to changes in the appearance of components. In addition, an extremely high number of ridges increases the punch manufacturing costs, whereas an extremely low number of ridges reduces the drawing effect.|$|E

This work aims at a robust design of forming die using numerical analysis and the Taguchi method. A three dimensional elastoplastic finite element model of a sheet metal forming process of SPCEN steel has been successfully developed using the material flow stress obtained from the modified Erichsen cup test. The model was validated with the actual forming experiment and the results agreed well. The influence of draw bead parameters on splitting and thinning distributions were examined using the Taguchi method. Four parameters, namely the friction coefficient, draw bead height, radius and <b>shoulder</b> <b>radius</b> were investigated. The Taguchi main effect analysis and ANOVA {{results show that the}} height and <b>shoulder</b> <b>radius</b> of the draw bead are the most important factor influencing the thinning distribution. Applying the Taguchi method and using the minimum thinning percentage as the design criteria, the optimum die design was identified as height, radius, <b>shoulder</b> <b>radius</b> and the friction coefficient of 4, 8, 8 mm and 0. 125 respectively.

In {{an attempt}} to {{optimize}} the friction spot joining process of Al alloys for automobiles (Al 5000 and Al 6000 series, thickness 1 mm), effects of joining parameters such as tool rotating speed, plunging depth and dwelling time on the weld joints properties were evaluated.

40|$|Freeways are {{arterial}} highways {{characterized by}} {{high levels of}} safety and high speed vehicular traffic. Access {{to and from the}} freeways is provided through ramps. Geometric elements making up freeway facilities include the roadway, median shoulders, grades, and ramps to and from the traveled way at selected locations, <b>shoulders,</b> <b>radius</b> of curvature, lane width, and speed-change lanes. With the increase of traffic using the freeway systems, there arises more traffic weaving movements within the elements making up the freeway systems. This causes traffic flow to compete at the limited spaces available and reduces safety performance of freeway system. In studies on safety issues of freeway systems, geometric elements of freeways have been evaluated for their safety effects on crashes occurring on the freeways. These studies have included interchange spacing, number of through lanes, median shoulder width and type, ramp spacing, length of segment, speed change lanes, and lengths for limited and extended lanes. Their findings revealed that freeway safety issues are associated with freeway geometric characteristics. However, the previous studies did not consider the safety impact of all segment types on the crash frequency on freeways. This study observed four types of segments when a freeway is divided into segments with Exit and Entry terminals. These segments were defined as EN-EN, EX-EX, EN-EX, EX-EN segments where 2 ̆ 2 EX 2 ̆ 2 stands for Exit from the freeway and 2 ̆ 2 EN 2 ̆ 2 stands for Entrance to the freeway. The study also extends types of weaving movements taking place in weaving segments. Crash rate and severity models were developed in this study based on the data collected for every freeway segment type. A complete set of geometric data was included in the data for each freeway segment type. Models for individual freeway segment type (EN-EN, EX-EX, EN-EX, and EX-EN) were developed. The results indicated that for EN-EN segment type; only two freeway characteristics had an impact: median width and segment length. Wider median and long segments both reduced crash while they were insignificant for severity model. For EX-EX segment type, the number of through lanes, median width, and AADT had an impact on average crash rate while for a severity model, only the number of through lanes had an impact. Specifically, it was found that, the number of through lanes reduced both average crash rate and high severity crashes when all through lanes were combined together. However, on individual segment type in a specific freeway, it was found that, the number of through lanes on I- 15 increased average crash rate while they reduced average crash rate on I- 215. Wider median reduced average crash rate while it increased high severity crashes. Traffic volume increased average crash rate while it was found insignificant on severity model. At a freeway level, EX-EX segment type reduced average crash rate compared to both I- 215 and US 95 while it reduced average crash rate for I- 215 compared to I- 15 and US 95. For EN-EX segment type, shoulder width {{had a significant impact on}} average crash rates while the number of through lanes, median width, length of segment, and curve radius indicated significant impact on severity crashes. Wider shoulders on I- 15 reduced average crash rate. The number of through lanes increased high severity crashes when all number of lanes were combined together. However, on individual freeways, the number of through lanes on reduced high severity crashes while they were insignificant on I- 215 and US 95. Wider median increased high severity crashes when all freeways were combined together while they reduced high severity crashes on I- 15. Long segment increased high severity crashes when all EN-EX segment type from all freeways was combined together. Segments with large radius of curvature reduced high severity crashes when all for combined freeways while they increased high severity crashes for I- 15. At a freeway level, I- 15 increased both average crash rate and high severity crashes compared to I- 215 and US 95. For EX-EN segments, shoulder and AADT had a significant impact on average crash rate while the number of through lanes, median width, radius curvature and lane changes from ramp-to-freeway had a significant impact on severity crashes. Wider shoulder reduced average crash rate for combined data from all freeways but increased crash rate on I- 215. Wider median increased high severity crashes for combined data from all freeways while they were insignificant on average crash rate models. Segments with large radius of curvature increased high severity crashes while it was insignificant on average crash rate model. Lane changes from ramp-to-freeway increased high severity crashes.

40|$|International audienceDeep {{drawing is}} one of the most {{important}} operations used in sheet metal forming. Within this, forming of cylindrical cup {{is one of}} the most widely studied deep drawing processes since it allows analysing the effect of different process parameters in phenomena such as earing, springback and ironing. In fact, during the deep drawing of a cylindrical cup the blank thickness gradually increases as the blank outer diameter is reduced to the die inner diameter, resulting in a thickness increase from a point near the bottom radius until the maximum value at the top of the cup. Therefore, if the gap between the punch and the die is not sufficiently large to allow the blank material to flow, ironing of the cup wall will occur. The ironing process typically imposes high contact forces, normal to the surface of the punch and the die, which can lead to the occurrence of galling, particularly for aluminium alloys. In this work an experimental device, adopted in previous studies, was used to analyse the influence of the lubricant conditions in the deep drawing of a cylindrical cup. The study considers an AA 5754 -O aluminium alloy blank with a diameter of 60 mm, which is fully deep drawn with a 33 mm diameter punch. Due to the forming conditions, the cup is deep drawn and ironing of the cup wall also occurs. The experimental tests were performed considering different amounts of lubricant in the blank surfaces in the contact with the die and with the blank-holder in order to better understand the influence of these tools on the process. The experimental study was complemented with numerical simulations, exploring the conditions induced by the ironing operation, quite challenging for the numerical simulation of the process using the finite element method. Besides the influence of the contact with friction conditions in the forming process (i. e. punch force evolution, thickness distribution along the cup wall and contact pressure), the influence of the die <b>shoulder</b> and inner <b>radius</b> were also analysed...|$|R

Moreover, the springback of sheet metal {{should be taken into}} consideration in order to produce bent sheet metal parts within acceptable tolerance limits and to solve geometrical variation for the control of manufacturing process. Nowadays, the importance of this problem increases because of the use of sheet-metal parts with high mechanical characteristics (High Strength Low Alloy steel). This work describes robust methods of predicting springback of parts in 3 D modelling subjected to bending and unbending deformations.
