After unsuccessful attempts to absorb the RMS through negotiations, the Republic of Indonesia initiated a six-month military conflict in July 1950.

In Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, the closely allied P. Theseus has a very short tail, or tooth only, in the male, while in the females the tail is retained. Further east, in Celebes and the <b>South</b> <b>Moluccas,</b> the hardly separable P. Alphenor has quite lost the tail in the male, while the female retains it, but in a narrower and less spatulate form. A little further, in Gilolo, P.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{information}} on morphological characteristics of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) variety Hartapel, origin South Buru. The research was conducted in the Fakal village of <b>South</b> Buru of <b>Moluccas</b> located 1124 m above sea level. The results showed that potato variety Hartapel was found to be a local variety which has long been adapted to local growing environment. Morphological characters of this variety are influenced by environmental factors. The morphological characterization of Hartapel potato variety from South Buru can provide a source of information that can be useful for preserving germplasm diversity of potato varieties. In addition, morphological characterization results can be used as baseline for further development of Hartapel variety of potatoes and can serve as source of information on biodiversity of potato plants...|$|R

50|$|As copilot of a PBY-5, he {{departed}} for a patrol <b>south</b> of Amboina, <b>Moluccas,</b> 19 February. With Lt. Thomas H. Moorer (later admiral and Chief of Naval Operations) as pilot, the patrol plane spotted a merchant ship off Melville Island, Australia, {{and turned to}} investigate. About 0920, nine Japanese fighters, part of a 70 plane force en route to bomb Darwin, Australia, jumped the PBY. Soon the plane was in flames, its port engine out and fuel streaming along the fuselage. Despite the attacking fighters, Lieutenant Moorer and Ensign Mosley skillfully landed the plane. In Lieutenant Moorer’s words, Mosley assisted by handling the throttle “although dazed and bleeding profusely from a wound in the head.” SS Florence D., an American merchant ship carrying ammunition to the Philippines, rescued the crew. Later that day, Japanese carrier planes attacked the unarmed ship with 500 pound bombs. Survivors, including Mosley, made Bathurst Island in two lifeboats about midnight, and a RAAF patrol plane spotted them on the 21st. The next morning, HMAS Warrnambool (J202), an Australian subchaser, rescued them and carried them to Darwin 23 February. Early in March Mosley returned to the United States where he joined VP 44 for operations out of Pearl Harbor. Late in May he flew search patrols out of Midway Island in anticipation of an enemy attack. During the first air attack against the island 4 June Mosley was serving as copilot in 44-P-12. His patrolling PBY-5A was attacked by two Japanese seaplanes, and the bomber was shot down in flames.|$|R

The South Moluccan rebels initially clung on to an early post-colonial treaty prescribing a federal form of statehood.
