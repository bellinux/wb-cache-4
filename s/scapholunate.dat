50|$|The <b>scapholunate</b> {{ligament}} is an intraarticular ligament binding the scaphoid and lunate {{bones of}} the wrist together. It {{is divided into three}} areas, dorsal, proximal and palmar, with the dorsal segment being the strongest part. It is the main stabilizer of the scaphoid. In contrast to the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament, the lunotriquetral ligament is more prominent on the palmar side.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{diagnose}} a SLAC wrist {{you need a}} posterior anterior (PA) view X-ray, a lateral view X-ray and a fist view X-ray. The fist X-ray is often made {{if there is no}} convincing Terry Thomas sign. A fist X-ray of a <b>scapholunate</b> ligament rupture will show a descending capitate.

50|$|The initial {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} a suspected tear of the <b>scapholunate</b> and lunotriquetral interosseous ligament is a splint of the wrist. If the pain and instability persists, one could undergo an open surgery to reconstruct the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament. The lunotriquetral shear test may also be used. Arthroscopy is until today in an experimental stage but research suggest that {{in the near future}} it will be a reasonable alternative for open surgery due to faster recovery time. For a tear in the lunotriquetral ligament, arthroscopic debridement is the prime treatment with a loss or reduction of symptoms of 78-100%.|$|E
50|$|Watson's test {{is used by}} {{physicians}} to diagnose <b>scapholunate</b> instability.This test has a low specificity and sometimes is positive for capito-lunate instability. As many as 20% of normal wrists will also have a 'clunk'.|$|E
50|$|Scaphoid Lunate Advanced Collapse, {{also known}} as SLAC Wrist is a wrist in which the <b>scapholunate</b> {{ligament}} is ruptured. If the diagnosis is missed or the given treatment is not effective, this will eventually give osteoarthritis of the wrist.|$|E
50|$|Complete rupture of this {{ligament}} {{leads to}} wrist instability, termed <b>scapholunate</b> advanced collapse (SLAC). The instability {{can be either}} dynamic in nature which typically cannot be seen on X-Ray, or static which {{can be seen on}} X-Ray. The Watson's test may be used in diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|Osteoarthritis of {{the wrist}} can be idiopathic, but it is mostly seen as a {{post-traumatic}} condition. There are different types of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. <b>Scapholunate</b> Advanced Collapse (SLAC) {{is the most common}} form, followed by Scaphoid Non-union Advanced Collapse (SNAC). [...] Other post-traumatic causes such as intra-articular fractures of the distal radius or ulna can also lead to wrist osteoarthritis, but are less common.|$|E
50|$|Rupture of the <b>scapholunate</b> {{ligament}} changes wrist joint kinematics. Due to lack {{of stability}} from the separated scaphoid and lunate, the lunate may angulate to the posterior side of the hand. This {{is known as a}} dorsal intercalated segment instability deformity (DISI), which disrupts the perfect fit between the radius and the scaphoid carpal bone.This process is known as SLAC and eventually will lead to degenerative osteoarthritis of the radioscaphoid joint.|$|E
50|$|In stage I {{surgical}} treatment often consists of neurectomy of the posterior interosseous nerve {{and is often}} combined with other procedures. In {{the case of a}} SLAC, the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament can be reconstructed in combination with a radial styloidectomy, in which the radial styloid is surgically removed from the distal radius. In the case of a SNAC, the scaphoid can be reconstructed by fixating the scaphoid with a screw or by placing a bone graft(Matti-Russe procedure)to increase the stability of the scaphoid.|$|E
50|$|A {{patient may}} suffer from various {{illnesses}} regarding the wrist. Examples include TFCC lesion, <b>scapholunate</b> and lunotriquetral instability, ganglions, and synovitis. These illnesses concern many different tissues and structures. By using just one portal, one {{will never be}} able to visualize all these structures and tissues. For that reason, several portals exist, each having its own function (Table 1). The traditional portals are at the back of the hand (dorsal side), because many neurovascular structures are at risk at the palmar side of the hand.|$|E
50|$|SLAC and SNAC {{are both}} caused by injury, for example a fall on an {{extended}} hand. SLAC {{is caused by}} rupture of the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament, SNAC {{is caused by a}} scaphoid fracture which does not heal and because of that will develop in a non-union fracture. SLAC is more common than SNAC; 55% of the patients with wrist osteoarthritis has a SLAC wrist. Although they have a different underlying pathology, they both lead to abnormal wrist kinematics which will eventually lead to osteoarthritis of the wrist.|$|E
50|$|The Brunelli Procedure is a {{surgical}} procedure {{that can be}} used to correct instability in the wrist. Instability in the wrist can be caused by a torn <b>Scapholunate</b> ligament. The Brunelli Procedure does not fix the torn ligament. A hole is drilled through the Scaphoid bone and a part of a tendon taken from the patient is put through this hole and attached to the nearby bones. The procedure usually results in reduced movement of the wrist. Instability in the wrist can, over time, lead to wrist osteoarthritis.|$|E
50|$|Because the <b>scapholunate</b> {{ligament}} is ruptured, the scaphoid and lunate are not longer connected. This {{results in}} a larger space between the two bones, {{also known as the}} Terry Thomas sign. A space larger than 3 mm is suspicious and a space larger than 5 mm is a proven SLAC pathology. Scaphoid instability due to the ligament rupture can be stactic or dynamic. When the X-ray is diagnostic and there is a convincing Terry Thomas sign it is a static scaphoid instability. When the scaphoid is made unstable by either the patient or by manipulation by the examining physician it is a dynamic instability.|$|E
50|$|To {{perform the}} test, the {{examiner}} grasps the wrist with their thumb over the scaphoid tubercle (volar {{aspect of the}} palm) {{in order to prevent}} the scaphoid from moving into its more vertically oriented position in radial deviation. For the test, the wrist needs to be in slight extension. The patient's wrist is then moved from ulnar to radial deviation. The examiner will feel a significant 'clunk' and the patient will experience pain if the test is positive. For completeness, the test must be performed on both wrists for comparison. If the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament is disrupted, the scaphoid will subluxate over the dorsal lip of the distal radius.|$|E
50|$|Distal radius {{fractures}} {{might occur}} {{when a person}} falls on an outstretched hand (FOOSH). Immediate pain, swelling and loss of wrist function {{are the most common}} symptoms. These fractures have wide variety of classification systems, but for arthroscopic intervention a difference is made between extra- or intra-articular fractures. Arthroscopy can be used to treat an intra-articular distal radius fracture {{and at the same time}} examine the <b>Scapholunate</b> ligament, Lunotriquetral ligament and articular disk. The shifted bone segment is relocated, in necessary a bone autograft can be used to fill up the fracture. At the end the fracture is stabilized using percutane wires. Arthroscopy has good results as treatment for distal radius fracture, with over 85% of the patiÃ«nts showing good to excellent postoperative results.|$|E
30|$|<b>Scapholunate</b> diastasis is {{the term}} used to {{describe}} an abnormal increase in the <b>scapholunate</b> interval. <b>Scapholunate</b> diastasis occurs {{when there is a}} functionally complete tear of the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament. <b>Scapholunate</b> diastasis {{can be seen in the}} setting of <b>scapholunate</b> dissociation. However, <b>scapholunate</b> dissociation and <b>scapholunate</b> diastasis are not truly synonyms as one may have dissociation with a preserved width of the <b>scapholunate</b> interval [8].|$|E

40|$|Background: Repair of the dorsal {{component}} of the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament alone is the usual surgical treatment for <b>scapholunate</b> injuries. Recent literature has suggested that additionally repairing the palmar {{component of}} the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament leads to improved and lasting clinical outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the biomechanical properties of both portions of <b>scapholunate</b> ligaments derived from the same wrist and compare them with the whole <b>scapholunate</b> ligament. The goal was to further elucidate the importance of the palmar portion of the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament from a biomechanical perspective. Methods: <b>Scapholunate</b> ligaments and their components were harvested from the same fresh frozen cadaveric wrists. Force at failure and stiffness were measured. Findings: The mean maximum loads to failure for the entire <b>scapholunate</b> ligament, dÎ¿rsal and palmar portions were found to be 147 (SD 54) N, 83 (SD 18) N and 86 (SD 16) N respectively. No statistical difference was found between the mean maximum load and stiffness for palmar and dorsal components (P = 0. 05). Mean maximum load and stiffness, of the intermediate portion, were 36 (SD 15) N and 25 (SD 23) N/mm. Interpretation: Our biomechanical findings on the dorsal and palmar portions of the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament suggest that each portion contributes approximately 50 % to the whole ligament tensile force. These results appear to agree with other reports about the stabilizing role of the palmar portion of the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament and suggest that the palmar portion of the ligament should be considered for surgical repair.

40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of <b>scapholunate</b> interosseous ligament tears with distal radius fractures is likely important in treatment and outcome, but identification of these injuries {{has not been}} well explored. We asked {{whether there was a}} difference in the <b>scapholunate</b> interval between high-grade and low-grade tears of the <b>scapholunate</b> interosseous ligament in distal radius fractures, the best position of the wrists to identify any differences; we also asked what gap width accurately identified high-grade tears on fluoroscopic evaluation. We fluoroscopically evaluated the <b>scapholunate</b> gap in six different wrist positions and then performed arthroscopic examination in 45 distal radius fractures in 44 consecutive patients. The tears were classified as high-grade (Grade 3 or greater) or low-grade (Grade 2 or less) based on arthroscopic findings. We then compared the <b>scapholunate</b> gap measured on fluoroscopic images between the high-grade tear group and the low-grade tear group and between the different positions of the same wrist. The <b>scapholunate</b> gap was wider in the high-grade tear group than in the low-grade tear group and wider in ulnar deviation than in radial deviation. A 2 -mm <b>scapholunate</b> gap appeared the best cutoff point for the fluoroscopic diagnosis. We concluded fluoroscopic examination is a good test for identifying high-grade tears of the <b>scapholunate</b> interosseous ligament in distal radius fractures...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four {{patients}} {{were treated with}} <b>scapholunate</b> ligament repair and dorsal capsulodesis for <b>scapholunate</b> dissociation. Seventeen {{patients were}} available for follow-up {{at an average of}} 30 months. The average interval between injury and surgery was 3 months. At final follow-up, no patients were pain-free. Average total wrist motion was 60 % and grip strength 70 % of the opposite normal side. The average preoperative <b>scapholunate</b> angle was 78 Â° and was corrected to a normal 47 Â° at surgery. The average final <b>scapholunate</b> angle was 72 Â°, which was not significantly different from the preoperative value. The <b>scapholunate</b> gap likewise was not significantly changed postoperatively. Only two patients had an excellent or good outcome using a clinical grading system, and six out of 17 scored good or excellent using a radiographic grading system. In conclusion, repair of the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament with dorsal capsulodesis failed to provide consistent pain relief and maintain carpal alignment in patients with static <b>scapholunate</b> instability.

30|$|<b>Scapholunate</b> {{dissociation}} is {{the loss}} of synchronous motion or normal alignment between the scaphoid and lunate bones usually from ligamentous injury [7, 8]. The mechanism of injury in <b>scapholunate</b> dissociation is most commonly trauma causing wrist extension, ulnar deviation and intercarpal supination [9]. Eventually <b>scapholunate</b> dissociation leads to misalignment of other scaphoid joints and ultimately to osteoarthritis (SLAC wrist) [8].|$|E
40|$|Objective: Closed {{reduction}} and internal fixation of the <b>scapholunate</b> dissociation are currently performed using K-wires or a headless bone screw. We present an alternative for this fixation {{by means of}} a cannulated screw with dynamic adjustable interfragmentary compression and discuss the advantages of using this type of technique. Methods: Closed reduction of the <b>scapholunate</b> interval was achieved using a K-wire centered through the scaphoid and lunate bones followed by delivery of a cannulated compression screw to maintain the <b>scapholunate</b> interval. Results: Nine months after the surgery, the hand active range of motion was significantly improved. Only minimal pain was experienced with high loadings of the wrist and the patient achieved much improvement in his wrist strength. Conclusions: The technique we present is simple to perform and represents an attractive alternative to the conventional procedures to achieve the reduction of the <b>scapholunate</b> diastasis and the maintenance of the <b>scapholunate</b> interval. <b>Scapholunate</b> dissociation is a common injury of the biomechanical linkage between the scaphoid and lunate where the degree of injury may extend from partial or complete disruptio...|$|E
30|$|SLAC is an osteoarthropathy of the carpus {{secondary}} to altered stress around an unstable scaphoid. In SLAC, there is ligamentous instability {{of the wrist}} including disruption of the <b>scapholunate</b> ligament, which causes <b>scapholunate</b> dissociation, <b>scapholunate</b> diastasis, rotary subluxation of the scaphoid and DISI. Changes in alignment of the carpus, particularly changes in position of the scaphoid, result in inordinate stress and load to be placed predominantly on the radioscaphoid and capitolunate joints.|$|E
40|$|Eight {{patients}} underwent <b>scapholunate</b> reconstruction using tensionable suture anchors. Adapted from {{a modified}} Brunelli technique, the anchors provide a fixed cable {{that reduces the}} <b>scapholunate</b> diastasis and maintains reduction during the healing phase. The flexor carpi radialis tendon graft is advanced through the scaphoid and stabilizes the volar scaphotrapezial ligament, dorsal <b>scapholunate</b> ligament, dorsal intercarpal ligament, and dorsal radiocarpal ligament. The ligament-sparing approach is closed using an ulnar advancement capsulodesis that further reinforces the dorsal intercarpal and dorsal radiocarpal ligament. Good clinical results were obtained. Measured on a visual analog scale (0 to 10), the average pain score improved from 5. 8 to 2. 1, average patient satisfaction was 7. 6, average extension was 56 degrees (91 % of contralateral side), flexion was 44 degrees (70 % of contralateral side), and grip was strength 41 kg (95 % of contralateral side). Radiographic parameters were less favorable. The average <b>scapholunate</b> angle was 71 degrees, radiolunate angle 16 degrees, and <b>scapholunate</b> interval 3. 0 mm. The cable-augmented, quad ligament <b>scapholunate</b> ligament reconstruction offers theoretical advantages over previously published techniques, but long-term follow-up is required.
