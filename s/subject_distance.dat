25|$|As <b>subject</b> <b>distance</b> is decreased, {{the subject}} {{magnification}} increases, and eventually becomes large {{in comparison with}} the hyperfocal magnification. Thus the effect of focal length is greatest near the hyperfocal distance, and decreases as <b>subject</b> <b>distance</b> is decreased. However, the near/far perspective will differ for different focal lengths, so the difference in DOF may not be readily apparent.|$|E
25|$|The DOF {{beyond the}} subject is always greater than the DOF {{in front of the}} subject. When {{the subject is}} at the hyperfocal {{distance}} or beyond, the far DOF is infinite, so the ratio is 1:∞; as the <b>subject</b> <b>distance</b> decreases, near:far DOF ratio increases, approaching unity at high magnification. For large apertures at typical portrait distances, the ratio is still close to 1:1. The oft-cited rule that 1/3 of the DOF is in front of the subject and 2/3 is beyond (a 1:2 ratio) is true only when the <b>subject</b> <b>distance</b> is 1/3 the hyperfocal distance.|$|E
25|$|Several other factors, such {{as subject}} matter, movement, camera-to-subject distance, lens focal length, {{selected}} lens f-number, format size, and {{circle of confusion}} criteria also influence when a given defocus becomes noticeable. The combination of focal length, <b>subject</b> <b>distance,</b> and format size defines magnification at the film / sensor plane.|$|E

25|$|The {{asymmetrical}} lens formulas require {{knowledge of}} the pupil magnification, which usually is not specified for medium- and small-format lenses. The pupil magnification can be estimated by looking into {{the front and rear}} of the lens and measuring the diameters of the apparent apertures, and computing the ratio of rear diameter to front diameter (Shipman 1977, 144). However, for many zoom lenses and internal-focusing non-zoom lenses, the pupil magnification changes with <b>subject</b> <b>distance,</b> and several measurements may be required.|$|E
25|$|For a given {{scene and}} subject magnification, the {{background}} blur increases with lens focal length. If {{it is not}} important that background objects be unrecognizable, background de-emphasis can be increased by using a lens of longer focal length and increasing the <b>subject</b> <b>distance</b> to maintain the same magnification. This technique requires that sufficient space {{in front of the}} subject be available; moreover, the perspective of the scene changes because of the different camera position, and this {{may or may not be}} acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Depth {{of field}} {{increases}} with f-number, {{as illustrated in}} the image here. This means that photographs taken with a low f-number (large aperture) will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, {{with the rest of}} the image (nearer and farther elements) out of focus. This is frequently used for nature photography and portraiture because background blur (the aesthetic quality of which is known as 'bokeh') can be aesthetically pleasing and puts the viewer's focus on the main subject in the foreground. The depth of field of an image produced at a given f-number is dependent on other parameters as well, including the focal length, the <b>subject</b> <b>distance,</b> and the format of the film or sensor used to capture the image. Depth of field can be described as depending on just angle of view, <b>subject</b> <b>distance,</b> and entrance pupil diameter (as in von Rohr's method). As a result, smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same f-number for the same distance of focus and same angle of view since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length (wider angle lens) to produce the same angle of view, and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths. Therefore, reduced–depth-of-field effects will require smaller f-numbers when using small-format cameras than when using larger-format cameras.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{the larger}} the format size, the longer a lens {{will need to be}} to capture the same framing as a smaller format. In motion pictures, for example, a frame with a 12 degree {{horizontal}} field of view will require a 50mm lens on 16mm film, a 100mm lens on 35mm film, and a 250mm lens on 65mm film. Conversely, using the same focal length lens with each of these formats will yield a progressively wider image as the film format gets larger: a 50mm lens has a horizontal field of view of 12degrees on 16mm film, 23.6degrees on 35mm film, and 55.6degrees on 65mm film. Therefore, because the larger formats require longer lenses than the smaller ones, they will accordingly have a smaller depth of field. Compensations in exposure, framing, or <b>subject</b> <b>distance</b> need to be made in order to make one format look like it was filmed in another format.|$|E

50|$|The {{viewfinder}} of any {{camera that}} does not allow viewing through the taking lens, including rangefinder cameras, is necessarily offset from the taking lens, so that the image shown is not exactly what will be recorded on the film; this parallax error is negligible at large <b>subject</b> <b>distances,</b> but increases as the distance decreases. More advanced rangefinder cameras project into the viewfinder a brightline frame that moves as the lens is focused, correcting parallax error down to the minimum distance at which the rangefinder functions. The angle {{of view of a}} given lens also changes with distance, and the brightline frames in the finders of a few cameras automatically adjust for this as well. For extreme close-up photography, the rangefinder camera is awkward to use, as the viewfinder no longer points at the subject.|$|R

50|$|Another {{problem is}} the lower level of light underwater.

Large unwieldy lighting systems were problematic to early underwater videography. And last, underwater objects viewed from an airspace with a flat window, such as the eye inside a mask or the camera inside a housing, appear to be about 25% larger than they are. The photographer needs to move farther back to get the subject into the field of view.
