Assuming that both constituents of the reinforced ground are purely cohesive materials ("lime column" technique), an upper bound estimate for the macroscopic strength condition of the reinforced soil as a homogenized medium is first obtained, providing definite evidence of a shear strength anisotropy associated with the reinforcement preferential orientation. The kinematic method of yield design is then performed on the basis of such a criterion, making use of rotational failure mechanisms involving <b>slip</b> <b>circles</b> in the reinforced ground. Upper bound estimates are finally obtained for the embankment stability factor, as functions of the degree of reinforcement and relative thickness of the soil layer. These results are compared with those derived from a simplified analysis, where the reinforced soil is assumed to exhibit an averaged isotropic cohesion. This comparison clearly indicates that the latter simplified analysis may produce quite unsafe estimates for the embankment stability, which can be attributed to the fact that it fails to capture the inherent strength anisotropy of the reinforced soi...|$|R

The statistical properties of concern include the mean value and coefficient of variation (COV) of the model factor. It is found that the mean values of the model factors for the modified Terzaghi׳s and Bjerrum-Eide׳s methods are close to 1, whereas that for the <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> method is significantly greater than 1.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> {{method of}} slices is {{commonly}} used in the analyses of slope stability and bearing capacity for multi-layered ground. However, {{in the case of}} ground consisting of horizontal sandy layer, it is known that modified Fellenius׳ method tends to underestimate the factor of safety, while simplified Bishop׳s method tends to overestimate the factor of safety. In this study, a new <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> method was proposed for the purpose of improving the accuracy of the analysis for a ground consisting of sand and clay layers. In the proposed method, β of the ratio of inter-slice shear force to inter-slice normal force i. e tan(βαi) is assumed constant as 0. 25 for all slices. This is named as circle bearing capacity factor (CBCF) method. It was found that the bearing capacity factors, Nc, Nq, and Nγ calculated for shallow foundation on horizontal ground from CBCF method agreed well with that obtained from the plastic solution. The back-analyses carried out for a few case studies on the stability of slopes on earth structures found in sand and clay layers showed that the factor of safety calculated from CBCF method explains the actual performance of earth structures well. The proposed CBCF method proves it reliability in calculating bearing capacity for shallow foundations. This was achieved from the results obtained from centrifugal model test, which were carried out for dense sand layer overlying soft clay with various conditions by Okamura et al. (1998). It was examined that the factor of safety calculated for the stability of slopes from CBCF method can explain the actual performance of geotechnical structures constructed on ground consisting of sand and clay layers...|$|E

This article revisits some or those data, specially the imaginary essay to hide the exploitation, coming from the children interviewed. It is asked why, having openly lived the situation, the children choose to silence about it. But they know well about sexual exploitation, as demonstrated by interviews' analyses. They identify the exploiters' profiles, the overall situation in which the exploitation occurs and the sexual program, but avoid to report these facts as occurring to themselves. The article tries to understand how the silence was created and its purpose. By hypothesis, the circulation of gossips in the small towns arouses a stigmatization process from which the children try to escape. That is why they silence. In the other side, always under an imaginary cover, the silence protects the towns, its inhabitants and families, the clients and the enticers, assuring the maintenance of a vicious circle in which the children continue falling into situations of sexual (and economic) exploitation.

Here we present a model for rotational flow under spherical indenters, based on the <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> construction which has already been applied to pyramidal indenters. By using the magnitude of a representative Burgers vector as a scale parameter, it is also possible to estimate the approximate size at which the transition from laminar to rotational flow occurs.

40|$|Design {{procedures}} for Geosynthetic Reinforced Column Supported (GRCS) embankments generally consider the sliding failure for external stability and the shear failure mode for internal stability. However, other failure modes such as collapse failure, <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> failure, punching shear failure around column heads (overall or local), and bending failure of DCM columns are also significant for GRCS embankments. Although some design procedures have considered {{some of these}} failure modes and proposed design criteria to check against these failure modes, they are not currently used in practice due to uncertainties related to some assumptions used in developing these methods, unreliable results given by them and difficulty in finding some parameters. Still there are uncertainties in identifying the critical failure modes for these embankments at the ultimate limit state (ULS) conditions. In this paper, two-dimensional finite element modeling incorporating strain softening behavior of cement admixed soils is used to identify the failure modes of GRCS embankments at the ULS. Bending failure of columns with subsequent shear failure {{is found to be}} critical for internal stability of GRCS embankments. Consequently, analytical equations are derived to calculate the factor of safety against bending failure for improved ground considering driving and resisting moments...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} work detailed {{in this thesis}} is mainly aimed at two aspects, i. e. (a). assessments of slope reliability considering both deterministic and probabilistic approaches, and (b). updating of slope reliability by reducing the contribution of systematic errors. Currently, the determination of critical slip surfaces within a probabilistic framework {{and the influence of}} systematic errors on calculated reliability are areas requiring further development. This research addresses these problems and provides appropriate and systematic approaches in these areas. Four commonly used deterministic models have been employed in this research. Difficulties in convergence associated with the original Janbu generalized method have been addressed by the proposed modified Janbu method. The convergence of the modified Janbu generalized method developed in this thesis is generally rapid. Based on previously published examples, it is found that the calculation results in good agreement with those based on other reliable methods. An extra effort made by the writer on the modified method is the determination of the position and depth of tension cracks. The effects of tension cracks on slope stability have been considered during the search for the critical slip surfaces. Critical slip surfaces identified without considering the possible formation of tension cracks are found be different from those identified when cracks are considered as part of the search process. Reliability framework for the consideration of inherent variability of geotechnical parameters has been developed {{on the basis of the}} adopted deterministic methods and the proposed probabilistic approaches. Two solution techniques for calculating moments of functions of random variables have been employed (i. e. first order second moment approximation and Rosenblueth point estimate method). Three probabilistic models (i. e. lumped parameter model, local average process model and multi-layer model) have been developed for assessing slope reliability. Spatial variation of shear strength parameters of earth materials has been incorporated in the last two models. The simplex reflection technique has been used for the determination of critical surfaces based either on the factor of safety or on the reliability index. Application of the technique to the search for the critical <b>slip</b> <b>circles</b> has been enhanced. Its extension to the identification of the critical slip surfaces of arbitrary shape has been implemented. Based on the proposed optimization approach, this {{research work}} back-analysed some documented failure case histories by searching for the critical slip surfaces and comparing the calculated critical surfaces with the observed failure surfaces. In the back-analysis studies, it is found that only one pair of values of cohesion c and friction angle Φ can be regarded as reasonable. This is the combination which leads to coincidence or approximate coincidence between the observed failure surface and the optimized critical failure surface. Based on the developed models and approaches, the case and example studies have allowed a comprehensive analysis of the contributions of different uncertainties to the location of critical slip surfaces and the evaluation of slope reliability. The difference between conventional and reliability based critical slip surfaces have been explored. It is found that a conventional critical slip surface is not always close to the corresponding reliability based critical slip surface. Under certain conditions the reliability based critical slip surfaces are much deeper than the conventional critical slip surfaces; in other situations conventionally determined critical surfaces are deeper. In addition to the inherent variability of shear strength parameters and pore water pressure and the intrinsic random measurement error, there are two systematic errors involved in the evaluation of slope stability, i. e. statistical estimation error and measurement bias. These systematic errors do not follow the averaging rule and can not be expected to cancel out- They introduce uncertainties in the estimation of the statistical parameters (mean and standard deviation) and thus the evaluation of slope stability. However, these errors are not the inherent characteristics of the natural world and can be reduced on the basis of additional information. In the case of slope stability study, this information could be the performance of a soil or rock slope. The performance (e. g. failure or success) could be considered associated with each stage of construction or operation. An approach based on Bayes’ theorem has been developed in this thesis to update slope reliability. The performance of a slope is regarded as a full scale field based on this approach. The approach provides new prospects for the application of probability theory to slope stability analysis. It can be employed for a major project at any stage of its construction or operation. The approach can result in an enhanced appreciation of risk and reliability and may lead to significant cost savings for a project. The application of this approach has been demonstrated for modeling, analysis and updating of slope stability for both failed and survived slopes...|$|R

40|$|Historically the Netherlands {{have always}} {{had to deal with}} the threat of flooding, both from the rivers and the sea as well as from heavy rainfall. The country {{consists}} of a large amount of polders, which are low lying areas of land protected from flooding by embankments. These polders require an extensive water storage and drainage system to discharge excess water to the surrounding ‘outside water’. Through a large system of ditches water is pumped onto large storage canals which in turn drain in to the ‘outside water’: in the sea or in rivers. In Dutch these drainage canals are called ‘Boezems’. The embankments which enclose the storage canals inside the polders are called Regional Flood Defences. The objective is to determine whether or not the flood risk approach can be applied to a system of regional flood defence systems, given the existing data and ‘state of the art’ methods. The proposed methodology will provide a basis for more thorough assessment of the regional flood defences, not only based on the safety standards, but including the failure probabilities of all relevant geotechnical failure mechanisms and corresponding consequences of flooding. The project focuses on ‘Boezemkaden’, which will be addressed as regional flood defences in the remainder of this document. These flood defences typically retain lower hydraulic heads than primary flood defences. Risk assessment methodology Flood risk is assessed by the annual expected damage due to flooding, which is estimated by multiplying the probability of flooding with the consequences of flooding. The largest knowledge gaps exist in the calculation of probabilities, because several ‘state of the art’ models are available to determine the flood consequences due to breaches in a flood defence system. Probability of flooding The probability of failure of a system of flood defences is determined based on a schematization of the system, which divides it in sections with similar strength properties. Probabilistic methods are used to determine the probability of failure of one section. Flood scenarios are defined as groups of sections which have similar consequences during a flood: these are chosen such that every breach in this group, regardless of its location, will lead to the same flood consequences. To obtain the probability of one flood scenario, the failure probabilities of individual dike sections are combined. The probability of flooding of the whole system can be determined by combining the scenario probabilities. The manner in which the failure probabilities are combined depends on the occurrence of relief in the system:  Relief: if failure of one section results in lower loads on the other sections relief is taken in to account. This can be done in two ways: by assuming that the weakest section fails first or by assuming that the first loaded section fails first;  No relief: if failure of one section does not have any effect on the loads of other sections, no relief is taken in to account. The occurrence of relief strongly depends on the volume of water inside the canal compared to the size of the inundated area after a breach. The extent of relief in canal systems requires careful investigation for every case study. With relief, we can assume only one breach is possible within one canal system. However, when there is no relief multiple breaches are possible. This is an important part of the schematization of the system, as the occurrence of relief has large effect on flood risk. Flood consequences It is assumed that floods resulting from a breach in a regional flood defence system only have inundation depths in the order of decimetres, except for the occasional deeper polders. Due to the low expected inundation depths no loss of life is taken in to account. The economic consequences are determined with HIS SSM and WSS. The HIS SSM model provides an estimate of the economic consequences and loss of life for large floods, with inundation depths of several meters. A disadvantage of the model is that it is inaccurate for low inundation depths. The ‘Water Schade Schatter’ is developed to determine the consequences of small floods due to heavy rainfall in polders. This model uses more accurate consequence functions for low inundation depths of several decimetres, providing more accurate estimations for small floods. A major disadvantage is that the consequence functions are limited to inundation depths below 0. 3 meter. To account for larger inundation depths, the consequence functions for buildings specifically have to be changed. Both methods are used and compared in this report; the difference between both estimators can reach up to 20 %. No clear distinction can be made of which estimator provides an upper or lower limit. Uncertainties in loads on regional flood defences To determine failure probabilities, insight is required in the statistical distribution of the governing loads, which for regional flood defences are: 1) Hydraulic loads: water levels inside the canals and resulting groundwater level; 2) Traffic loads: vertical loads on top of the flood defence; Waves in these canals are neglected. Currently a research program is undergoing on the stability of peat dikes during droughts. This load is not taken in to account at this stage, because the results of this research are expected to largely influence the assessment of regional flood defences. Furthermore, a case study is chosen for a region where earthquake loading is not present. Hydraulic loads We consider the volume of water in the canals being governed by the inflow from the polder drainage stations and the outflow to the outside water; neglecting rainfall, seepage and local wind set up. These water levels are regulated by the water boards. During extreme rainfall events, the canals have a certain storage volume available for storage of excess water out of the polders pumped on to the canals, which is determined by the difference between the target water level and the ‘drain stop level’; the maximum allowed water level on the canals. Once the ‘drain stop level’ is reached, the polder drainage stations are not allowed to keep pumping water on to the canals. This event may only occur with a probability of 1 / 100 per year. Whether or not the drain stop is successful depends on the way these are managed. During heavy rainfall events, water boards may have to choose between having to exceed the ‘drain stop level’ on the canals to keep polders dry, or vice versa. The drain stop may fail due to factors which cannot be influenced by the waterboard, or because a certain part of a polder needs to remain dry. The event where the water levels exceed the drain stop level is defined as ‘failure of the drain stop’. Water level observations are used to determine the water level statistic of the regulated system. A Generalized Pareto Distribution is fitted through independent peaks of water levels in the canals. This distribution is modified, to account for the regulation of water levels in the system, by making a distinction successful and unsuccessful drain stop, see Figure 21. Traffic loads The combination of hydraulic loads (high water levels) and traffic loads is governing for the stability of the flood defence. Expert ellicitation was used to determine the statistical distribution of traffic loads. Water board employees responsible for the assessment of the regional flood defences were asked to provide estimates of the 5 th, 50 th and 95 th quantiles of the statistical distribution of the traffic loads. Furthermore, they were asked to provide an estimate of the correlation between the traffic load and water level. The resulting traffic load distribution is shown in Figure 25, for green and grey flood defences. No correlations between the traffic load and water levels was expected with average water levels; the experts all agreed on this point. However, they did not agree on the correlation between the traffic load and the extreme water levels, which was either positive or negative. Different combinations of hydraulic and traffic loads are possible, which depend on the management of the water board. Specifically the policy regarding traffic loads on a regional flood defence determines which combinations of loads are most likely to occur. We determined the probability of failure of the regional flood defences with and without traffic loads. Using this methodology, we showed the influence of the traffic loads on the failure probability and risk of regional flood defences, which is significant. Uncertainties in strength of regional flood defences The following failure mechanisms are governing for regional flood defences: Overflow, Piping and Instability of the inner slope. FORM reliability calculations are used to determine the probability of failure for each mechanism. Overflow will occur when the water levels in the canal exceed the retaining height of the surrounding flood defence. The limit state function of overflow is based on a critical overflow amount, which can lead to erosion of the inner slope and breaching. The stability for piping is calculated with the updated Sellmeijer formula. ‘Hydraulic short circuiting’ is required for piping to develop under regional flood defences. Recent research has shown that hydraulic short circuiting is likely to occur when there is an aquifer below the canals. The response of the water pressure behind the dike to intrusion of water from the canal in the aquifer depends on the thickness of the aquifer. Field tests are required to determine the reduced hydraulic head over the flood defence, due to reduced infiltration of water from the canal to the aquifer. D-Geo Stability is used to determine the probability of failure for inner slope instability. The failure probability of critical <b>slip</b> <b>circles</b> is calculated with Bishop, for several combinations of water levels, piezo metric lines and traffic loads.

These chart solutions bound the true stability numbers within ± 9 % or better and are suited to isotropic and homogeneous intact rock or heavily jointed rock masses. A comparison of the stability numbers obtained by bounding methods and the limit equilibrium method has been performed where the later was found to predict unconservative factors of safety for steeper slopes. It was also observed that the stability numbers may increase depending on the material parameters in the Hoek–Brown model. This phenomenon has been further investigated in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{behaviour}} {{of vehicles}} {{is often the}} subject of study, motivated by either the development of active safety systems uch as ESP, or the improvement of vehicle performance such as for racecars. In all of these cases, combined slip {{needs to be taken}} into account. In many cases however, the full set of tyre characteristics is not available. Consequently, one needs to work with inaccurate combined slip properties based on estimated slip stifnesses and friction levels. It would be a great advantage if combined slip characteristics could be estimated accurately, especially for truck tyres and racecar tyres, where facilities are rare and testing is very expensive. For passenger cars and light van tyres, about 60 % of the testing effort is spent in combined slip. This means time and costs which could be saved by this accurate estimation. Moreover, apart from this reduction of the testing effort, the estimation could be a tool for assessment in testing tyres in combined slip leading to better quality tests results. Anyhow, it will permit to derive combined slip characteristics when no test-data are available. First, some fundamental aspects in tyre modelling are given with the MF-Tyre Model (Magic Formula) treated in detail. Combined slip as described by the MF-Tyre model is discussed with the characteristics derived and compared with different passenger car tyres. In parallel, combined slip is also studied from a more fundamental scope using the physical Brush Model, with special focus on the ratio between tyre forces under pure slip and combined slip conditions (the weighting functions). Various methods to derive these weighting functions based on pure slip characteristics without testing are treated. Among these, two methods lead to satisfactory results, the <b>Slip</b> <b>Circle</b> Sinusoidal Method (SCS) presented by Pottinger and especially the Practical Slip Similarity Method (PSS), derived and developed by the authors. Among others, these methods will be compared with the Magic Formula fits and the experimental results with observed deviations for the PSS-method in shear force with measurement results bounded by 5 % for large tyre load and less than 8 % for low tyre load. A comparision of the SCS-method and PSS-method with the MF-fits for large slip suggests improvements of the Magic Formula tyre model, Between the various estimations for the prediction of the combined slip based on pure slip characteristics, the <b>Slip</b> <b>Circle</b> Method and the Practical Slip Similarity Method, derived and developed by the authors will lead to a satisfactory prediction with respect to measurement data.

In this paper back-analyzed data from GEO 5 software has been used to create an empirical equation for preliminary design of the required reinforcement to maintain a specific FOS.

Analizler, sıkıştırılarak hazırlanmış numunelerin zemin su karakteristik eğrisinden elde edilen uniform matrik emme basıncına göre, yeraltı su seviyesinin değişken olduğu ve zeminin tamamen suya doygun olduğu durumlar için yapılmış ve yeraltı su seviyesinin değişimiyle güvenlik sayısının değişimi araştırılmıştır.   Elde edilen sonuçlara göre; doygun olmayan zemin parametrelerinin şevlerin güvenlik sayısına etkisinin en çok gözlemlendiği numune kil oranının en yüksek olduğu numunedir. Numunelerde kum oranı arttıkça; doygun ve doygun olmayan zemin mekaniği ilkelerine göre yapılan analizlerin sonuçları arasındaki fark azalmaktadır. Yeraltı su seviyesinin yükselmesiyle her üç numunede de doygun ve doygun olmayan kabuller için elde edilen güvenlik sayıları birbirlerine yaklaşmakta; zeminin suya tamamen doygun olduğu durumda elde edilen güvenlik sayıları ise aynı olmaktadır. Şevler doygun duruma gelmeden de göçmeler meydana gelebildiğinden, doygun olmayan zemin mekaniğinin önemi artmaktadır. Analysis of {{slope stability}} {{is one of}} the main issues of geotechnical engineering. Natural or human made slopes’ problems are focus area, which geotechnical engineers have to bring a solution. There are main acceptances, which base on saturated soil mechanic principles to analyze slope stability.  However, this approach sometimes causes the uneconomical solutions. According to researches that were made in the last years, unsaturated soil mechanichs approach has been started to use in the slope stability analyses and this approach creates the economical and reliable results for slope stability analyses.   Depending of the developments in the technology, the laboratory devices has been used widely and the quality of devices has increased. Thanks to this development, soil mechanich acceptances has been started to change. The unsaturated soil mechanichs principles are one result of this change. In the scope of this thesis, the effects of properties of unsaturated soil mechanic’s parameters to factor of safety of slopes were searched. Effects of changing of ground water table level on the factor of safety of slopes and the different impacts of unsaturated soil mechanic principles on the various soil types were the main topics in the thesis. Although the unsaturated soil mechanic approach has been appeared since early of 1900 ’s, the development of acceptances has begun for last twenty years because of reasons, which was mentioned above paragraph. Especially for the dry conditions and the conditions where the ground water table level is far from the surface, the unsaturated soil mechanic parameters affect the stability of slopes, bearing capacity of foundations, consolidation and infiltration of soils. Unsaturated soil mechanic researches remark that the unsaturated soil parameters should not be ignored especially for clay soils. In this thesis, factor of safety that obtained from the results of slope stability analysis of sandy clay, low plasticity clay and poor graded sand soil are examined with the change of ground water table level for saturated and unsaturated soil mechanics principles.  The sandy clay sample is from Günesli vicinity of Istanbul and the other samples are got from the other researches. The thesis has two parts. In the first part, laboratory tests are available. The laboratory tests were performed in the Ord. Prof. Dr. Hamdi Peynircioğlu Soil Mechanics Laboratory, Istanbul Technical University between the dates February of 2014 and July of 2014.  The tests were performed by two stages. In the first stage, sieve analyses, hydrometer, Atterberg limits, pycnometer, standard compaction and direct shear tests are available. The second stage consists of pressure plate test, which gives the unsaturated soil properties. In the light of sieve analysis and Atterbeg limits, the soil sample that was obtained from the field was described as low plasticity clay according to Unified Soil Classification System. The samples, which were used for direct shear test and pressure plate test, were preapeared as near the optimum conditions these are defined from standart proctor test. The other samples, which were used for slope stability analyses have experienced to same tests from other researchers with sample obtained from field.   The Sample I is the sample which the experimentals applied in the labarotory by author of this thesis. The Sample II was taken from Gülsen’s research and the classifition of the soil is poor graded sand. The Sample II consists of 100 percent sand. The sample III is named as Indian Head Till is from Kutlu’s research. According to Unified Soil Classification System, the soil is low plasticity clay. For each soil samples, the parameters that were used in slope stability analyses were defined. These parameters were effective cohesion (c’) and effective internal friction angle (ɸ’) for saturated and unsaturated soil acceptances and soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) and matric suction for unsaturated soil acceptance. SWCC and matric suction was determined with pressure plate test for Sample I and Sample III and with tempe-pressure cell for Sample II. Both of the test devices use the axis translation technique. The axes translation technique was mentioned in the thesis with details.   Soil water characteristic curve {{is one of the}} main parameter, which specifies the behavior of unsaturated soils. Soil water characteristic curve is relationship of matric suction and degree or saturation or water content or volumetric water content. Soil water characteristic curve can be obtained from experimental, estimation or fitting methods. In the light of researches for the unsaturated soil mechanics, properties of soils as the clay or sand content, plasticity or coefficient of compressibility has significiant effects on the soil water characteristic curve. Suction pressure of soils is the other main parameter for unsaturated soil mechanic approaches. It includes both osmotic suction and matric suction parameters. Osmotic suction is related with chemical contents, which takes part in pores of soil. Because of difficulties to gauge the osmotic suction, it is usually neglected. Therefore, the matric suction becomes the main parameter for the suction pressure. The matric suction is difference between pore air pressure and pore water pressure. İt can be described as negative pore water pressure. Pore water pressure inceares under the ground water table level with depth and matric suction increases above the ground water table level. Researchs about unsaturated soil mechanics proove the positive effect of matric suction to the shear strength of soils. Because of ıts positive effects to the shear strength of soils, the calculations become more economical ıf we compare with saturated solution.   In the second part of the thesis, slope stability for saturated and unsaturated conditions was analyzed using parameters, which were obtained from experimental studies and the effect of unsaturated soil parameters on the factor of safety was defined. The change of factor of safety was examined with change of ground water table level. For each soil samples, same geometry of cross section was used for the models. Each stability of slopes was analyzed with the SLOPE/W, which takes part in GeoStudio packet programme. SLOPE/W programme benefits from Limit Eqiulibrium Methods. In the thesis, principles of Limit Equilibrium Methods and the usage of SLOPE/W are shared with details.  The results were obtained with Bishop Limit Equilibrium Method for each soil type. Mohr-Coulomb failure hpyothesis was accepted for the soil behavior. Three ground water conditions were examined for the solutions. For three soil samples, soil parameters for saturated and unsaturated acceptances were determined.    The first condition was the initial condition of the soils. There was no ground water level for initial conditions. For saturated soil acceptances, the parameters that were defined for the analysis were effective cohesion and effective internal friction, which were obtained from direct shear tests and unit weight of the soils. For unsaturated soil acceptances, the matric suction value was acted to effective cohesion. Defined cohesion for dry condition according to unsaturated acceptances was greater value than defined effective cohesion according to saturated acceptances. For unsaturated soil acceptances, soil water characteristic curve was necessary to account the cohesion value. Beside the soil water characteristic curve, to describe the cohesion of unsaturated soil acceptances for dry conditions, effective cohesion that was obtained from direct shear test and matric suction of the soil must be contributed to calculation of cohesion. The calculation of cohesion according to unsaturated soil principles for dry condition was told with details in the next chapters.   In the second condition for the soils, the ground water table level was defined and systematically it was assessed nearer positions to surface of ground. For saturated soil acceptances, the parameters which has determined for the stability analysis were effective cohesion, effective internal friction angle and unit weight of the soils. To get the factor of safety according to unsaturated soil acceptances, effective cohesion, effective internal friction angle, unit weight of soil and soil water characteristic curve were necessary. Soil water characteristic curve that was determined from experimental ways was defined in the programme related with volumetric water content and matric suction values.   For the third condition of the soil, soil pores was completely full of pore water. The ground water table level was fifty centimeter above of surface. The parameters were same with the conditions that ground water table level was defined. After the geometry of cross section, soil parameters and ground water conditions were defined, the factor of safety for the slope stability analyses was obtained.  SLOPE/W gave the crititical <b>slip</b> surfaces of <b>circle</b> and factor of safety for critical <b>slip</b> <b>circle’s</b> surface was the factor of safety value for the slope stability analyses.   The greatest factor of safety was obtained for the initial conditions according to unsaturated soil acceptance. The difference between saturated soil and unsaturated soil analyses was the most apparent value for Sample III. However, the difference was so little for the Sample II. That demonstrates, while the clay content was raising, unsaturated soil parameters had more significiant role in the shear strength theory.   While the ground water table level was increasing, factor of safety difference between saturated and unsaturated slope stability analyses decreased. This remarks that, while the soil was becoming more saturated, the effect of unsaturated soil parameters declined. With the increasing of ground water table level, factor of safety for unsaturated soil acceptances has significiantly declined for especially Sample III.   When the ground water table level was above of ground surface, there was no factor of safety difference between analyses with unsaturated soil principles and saturated soil principles. This is because there was no pore air pressure in the soil when the ground water table level above of ground surface. Because of this reason, unsaturated soil parameters had no effect on the shear strength of soils, when the soil pores were full of pore water. For the thesis, both of experimental and analytical studies were done. The results were presented with details. In the scope of the research, three soil samples were used. For a detailed study, the number of soil samples may increase. To define the ground water level, the rain infiltration case can be considered. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|There {{is about}} 18000 km of dikes in The Netherlands. Their use {{is to prevent}} the lowlands, where the {{inhabitants}} live, from flooding. Flooding is a typical high-consequence low-probability event. To study the failure probability of a dike, one of the numerical methods available, derived from the Level III probabilistic methods, is the so-called Monte Carlo simulation (MCs). The Finite Element Method (FEM) program PLAXIS is widely used to study dike stability. This dike stability can be quantified {{by means of the}} Safety Factor (SF). However, estimating the failure probability of a dike with PLAXIS is at present not possible and even if the MCs will be installed, the calculation will be time consuming. In order to overcome this problem, an easy and quick method is needed to estimate the failure probability of a dike. This project uses a study case described by a circular slip failure surface of a dike with three independent layers. Each layer is defined by its undrained shear strength with a normal distribution function. Besides MCs, an analytical solution for the SF of a slope, which is a linear combination of the soil strength for a fixed <b>slip</b> <b>circle,</b> was developed. The project compares the failure probability value obtained by both the MCs and the analytical solution. Finally, using the analytical solution, the failure probability estimation of a slope is presented by a quick and easy procedure to use with FEM. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The seismic {{performance}} evaluation of embankment dams {{are applied to}} confirm that the earthquake-induced settlement of embankment dams crest is enough small, because the overflow from the crest could cause catastrophic failure of embankment dams. Now in Japan, trial of “Guidelines for Seismic Performance Evaluation of Dams during Large Earthquakes (Draft) ” has been conducted. According to the guidelines, earthquake-induced settlement of dam crest should be basically evaluated by the method combining dynamic analysis and Newmark’s method. This method uses the dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method, and next calculates the deformation as an amount of displacement of the <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> due to earthquake response. But other deformation evaluation method for embankment dams has been recently developed based on cumulative damage theory. The deformation evaluation method based on cumulative damage theory also uses the dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method, and calculates the deformation as a residual strain by cyclic loading due to earthquake response. In this paper, we first describe dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method for a rockfill dam with a central earth core, and then evaluate the settlement obtained from cumulative damage theory. The results of our research make it clear that the settlement of model dam crest ranges from about 36 cm to 160 cm based on cumulative damage theory due to an earthquake motion with a maximum acceleration of more than 700 gal. The observed settlement of the crest of existing embankment dams due to earthquakes are compared to the calculated values based on the cumulative damage theory, and we confirm that relationship between observed values of existing dams and calculated values of model dam has a good coincidence and that cumulative damage theory is available to evaluate the settlement of dam crest due to a large earthquake...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAircraft {{braking forces}} have {{increased}} {{in the past and}} will continue to increase in the future. This has resulted in instances of shear related distress in asphalt runway surfaces. The shear stresses transferred from braking tyres to the pavement surface can initiate failures of poorly bonded interfaces. Shear creep deformation within the mix can also occur. Octahedral shear stress (OSS) has been recommended as an indicator of asphalt distress. OSS is unaffected by the geometry of loading and reference coordinate system. In this research, the peak surface forces in three dimensions were calculated. Stresses through the surface layer were then calculated using mePADS/GAMES software. The calculated stresses in the surface layer were compared under various braking conditions. The OSS was used as the primary basis for these comparisons. The maximum calculated OSS induced by a heavy braking truck was only 53 % of that for the aircraft during only moderate braking. Contrary to expectation, the peak shear stress under {{the leading edge of the}} tyre did not increase significantly with increased aircraft braking effort. Analysis of the shear stress distributions, however, identified a significant change with increased braking effort. For non-braking aircraft, a zone of near-zero shear stress was found under the central portion of the tyre. As the horizontal surface force increased, this became a zone of near-constant shear stress. Observed differences in field performance of nominally identical asphalt in landing/braking zones of an airport were not explained by the peak OSS values calculated. It was, however, concluded that the near-steady shear state under a passing tyre during aircraft braking could explain different asphalt responses in the field. This conclusion was consistent with the observed nature of such failures, which are creep related, rather than the result of conventional <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> shear. It was suggested that the presence of shear related failures only in the braking area would be indicative of shear creep deformation within the mix rather than delamination at the surface interface...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of soil-reinforcement interaction for a reinforced embankment on soft clay has been explored by conducting a parametric study using a coupled non-linear elastoplastic finite element program. One {{of the major}} issues {{in the design of}} a reinforced embankment on soft clay is the magnitude of tension that can be mobilized in the geosynthetic reinforcement. Previous research using geotechnical centrifuge modelling and present research using finite element modelling has confirmed that the tension mobilized in the reinforcement is only of the order of active lateral thrust in the embankment. The parametric study has revealed that the soil-reinforcement interaction mechanism depends on the ratio of embankment height to the depth of the clay layer. The embankment behaves similar to a rigid footing in case of deep clay deposit. In this case, the failure mechanism is similar to a <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> and there is very little contribution from the clay-reinforcement interface towards the mobilization of reinforcement tension. However, if the depth of clay deposit is small, the soil-reinforcement interaction mode is similar to direct shear failure and slip surface is located close to the clay-reinforcement interface. In this case, the contribution of clay-reinforcement interface towards the tension mobilized in the reinforcement is higher and therefore, the contribution of the reinforcement towards overall stability of the embankment is greater. Based on the results of the parametric study a novel serviceability criterion is proposed that aims to limit the lateral deformation of the clay foundation at the toe of the embankment by limiting the allowable mobilized tension in the reinforcement. A simple procedure for the evaluation of the efficiency of soil-reinforcement interface for reinforced embankments on soft clays is also proposed. The validity of the proposed serviceability criterion and the design charts was successfully tested using two field case studies. Sackville test embankment constructed to failure in 1989 and a levee test section that remained serviceable after construction in 1987 at Plaquemine, Louisiana were able to confirm the validity of the serviceability criterion proposed in the present study...|$|E
40|$|The {{surf zone}} {{is defined by}} highly non-linear, {{breaking}} waves that have very different acceleration signatures beneath their respective crests and troughs. The consequences of this dissimilarity on sediment transport is not fully understood. This thesis develops methodologies to predict sediment transport under these asymmetric, skewed waves. Two different transport mechanisms are considered: bedload transport and "subsurface" transport. The potential for subsurface transport was first realized by Madsen (1974) who found that the large pressure gradient beneath a breaking wave was sufficient to drive a substantial porous-media flow, adequate to create a soil-mechanics type failure extending several centimeters into a sandy sediment bed. The theoretical model of Madsen (1974) is extended to obtain estimates of subsurface transport by subdividing the sediment in failure into distinct, kinematically admissible slip circles. An equation governing the rotation of each <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> is developed, yielding the subsurface sediment's horizontal movement {{as a function of}} depth. By integration, subsurface transport can predicted. In addition, a method is developed for estimating bedload transport under breaking waves, accounting for the enhanced shear stress beneath the wave's crest. An existing bedload formula is used as the foundation for this predictive model. (cont.) The validity of the two predictive models is substantiated by experiments conducted in a laboratory wave flume. Breaking waves are passed over lightweight, plastic beads representive of uncohesive sediment. The surficial and subsurface transport is experimentally measured. Using velocity records from the laboratory waves, the theoretical models are used to make predictions of each type of transport. Both models produce good agreement with experimental observations. Finally, laboratory wave data from Madsen (1974) are scaled to the the size of waves typical of the surf zone. Using parameters characteristic of sand, the two models predict a subsurface transport of the same order as bedload transport for typical wave and sediment parameters. Furthermore, subsurface transport is found to be proportional to the characteristic length scale of the wave squared, while bedload transport is proportional to the length scale to the power of 1. 5. by William McKinney Durham.

40|$|Breakwaters {{differ from}} each other by their {{functions}} or their type. The most important function of breakwaters is to allow the ships to be loaded and unloaded in calm water conditions and to provide dock or quay facilities. Several types of breakwaters can be distinguished, depending on their operation and design. The most common breakwater concepts are divided into two types: statically stable and dynamically stable breakwaters. The site variables, set by the situation at Ennore, concerne the geotechnical aspects, the construction material and the hydraulic boundary conditions. The hydraulic boundary conditions {{will be determined by}} the wave climate during extreme weather conditions, which is during cyclones. Cyclones arrive on the east coast of India usually with a return period of 2 years. Wave motions in harbours can, under extreme conditions, endanger the handling of vessels at berth. Therefore a certain degree of tranquillity of the harbour basin is required. The tranquillity of the harbour basin is essential for ships to load and unload in calm water conditions. Too high waves in the harbour basin will cause an unsafe handling of ships. Should the coal handling cease at Ennore, then the storage of coal will run out, leading to the breakdown of the power station. The breakwater structure has to reduce the wave heights in the harbour by adequate layouts. By analysing the failure mechanisms of all the different parts of the breakwater, reliability functions can be formed and the probability of failure, according to the various mechanisms, can be calculated. These reliability functions, described by each failure mechanism, are mainly based on hydraulic and geotechnical parameters. This study attempts to survey all imaginable failure mechanisms that may occur during the design, construction, and lifetime of the crested rubble mound breakwater at Ennore. In order to address the problems encountered systematically, a general faulttree has been given. The quantification of some failure mechanisms for the crested rubble mound breakwater at Ennore is effected for the following failure mechanisms: - instability of a rock armour slope - instability of an armour layer with ACCROPODE elements - <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> of a rock armour layer - horizontal displacement of the crest element. The quantification of these failure mechanisms is a complex task which most important difficulty resides in the determination of the mean value and the standard deviation of the variables. After the calculation, an adjustment of these values may take place in order to improve the design. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{construction}} of rolled-fill earth dams with the standard methods of practice, taking the Hirakud Dam as the basis. The field operations of the investigation to obtain observational information and to secure samples for the laboratory testing include observation of rain gauge and river gauge readings, taking river water samples, digging test pits, drilling grout holes, opening drifts, digging borrow pits and conducting detailed topographical surveys. Laboratory tests are conducted on the samples {{and the results are}} plotted in graphs. Rainfall and run-off statistics are plotted in graphs. Observational information of geology is plotted in log sheets and the field data of survey works is made use of for the preparation of the topographical maps. From the results of the investigation it is found that the Hirakud Dam has a firm foundation and there is sufficient quantity of material for the embankment at site. The annual rainfall is 47. 49 inches yielding a run-off of 50 million sore feet over a catchment area of 32, 200 square miles. The stability of the embankment is computed by the <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> method and the seepage water from the flow net method. The dam is designed for 100 years with a reservoir capacity of 5. 98 million acre feet at the maximum water level elevation 625 feet, the bed level being elevation 500 feet. The dead storage is 2. 24 million acre feet corresponding to elevation 590 feet, and the maximum submerged area corresponding elevation 625 feet is 150, 380 acres. The minimum factor of safety for the upstream slope is 1. 68 and that for the downstream slope is 1. 19. The seepage water is 0. 264 cubic feet per lineal foot per year. The dam is to be constructed as per the design and the specifications. The compaction is attained by the mechanical effort at the optimum moisture content. The mechanical effort is influenced by the type of roller, its weight and the number of passes. Field control is affected by vigilant supervision, needle penetration, ring test and sand test. The construction is to be carried out according to a plan of seven stages. A comparison and contrast is drawn between the U. S. A. and India to bring out the inherent difficulties of construction operations of large dams in India. Importance is given to the sequence of the subject matter since no text book gives all the relevant portions as used in practice. Reference is given to the text books from which the formulas are taken so that a student who is interested in theory, derivation and explanation of the formulas may study the available literature.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu kapsamında yapılacak olan güzergah çalışmaları Asya yakasında Poyraz-Paşaköy otoyolu ile Çamlık-Reşadiye bağlantı yolu, Avrupa yakasında ise Odayeri-Garipçe otoyolu ile İstoç-Odayeri Bağlantı yollarından oluşmaktadır. Bu projenin Odayeri-Paşaköy bölümünde yaklaşık 115 km uzunluğa sahip Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu yer almaktadır. Karayolu güzergahının amacı mevcut olan trafiği azaltmak ve ulaşım problemini giderebilmektir.   Bu tez kapsamında Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Garipçe yarmasının mühendislik jeolojisi ve kazı şevlerinin analizi değerlendirilmiştir. Garipçe yarmasının bulunduğu zemin ve kaya birimlerinin mühendislik jeolojisi özellikleri incelenmiştir. Inceleme alanının veri tabanlarının olşturulması amacıyla 9 adet mekanik sondaj, sismik çalışmalar  ile saha çalışmaları ve laboratuvar deneyleri yapılmıştır.  Sondajlar ile korele edilen jeofizik çalışmalar ışığında inceleme alanının jeolojisi yorumlanmıştır. Mühendislik jeolojisi çalışmaları sonucu şev duraylılığı açısından meydana gelebilecek sorunlar üzerinde durulmuştur.   Kinematik analiz çalışmaları ile andezit birimlerinin düzlemsel kayma, kama kayması ve devrilme durumları sağ ve sol şevler için ayrı ayrı incelenmiştir. Yarma içerisinde kritik olarak belirlenen kesitlerde zemin ve kaya birimleri için hesaplanmış olan parametreler ile Plaxis programı yardımıyla stabilite analiz çalışmaları yapılmıştır. Analizler statik ve dinamik (depremli) durum için ayrı ayrı incelenmiştir. Kesit üzerinde en büyük kayma çemberi çizdirilerek kritik olan bölge belirlenmiş ve o noktalardaki güvenlik sayıları elde edilmiştir. Yarmalarda uzun dönemde duraylılığı sağlayacak koşullar göz önüne alınmıştır. Araştırma Mühendislik Hizmetleri Teknik Şartnamesine göre uzun dönem (statik) için güvenlik sayısı 1. 5 ’den büyük, uzun dönem (dinamik) için güvenlik sayısı ise 1. 1 ’dem büyük olmalıdır.

Works {{regarding}} highway {{course to}} be carried out within the scope of the North Marmara Highway comprise of Poyraz-Paşaköy motorway and Çamlık-Reşadiye access road in the Asian side and Odayeri-Garipçe motorway and İstoç-Odayeri access road in the European side. North Marmara Highway having approximately 115 km length takes place in the Odayeri-Paşaköy section of this project. Objective of such highway route is to ensure passing the strait of İstanbul within the shortest time in a comfortable way as well as to mitigate the traffic load of hazardous pollutants on the urban roads and existing suspension bridges over Bosphorus, {{and as a result of}} this, ensure fuel savings, and reduce the effects of contaminated air resulting from the transportation inside the city. Transportation system on rails will also benefit from the suspension bridge planned to be constructed over the strait with high standard for passing Bosphorus. Engineering geology and excavation slopes analysis of road cuts in Garipçe of the North Marmara Highway have been evaluated within the scope of this thesis. Studies related to the engineering geology in order to determine engineering properties, state of underground water and the rock quality of the environment with regard to Garipçe earth work place in the project scope, have been evaluated within the scope of this thesis. In the area where the road cutting is taken place, it changes into totally decomposed, extremely decomposed andesite and levels of agglomerate andesite locally available comprising the Garipçe formation when going down to lower layers, whilst Meşetepe formation is taken place at the upper part. It caused subsurface water to be present in the Andesite-volcanic tuff bodies, and locally formed small spring waters unearthing such subsurface water. Although these bodies usually seem to be stable in the nature, they may also exhibit other behaviors than stable state when they are subjected to engineering processes. Geological map-cross section with 1 / 1000 scale and geotechnical data table of the Garipçe earth work covering the area under examination have been prepared. Cross-sectional studies have been carried out at the certain kilometers specified as critical. General geology and hydrogeology of the route have been outlined within the scope of the report, engineering geology properties of the formations have been described, drilling and geophysical studies have been carried out in the field and laboratory experiments have been evaluated. Laboratory experiments have been performed on the soil and rock using analyses to determine the stability of slopes that will be built up during the construction of Garipçe earth work within the area under examination, and samples taken for the purposes of determining index properties of the material in order to evaluate the geomechanical behaviors of the material in this area. Data related to consistency limits, sieve analysis and water content have been determined with the experiments on samples taken from the soil. On the samples obtained from the rocks experiments such as physical properties, mechanical properties, erosion index in water and triaxial pressure test have been performed. In addition to that geophysical (MASW) studies were carried out in order to determine the border between soil and rock in detail. Geological state of the area under examination have been interpreted in the light of drillings and correlated geophysical studies. Emphasis has been put on the problems that may arise in terms of slope stability and be identified as a result of engineering study. Positions of their joints were determined from the andesite exposure constituting the rock bodies through which road cut slopes are formed. Contour diagrams and kinematic analysis have been carried out with such mesurements taken by using the Dips software program of the RocScience company. With the aid of kinematic analysis studies, planar sliding, wedge sliding and toppling situations of the andesite bodies have been examined for right and left  slopes separately. Determination of the slope ratios capable of keeping their stability under the conditions in the long run, has been intended in the road cutting known as Garipçe earth work, exhibiting a feature of through road cut, having a length of 800 meters and a height of 40 meters. In this regard, drilling operations and geophysical measurement (MASW) works have been carried out together with the  studies on surface geology in the field, and laboratory tests with regard to soil and rock mechanics have been performed on the samples taken. All of these data have been evaluated in the office environment and stability analysis works have been carried out along with the engineering parameter calculations. Hoek-Brown Criterion Generalized by Hoek et al. (2002) has been proposed in order to estimate the strength of rock mass from the properties of rock material with the most correct approach. In this respect, a software known as RocLab which is based on Hoek-Brown failure criterion and determines the strength parameters of a rock mass, has been employed for the rock classification in the cross sections specified as critical within the road cut.   Strength parameter calculation related to the soil bodies has been carried out with the empirical calculations at all distances between axis for the clay bodies where pile foundation are located, taking the results obtained from the laboratory experiments into consideration. Soil parameter calculations include cohesion without drainage (cu) and modulus of elasticity (Es) calculations. Soil parameter calculations include such short term parameter calculations as cohesion without drainage (cu) and modulus of elasticity (Es) and such long term parameter calculations as angle of internal friction (ϕ) and drained elastic modulus (Es). Rock quality classifications for Garipçe earth work have been achieved using RQD and RMR methods. Stability analysis works have been carried out using Plaxis 2 D software with the parameters calculated for the soil and rock bodies in the cross-sections specified as critical inside the road cut. Plaxis 2 D software is a finite element package specially developed for two dimensional analysis of deformation and stability in the geotechnical projects. Analysis have been carried out for static and dynamic (with earthquake) cases separately. Effective ground acceleration coefficient is A 0 = 0, 2 g since location of road cut in Garipçe under examination falls into the third grade earthquake region according to the seismic hazard map. Critical region was determined drawing the greatest <b>slip</b> <b>circle</b> on the cross-section, and factors of safety at those points were obtained. Long term stability which is the most critical case, must be evaluated using effective sliding resistance parameters when stability of the excavation slopes are of concern. According to the technical specification for surveying engineering services, safety factor for long term (static) must be greater than 1. 5 and for long term (dynamic) must be greater than 1. 1. Safety factors have been improved using certain ways in case where factors of safety nonconforming to these values were observed. It was observed that no stability problem will be expected in case of specified slope ratios such as 2 Y/ 3 D before the 1 st bench, 3 Y/ 2 D between 1 st bench and 2 nd bench and 2 Y/ 1 D after 2 nd bench for the road cut in Garipçe. At the end of the studies, Km: 86 + 330 and Km: 86 + 590 cross sections have been considered to be critical and stability analyses have been carried out. In these cross sections at the 42 meter deep from the land level located are a soil body where andesite was completely decomposed and became soil, together with an andesite body featuring main rock properties with agglomerate interface underneath, and decomposed sections of that body. Parameter calculations have been carried out for sandy elastic silt, slightly sandy low-plastic silt and andesite bodies observed for this section. It was determined that it has a "very weak rock" quality taking the correlation between the RQD defined by Deere (1968) and engineering quality of the rock into consideration. It was determined that the factors of safety under both static and dynamic conditions did not have a proper value at the end of the analysis works performed on the Km: 86 + 330 cross section. Such factors of safety as 1. 31 for the static situation and 1. 11 for the dynamic situation have been obtained in the stability analysis study. At this section where there is a expropriation problem, it was recommended that the slope before the 1 st bench must be reinforced with  28 mm (diameter), 10 meter long soil nails with 2 mx 3 m (Y/D) pattern and 20 cm thick shot concrete. Following values, such as 1. 74 for static conditions and 1. 37 for dynamic conditions, have been obtained for the road cut reinforced and improved with the soil nails and shot concrete and it was deemed to be reliable. It is seen that there is no problem in terms of static and dynamic safety factors observed at the end of of stability analysis works carried out in the Km: 86 + 590 cross section. Parameter calculations have been carried out for elastic silt, sandy clay, decomposed andesite and andesite bodies observed for this section. It was determined that it has a "very weak rock" quality taking the correlation between the RQD defined for andesite and decomposed andesite by Deere (1968) and engineering quality of the rock into consideration. Such factors of safety as 2. 30 under static conditions and 1. 77 under dynamic conditions have been calculated in the stability analysis study and it was seen that there is no problem with the stability of road cut. Slope before the 1 st bench between Km: 86 + 570 – 86 + 650 in the section where Km: 86 + 590 is located, was observed to be reliable. However, in terms of road cut safety in the long run it will be proper to apply the reinforcing system given at the table above to this gap where decomposed andesite body will be interrupted.
