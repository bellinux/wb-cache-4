40|$|During Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth glaciations, {{the oceans}} gained {{massive amounts of}} alkalinity, {{culminating}} in the deposition of massive cap carbonates on deglaciation. Changes in terrestrial runoff associated with both breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent and deglaciation can explain some, {{but not all of}} the requisite changes in ocean chemistry. Submarine volcanism along <b>shallow</b> <b>ridges</b> <b>formed</b> during supercontinent breakup results in the formation of large volumes of glassy hyaloclastite, which readily alters to palagonite. Here we estimate fluxes of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, silica and bicarbonate associated with these shallow-ridge processes, and argue that extensive submarine volcanism during the breakup of Rodinia made an important contribution to changes in ocean chemistry during Snowball Earth glaciations. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show that widespread hyaloclastite alteration under near-global sea-ice cover could lead to Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + supersaturation {{over the course of the}} glaciation that is sufficient to explain the volume of cap carbonates deposited. Furthermore, our conservative estimates of phosphorus release are sufficient to explain the observed P:Fe ratios in sedimentary iron formations from this time. This large phosphorus release may have fuelled primary productivity, which in turn would have contributed to atmospheric O 2 rises that followed Snowball Earth episodes...|$|R

50|$|Quartzite is very {{resistant}} to chemical weathering and often <b>forms</b> <b>ridges</b> and resistant hilltops. The nearly pure silica {{content of the}} rock provides little for soil; therefore, the quartzite ridges are often bare or covered only with a very thin layer of soil and (if any) little vegetation.|$|R

5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south. This <b>shallowing</b> <b>forms</b> the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic inactivity occurs because the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|R

5000|$|Ridge Road—a largely rural route, Ridge veers off to {{the west}} {{significantly}} south of Ford Road, crossing the Wayne-Washtenaw county line and into the easternmost part of Ypsilanti.

40|$|For the Cottonwood Triangular point forms at Ystaqua, the Ipai site {{approximately}} 64 km. {{south of}} the research area, the proposed sequence postulates that the straight base form, together with the predominant broad and <b>shallow</b> <b>forms,</b> occur earlier than the deep base variant (Carrico and Taylor 1983 : 103). If these broad and <b>shallow</b> <b>forms</b> {{can be said to}} equate to the broad base form as described herein, this sequence appears to be at odds with the findings for Frey Creek and the adjacent mountain region in northern San Diego County as represented at Silver Crest. For lack of comparable data, at this time {{it is not possible to}} extend these conclusions from the present research to other sites within the immediate area; however, it is expected that further comparative analyses can test these proposals. It is also hoped that the definition of attributes presented here will aid in these analyses by providing objective criteria...|$|R

5000|$|Differential erosion- Erosion {{that occurs}} at {{irregular}} or varying rates, {{caused by the}} differences in the resistance and hardness of surface materials; softer and weaker rocks are rapidly worn away, whereas harder and more resistant rocks remain to <b>form</b> <b>ridges,</b> hills, or mountains.

50|$|Slope angles can {{be reduced}} by digging out the brow of the slope, usually in a {{step-wise}} fashion. This method is effective for correcting <b>shallow</b> <b>forms</b> of instability, where movement is limited to layers of ground near the surface and when the slopes are higher than 5m. Steps created by this method may also reduce surface erosion. However, caution is necessary to avoid the onset of local breakage following the cuts.|$|R
