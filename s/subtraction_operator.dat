40|$|We {{consider}} {{the design of}} synthetic embedded feedback circuits that can implement desired changes in the concentration of the output of a biomolecular process (reference tracking in control terminology). Such systems {{require the use of}} a "subtractor", to generate an error signal that captures the difference between the current and desired value of the process output. Unfortunately, standard implementations of the <b>subtraction</b> <b>operator</b> using chemical reaction networks are one-sided, i. e. they cannot produce negative error signals. Previous attempts to deal with this problem by representing signals as the difference in concentrations of two different biomolecular species lead to a doubling of the number of chemical reactions required to generate the circuit, hence sharply increasing the difficulty of experimental implementations and limiting the complexity of potential designs. Here we propose an alternative approach that introduces a degradation term into the classical proportion-integral control scheme.

We then generalize this to ribbon graphs and present {{the relation of the}} Bollobás-Riordan polynomial with the parametric representation of some Φ^ 4 field theory on the non-commutative Moyal space. We also review the rôle played by the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra as the combinatorial backbone of the renormalization process in field theories. We then show how this generalizes to the scalar Φ^ 4 field theory implemented on the non-commutative Moyal space.

The computation is done both in the modified dimensional reduction {{as well as in}} the four dimensional helicity scheme. We have studied the universal structure of infrared (IR) singularities in these FFs using Catani's IR <b>subtraction</b> <b>operators.</b> Exploiting the factorisation property of the IR singularities and following BDS like ansatz for the IR sensitive terms in FFs, we determine the finite remainders of them. We find that the finite remainders of FFs of the half-BPS for both the choices of final states give not only identical results but also contain terms of uniform transcendentality of weight two and four at one and two loop levels, respectively. In the case of the Konishi operator, the finite remainders depend on the external states and do not exhibit uniform transcendentality. However, surprisingly, the leading transcendental terms for g ϕϕ agree with that of the half-BPS. We have demonstrated the role of on shell external states for the FFs in the context of maximum transcendentality principle. Comment: 37 page...|$|R

We extend PHLAC features to crosscorrelations of posterior probabilities of other categories. Also, we introduce the <b>subtraction</b> <b>operator</b> for describing another spatial relationship of local posterior probabilities, and present vertical/horizontal mask patterns for the spatial layout of auto/crosscorrelations. Since the combination of category index is large, we compress the proposed features by two-dimensional principal component analysis.

In this context and when fuzzy representation results are desired, an approximation strategy is proposed to determine the nearest fuzzy interval of the non-monotonic gradual interval obtained.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method of feature co-occurrence {{representation}} based on boosting for object detection. A previously proposed method that combines multiple binaryclassified codes by AdaBoost to represent the co-occurrence of features {{has been shown to}} be effective in face detection. However, if an input feature is difficult to be assigned to a correct binary code due to occlusion or other factors, a problem arises here since the process of binary classification and co-occurrence representation may combine features that include an erroneous code. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a Co-occurrence Probability Feature (CPF) that combines multiple weak classifiers by addition and multiplication arithmetic operators using Real AdaBoost in which the outputs of weak classifiers are real values. Since CPF combines classifiers using two types of operators, diverse types of co-occurrence can be represented and improved detection performance can be expected. To represent even more diversified co-occurrence, this paper also proposes co-occurrence representation that applies a subtraction arithmetic operator. Although cooccurrence representation using addition and multiplication operators can represent co-occurrence between features, use of the <b>subtraction</b> <b>operator</b> enables the representation of co-occurrence between local features and features having other properties. This should have the effect of revising the probability of the detection-target class obtained from local features. Evaluation experiments have shown cooccurrence representation by the proposed methods to be effective. 1...|$|E
3000|$|... a-a≠ 0. In {{order to}} develop a useful {{theoretical}} framework on interval number like real number theory, Hukuhara [23] introduced another concept of interval difference for a and b in 1967, namely the Hukuhara difference (H-difference, a b), where a b=c {{if and only if}} a=b+c. However, although such a concept can satisfy a a= 0, a b is meaningful only when w(a)> w(b), where w(a) and w(b) denote the widths of a and b, respectively. In order to overcome one such fault, after Markov [24] pointed out that the width of a-b was equal to the sum of the widths of a and b, he gave the concept of a nonstandard subtraction expressed also by the symbol of ‘−’. Such a concept can guarantee that a-a= 0, and the width of the interval a-b equals the absolute value of the difference of the widths of a and b. Thereafter, Stefanini [9, 27 – 29] extended the version of the H-difference to the concept of a generalized Hukuhara difference (gH-difference, a_gb) which coincided with the nonstandard <b>subtraction</b> <b>operator</b> introduced in Markov [24], Definition  1, p. 326. Such a gH-difference has been comprehensively adopted to investigate interval dynamic systems, because apart from still satisfying a_ga= 0, the gH-difference always exists for any two intervals. Thus, it is an invaluable mathematical concept in probing interval number theory. In our last work [30], some fundamental arithmetic rules on interval numbers, based on the conventional addition and gH-difference were extended to the case of interval-valued vectors, while some properties, in particular associative and distributive laws, were obtained.|$|E

The basic peculiarity of this method is connected with a representation of the problem operator as the sum of two operators, which are constructed for two separate subdomains with the <b>subtraction</b> of the <b>operator</b> that is associated with the intersection of the subdomains.
