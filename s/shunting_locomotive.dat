5|$|In 1976, a new diesel <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive,</b> made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It {{was built}} at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line {{from there to}} the works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was {{partially}} dismantled, and eventually cut up in January 1978. The connection between the works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of {{a very small number of}} isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had been lifted. When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson tipping wagons went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several changes of ownership, is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a short}} {{high-level}} siding {{within the}} Waterloo yard area; coal to fuel the boilers was brought in by ordinary LSWR wagons lowered to the running line by the carriage lift; the wagons were drawn through the northbound platform by an electric <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and another lift elevated them to the siding. Boiler ash was disposed of correspondingly.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 a second, more {{powerful}} <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive</b> was acquired. Designed by the LSWR Chief Mechanical Engineer, Dugald Drummond it had two four wheel bogies and {{was intended for}} the rescue of failed passenger trains in the tunnel. In 1915 it {{was removed from the}} tunnel and put to work shunting coal wagons at Durnsford Road power station, having had its shoe collectors altered for the surface traction supply system.|$|E

25|$|In 1928 PR {{bought one}} vertical-boilered 0-4-0T <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive</b> and two vertical-boilered steam-powered railcars for local {{services}} from Sentinel-Cammell in Shrewsbury, England. Each railcar unit had two coach bodies articulated over three bogies. The shunter {{was capable of}} only light duties {{and by the end}} of the Second World War PR had stored it out of use. PR found the railcar format inflexible, as if passenger numbers exceeded the capacity of a railcar it was not practical to couple up an extra coach. In 1945 PR removed the Sentinel engines and converted the railcars to ordinary coaching stock.|$|E
25|$|L13A/B - Created in 1974, this {{locomotive}} {{consisted of}} two 1938 Stock Driving Motor cars coupled back to back. Modifications included the addition of high level air pipes to allow coupling to other Departmental vehicles, reciprocating compressors, {{and the addition of}} power lines between the two cars. These gave the locomotive a very long shoegear span, since all four bogies were fitted with shoe beams, enabling it to cross gaps in the current rail at very low speeds. The locomotive was built so that L14A/B, which had proved the usefulness of a long <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive,</b> could be scrapped.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1946â€“48 Israeli War of Independence and {{subsequent}} 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Palestine Railways main line was severed at the 1949 Armistice Line. The 1956 Israeli invasion severed Sinai's rail link with the rest of Egypt was reconnected its rail link with Israel. Israel captured a 4211 class 0-6-0 diesel <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive</b> and five 545 class 2-6-0 steam locomotives. Israel also captured rolling stock including a six-wheel coach dating from 1893 and a 30-ton steam crane built in 1950, both of which Israel Railways then appropriated into its breakdown fleet. Before being forced to withdraw from Sinai in March 1957, Israel systematically destroyed infrastructure including the railway. By 1963 the railway in Sinai was reconnected to the rest of Egypt but remained disconnected from Israel.|$|E

500|$|At {{grouping}} 196 steam locomotives {{including the}} L and Caldon Low engines were {{absorbed into the}} LMS along with the three railmotors and one battery electric locomotive. This last engine was built at Stoke in 1917 for shunting the copper works at Oakamoor. Four engines under construction at Stoke in 1923 were completed and also added to the LMS stock. Although many of the locomotives were not old, due to the LMS policy of standardisation all NSR engines had been withdrawn from service by 1939. [...] The one exception was the battery electric <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive</b> which remained in service until 1963.|$|E

2500|$|Methven was {{naturally}} aligned to Christchurch and its port in Lyttelton {{rather than}} a regional centre such as Ashburton, and trains began operating from Christchurch rather than Methven not long before the conclusion of World War II. [...] AB class steam locomotives were the typical form of motive power for many years on the line until it was dieselised in September 1967. [...] Despite trains being cut to run only thrice weekly in 1969, Methven still retained a small diesel <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive</b> in 1972. [...] However, traffic simply was not sufficient to justify {{the continued existence of}} the line and it was closed on 31 July 1976.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{configuration}} of the railway freight <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotives,</b> improve the efficiency of locomotive operation; a DEA cross evaluating method based on grey incidence analysis is presented in this paper. This method is based on collecting underlying data of factors that influence the shunting operation efficiency in train service depot, which utilizes grey incidence analysis to establish corresponding evaluation indicators system. Furthermore, the method as well adopts DEA and DEA cross efficiency model to analyze, evaluate and estimate the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotives</b> operation in train service depots. A sorting result of the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotives</b> operation in each train service depot has been acquired with help of programming using MATLAB 7. 0. What the result indicates is that the DEA cross efficiency evaluating model based on grey incidence analysis can reflect the actual state of the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotives</b> operation in each train service depot. Eventually, based on a projection analysis of non-DEA's three decision-making units, key factors that influence the efficiency of <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotives</b> operation are identified, which can provide decision support for further improvement of the configuration and operation in train service depots...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{development}} from trainspotting (almost {{unique to the}} UK) is the [...] "haulage basher" [...] or locomotive haulage enthusiast These individuals attempt to ride behind or in the cab (some people do not count the latter as proper [...] "haulage") of as many locomotives as they can, marking them off in a book as would a regular trainspotter. Even the shortest haulage will count, such as being hauled for {{a few hundred yards}} by a <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive</b> when one portion of a train is being hooked up to another at a junction. In some cases fans who like the sound of a particular type of locomotive working hard hauling a train will ride behind them as much as possible, even following English-built locomotives exported abroad, Portugal's 1800 Class (similar to BR Class 50) being one example. [...] "Haulage bashers" [...] sometimes use unusual words and language known as [...] "basherspeak".|$|E
2500|$|The most {{frequently}} used motive power on the Albula Railway is the modern Ge 4/4 III class of electric locomotive, which is also in service on the Vereina line. [...] The Albula Railway was once the main stamping ground of the Rhaetian Crocodile (the Ge 6/6 I). [...] The two remaining locos of this class, and the similarly historic Ge 4/6, still operate today {{at the head of}} not uncommon special trains. [...] In contrast, the newer RhB locomotives have not achieved the popularity of the Crocodiles. [...] However, they are in everyday use, and the operational difficulties they face can hardly be compared with those to be found on other railways of this magnitude and gauge, {{due to the nature of}} the route, and the density of the traffic. [...] Additionally there is, for a narrow gauge railway, unusually dense goods traffic, which in mountainous terrain takes over much of what would otherwise be carried by road traffic. [...] Almost all of the stations on the line are served with goods trains; the larger stations are equipped with (at least) one <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive</b> of their own. [...] The most important goods transiting the line are timber, cement and other building materials, mineral oil products and foodstuffs.|$|E
2500|$|L14A/B - Two of {{the flat}} fronted 1935 stock {{prototype}} cars were rebuilt to create this locomotive. The donor cars, numbers 10011 and 11011, had been displaced from the Epping - Ongar shuttle in 1966. They were transferred to Acton Works for articulation experiments, thought being given {{at the time to}} the articulation of trains on the Northern line. The trailing ends of the two motor cars were cut back so there was only one window behind the rear double doors, and both were mounted on a single steel bogie. The outer bogies were replaced with new lightweight ones, constructed of aluminium, and the unit was ready for testing to begin in August 1970. After a year of trials, engineers had collected sufficient data, and as it was never intended for the vehicle to enter passenger service, it was transferred to Acton Works as a <b>shunting</b> <b>locomotive,</b> where it was particularly useful, as the shoes spanned [...] The experimental lightweight aluminium motor bogies were removed in 1975, and fitted to 1972 MkII car No3363, so that long-term testing of the design could be carried out. This ended the life of LT's only articulated locomotive, which was scrapped at Acton later that year.|$|E
