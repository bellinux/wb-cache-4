40|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> is a {{very easily}} worn out part in a {{high-pressure}} die-casting machine due to serious dissolution of the area underneath the pouring hole. It is because during a normal pouring process, the high temperature molten aluminum will impact and dissolve that area of the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> by complex chemical and physical process. Rotation experiment was carried out to H 13 and four kinds of refractory metal samples. SEM and EDS pictures were taken in order to investigate the microstructure and the dissolution mechanism of these materials.

The analysis of the wave of molten metal created by plunger motion can be of help in reducing porosity in manufactured parts caused by entrapment in the molten metal of a certain amount of the initial air in the die cavity and in the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The amount of trapped air can be reduced by selecting appropriate operating conditions during the injection process, which are mainly determined by the law of plunger motion, the initial <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> filling fraction, and the geometrical characteristics of the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The proposed model, which considers the problem as two-dimensional, is based on the conservation equations of mass and momentum, and treats the free surface using a capturing method (Scalar Equation Method). Surface tension and solidification effects are neglected. Different approaches are considered to simulate plunger motion, in which either the plunger surface or the end wall of the sleeve moves and contracts a Cartesian grid. In the second case, a horizontal body force per unit mass is introduced and the plunger is assumed to be at rest. When numerical results for the wave profile were compared with those obtained using an analytical model based on the shallow-water approximation, and also with numerical results obtained from a CFD code specifically designed for free-surface flow modeling, a good degree of agreement was found.

The average size of dendrites and fragmented dendrites of the primary a-Al phase formed in the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> is 43 lm, and the globular primary a-Al grains formed inside the die cavity is at a size of 7. 5 lm. Solidification inside the die cavity also forms the lamellar Al-Mg 2 Si eutectic phase and the Fe-rich intermetallics. The size of the eutectic cells is about 10 lm, in which the lamellar a-Al phase is 0. 41 lm thick. The Fe-rich intermetallic compound exhibits a compact morphology and is less than 2 lm with a composition of 1. 62 at. pct Si, 3. 94 at. pct Fe, and 2. 31 at. pct Mn. A solute-enriched circular band is always observed parallel {{to the surface of the}} casting. The band zone separates the outer skin region from the central region of the casting.

40|$|The need {{to produce}} lighter {{components}} in transportation equipment {{is the main}} driver in the increasing demand for magnesium castings. In many automotive applications, components can be made of magnesium or aluminum. While being lighter, often times the magnesium parts have lower impact and fatigue properties than the aluminum. The main objective {{of this study was}} to identify potential improvements in the impact resistance of magnesium alloys. The most common magnesium alloys in automotive applications are AZ 91 D, AM 50 and AM 60. Accordingly, these alloys were selected as the main candidates for the study. Experimental quantities of these alloys were melted in an electrical furnace under a protective atmosphere comprising sulfur hexafluoride, carbon dioxide and dry air. The alloys were cast both in a permanent mold and in a UBE 315 Ton squeeze caster. Extensive evaluation of tensile, impact and fatigue properties was conducted at CWRU on permanent mold and squeeze cast test bars of AZ 91, AM 60 and AM 50. Ultimate tensile strength values between 20 ksi and 30 ksi were obtained. The respective elongations varied between 25 and 115. the Charpy V-notch impact strength varied between 1. 6 ft-lb and 5 ft-lb depending on the alloy and processing conditions. Preliminary bending fatigue evaluation indicates a fatigue limit of 11 - 12 ksi for AM 50 and AM 60. This is about 0. 4 of the UTS, typical for these alloys. The microstructures of the cast specimens were investigated with optical and scanning electron microscopy. Concomitantly, a study of the fracture toughness in AM 60 was conducted at ORNL as part of the study. The results are in line with values published in the literature and are representative of current state of the art in casting magnesium alloys. The experimental results confirm the strong relationship between aluminum content of the alloys and the mechanical properties, in particular the impact strength and the elongation. As the aluminum content increases from about 5 % in AM 50 to over 9 % in AZ 91, more of the intermetallic Mg 17 Al 12 is formed in the microstructure. For instance, for 15 increase in the aluminum content from AM 50 to AM 60, the volume fraction of eutectic present in the microstructure increases by 35 %! Eventually, the brittle Mg 17 Al 12 compound forms an interconnected network that reduces ductility and impact resistance. The lower aluminum in AM 50 and AM 60 are therefore a desirable feature in applications that call for higher impact resistance. Further improvement in impact resistance depends on the processing condition of the casting. Sound castings without porosity and impurities will have better mechanical properties. Since magnesium oxidizes readily, good melting and metal transfer practices are essential. The liquid metal has to be protected from oxidation at all times and entrainment of oxide films in the casting needs to be prevented. In this regard, there is evidence that us of vacuum to evacuate air from the die casting cavity can improve the quality of the castings. Fast cooling rates, leading to smaller grain size are beneficial and promote superior mechanical properties. Micro-segregation and banding are two additional defect types often encountered in magnesium alloys, in particular in AZ 91 D. While difficult to eliminate, segregation can be minimized by careful thermal management of the dies and the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve.</b> A major source of segregation is the premature solidification in the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The primary solid dendrites are carried into the casting and form a heterogeneous structure. Furthermore, during the shot, segregation banding can occur.

40|$|Cold chamber high {{pressure}} die casting, (HPDC), {{is an important}} commercial process {{for the production of}} complex near net shape aluminium and magnesium alloy castings. The work presented in the thesis was aimed at investigating the microstructure formation in this type of casting. The solidification characteristics related to the process and the alloys control the formation of grains and defects. This again has {{a significant impact on the}} mechanical properties of the castings. The investigations were carried out mainly using the AM 60 magnesium alloy and the A 356 aluminium alloy. Two different casting arrangements were used: the cold chamber HPDC and the gravity die casting methods, which allowed for different flow and solidification conditions. The microstructures in the castings were investigated using optical microscopy, image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, electron back scatter diffraction measurements and electron probe microanalysis. In the HPDC experiments, the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> solidification conditions were investigated primarily by changing the melt superheat on pouring. This significantly affected the microstructures in the castings. The fraction of externally solidified crystals (ESCs) was consistently found to be largest near the gate in both the AM 60 and the A 356 die castings. This was attributed to the inherent <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> solidification conditions and the flow set up by the plunger movement. When the superheat was increased, a lower fraction of ESCs was found in the castings. Furthermore, a high superheat gave ESCs with branched dendritic/elongated trunk morphology whilst a low superheat generated coarser and more globular ESCs, both in the AM 60 and the A 356 castings. The ESCs typically segregated towards the central region of the cross sections at further distances from the gate in the die castings. When a thin layer of thermal insulating coating was applied on the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> wall in the production of AM 60 die castings, it nearly removed all ESCs in the castings. Using an A 356 alloy, (and no <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> coating), with no Ti in solution gave a significantly lower fraction of ESCs, whereas AlTi 5 B 1 grain refiner additions induced an increase in the fraction of ESCs and a significantly finer grain size in the castings. The formation of globular ESCs was enhanced when AlTi 5 B 1 grain refiner was added to the A 356 alloy. In controlled laboratory gravity die casting experiments, typical HPDC microstructures were created by pouring semi-solid metal into a steel die: The ESCs were found to segregate/migrate to the central region during flow, until a maximum packing, (fraction of ESCs of ~ 35 - 40 %), was reached. The extent of segregation is determined by the fraction of ESCs, and the die temperature affects the position of the ESCs. The segregation of ESCs was explained to occur during flow as a result of lift forces. The formation of banded defects has also been studied: the position of the bands was affected by the die temperature and the fraction of ESCs. Based on the nature of the bands and their occurrence, a new theory on the formation of defect bands was proposed: During flow the solid distribution from the die wall consists of three regions: 1) a solid fraction gradient at the wall; 2) a low solid fraction region which carries (3) a network of ESCs. A critical fraction solid exists where the deformation rate exceeds the interdendritic flow rate. When the induced stress exceeds the network strength, deformation can occur by slip, followed by liquid flow. The liquid flow is caused by solidification shrinkage, hydrostatic pressure on the interior ESC network, and gaps forming which draw in liquid. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to predict the part deformation and residual stresses after ejection from the die and cooling to room temperature. A finite element model was built to achieve this goal and several modeling techniques were investigated throughout {{this research}}. Die-casting is a very complex process and the researchers are faced with a large number of hard to solve physical problems when modeling the process. Several assumptions are made in our simulation model. The first significant assumption is the instantaneous cavity filling. This means that the cavity filling stage is not considered in our model. Considering the cavity filling stage increases the modeling complexity as a result of different flow patterns. expected in the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve,</b> gate, runner and different cavity features. The flow of gas from the cavity through the vents is another problem that is ignored in our model {{as a result of this}} assumption. Our second assumption is that the cast metal has uniform temperature distribution inside the cavity, at the starting point of simulation. This temperature is assumed to be over liquidus limit, i. e. the solid fraction is 0. 0 % of the cast metal. The third assumption is due to ABAQUS (commercial software used in this research) limitations. ABAQUS cannot deal with multi-phase models; therefore we use solid elements to define the casting instead of multi-phase (liquid/solid) elements. Liquid elements can carry the hydrostatic pressure from the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> and apply it on the cavity surfaces, while the solid elements do not have this capability. To compensate for this assumption we add the cavity pressure as a boundary condition and apply it on the cavity surface separately from the part. Another issue with this assumption is that, liquid casting can follow the cavity shape when it distorts. With the use of solid elements to represent the casting during its liquid state, it loses this capability to follow the cavity. Several techniques were tested to overcome this problem...|$|E

The purpose of this new construction solution is mainly {{the reduction of the}} casting porosity caused by air entrapment and the improvement of both castability and accuracy of the die cavity reproduction. For such a redesigned machine there have been performed examinations consisting in pressure casting of AlSi 9 Cu alloy (EN AC- 46000) at varying plunger velocity in the second stage of injection and varying intensification pressure. The alloy castability (the die filling ability) has been measured for each parameter setting. For the purpose of comparison, similar measurements have been performed also for the conventional system without a counter plunger. The castability examination has been done by means of a specially designed die with an impression of a trial casting of variable wall thickness. The experiments have been held according to the assumed factor design 22, what allowed for determining the mathematical models describing the influence of die filling parameters on the castability and the die cavity reproduction level. Both alternatives of the experiment confirmed the positive influence of plunger velocity and intensification pressure increase on the improvement of castability, the measure of the latter being the filled length of the impression. Applying of the new ‘full sleeve’ solution has improved castability for each experiment by about 20 % as compared with conventional alternative. Castability in the ‘full sleeve’ system has been increased even for low values of plunger velocity and intensification pressure. For both alternative systems the influence of plunger velocity has been found, as an average, by four times greater than the influence of intensification pressure. The possibility of applying lower pressure values has been noticed for the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> construction with the counter plunger. This can influence favourably both the die and the machine durability. The obtained results have been explained and it has been pointed out that the ‘full sleeve’ construction can be widely adopted in pressure die casting of metal alloys...|$|E

Due to high demands on stiffness and fracture toughness high-strength forged steels are used to provide components with high mechanical load capacity. In spite of all advantages forging is restricted by some means like the freedom of scope. However, because of the extreme thermal load and the hardly avoidable casting defects, hand tools are nowadays not cast. By thixocasting steel technical difficulties can be reduced and new options are provided, which allow manufacturing of components with much higher complexity than forging.

At present, {{there are still}} very few systematic studies on vacuum die casting theory and equipment design. On {{the basis of the}} existing theories of the vacuum die casting pumping and venting systems, a simplified model is established in this research. The model has an aggregate unit consisted of "vacuum pump + buffer tank" and a cylindrical container (including the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve,</b> cavity and exhaust channel). The theoretical analysis is carried out between the cavity pressure and the pumping time under different volume models. An auxiliary system for high vacuum die casting is designed based on the above analysis. This system is composed of a vacuum control machine and a new vacuum stop valve. The machine has a human-computer control mode with "programmable logic controller(PLC) + touch screen" and a real-time monitoring function of vacuum degree for buffer tank and die cavity. The vacuum stop valve with the "compressed gas + piston rod + labyrinth groove" structure can realize the function of whole-process vacuum venting. The new system shows great advantages on vacuuming the cavity with a much faster speed by making tests on an existing die casting mold and a 250 t die casting machine. A die cavity pressure less than 10 kPa can be reached within 0. 8 s in the experiment and the porosity of castings can be greatly decreased. The systematic studies on vacuum die casting theory and equipment have a great guiding significance for high vacuum die casting, and can also be applied to other high vacuum forming in related theoretical and practical research...|$|E
40|$|Contaminated {{surfaces}} of the feedstock materials in aluminum alloy casting processes often produce various types of defects which can affect the tensile properties of the final products {{as well as their}} fatigue reliabilities. Semi-solid processing takes advantage of a much higher apparent viscosity of the die cast materials by limiting the risk of oxides formed at the free surfaces to become incorporated into the casting when the material is injected into the die. Most of existing semi-solid processes that use billets as feedstock material are however tied up with a different type of contaminated surface. During the injection phase, the external-skin {{on the periphery of the}} billet, which has been in contact with air and lubricant during the transfer in the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve,</b> can be incorporated into the casting. When subjected to a heat treatment, the lubricant is decomposed and produces lens shape porosities. This might be a cause of reject for most structural parts. To avoid this kind of defects, the paths along which the billet skin evolves must be controlled during filling. In order to investigate the possibility of skin inclusion into cast parts during injection of the billet, a two-phase finite element mixture model is employed to model the metal flow. The formation of a skin on the periphery of the billet is modeled by setting an initial solid phase concentration profile in the radial direction. Microscopic observations of the real castings show that the approach is able to model the shear layers and to predict the paths along which the 2 ̆ 01 clens porosity 2 ̆ 01 d defects could be formed. An Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagangian (ALE) method is also investigated and appears to be very promising to follow the skin movement in the casting. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Semisolid metal alloys have {{a special}} {{microstructure}} of globular grains suspended in a liquid metal matrix. This particular physical state of the matter can be exploited to produce near-net-shape parts with improved mechanical properties. Indeed, semi-solid processes {{take advantage of a}} much higher apparent viscosity of the die cast materials by limiting the risk of oxide formed on the free surfaces to become incorporated into the casting when the material is injected into the die. Semi-solid processes that use billets as feedstock material are however tied up with an additional type of surface contamination. During the injection phase, the external-skin {{on the periphery of the}} billet, which has been in contact with air and lubricant during the transfer in the <b>shot</b> <b>sleeve</b> may be incorporated into the casting. This can be an important cause of reject for most structural parts in the automotive industry. In order to predict and control the occurrence of skin inclusion into cast parts during the injection phase of semisolid processes, Lagrangian methods are appropriate. Indeed, the skin, composed of contaminated or even partially solidified metal, has different mechanical properties compared to the core of semi-solid aluminum. Abitrary- Lagrangian-Eulerian formulations, which can account for the coupling between the 2 ̆ 01 csolid 2 ̆ 01 d skin and the flow of 2 ̆ 01 csemi-solid 2 ̆ 01 d aluminum are promising but still necessitate a huge amount of computer power. On the other hand, particle based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approaches are particularly well suited to this kind of flows involving complex flow behavior and solidification. These methods are able to track accurately free surface flows with fragmentation and break up as well as to follow the advection of oxides through the flow. In this paper, a first analysis is performed in order to investigate the potential of the SPH solver of LS-DYNA to deal with the problem of skin inclusion in semi-solid die casting processes. Preliminary results show that the SPH approach is a very promising simulation tool to follow the skins during semi-solid injection casting. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
