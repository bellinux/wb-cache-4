Two of the four rams advanced beyond the line of the gunboats and rammed or otherwise disrupted the movements of their opponents; the other rams misinterpreted their orders and did not enter the battle at all. With the federal rams and gunboats not coordinating their movements and the Confederate vessels operating independently, the battle soon was reduced to a melee. It is agreed by all that the ram flagship, , initiated hostilities by slamming into CSS Colonel Lovell. She was then rammed in turn by {{one or more of the}} remaining cottonclads. Ellet was at this time wounded by a pistol shot in his knee, thereby becoming the only casualty on the Union side. (In the hospital, he contracted measles, the childhood disease that killed some 5,000 soldiers during the war. The combination of the disease and the debilitation caused by his wound was too great, and he died on June 21.) The remainder of the battle is obscured by more than the fog of war. Several eyewitness accounts are available; however, they are mutually contradictory to a greater degree than usual. All that is certain is that at the end of the battle, all but one of the cottonclads were either destroyed or captured, and one Yankee boat, Queen of the West, was disabled. The sole boat to escape, CSS General Earl Van Dorn, fled to the protection of the Yazoo River, just north of Vicksburg. Personnel losses among the Confederates cannot be estimated reliably.|$|E

40|$|Communication {{theology}} {{is a relatively}} new field of thought at the meeting point of two disciplines, a result of an attempt to approach communication from a theological perspective. Showing the characteristics of basic researches when describing phenomena and grasping concepts which usually belongs to the field of communication studies, it vindicates the essentially theological caracter of communication. However, the established discourse is one-sided: Within its framework, communication is integration-focused in a specific way, as integration through acts of the Divine Persons or through human acts in correspondence with ontological and revealed truths. In the meantime, little light was shed both on the separative aspect of this integration and on the explication of other, negative integration processes, described in the Bible as a type of communication. In this paper, we will examine these issues postulated as weaknesses in communication theology, and trying to argue for the following propositions: First, the lack of <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of demarcation between positive and negative communication in an ontological sense poses a serious problem in a proper theological understanding of communication, and second, it is necessary to differentiate between communities created through these processes...|$|E

40|$|A {{side-scatter}} imaging (SSI) technique using a 447 nm, 500 mW laser and a Nikon D 80 {{camera was}} tested at Kennedy Space Center, Florida during {{the passing of}} a rain band associated with Tropical Storm Colin. The June 6, 2016, 22 : 00 GMT rain event was intense but short-lived owing to the strong west-to-east advection of the rain band. An effort to validate the optical extinction measurement was conducted by <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> of three tipping rain gauges along an 80 m east-west path and below the laser beam. Differences between tipping bucket measurements were correlated to the extinction coefficient profile along the lasers path, {{as determined by the}} SSI measurement. In order to compare the tipping bucket to the optical extinction data, a Marshall-Palmer DSD model was assumed. Since this was a daytime event, the laser beam was difficult to detect in the camera images, pointing out an important limitation of SSI measurements: the practical limit of DSD density that can be effectively detected and analyzed under daylight conditions using this laser and camera, corresponds to a fairly moderate rainfall rate on the order of 20 mmh (night measurements achieve a much improved sensitivity). The SSI analysis model under test produced promising results, but in order to use the SSI method for routine meteorological studies, improvements to the math model will be required...|$|E
