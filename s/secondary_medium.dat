25|$|The {{appearance}} of multimodality, {{at its most}} basic level, can change the way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via semiotics – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its semiotic effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on multimodality and semiotics, argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered in conjunction with a <b>secondary</b> <b>medium,</b> such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer’s attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their semiotic connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and this new type of learning can be controlled by the types of media used.|$|E
25|$|The game uses a {{class-based}} character system, {{similar to}} the system found in Pandemic's previous game Star Wars: Battlefront. There are four playable classes. Warriors are a melee combat unit which focus on swordsmanship. Unlike the other classes, whose special attacks recharge over time, warriors can only gain energy by defeating enemies, which allows them to unleash more powerful attacks with a flaming sword, such as spinning to hit every adjacent enemy. They are the only class that can block or perform counterattacks with special moves. The warrior also has a throwing axe as a <b>secondary,</b> <b>medium</b> ranged weapon. Archers are better suited for long range combat and are equipped with a bow and arrow. Different types of arrows can be equipped: fire arrows, which can knock down enemies and deal explosive damage; poison arrows, which slow enemies down and do damage over time, {{and the ability to}} fire a volley of three normal arrows at multiple enemies at once. They also have a kick for use in close-quarters, which knocks back the enemy. They can also hit concealed Scouts with the multiple arrow skill. A headshot will allow the archer to kill most enemies in a single hit.|$|E

2500|$|The full disentangling of Greek statues {{from their}} later Roman copies, {{and a better}} {{understanding}} of the balance between Greekness and Roman-ness in Greco-Roman art was to take much longer, and perhaps still continues. [...] Greek art, especially sculpture, continued to enjoy an enormous reputation, and studying and copying it was a large part of the training of artists, until the downfall of Academic art in the late 19th century. [...] During this period, the actual known corpus of Greek art, and to a lesser extent architecture, has greatly expanded. [...] The study of vases developed an enormous literature in the late 19th and 20th centuries, much based on the identification of the hands of individual artists, with Sir John Beazley the leading figure. This literature generally assumed that vase-painting represented the development of an independent medium, only in general terms drawing from stylistic development in other artistic media. [...] This assumption has been increasingly challenged in recent decades, and some scholars now see it as a <b>secondary</b> <b>medium,</b> largely representing cheap copies of now lost metalwork, and much of it made, not for ordinary use, but to deposit in burials.|$|E

40|$|Taking its {{cue from}} {{literature}} on visual culture this article addresses {{the possibility of}} a plurality of listening positions or, more precisely, the possibility of periodizing competing or co-existent `auditory regimes¿. It therefore contributes to what Douglas has recently described as an `archaeology of listening¿. By the 1920 s film was being theorized as a new sense organ presenting a distracted, modern (and potentially progressive) way of seeing. But the really new medium of the 1920 s was the radio, which quickly became defined as a <b>secondary</b> <b>medium</b> broadcasting fragmentary, ephemeral content. By drawing on theoretical discourses of perception in the work of Kracauer and Benjamin and on contemporary sources about radio and everyday life in Weimar Germany, this article examines the `modernization¿ of an aural mode of perception, and the reversal of conventional gender roles in contemporary writings on the cinema, given radio¿s primary location in the private sphere...|$|E
30|$|The paper “A {{concurrent}} access MAC {{protocol for}} cognitive radio ad hoc networks without common control channel” by S.K. Timalsina, S. Moh, I. Chung, and M. Kang considers a typical {{problem in a}} cognitive radio ad hoc network: spatially distributed SUs do not necessarily have the same channels available for dynamic spectrum access, because they may observe different activity of PUs. Correspondingly, it cannot be guaranteed that {{there is at least}} one channel common to all SUs, which makes it difficult to install a common control channel (CCC) for <b>secondary</b> <b>medium</b> access. To this end, the authors propose a concurrent access MAC (CA-MAC) protocol, which does not require any CCC and limits the waiting time for the secondary nodes by allowing parallel channel access by multiple communication pairs within the same time slot. Analytical and simulation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed CA-MAC protocol with regard to the resulting throughput when compared to state-of-the-art MAC protocols without CCC.|$|E
