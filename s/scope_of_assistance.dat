40|$|In {{the past}} twenty to thirty years, the United States has made great strides in {{treating}} the victims of heterosexual domestic violence. For victims that are in same-sex relationships, the story is much different. Traditional gender roles frame the quality of treatment victims receive, and biases held by many public officials and servants make many avoid help at all. Negative views of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual) stemming from traditional gender roles affect victims of LGBT violence by impacting the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> they receive. This claim has been founded by examining sources from mental health, public policy, and gender studies for potential results of bias and gendered views. By {{improving the quality of}} care and educating those who handle domestic violence on a daily basis, victims will begin to reach out for help more often while encouraging other victims who are trapped in their own relationships.

40|$|Impairment of a {{healthcare}} professional (HCP) is {{the inability to}} practice according to accepted standards of practice due to mental or physical disability, condition or disorder. Substance use disorder is amenable to treatment and the pharmacy profession has an ethical and professional obligation to assist impaired colleagues getand to protect the public. There is one support program for Australian pharmacists, the Victorian Pharmacist Support Service (PSS). An explorative survey and semi-structured interview were utilised to explore the PSS program, its <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance,</b> {{the nature of its}} services and its role in addressing impairment. Limitations on the efficacy of the PSS program were identified such as a lack of awareness of PSS in the profession and difficulty with follow-up due to privacy laws. Both financial limitations and lack of availability of expertise prevented the program from comprehensively addressing the issue of pharmacist impairment. PSS is predominantly a listening ear and referral service. Poor transparency by AHPRA and an associated stigma with impairment was identified as a barrier to reporting. More information and education about the issue is necessary. Key concerns surfaced regarding the mandatory reporting requirements with volunteers utilizing several measures to evade the issue. Volunteers revealed a hesitancy to refer impaired callers to professional help and their confidential assistance was limited due to their obligation to report. Impairment is being addressed internationally and within Australia for other HCPs using prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programs that have a high success rate. The provision of a more viable HCP integrated support program is required that comprehensively addresses the issue. The findings provide an insight into Australia’s impaired pharmacist population that {{has been the subject of}} very limited research...|$|E
40|$|Post penal {{treatment}} {{should be}} used throughout the whole world, because life in prison entirely differs from life in freedom. In my thesis, my interest was the treatment of convicts and former convicts in Spain, since I lived in Madrid for a year, where I, theoretically, as well as practically, encountered the world of imprisonment. The theory {{and the practice of}} post penal assistance in Spain partially differ, but, as I found out, sometimes also coincide. I would describe the post penal treatment as a treatment, help for the prisoners and former prisoners in the fields of habituation, employment, finances, health care and possible addiction, the contact with family and friends, legal representation and psychological assistance, as well as any other <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> needed. I believe that post penal treatment should already begin during imprisonment, and continue upon release. It is a fact, that the life of an individual thorroughly changes with the entry and the release from prison; for one, with the entry, one has to adapt to the institution, in which the imprisonment is served, while simultaneously preparing for life after the imprisonment, which will probably not continue as it was before. This adaptation to two entirely different realities is a challenging task. Once a convict is set free, he has to reintegrate into society, which means that he has to integrate on different levels. I would describe this process as very challenging, because a former convict is stigmatized as someone whom people fear and therefore refuse to keep in their vicinity. This is where mostly problems with employment, existential and financial problems derive from. These problems are reflected differently in every country, but I believe they are at least partly present everywhere. The primary purpose of my thesis is to display the practice of post penal treatment in Spain before and after the release from prison. In addition to the theoretical part, where the assistance to convicts and former convicts is presented, I also included an empirical part in my work, which shows the post penal treatment and the experience of a user of post penal assistance. I believe, that social pedagogy {{has a lot to do}} with post penal assistance, no matter what country discussed, because our profession is specialized for people in the social periphery, where convicts and former convicts undoubtedly find themselves. With the socially pedagogical treatment of these people, it is crucial to start with the needs of users, in order to provide the most effective assistance. This means that convicts and former convicts would retreat from the social periphery right into the heart of society as fast as possible. For this, however, the will and iniciative, commitment and true interest of an individual, as well as the training of professional workers for help and the affection of society, are needed. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the Saskatchewan Government's export {{promotion}} program by making comparisons with the export programs of the federal government and the other provincial governments. The study was motivated by the almost total lack of information on this topic in the literature. The methodology of the research included a survey of available government documents on export promotion, personal interviews with government officials and a mail questionnaire to all provincial governments. Results indicated that the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> export <b>assistance</b> offered by the Saskatchewan Government was generally more limited than in most other provinces. The programs available in Saskatchewan were found to be, for the most part, similar in nature to the programs offered by most other provincial governments. While the Saskatchewan Government attempted to supplement export services offered by the federal government, a significant gap had been left with respect to export promotion in the United States. Budgetary restraints had reduced Saskatchewan's export promotion activities in all foreign countries. As many federal programs apply only to countries outside Canada and the United States, Saskatchewan exporters were left without formal, ongoing government assistance programs with respect to their largest export market, the United States. It was further discovered, however, that the Saskatchewan Government was considering the establishment of promotional programs specifically for the United States, so this gap may be filled in the near future...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how living conditions and settlement patterns differ between two ethnic groups {{belonging to the}} Afghan refugee population residing in Peshawar, Pakistan. Evidence from Peshawar suggests that the Pashtun, {{the largest and most}} dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan, migrate to the city largely in search of employment and/or because they no longer require humanitarian <b>assistance.</b> Approximately one-third <b>of</b> the Pashtuns interviewed had spent some time in a refugee village before settling in Peshawar. In contrast the Hazaras, among the weakest minority groups in Afghanistan, avoid refugee camps altogether. The Hazaras fear persecution in the refugee villages by other Afghans and choose to settle in cities almost immediately after entering Pakistan. Both groups, in almost equal number, cite the existence of family and friends in Peshawar as another reason for settling in Peshawar. Since refugee relief efforts are focused in refugee villages, Hazaras and other minorities living in cities tend to be excluded from aid. Relying on data collected from sixty interviews, the paper describes issues faced by both groups living in Peshawar. It concludes that organizations coordinating refugee relief efforts in Pakistan ought to consider how minority groups within the larger refugee population are affected by the concentration <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>assistance</b> in refugee villages. It argues that relief efforts sensitive to the ethno-religious identity and location of refugee can mitigate the hardships faced by those normally outside the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> humanitarian <b>assistance...</b>|$|R

40|$|The state, {{the family}} and the market are the main pillars of welfare regimes that have {{different}} configurations from one country to another. In Turkey, these mechanisms are under increasing pressure today. The family seems unable to extend protection beyond the nuclear household. In addition to that, support to rural employment and urban housing, deployed through clientele networks, decline. Wage insurance, as a way of accessing the social protection system, is also challenged by the characteristics of the labour market. We argue that the structure of employment is increasingly incompatible with the existing welfare system framework, which is mainly centred on formal workers insurance. In this context, will the current pensions and health reforms lead to a better articulation between employment forms and the social protection system? The first part of the article analyzes the evolution of the labour market since the 1990 s. Recent adjustments of this market take place in the context of structural changes in the regulation of labour relations and of the economic model. The second part of the article examines social protection reforms. We analyse first parametric adjustments in the case of pensions (retirement age, period of contribution and replacement rates), and secondly, measures adopted to ensure universal access to health care and services. We argue that other forms <b>of</b> insurance and/or <b>assistance</b> might be necessary to increase the scope and depth of coverage. The last section explore three possible transformations of the Turkish welfare regime: increased labour market flexibility, a more important role of private insurance and the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> social <b>assistance</b> mechanisms.  ...|$|R
40|$|Welfare {{reform in}} middle income countries, where formal {{institutions}} conventionally have an exclusionary character and informal institutions {{are central to}} social welfare, {{has been marked by}} a drastic rise <b>of</b> means-tested social <b>assistance</b> schemes. This dissertation analyses, with an empirical focus on Turkey, the potential of these schemes to expand social rights by creating new formal entitlements for previously excluded groups. The number and the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> social <b>assistance</b> schemes in Turkey have shown a remarkable increase, especially after the 2001 economic crisis, accompanied by significant institutionalisation. Yet, we argue that whilst social assistance has grown distinctively and {{become an integral part of}} the emerging welfare regime, certain characteristics of the previous regime were ultimately reproduced within new institutions due to the content of current schemes and the institutional structure of implementation. These include the association of mainstream welfare institutions with social insurance, the ambiguous role of the state towards the excluded parts of the society, the reliance on family relations and informal employment, and the prevalence of paternalist or clientelist motivations. Consequently, the potential <b>of</b> social <b>assistance</b> to extend formalised rights to the entire population was undermined, and the outcome has been the consolidation of a semi-formal welfare regime. To substantiate this argument, the dissertation develops a historical institutionalist framework and examines the elements of institutional change and continuity as well as the processes of change. Our three empirical chapters then focus on the development of legal, organisational, ideational and political bases of social assistance; trends in policy outcomes from the perspectives of decommodification, commodification, defamilialisation and declientelisation; and the functioning <b>of</b> social <b>assistance</b> through semi-autonomous foundations at the local level. Empirically, we build our argument on a comprehensive evidence base including a wide range of policy documents and qualitative interviews. Theoretically, we discuss the implications of our findings for the literatures on welfare regimes and institutionalism, stressing the importance of implementation structures, the co-existence of institutional change and continuity, and the suggestion of a semi-formal regime type...|$|R

The conclusion was that the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assistance</b> should be expanded to include expertise in rangeland management and livestock marketing, as well as animal production. The main mission visited the most seriously affected areas, identified situations requiring priority attention and gave recommendations concerning practical strategies to alleviate the effects of future drought. The project also provided a consultancy on rural water supplies which has been covered under the terminal statement of TCP/NAM/ 0154 "Assistance to Rural Water Supplies". The main mission recommended that pertinent livestock and rangeland parameters be included into the country's early-warning system. Continuing degradation of the veld was highlighted as a serious problem exacerbated by uncontrolled water exploration and development in the less-intensively grazed areas. The impact of future droughts can be reduced by encouraging livestock owners to sell surplus stock earlier in drought years, but such a strategy requires a functional marketing system particularly in those areas where the informal market is less active. Priority should be given to increasing MEATCO's slaughter capacity and holding ground facilities. The consequences of providing subsidized drought feeding, especially with cereal grains, are pointed out. The project concluded that improvements in animal and rangeland husbandry which lead to increased livestock productivity will in the future reduce the vulnerability of the national herd to drought. Proposals are given to initiate three pilot livestock development areas and to develop the human resources available within the Department of Veterinary Services...|$|R
