40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>merchant</b> <b>markets</b> in {{the presence}} of vertically-integrated firms. We discuss when vertical integration tends to increase the elasticity of (derived) demand in the <b>merchant</b> <b>market</b> because of indirect contraints arising from the retail market. We also discuss the relevance of different measures of market power such as market shares in the wholesale or retail market. We provide insights into the likely effect of an upstream merger under vertical integration, depending on, for instance, whether the integrated firm currently sells into the <b>merchant</b> <b>market</b> or whether this can be expected after the merger. market definition, wholesale, SSNIP, vertical integration...|$|R

40|$|For an {{assessment}} of market power on the wholesale (or <b>merchant)</b> <b>market</b> {{in the presence of}} vertically integrated firms, we analyze the interaction of direct constraints, arising from competition on the wholesale market, and of indirect constraints, arising from substitution on the retail market. A vertically integrated firm that still participates in the <b>merchant</b> <b>market</b> exerts both direct and indirect constraints. We analyze the factors that determine the importance of indirect constraints. We find that, in contrast to a common presumption, indirect constraints are sometimes more powerful than direct constraints. We furthermore analyze the incentives of integrated firms to still participate in the <b>merchant</b> <b>market,</b> provided that this is technologically feasible.

50|$|In Table 5, the {{approximately}} $85 billion fine chemical market is subdivided into major applications {{according to their}} relevance, namely, fine chemicals for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialty chemicals outside life sciences. Furthermore, a distinction is made between captive (in-house) production and <b>merchant</b> <b>market.</b> Pharmaceutical fine chemicals (PFCs) account for two-thirds of the total. Out of the PFC value of $55 billion, about $23 billion (~40%) are traded, and $32 billion (~60%) are the production value of the pharma industry’s in-house production. Within life science products, fine chemicals for agro, and —at a distance— for veterinary drugs follow in importance. The production value for fine chemicals used for specialty chemicals other than pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals is estimated at $15 billion. As the leading specialty chemical companies, Akzo Nobel, Dow, Du Pont, Evonik, Chemtura and Mitsubishi are backward-integrated, the share of in-house production is estimated at 75%, leaving a <b>merchant</b> <b>market</b> of approximately $5 billion.|$|R

We examine the fundamentals and segment these versatile markets in which expanding gas production and the drive towards liberalization are affecting market conditions. The analysis shows that the industrial LNG, LPG, ammonia and petrochemical markets are slowly transforming to a competitive setting with an increasing number of private buyers and sellers rendering the market more efficient. The gas asset markets are still too small in size and illiquid so that entry and exit through the second-hand market remains difficult. ...|$|R
