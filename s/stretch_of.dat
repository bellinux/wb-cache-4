30|$|In L- 3 (red line in Fig.  1) major signals were at 3466, 2929 and 2551  cm− 1 {{which are}} related to N–H <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> amines and amides, C–H <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> alkanes and O–H <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> {{hydrogen}} bonded carboxylic acids, respectively (Skoog et al. 2007; Shouliang et al. 2008).

40|$|Aims 2 ̆ 6 Objective: The {{objective}} of {{study was to}} compare the effectiveness <b>of</b> manual <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> the flexor retinaculum with or without ultrasonic therapy. Methods: The study was started by selecting the 50 patients from the out patients department of Al-nafees Hospital AlipurFarash and National institute of Rehabilitation Medicine Islamabad with history of carpal tunnel syndrome. The 25 patients in experimental group were treated with manual <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> flexor retinaculum and ultrasound and 25 patients of control group were treated with manual <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> flexor retinaculum. Every session was started by assessment of improvement of the symptoms in each patient. Data was collected through Numeric pain rating scale, point Paresthesia assessment scale and muscle strength by hydraulic hand dynamometer. Independent sample t-test was {{used to analyze the}} data with p ≤ 0. 05. Results: The mean age of subjects was 1. 78 ± 0. 64 and 41 subjects have CTS of Right hand remaining 9 subjects were left handed. After the completion of the treatment program it was observe that {{there was no difference in}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> manual <b>Stretching</b> <b>of</b> flexor retinaculum with ultra sound therapy and manual <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> flexor retinaculum alone. The NPRS, paresthesia and muscle stretch showed p≥ 0. 05 between experimental and control groups. Conclusion: This study proved that manual <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> the flexor retinaculum along with ultra sonic therapy have same affects as manual <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> the flexor retinaculum alone...|$|R
