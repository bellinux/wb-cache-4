A key factor is the polar winds that can drive the sound's pack ice into the Ross Sea summer or winter. Frigid katabatic winds rake subsequent exposed water, causing sea ice to form. Freezing surface water <b>excludes</b> <b>salt</b> from the water below; leaving behind heavy, cold water that sinks to the ocean floor. This process repeats itself along Antarctica's coastal areas, spreading cold sea water outward into the world's ocean basins.|$|R

However, recent research suggests the older, yellowing leaves have no more measurable salt content than the other, greener leaves. Red mangroves can also store salt in cell vacuoles. As seen in the photograph on the right, white or grey mangroves can secrete salts directly; they have two salt glands at each leaf base (correlating with their name—they are covered in white salt crystals).|$|R

A binary impact of salt on plants is exerted through osmotic stress and ion toxicity (Greenway and Munns 1980). The long-term impact of salt in this 30 -d salt treatment was primarily due to toxic effects of Na+ rather than osmotic stress, {{which would have been}} most apparent in the earliest stages of the treatment period when tissue ion levels were lowest and osmotic adjustment was not yet established (Munns et al. 2016). The more salt-sensitive genotypes appeared to have less capacity to <b>exclude</b> <b>salt,</b> causing leaf Na+ and K+ concentrations to rise above parity and cause toxicity and metabolic impairment.|$|R
50|$|High {{salinity}} {{represents an}} extreme environment to which relatively few organisms {{have been able}} to adapt and occupy. Most halophilic and all halotolerant organisms expend energy to <b>exclude</b> <b>salt</b> from their cytoplasm to avoid protein aggregation ('salting out'). To survive the high salinities, halophiles employ two differing strategies to prevent desiccation through osmotic movement of water out of their cytoplasm. Both strategies work by increasing the internal osmolarity of the cell. In the first (which is employed by the majority of halophilic bacteria, some archaea, yeasts, algae and fungi), organic compounds are accumulated in the cytoplasm — osmoprotectants which are known as compatible solutes. These can be either synthesised or accumulated from the environment. The most common compatible solutes are neutral or zwitterionic, and include amino acids, sugars, polyols, betaines, and ectoines, as well as derivatives of some of these compounds.|$|R

Dietary-I intakes were {{assessed}} using new datasets of crop, fish, salt and water-I concentrations, while I status was assessed for 60 women living on each of calcareous and non-calcareous soils as defined by urinary iodine concentration (UIC). Iodine concentration in staple foods was low, with median concentrations of 0. 01 mg kg− 1 in maize grain, 0. 008 mg kg− 1 in roots and tubers, but 0. 155 mg kg− 1 in leafy vegetables.

When MH is recovered during drilling, the MH dissociates, {{depending on the}} temperature and pressure conditions, to release CH 4 and water (Hesse and Harrison [1981]; Ussler and Paull [1995]). In vertical profiles of pore fluids, samples influenced by MH dissociation are characterized by a negative Cl− concentration spike and positive δ 18 OH 2 O and δDH 2 O values (Kvenvolden and Kastner [1990]). Experimentally determined δ 18 OH 2 O and δDH 2 O fractionation factors during MH formation show a shift to heavier values from ambient water to the formation water; that is, Δδ 18 O shifts from + 2.8 ‰ to + 3.2 ‰ and ΔδD shifts from + 16 ‰ to + 20 ‰ (Maekawa [2004]; Maekawa and Imai [2000]).

The diffusion coefficient for salt in mangrove soils determines the rate of this diffusive transport but has not been determined experimentally before. In this work we used a 12 -month long-time series of salt concentration profiles measured in a sediment core over which fresh water was continuously circulated, to determine the diffusion coefficient for salt in the soil. Salt concentrations were measured using an electrical conductivity probe that was developed for use in hypersaline (salt concentration up to and in excess of 120 thinspg/l) conditions. A modified formula was experimentally determined to relate electrical conductivity to salt concentration and temperature, applicable up to a salt concentration of 200 thinspg/l. This was done because standard formulae relating these variables do not apply in the hypersaline conditions often encountered in salt flat sediments. The salt concentration profiles were used in a simple mathematical model to determine a sediment diffusion coefficient for salt in a salt flat sediment. This value of D=(4. 6 ± 0. 2) × 10 – 5 thinspm 2 /day was approximately half that calculated theoretically...|$|R
40|$|The {{responses}} to mild root zone salinity stress were investigated in two co-occurring Mediterranean woody evergreens, Quercus ilex L. and Arbutus unedo L., which differ in morpho-anatomical traits and strategies {{to cope with}} water deficit. The aim was to explore their strategies to allocate potentially toxic ions at organism level, and the consequential physiological and biochemical adjustments. Water and ionic relations, gas exchange and photosystem II performance, the concentration of photosynthetic pigments, and the activity of antioxidant defenses, were measured. Quercus ilex displayed a greater capacity to exclude Na+ and Cl- from the leaf as compared with Arbutus unedo, in part {{as a consequence of}} greater reductions in transpiration rates. Salt-induced reductions in CO 2 assimilation resulted in Q. ilex suffering from excess of light {{to a greater extent than}} A. unedo. Consistently, in Q. ilex effective mechanisms of nonphotochemical quenching, also sustained by the lutein epoxide-lutein cycle, operated in response to salinity stress. Q. ilex also displayed a superior capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen species with respect to A. unedo. Our data suggest that the ability to <b>exclude</b> <b>salt</b> from actively growing shoot organs tightly depends on metabolic cost sustaining leaf construction, i. e., species-specific leaf life-span, and the relative strategies to cope with salt-induced water stress. We discuss about how contrasting abilities to restrict the entry and transport of salt in sensitive organs relate with species-specific salt tolerance...|$|R

40|$|As {{vegetation}} usually <b>excludes</b> <b>salt</b> during water uptake, transpiration {{will increase}} the salinity of the residual water. If the source water is sea water, then the residual water may become highly saline. In the unconfined coastal aquifer of the tropical Burdekin River delta, northeastern Australia, areas of highly saline ground water with chloride concentrations up to almost three times that of sea water occur up to 15 km from the present coastline, and are attributed to transpiration by mangrove vegetation during periods of high sea level. Radiogenic (14 C) carbon isotope analyses indicate that ground water with chloride concentrations between 15, 000 and 35, 000 mg/L is mostly between 4000 and 6000 years old, at which time sea level was 2 to 3 m higher than present. Stable isotope analyses of oxygen- 18 and deuterium show no evidence for evaporative enrichment of this water. Oxygen- 18, deuterium, and stable (δ 13 C) carbon isotope analyses of ground water and soil water point to a recharge environment beneath the mangrove forests during this postglacial sea level high stand. During that period, transpiration of the mangrove forests would have led to high chloride concentrations in the residual ground water, without inducing isotopic fractionation. Due to the higher density, this hypersaline water moved downward through the aquifer by gravity and has formed lenses of highly saline ground water {{at the bottom of}} the unconfined aquifer...|$|R

The fibroin was dissolved in 9 M (Ca(NO 3 ) 2 ) with ethanol (2 by mole) and heated at 70 ℃. The silk fibroin (SF) solution was then dialyzed to <b>exclude</b> <b>salt</b> in phosphate buffer.

These were indicated from FTIR spectra and thermal analysis. The chlorhexidine drug has not affect on the changes of film properties. However, the releasing pattern of chlorhexidine from each film was varied. The highest rate of drug releasing was found in the native SF film while the native G film was the lowest.

Seedlings were exposed to salt stress and the growth rate was monitored to decipher the effect of long-term stress. At Day 16, IR 29 produced lower shoot biomass than FL 478. Significant differences for Na⁺ and K⁺ concentrations and Na⁺ : K⁺ ratios in roots and shoots were observed between genotypes. Changes in the proteomes of control and salt-stressed plants were analysed, identifying 59 and 39 salt-responsive proteins in roots and leaves, respectively. Proteomic analysis showed greater downregulation of proteins in IR 29. In IR 29, proteins related to pathways involved in salt tolerance (e. g. oxidative stress response, amino acid biosynthesis, polyamine biosynthesis, the actin cytoskeleton and ion compartmentalisation) changed to combat salinity. We found significant downregulation of proteins related to photosynthetic electron transport in IR 29, indicating that photosynthesis was influenced, probably increasing the risk of reactive oxygen species formation. The sensitivity of IR 29 {{might be related to}} its inability to <b>exclude</b> <b>salt</b> from its transpiration stream, to compartmentalise excess ions and to maintain a healthy photosynthetic apparatus during salt stress, or might be because of the leakiness of its roots, allowing excess salt to enter apoplastically.

40|$|Objectives: Sodium is {{the mineral}} that has been, mainly, linked to {{hypertension}} and cardiovascular disease. It is found naturally in many foods, {{but is also}} used in the food industry and manufacturing. Identification of total sodium intake, as well as ‘hidden’ sodium intake from food sources early in life is necessary. Methods: Four thousand, five hundred and eighty children aged 10 – 12 years were enrolled, in a cross-sectional, population-based survey. Among other measurements, dietary data were obtained by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and sodium intake was calculated. High sodium consumption was considered an intake over 2200 mg/day. Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was evaluated using the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and adolescent score (KIDMED score). Results: Twenty-three percent of Greek children had sodium intake which exceeded the 2200 mg/day recommendation, <b>excluding</b> <b>salt</b> added at table and during cooking. Sodium intake was found elevated in children with moderate and high adherence to the Mediterranean Diet. Additionally, 1 unit increase in KIDMED score (i. e. higher adherence) was associated with 10 % [odds ratio (OR) 1. 10, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 07 – 1. 13] increased likelihood of consuming sodium above the median intake (i. e. > 1500 mg/day). Thirty-four percent of sodium intake from ‘hidden’ sources came from bread, processed cereals and white cheese. Conclusions: Greek children have an elevated sodium intake from ‘hidden’ sources and main contributors are foods which are recommended to be consumed {{on a daily basis}} according to the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid.

There {{is evidence that}} in selecting material to screen, provenances from saline areas will show higher levels of salt tolerance than those from non-saline areas. However, there are sufficient numbers of exceptions to justify inclusion in trials of some material from non-saline areas. Because of the complexity and long term nature of field trials, large numbers of species and provenances have been screened as juvenile plants (up to 1 year old) in the glasshouse. For very few of these, has the match between performance in glasshouse and field been checked. In Eucalyptus, the genus for which most species have been screened, the assessment of salinity tolerance is {{the same in the}} field and glasshouse for 20 species, three appear more tolerant in the field than the glasshouse and five are less tolerant in the field than would be expected from glasshouse results. For 13 eucalypt species there are conflicting results between different glasshouse and/or field trials. A similar picture emerges for Melaleuca, Acacia and Casuarina though in these genera fewer species have been tested in both glasshouse and field. Glasshouse trials have a role where specific information is needed from juvenile plants such as the ability of a species to <b>exclude</b> <b>salt</b> from the leaves, or performance under controlled conditions of waterlogging or saline waterlogging. However, as the objective of most experiments is to identify superior salt tolerant lines for the field, despite the complexity and cost, well designed and monitored field trials are the ultimate test.

40|$|Increasing {{episodes of}} drought, lack of {{sufficient}} nutrients, exposure to toxic minerals, and soil compaction {{are just a}} few examples of the environmental constraints that the roots are exposed to during plant growth. Understanding how roots respond to these stresses is crucial for improving crop production under such conditions. Yet, investigating roots is a very difficult task and, therefore, very {{little is known about the}} precise role that the roots play in contributing to plant adaptation to hostile environments. It is assumed that while the root depth and abundance would contribute to drought tolerance, profuse rooting would enhance nutrient capture, and where the membrane transporters would <b>exclude</b> <b>salts</b> from the root cells. However, a great deal is still unknown about how these mechanisms actually operate; for example which particular characteristics of roots and root hydraulics actually contributes to water uptake in a way that confers increased tolerance, how the stress signaling from the roots affects the physiological relations in the shoot and those between the shoot and the root, how water and nutrient absorption relate to one another when both are limiting, or how roots avoid the loading of salt in xylem vessels. In this paper, our intention is not an exhaustive review of roots, but to highlight a few research topics related to abiotic stresses - mostly drought stress, but also nutrient limitation (especially phosphorus) and salt stress - where roots and their hydraulics are at the center stage. First, we provide an update on root structure, root hydraulics, and modes of water and nutrient absorption, mainly focusing on how inter- and intra-specific variations in these aspects can modify the way roots respond to a range of abiotic stresses. We then review scattered reports across a range of crops showing the contribution of roots to stress tolerance, and then report our own assessment of the role of roots using near isogenic lines (NILs) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Halophiles {{are found}} in all three domains of life. Within the Bacteria we know halophiles within the phyla Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Bacteroidetes. Within the Archaea the most salt-requiring {{microorganisms}} {{are found in}} the class Halobacteria. Halobacterium and most of its relatives require over 100 – 150 g/l salt for growth and structural stability. Also within the order Methanococci we encounter halophilic species. Halophiles and non-halophilic relatives are often found together in the phylogenetic tree, and many genera, families and orders have representatives with greatly different salt requirement and tolerance. A few phylogenetically coherent groups consist of halophiles only: the order Halobacteriales, family Halobacteriaceae (Euryarchaeota) and the anaerobic fermentative bacteria of the order Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes). The family Halomonadaceae (Gammaproteobacteria) almost exclusively contains halophiles. Halophilic microorganisms use two strategies to balance their cytoplasm osmotically with their medium. The first involves accumulation of molar concentrations of KCl. This strategy requires adaptation of the intracellular enzymatic machinery, as proteins should maintain their proper conformation and activity at near-saturating salt concentrations. The proteome of such organisms is highly acidic, and most proteins denature when suspended in low salt. Such microorganisms generally cannot survive in low salt media. The second strategy is to <b>exclude</b> <b>salt</b> from the cytoplasm and to synthesize and/or accumulate organic 'compatible' solutes that do not interfere with enzymatic activity. Few adaptations of the cells' proteome are needed, and organisms using the 'organic-solutes-in strategy' often adapt to a surprisingly broad salt concentration range. Most halophilic Bacteria, but also the halophilic methanogenic Archaea use such organic solutes. A variety of such solutes are known, including glycine betaine, ectoine and other amino acid derivatives, sugars and sugar alcohols. The 'high-salt-in strategy' {{is not limited to the}} Halobacteriaceae. The Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes) also accumulate salt rather than organic solutes. A third, phylogenetically unrelated organism accumulates KCl: the red extremely halophilic Salinibacter (Bacteroidetes), recently isolated from saltern crystallizer brines. Analysis of its genome showed many points of resemblance with the Halobacteriaceae, probably resulting from extensive horizontal gene transfer. The case of Salinibacter shows that more unusual types of halophiles may be waiting to be discovered. </p...|$|R

40|$|Amaranth, {{an ancient}} cereal plant from South America, {{is making a}} comeback. Researchers {{have found that the}} plant tolerates saline soils and {{produces}} very nutritious food from land that has been abandoned to salt. Millions of hectares of farmland have been rendered useless to agriculture because inefficient irrigation systems, flooding and the encroaching sea have brought salts to the surface. At the moment these lands support coarse grasses or halophytic (salt tolerant) plants that are unsuitable for human consumption. The amaranths were the major cereals eaten by people living in Peru and Bolivia before the Spanish Conquest: subsequently maize relegated them to a minor role. Recently British and Chinese researchers at Coventry University, in the UK, have found that some species of amaranth can tolerate concentrations of salt that are as high as 50 % seawater. Traditional cereal crops would be killed at these concentrations. This means that {{they should be able to}} cope with the conditions that are now found in north-east China where large areas of the Yellow river delta are being lost to agriculture. For eight years British researchers and scientists from Shandong Teachers University have tested hundreds of different crops, and the amaranths look the most promising. The plant is able to <b>exclude</b> <b>salt</b> when it is growing, unlike halophytic plants which accumulate salt. Amaranths can yield an extremely nutritious grain which has a protein value almost equivalent to that of milk and much higher than that of traditional cereals. It also produces a green-leaf vegetable and is a useful forage crop for animals. They grow quickly, being ready for harvest in just three months. Another important trait is that they are C 4 plants. C 4 plants, such as maize and sugarcane, are far more efficient at trapping sunlight and absorbing nutrients than other crops. Field tests will start in China in November.

Twelve lactating Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (mean ± SD: milk production 28. 1 ± 3. 23 kg/d and 190 ± 41 d in milk), of which 4 were fitted with catheters in the urine bladder and jugular vein, were randomly assigned to 4 dietary levels of sodium chloride (3, 9, 14, and 19 g of Na/kg of DM) according to a triple 4 × 4 Latin square design. Cows were fed at 95 % of ad libitum intake, <b>excluding</b> <b>salt</b> addition. Milk was analyzed for MUN and protein content; urine was analyzed for total N, urea, and creatinine content; feces were analyzed for total N and DM content; and blood plasma was analyzed for urea and creatinine content. Creatinine clearance rate (CCR; L/min) and renal urea reabsorption ratio were estimated based on plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine, and total excretion of urea and creatinine in urine. Intake of DM and N, milk production, and milk protein content were (mean ± SD), on average, 21. 4 ± 1. 24 kg/d, 522 ± 32. 0 g/d, 25. 4 ± 2. 53 kg/d, and 3. 64 ± 0. 186 %, respectively. A linear relationship was found between Na intake and urine production [urine (kg/d; mean ± SE) = 7. 5 ± 4. 33 + 0. 136 ± 0. 0143 × Na intake (g/d) ] and between Na intake and MUN [MUN (mg/dL; mean ± SE) = 13. 5 ± 0. 35 - 0. 0068 ± 0. 00104 × Na intake (g/d) ]. Despite the decrease in MUN with increased Na intake, UN excretion increased linearly with Na intake. Excretion of UUN was not affected by dietary Na content. A linear plateau relationship was observed between CCR and renal urea reabsorption. An increase in CCR coincided with an increase in calculated renal urea reabsorption until a CCR breakpoint value (mean ± SD) of 1. 56 ± 0. 063 L/min was reached. We conclude that Na intake is negatively related to MUN, whereas UUN is not affected.

Median bread intakes were low at 1. 8 (1. 1, 2. 7) serves/day; 25 % consumed ≤ 1 serve/day. Although population iodine intakes improved following mandatory fortification, some had low intakes. Selenium intakes remain low. Further research should investigate thyroid function of low consumers of iodine fortified bread and/or selenium in New Zealand...|$|R
50|$|Brine pools {{are large}} areas of brine on the seabed. These pools are bodies of water that have a {{salinity}} that is {{three to five times}} greater than that of the surrounding ocean. For deep sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic extremophiles that live in this specialized biome. Brine pools are also known to exist on the Antarctic continental shelf where the source of brine is <b>salt</b> <b>excluded</b> during formation of sea ice. Deep sea and Antarctic brine pools can be toxic to marine animals. Brine pools are sometimes called seafloor lakes because the dense brine creates a halocline which does not easily mix with overlying seawater. The high salinity raises the density of the brine, which creates a distinct surface and shoreline for the pool.|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} decolourization of Acacia Seyal (Talha) Gum Arabic {{to improve its}} quality. The {{experimental}} set up consists of adsorption column made of Perspex. The adsorption media is activated charcoal of 350 m pore size. The adsorption bed is 15 cm in depth and 3. 5 cm in diameter. The experiment is conducted for wide range of Talha Gum concentrations (5. 5 - 55 g/L). The transmittance is measured for wide range of wave length (350 to 800 nm). The result showed that the colour has changed from pink to colourless-transparent. The transmittance (%) has improved by 5 to 22 % depending on the initial transmittance. The colour removal is found to have significant influence on pH, and total dissolved solid (TDS) and less influence on viscosity. The pH increased by 1 unit indicating that the impurities are of basic origin. The TDS is reduced by 20 to 50 % indicating the removal of other <b>salts</b> <b>excluding</b> Ca+ 2 and Mg+ 2 ion...|$|R
40|$|Our study aims {{to clarify}} the {{population}} nutrient status in locations with different levels of iodine in the water in China; to choose effective measurements of water improvement(finding other drinking water source of iodine not excess) or non-iodised salt supply or combinations thereof; to classify the areas of elevated water iodine levels and the areas with endemic goiter; and to evaluate the risk factors of water iodine excess on pregnant women, lactating women and the overall population of women. From Henan, Hebei, Shandong and Shanxi province of China, for each of 50 ∼ 99 µg/L, 100 ∼ 149 µg/L, 150 ∼ 299 µg/L, and ≥ 300 µg/L water iodine level, three villages were selected respectively. Students of 6 - 12 years old and pregnant were sampled from villages of each water-iodine level of each province, <b>excluded</b> iodized <b>salt</b> consumer. Then the children's goiter volume, the children and pregnant's urinary iodine and water iodine were tested. In addition, blood samples were collected from pregnant women, lactating women and other women of reproductive age for each water iodine level in the Shanxi Province for thyroid function tests. These indicators should be matched for each person. When the water iodine exceeds 100 µg/L; the iodine nutrient of children are iodine excessive, and are adequate or more than adequate for the pregnant women. It is reasonable to define elevated water iodine areas as locations where the water iodine levels exceed 100 µg/L. The supply of non-iodised salt alone cannot ensure adequate iodine nutrition of the residents, and water improvement must be adopted, as well. Iodine excess {{increases the risk of}} certain thyroid diseases in women from one- to eightfold...|$|R

40|$|Halophytes in arid and semi {{arid zones}} {{of the world}} are often {{subjected}} to extremely variable drought, salinity and temperature. These fluctuations may bring about changes in their osmoregulation and gas exchange responses besides other physiological and biochemical processes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to detect temporal changes in plant water status and osmotic adjustment in four desert halophytes viz., Suaeda fruticosa, Heliotropium curassavicum, Haloxylon stocksii and Atriplex stocksii from an inland community at Karachi University Campus. During the dry period (November to January) water and osmotic potentials of all test species increased with higher values in A. stocksii (salt secretor) than those of S. fruticosa and H. stocksii (salt includer) and H. curassavicum (<b>salt</b> <b>excluder).</b> Proline increased substantially and was highest in H. curassavicum followed by A. stocksii in comparison to the two salt includers. The lowering of osmotic potential corresponded to an increase in Na and Cl, lower stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content indicating reduced gas exchange during the dry period. The increase in proline may have little role in osmoreglation but could contribute in scavenging reactive oxygen species...|$|R
40|$|Flow of {{groundwater}} from mangrove swamp sediment to mangrove creeks {{is likely to}} be an important pathway in mangrove swamps, particularly for the removal of <b>salt</b> <b>excluded</b> at the mangrove root. The swamps are generally saturated with water, and are perforated with animal burrows, allowing significant groundwater flow to mangrove creeks to occur. The hydraulic conductivity of the sediment is thus an important physical parameter but is very difficult to measure in-situ. In this work, we describe a simple method for determining the hydraulic conductivity of mangrove sediment, including the effect of macropores such as crab burrows, which uses the existing animal burrows as piezometers. Experiments to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment were carried out in a variety of mangrove forests. It was found that hydraulic conductivity varied from around 1 to 10 m per day, which is at least 10 times greater than would be expected if there were no burrows. In order to check the validity of the method, conventional piezometers were used to determine the free water table level in an area of mangroves fringing a creek. From these measurements, hydraulic conductivity was determined independently and found to be consistent with the new methodology...|$|R
40|$|Salt-tolerant {{selected}} {{cells of}} Shamouti orange (Citrus sinensis) and Sour orange (Citrus aurantium) grew considerably better than nonselected cells at any NaCl concentration tested up to 200 millimolar. Also, the growth response of each treatment was identical {{in the two}} species. However, the performance of cells of the two species under osmotic stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is presumably a nonabsorbed osmoticum, was significantly different. The nonselected Shamouti cell lines were significantly more sensitive to osmotic stress than the selected cells. The salt adapted Shamouti cells were apparently also adapted to osmotic stress induced by PEG. In Sour orange, however, the selected lines had no advantage over the nonselected line in response to osmotic stress induced by PEG. This response was also similar quantitatively to {{the response of the}} selected salt-tolerant Shamouti cell line. It seems that the tolerance to salt in Shamouti, a partial <b>salt</b> <b>excluder,</b> involves an osmotic adaptation, whereas in Sour orange, a salt accumulator, such an adaptation apparently does not occur. PEG-induced osmotic stress causes an increase in the percent dry weight of salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant cells of both species. No such increase was found under salt stress. The size of control and stressed cells is not significantly different...|$|R
40|$|The term ‘brackish water’ is used {{in several}} senses and, therefore, I want at first to explain what I {{consider}} to be brackish water and what not. Redeke (1933) defined brackish water as a mixture of fresh water and sea water sensu stricto. This definition <b>excludes</b> the continental <b>salt</b> waters which have a different origin. There exist, however, salt waters which have lost long ago their contact with the sea and have now a chemical composition completely aberrant from sea water, due to the joint effect of continual inflow of new electrolytes with river water, evaporation, and precipitation. As examples the Caspian and the Aral Sea may be mentioned. Other investigators prefer to include on grounds of hydrological and hydrochemical similarities also the continental salt waters which at no time in their history have {{been in contact with}} the sea, e. g. the Great Salt Lake in Utah, U. S. A. They regard as brackish all salt waters which have a lower salinity than the sea. According to Schmitz (1959) the differences between the continental and marine salt waters are only of a relative value as both categories have the following four hydrological characters in common: 1. The total salinity is generally between that of fresh and sea water. 2. The waters show often salinity stratification. 3. Horizontal differences in salinity occur e. g. where a river discharges in a salt lake. 4. Large seasonal fluctuations in salinity occur...|$|R
40|$|Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Schinus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely found woody exotic species in South Florida. This exotic is {{distributed}} across environments with different hydrologic regimes, from upland pine forests to the edges of sawgrass marshes and into saline mangrove forests. To determine if this invasive exotic had different physiological attributes compared to native species in a coastal habitat, we measured predawn xylem water potentials (Ψ), oxygen stable isotope signatures (δ 18 O), and sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) contents of sap water from plants within: (1) a transition zone (between a mangrove forest and upland pineland) and (2) an upland pineland in Southwest Florida. Under dynamic salinity and hydrologic conditions, Ψ of Schinus appeared less subject to fluctuations caused by seasonality when compared with native species. Although stem water δ 18 O values could not be used to distinguish the depth of Schinus and native species 2 ̆ 7 water uptake in the transition zone, Ψ and sap Na+/K+ patterns showed that Schinus was less of a <b>salt</b> <b>excluder</b> relative to the native upland species during the dry season. This exotic also exhibited Na+/K+ ratios similar to the mangrove species, indicating some salinity tolerance. In the upland pineland, Schinus water uptake patterns were not significantly different from those of native species. Differences between Schinus and native upland species, however, may provide this exotic an advantage over native species within mangrove transition zones...|$|R
