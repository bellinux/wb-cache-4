The embroidery threads of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in backstitch while the replica uses looser <b>s-twisted</b> <b>yarn</b> and a variety of different stitches. The looser twist of the yarn {{may be one of the}} reasons that the replica sections are less well-preserved.|$|E
50|$|Although {{knitting}} may be {{done with}} ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or <b>S-twist</b> <b>yarn.</b> If the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun. The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, {{or they may be}} staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning. The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn. In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.|$|R

40|$|Two {{fragments}} of woven wool fabric that are attached {{by a single}} sewing yarn. Fragment A - yellow warp and weft. There are three hemmed edges and a brown cord tied to one corner. The cord consists of two 3 -ply <b>yarns</b> <b>S-twisted</b> together. Fragment B - yellow warp, 1. 5 cm yellow weft band, approximately 1. 5 cm red weft band. There is at least 0. 3 cm of yellow weft at the hem edge, partly turned under. There are two hemmed edges.; Dirty and very worn. Fragment A has several small interior holes and larger edge tears. Fragment B has several edge tears. Minor edge fraying...|$|R
