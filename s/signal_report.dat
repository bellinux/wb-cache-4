5000|$|An amateur radio contact, more {{commonly}} referred to as simply a [...] "contact", is an exchange of information between two amateur radio stations. The exchange usually consists of an initial call, a response by another amateur radio operator at an amateur radio station, and possibly a <b>signal</b> <b>report.</b> A contact is often referred to by the Q code QSO. It is often limited to just a minimal exchange of such station IDs. Stations who have made a contact are said to have worked each other. An operator may also say that he has worked a certain country. Amateurs use the slang expression ragchew or ragchewing to refer to an extended, informal conversation, a variation of the common idioms [...] "chewing the fat" [...] and [...] "chewing the rag". Sometimes, a contact in person, between two ham radio operators, is humorously referred to as an [...] "eyeball QSO".|$|E

40|$|Reputation {{mechanisms}} at online opinion forums, such as Amazon Reviews, elicit {{ratings from}} users about {{their experience with}} different products. Crowdsourcing applications, such as image tagging on Amazon Mechanical Turk, elicit votes from users {{as to whether or}} not a job was duly completed. An important property in both settings is that the feedback received from users (agents) is truthful. The peer prediction method introduced by Miller et al. [2005] is a prominent theoretical mechanism for the truthful elicitation of reports. However, a significant obstacle to its application is that it critically depends on the assumption of a common prior amongst both the agents and the mechanism. In this paper, we develop a peer prediction mechanism for settings where the agents hold subjective and private beliefs about the state of the world and the likelihood of a positive signal given a particular state. Our shadow peer prediction mechanism exploits temporal structure in order to elicit two reports, a belief report and then a <b>signal</b> <b>report,</b> and it provides strict incentives for truthful reporting as long as the effect an agent’s signal has on her posterior belief is bounded away from zero. Alternatively, this technical requirement on beliefs can be dispensed with by a modification in which the second report is a belief report rather than a <b>signal</b> <b>report...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abasic sites (apurinic/apyrimidinic or AP sites), {{a common}} lesion in DNA, are {{resulted}} from the cleavage of n-glycosylic bond, leaving deoxyribose residue in DNA.

A variety of analytical methods {{have been developed for}} the determination and quantification of AP sites in DNA, including P- 32 post. labeling, LC-MS, and ELISA. In this article, we provided an overview on the recent development of the DNA AP site detection using synthetic chemical probes. Covalent chemical probes were designed and synthesized which showed high specificity toward a particular AP site structure. <b>Signal</b> <b>report</b> groups were directly attached to the probe either, or indirectly by affinity reactions. Alternatively, non. covalent probes with signal groups rely on the weak (hydrogen. bonding, electrostatic, base stacking) interactions with the AP site and the consequent signal modulation. In addition, the AP sites have been explored as a recognition element in the detection of small molecules and SNPs...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{functional}} proteomics technology called PEP(Protein Elution Plate) {{was developed}} to separate complex proteomes from natural sources and analyze protein functions systematically. The technology {{takes advantage of the}} powerful resolution of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -D Gels). The modification of electrophoretic conditions in combination with a high-resolution protein elution plate supports the recovery of functionally active proteins. As 2 DE(2 -Dimensional Electrophoresis) resolution can be limited by protein load, we investigated the use of bead based enrichment technologies, called AlbuVoid™ and KinaSorb™ to determine their effect on the proteomic features which can be generated from the PEP platform. Using a variety of substrates and enzyme activity assays, we report on the benefits of combining bead based enrichment to improve the <b>signal</b> <b>report</b> and the features generated for Hexokinase, Protein Kinase, Protease, and Alkaline Phosphatase activities. As a result, the PEP technology allows systematic analysis of large enzyme families and can build a comprehensive picture of protein function from a complex proteome, providing biological insights that could otherwise not be observed if only protein abundances were analyzed...|$|E

40|$|A <b>signal</b> <b>report</b> of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2003 {{stated that}} {{profound}} changes were needed in how health systems are designed, and postulated that such redesign {{could not take}} place without properly preparing health care professionals {{to take on this}} task. It established a set of core competencies (competence in patient-centered care, interdisciplinary teaming, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, and informatics) that future professionals should possess. The current study was conducted {{to determine the extent to}} which these core competencies have been incorporated into curricula by colleges/schools of allied health. A survey was e-mailed to 112 institutional representatives of the member institutions of the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions for completion online. Thirty (26. 8 %) responded, and results were tabulated by Zoomerang software. Results indicated high desire to integrate the competencies and moderate to strong success in doing so. Most often, the competencies were included via integration throughout the curriculum, and rarely in standalone courses. This curriculum integrative approach makes sense, in the opinion of the author, as it has students apply the recommended competencies in concert with each other to various areas of content and scenarios rather than applying each in isolation within single standalone courses...|$|E
40|$|Startle reflex {{eliciting}} stimuli {{presented at}} the onset of the go signal in a simple forewarned reaction time (RT) task (at a SOA of 0 ms) elicit larger blink reflexes than do stimuli presented later (e. g., at a SOA of 150 ms) or during inter trial intervals. The present study investigated whether this facilitation is affected by attention to the go signal or motor preparation. Participants performed a forewarned reaction time task that crossed the requirements for a speeded response (Hold versus Move) and for a discrimination task performed with the go <b>signal</b> (<b>Report</b> versus No report). Relative to control reflexes, blinks elicited at a SOA of 0 ms were facilitated and blinks elicited at a SOA of 150 ms were inhibited. RTs were slower on trials that required attention to the go signal and in both attention conditions and at both SOAs shortened in the presence of a blink-eliciting stimulus. However, neither attention to the go signal nor motor preparation affected blink facilitation at the 0 ms SOA. This finding suggests that the blink reflex facilitation observed at a SOA of 0 ms with the onset of a go signal reflects on the summation of sub- and supra-threshold activations of the startle pathway.

40|$|The Highway Capacity Manual {{uses the}} arrival type (AT) as a {{mechanism}} {{to account for the}} quality of traffic signal coordination in the calculation of delay at a signalized intersection. Although there is much discussion in the literature regarding the accuracy and precision of this approach, the AT parameter provides a simple mechanism for grading the performance of traffic signal coordination. This paper describes data collection limitations of current traffic signal controllers and proposes a procedure where the AT parameter can be calculated by traffic signal controllers in real time. Given that the nation received a score of 61 out of a possible 100 points for coordinated systems on the National Traffic <b>Signal</b> <b>Report</b> Card, this method is particularly timely as it provides an easily obtainable quantitative measure of traffic signal coordination. Data from a coordinated system in Noblesville, Ind., is analyzed and presented in a format {{that can be used to}} assess arterial performance. Results from the test site show that the quality of progression of the northbound approach was “favorable” to “highly favorable” during the p. m. coordinated period (peak direction) and “random” to “favorable” during the a. m. coordinated period (off-peak direction). As expected, the quality of progression for the northbound approach during noncoordinated periods and the southbound approach (which is approximately 1. 6 km from the nearest upstream signal) during all periods was generally found to be “random. ...|$|E
