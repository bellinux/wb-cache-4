50|$|However, {{almost all}} vendors have {{proprietary}} extensions that resolve {{some of this}} issue: they aggregate multiple physical switches into one logical switch. In 2012, the IEEE standardized this feature in IEEE 802.1aq. The Split multi-link trunking (SMLT) protocol allows multiple Ethernet links to be split across multiple switches in a stack, preventing any single point of failure, and additionally allowing all switches to be load balanced across multiple aggregation switches from the single access stack. These devices synchronize state across an Inter-Switch Trunk (IST) such that they appear to the connecting (access) device to be a single device (<b>switch</b> <b>block)</b> and prevent any packet duplication. SMLT provides enhanced resiliency with sub-second failover and sub-second recovery for all speed trunks (10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, 1,000 Mbit/s, and 10 Gbit/s) while operating transparently to end-devices.|$|E
40|$|An FPD {{switch module}} M with w {{terminals}} {{on each side}} {{is said to be}} universal if every set of nets satisfying the dimensional constraint (i. e., the number of nets on each side of M is at most w) is simultaneously routable through M [8]. Chang, Wong, and Wong have identified a class of universal <b>switch</b> <b>blocks</b> in [8]. In this paper, we consider the design and routing problems for another popular model of switch modules called switch matrices. Unlike <b>switch</b> <b>blocks,</b> we prove that there exist no universal switch matrices. Nevertheless, we present quasi-universal switch matrices which have the maximum possible routing capacities among all switch matrices of the same size, and show that their routing capacities converge to those of universal <b>switch</b> <b>blocks.</b> Each of the quasi-universal switch matrices of size w has a total of only 14 w Γ 20 (14 w Γ 21) switches if w is even (odd), w ? 1, compared to a fully populated one which has 3 w 2 Γ 2 w switches.

5000|$|Languages {{derived from}} C, and more {{generally}} those influenced by Fortran's computed GOTO, instead feature fallthrough, where control {{moves to the}} matching case, and then execution continues ("falls through") to the statements associated with the next case in the source text. This also allows multiple values to match the same point without any special syntax: they are just listed with empty bodies. Values can be special conditioned with code in the case body. In practice, fallthrough is usually prevented with a [...] keyword {{at the end of}} the matching body, which exits execution of the <b>switch</b> <b>block,</b> but this can cause bugs due to unintentional fallthrough if the programmer forgets to insert the [...] statement. This is thus seen by many as a language wart, and warned against in some lint tools. Syntactically, the cases are interpreted as labels, not blocks, and the switch and break statements explicitly change control flow. Some languages influenced by C, such as JavaScript, retain default fallthrough, while others remove fallthrough, or only allow it in special circumstances. Notable variations on this in the C-family include C#, in which all blocks must be terminated with a [...] or [...] unless the block is empty (i.e. fallthrough is used as a way to specify multiple values).|$|E

40|$|As in {{traditional}} ASIC technologies, FPGA routing usually {{consists of two}} steps: global routing and detailed routing.

In particular, the routing congestion information of a <b>switch</b> <b>block</b> essentially is still measured by the numbers of available rows and columns in the <b>switch</b> <b>block.</b> Since the internal architecture of a <b>switch</b> <b>block</b> decides what can route through the block, the traditional measure of routing capacity is no longer accurate.

40|$|As the {{complexity}} of integrated circuits increases, {{the ability to make}} post-fabrication changes to fixed ASIC chips will become more and more attractive. This ability can be realized using programmable logic cores. These cores are blocks of programmable logic that can be embedded into a fixed-function ASIC or a custom chip. Such cores differ from stand-alone FPGAs in that they can take on a variety of shapes and sizes. With this in mind, we investigate the detailed routing characteristics of rectangular programmable logic cores. We quantify the effects of having different x and y channel capacities, and show that the optimum ratio between the x and y channel widths for a rectangular core is between 1. 2 and 1. 5. We also present a new <b>switch</b> <b>block</b> family optimized for rectangular cores. Compared to a simple extension of an existing <b>switch</b> <b>block,</b> our new architecture leads to an 8. 7 % improvement in density with little effect on speed. Finally, we show that if the channel widths and <b>switch</b> <b>block</b> are chosen carefully the penalty for using a rectangular core (compared to a square core with the same logic capacity) is small; for a core with an aspect ratio of 2 : 1, the area penalty is 1. 6 % and the speed penalty is 1. 1 %...|$|E

40|$|Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are {{integrated}} circuits {{which can be}} programmed to implement virtually any digital circuit. This programmability provides a low-risk, low-turnaround time option for implementing digital circuits. This programmability comes at a cost, however.
