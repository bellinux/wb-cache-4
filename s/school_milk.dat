The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected {{to serve as a}} Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free <b>school</b> <b>milk</b> from the Borough's children which was happening {{as the result of the}} policy of Margaret Thatcher, then Secretary of State for Education.|$|E

A significant amount of anti-poverty legislation was passed by Congress, including increases in social security benefits and in the minimum wage, several housing bills, and aid to economically distressed areas. A few antirecession public works packages, together with a number of measures designed to assist farmers, were introduced. Major expansions and improvements were made in Social Security (including retirement at 62 for men), hospital construction, library services, family farm assistance and reclamation. Food stamps for low-income Americans were reintroduced, food distribution to the poor was increased, and there was an expansion in <b>school</b> <b>milk</b> and school lunch distribution. The most comprehensive farm legislation since 1938 was carried out, with expansions in rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, farm credit, and marketing orders. In September 1961, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established as the focal point in government for the “planning, negotiation, and execution of international disarmament and arms control agreements.” Altogether, the New Frontier witnessed the passage of a broad range of important social and economic reforms.|$|E

In October 1945 she went to Germany to report on how the destroyed German education system could best be reactivated. She was astonished by the speed with which, five months after its defeat, the country's schools and universities were reopening. Other trips included visits to Gibraltar, Malta and Czechoslovakia. In November 1945 she chaired an international conference in London that led to the establishment, a year later, of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). In one of her final speeches in parliament, on 22 November 1946, she emphasised that UNESCO stood for [...] "standards of value... putting aside the idea that only practical things matter". She prophesied that the organisation [...] "will do great things", and urged the government to give it its full backing.|$|E

He also left behind him an outline budget which some observers found surprisingly hard-line in its proposals for control of public spending. This included the infamous abolition of free <b>school</b> <b>milk,</b> which became the first significant Ministerial act of the new Education Secretary and future Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher; she would {{come to be known as}} [...] "Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher", as a result.|$|E

As a result of the squeeze in the education budget, Thatcher ended the provision of free <b>school</b> <b>milk</b> for 8- to 11-year-olds (it had already been ended for other children by Harold Wilson); the tabloid press christened her [...] "Margaret Thatcher: Milk Snatcher" [...] (Harold Wilson, a Labour prime minister, had received no criticism) Despite these measures, the Heath Government encouraged a significant increase in welfare spending, and Thatcher blocked Macleod's other posthumous Education policy: the abolition of the Open University, which had recently been founded by the preceding Labour Government.|$|E
