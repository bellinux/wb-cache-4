Usually the upper limbs {{are not fully}} formed and sections of the [...] "hands and arms may be missing." [...] Short arm bones, fused fingers, and missing thumbs will often occur. Legs and feet are also affected similarly to the arms and hands. Individuals with phocomelia will often lack thigh bones, and the hands or feet may be abnormally small or appear as stumps due to their close [...] "attachment to the body."According to NORD, individuals carrying phocomelia syndrome will generally show {{symptoms of}} growth retardation previous to and after birth. The syndrome can also cause <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in infants.

40|$|ObjectivesTo date, {{there is}} no {{validated}} tool allowing the assessment of cognitive and motor capacities of patients with polyhandicap (PLH) because of their profound and multiple disabilities because of their <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and motor handicaps, {{as well as their}} extremely low possibilities to communicate. However, as these patients hardly ever reach the cognitive and motor development of infants older than two years, we hypothesized the level of their development may be assessed by means of an adapted version of the Brunet-Lézine (BL) Scale. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the relevance of the use of the Brunet-Lézine Scale among PLH patients. PatientsForty patients (21 males and 19 females aged 4 to 54) were enrolled in two specialized French Rehabilitation Centers. They were all PLH patients with a combination of motor (pyramidal, extra pyramidal, cerebellar, neuromuscular) deficiencies and a profound mental retardation (IQ could not be assessed); they fully depended on caregivers for their everyday needs (FIM< 30) and they had a very restricted mobility (GMFCS II to V). MethodsThe relevance of the use of Brunet-Lézine Scale among PLH patients was first assessed by describing the distribution of patients’ scores on the four dimensions of the scale. Then the structure of the scale was verified and the convergence of the scores at this scale with other relevant – while not sufficient – scores was assessed: FIM, GMFCS, and a clinical evaluation of sociability and verbalization by another independent caregiver. ResultsPLH patients tend to present low scores on the Brunet-Lézine Scale, which correspond to early developmental stages. Among PLH patients, it sounds more relevant to group the four dimensions of the Brunet-Lézine into two factors: motor activity (posture and coordination) and social interactions (language and sociability). Discussion/conclusionConvergence analyses suggest that the motor and social development of PLH patients may be reliably estimated by means of the Brunet-Lézine Scale...|$|R
5000|$|Penrose's [...] "Colchester Survey" [...] of 1938 was the {{earliest}} serious attempt {{to study the}} genetics of mental retardation. He found that the relatives of patients with <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> retardation were usually unaffected {{but some of them}} were affected with similar severity to the original patient, whereas the relatives of patients with mild mental retardation tended mostly to have mild or borderline disability. Penrose went on to identify and study many of the genetic and chromosomal causes of mental retardation (then called <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency).</b> This body of work culminated in the book, The Biology of Mental Defect (Sidgwick and Jackson, Ltd., London, UK, 1949).|$|R

We {{report on a}} further case of a patient showing the PWS phenotype with the AS molecular defect. Despite the PWS phenotype, the DNA methylation analysis of SNRPN revealed an AS pattern. Cytogenetic and FISH analysis showed normal chromosomes 15 and microsatellite analysis showed heterozygous loci {{inside and outside the}} 15 q 11 - 13 region.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the educational records of 36 children who met {{all or most of}} the criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and who were referred to special education in Anchorage, Fairbanks, or Juneau (Alaska) school districts. Thirty of the children were found to have medical comorbidities independent of the findings generally associated with FAS and which by themselves could explain the special education and related services they received. Qualifying conditions for children varied widely and included speech impairment (34 percent), mental retardation (20 percent), pre-school disabilities (14 percent), learning disability (20 percent), serious emotional disturbance (6 percent), and multiple disabilities (6 percent). The types of services received were similarly varied. Intelligence and achievement results varied from high average to <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The study found that there is no consistent pattern of educational deficit or service requirement associated with FAS. Results also suggest that factors other than in-utero alcohol exposure, including exposure to other in-uter...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and the function of central nervous system depend on thyroid hormones. In humans, the lack of thyroid hormones causes cretinism, a syndrome of <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency.</b> It is assumed that thyroid hormones affect the normal {{development and}} function of the brain by activating or suppressing target gene expression because several genes expressed in the brain {{have been shown to}} be under thyroid hormone control. Among these, the Rhes gene, encoding a small GTP-binding protein, is predominantly expressed in the striatal region of the brain. To clarify the role of Rhes in vivo, we disrupted the Rhes gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells and generated mice homozygous for the Rhes null mutation (Rhes/). Rhes/ mice were viable but weighed less than wild-type mice. Furthermore, they showed behavioral abnormalities, displaying a gender-dependent increase in anxiety levels and a clear motor coordination deficit but no learning or memory impairment. These results suggest that Rhes disruption affects selected behavioral competencies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTen {{percent of}} cases of {{intellectual}} deficiency in boys are caused by genes located on the X chromosome. X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) includes more than 200 syndromes and 80 genes identified to date. The fragile X syndrome is the most frequent syndrome, due to a dynamic mutation with a CGG triplet amplification. Mental retardation is virtually always present. Phonological and syntactic impairments are often combined with pragmatic language impairment and visuospatial reasoning difficulties. A minority fulfill the criteria for autism. In girls, the clinical expression of the complete mutation varies according to the X chromosome inactivation profile. Several XLMR occur as severe early onset encephalopathies: Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome, ATR-X syndrome (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked), Allan-Herdon-Dudley syndrome (MCT 8 gene). Two genes, ARX (X-LAG; Partington syndrome) and MECP 2 (Rett syndrome in females; mild MR with spastic diplegia/psychotic problems in males) are associated with various phenotypes, according to the mutation involved. Oligophrenine 1 (OPHN- 1) gene mutations lead to vermal dysplasia. PQBP 1 gene mutations (Renpenning syndrome) are responsible for moderate to <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency,</b> microcephaly, and small stature. Although some forms of XLMR are not very specific and the phenotype for each given gene is somewhat heterogeneous, a clinical diagnostic strategy is emerging...|$|E
40|$|Alfabetizar e letrar pessoas jovens e adultas constitui uma necessidade e, no caso de indivíduos adultos com deficiência mental, os estudos a respeito de letramento são rarefeitos e demandam, por isso, mais pesquisas e ações políticas que possam modificar as condições desses indivíduos. Letramento significa compreender e elaborar a linguagem e fazer uso social dela em várias situações da vida prática. Nesta pesquisa, objetivou-se comparar o grau de letramento, o nível de compreensão de leitura e produção escrita de adultos deficientes mentais, considerados alfabetizados, antes e depois de um programa de práticas de letramento. Estudou-se, também, a influência da família no nível de compreensão de leitura e escrita dos sujeitos. Participaram da pesquisa 11 sujeitos classificados, por meio de avaliação psicológica, como deficientes mentais moderados ou severos, com idade entre 18 e 34 que eram considerados alfabetizados e tinham freqüentado programa de educação especial por 5 anos ou mais. Foram aplicados questionários aos responsáveis pelos alunos para verificar as suas condições de letramento das famílias. A partir da avaliação inicial, elaborou-se um programa de práticas de letramento, realizado duas vezes por semana, durante 8 meses para que os sujeitos ampliassem o uso social da leitura e escrita. A cada sessão era feito um registro em diário de campo e {{realizadas}} algumas filmagens esporádicas para posterior análise. Os resultados mostraram que, apesar de serem considerados alfabetizados, os sujeitos dessa pesquisa tinham pouco domínio do uso social da leitura e escrita e que o grau de letramento das famílias influenciavam o acesso à leitura e escrita e, conseqüentemente, o seu uso social. Ao final das análises, pode se afirmar que, por meio da mediação pedagógica, houve o desenvolvimento de uma postura mais reflexiva sobre a leitura e a escrita e a pesquisa contribuiu para algumas mudanças na realidade dos sujeitos nela inseridos. Pode-se afirmar que a educação formal, por meio da mediação, contribui para a formação social da mente. Literacy {{and learning}} {{to read and write}} are a need for young people and adults. Studies on the theme with mentally deficient adults are scarce and require more research and policies that may modify these subjects. Learning to read and write means the understanding and the molding of the language, using it socially in several and different situations of daily life. Current research compares the reading-writing degree, reading comprehension level and writing production by mentally deficient literate adults, prior to and after a battery of reading-writing practices. The familyś influence on the reading and writing comprehension level of the subjects has also been analyzed. Eleven subjects, with moderate or <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> <b>deficiency,</b> aged between 18 and 34 years old, participated in the research. They had already taken part in special education programs for five years or over. Questionnaires, handed out to people who were responsible for the above-mentioned subjects, verified their familiesŕeading-writing conditions. A program with reading-writing practices was then prepared from this initial evaluation. The program was put into practice twice a week for 8 months so that the subjects could broaden the social usage of writing and reading. A report was made for each session and sporadic filming was undertaken for further investigation. Results showed that, {{in spite of the fact}} that they were literate, the subjects of research had only slight dominion of the social usage of writing and reading. Moreover, the familiesŕeading-writing degree affected their access to reading and writing, and thus, the social use of language. Analyses revealed that a more reflexive stance on reading and writing could be developed through pedagogical intervention. Actually the research has contributed towards certain change in the daily life of the subjects. Formal education actually contributes for the mindś social training through pedagogical mediation...|$|E
