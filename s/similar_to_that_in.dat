5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E
5|$|Crime in Paris is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{most large}} cities. Violent crime is {{relatively}} {{rare in the}} city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Judiciary Act of 1789 took effect, Attorney General Edmund Randolph proposed, {{in a report}} to the House of Representatives, a {{criminal}} appeal <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> England: a writ of error as of right in non-capital cases, and no writs of error in capital cases. Randolph's report was referred to the Committee of the Whole, which took no action.|$|E
5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another {{battle between}} the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Mortimer {{applied to}} switch to the Netherlands {{national}} team; since her mother is from that country, she has dual citizenship. In June 2014, the Hamilton Spectator reported the change. Although day-to-day funding in the Netherlands is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Canada, the former offers prize money; in the 2012 Paralympics, Mortimer would have won $60,000 for her gold medals alone. She will train in Amersfoort.|$|E
5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E

5|$|Mainstream American cuisine is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> other Western countries. Wheat is {{the primary}} cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain {{products}} made of wheat flour and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. These home grown foods {{are part of a}} shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.|$|E
5|$|Medieval: Total War {{features}} a multiplayer game mode <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Shogun: Total War, where players {{can engage in}} real-time battles with up to seven other players. Players create and control armies from the factions available in the game, where players can use them to compete in online tournaments or casual battles. The campaign mode cannot be played multiplayer; this feature was later added to the Total War series in Empire: Total War – but only at the beta stage, before being later removed.|$|E
5|$|Termites have a ten-segmented abdomen {{with two}} plates, the tergites and the sternites. The tenth {{abdominal}} segment has {{a pair of}} short cerci. There are ten tergites, of which nine are wide and one is elongated. The reproductive organs {{are similar to those}} in cockroaches but are more simplified. For example, the intromittent organ is not present in male alates, and the sperm is either immotile or aflagellate. However, Mastotermitidae termites have multiflagellate sperm with limited motility. The genitals in females are also simplified. Unlike in other termites, Mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor, a feature strikingly <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> female cockroaches.|$|E

On 15 July 1901, Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company with himself as managing director and raised £1million {{to carry out the}} electrification, including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock. Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a track level conductor rail <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.|$|E
5|$|The double drummer has a disjunct distribution, found from {{northern}} tropical Queensland, near Shiptons Flat and Cooktown south to Ingham and Sarina, {{and then from}} Gympie in southeastern Queensland to Moruya in southern New South Wales. It is found in areas of higher elevation in the northern segment of its range, as the climate there is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> southeast Queensland. Walter Wilson Froggatt and Robert John Tillyard erroneously included South Australia in its distribution.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role of molybdenum in living organisms is as a metal heteroatom at the active site in certain enzymes. In bacterial nitrogen fixation, the nitrogenase enzyme involved in the terminal step of reducing molecular nitrogen usually contains molybdenum in the active site (though replacement of molybdenum with iron or vanadium is also known). The structure of the catalytic center of the enzyme is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> iron-sulfur proteins: it incorporates a Fe4S3 and multiple MoFe3S3 clusters.|$|E

5|$|The {{technology}} {{of everyday life}} is not well recorded, but archaeological evidence shows it to have been <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England. Recently evidence has been found of watermills in Pictland and kilns were used for drying kernels of wheat or barley, not otherwise easy in the changeable, temperate climate. Although constructed in earlier times, brochs, roundhouses and crannogs remained in use into and beyond the Pictish period.|$|E
5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system was very <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled {{the value of the}} avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E
