5|$|The Emperor first {{appeared}} in The Empire Strikes Back. He appears in hologram form to address Darth Vader, his Sith apprentice. He tells Vader that Luke Skywalker is becoming a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Empire and must not become a Jedi. Vader convinces him that Luke {{would be a great}} asset if turned to the dark side.|$|E
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdist Rebellion {{broke out}} in 1881 when a {{religious}} leader, the self-proclaimed Mahdi, declared a jihad against the Egyptian government, which had been subject to British domination since {{the construction of the}} Suez Canal around a decade earlier. Leveraging widespread resentment towards European influence in Egypt and preaching renewal of the Islamic faith, the Mahdi began to accumulate followers and soon presented a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government. Early Egyptian-led efforts to suppress the movement failed spectacularly, and their humiliating defeat {{at the hands of the}} outnumbered, outgunned, and undersupplied Mahdist force only increased their leader's fame and reputation.|$|E

5|$|The first {{persecution}} by an emperor occurred under Nero, and {{was confined}} {{to the city of}} Rome. Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD64, some among the population held Nero responsible and that the emperor attempted to deflect blame onto the Christians. After Nero, a major persecution occurred under the emperor Domitian and a persecution in 177 took place at Lugdunum, the Gallo-Roman religious capital. A surviving letter from Pliny the Younger, governor of Bythinia, to the emperor Trajan describes his persecution and executions of Christians. The Decian persecution of 246–251 was a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Church, but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance. Diocletian undertook what was to be the most severe persecution of Christians, lasting from 303 to 311.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E
5|$|A few British leaders, {{particularly}} Lord Mountbatten, {{the last}} British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely {{states to the}} British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that {{the integration of the}} princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage the wounds of partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress.|$|E

5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{regarded}} the second Pittsburgh convention as a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{operation of the}} laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned down some of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.|$|E
5|$|The nation enjoyed great {{international}} prestige {{during the}} final years of the Empire, and it had become an emerging power within the international arena. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful. The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil, with little support in the provinces. The combination of republican ideas and the dissemination of Positivism among the army's lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monarchy. They dreamed of a dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the monarchy.|$|E
50|$|Painted {{honeyeaters}} {{are threatened}} by habitat loss. Listed as vulnerable in several states and territories in Australia, fragmentation and land clearing of areas which provide habitat for the painted honeyeater pose <b>serious</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> survival of this species.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> most <b>serious</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{survival}} of Oahu tree snails are predation by the introduced carnivorous snail Euglandina rosea, predation by rats (Rattus exulans, Rattus norvegicus, Rattus rattus), {{and loss of}} habitat due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spread of non-native vegetation into higher elevation forests.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> most <b>serious</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park come principally from hydrocarbon-related activities; seismic {{prospecting}} in the Bañados, drilling for petroleum in Ustarez and the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipelines, {{followed by the}} expansion of agricultural and cattle-ranching landuse; illegal commercial hunting and the diversion of the river Parapeto for agricultural purposes.|$|R
5|$|Several causes {{provoked}} a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, {{who used to}} consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population {{is estimated to be}} less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 20 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals. Consequently, there is low genetic variability.|$|E

Some {{of the most common}} food or waterborne diseases include diarrhea (bacterial and protozoal), hepatitis A, and typhoid fever, all of which pose <b>serious</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> communities. Malaria and dengue fever is also very common.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the past}} century tiger numbers have fallen dramatically, with a {{decreasing}} population trend.

25|$|Although {{nominally}} {{a constitutional}} monarchy, Thailand was {{ruled by a}} series of military governments, most prominently led by Phibun, interspersed with brief periods of democracy. Thailand took part in the Korean War. Communist Party of Thailand guerrilla forces operated inside the country from the early-1960s to 1987. They included 12,000 full-time fighters at the peak of movement, but never posed a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state.|$|E
25|$|The first {{congress}} of the party took place in Lisbon in November 1923, with Carlos Rates as leader.

50|$|The Hadza, or Hadzabe, are an {{indigenous}} ethnic group in north-central Tanzania, living around Lake Eyasi {{in the central}} Rift Valley and in the neighboring Serengeti Plateau. The Hadza number just under 1,000.

25|$|As the {{situation}} in the capital declined, various groups {{in different parts of the}} empire took advantage of this period of weakness. In Tabaristan a Zaydi dynasty came to power in 864. In 868 the Turk Ahmad ibn Tulun gained control of Egypt and gradually asserted his independence from Samarra. In Lower Iraq and Khuzistan, the Zanj Rebellion began in 869 and posed a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid Caliphate in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Huguenots became {{organised}} as {{a definitive}} political movement thereafter. Protestant preachers rallied a considerable army and a formidable cavalry, which {{came under the}} leadership of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny. Henry of Navarre and the House of Bourbon allied with the Huguenots, adding wealth and holdings to the Protestant strength. At its height, they controlled sixty fortified cities and posed a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Catholic crown and Paris over the next three decades.|$|E
25|$|Die-off {{can affect}} {{several species of}} cordgrass (genus Spartina), {{including}} S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, and S. townsendii. There are several competing hypotheses predicting the causes and mechanisms of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. These hypotheses place different emphasis {{on the effects of}} top-down or bottom-up processes for salt marsh die-off. Combined with salt marsh dieback of the high marsh, salt marsh die-off is a <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ecosystem services that marshes provide to local coastal communities.|$|E
