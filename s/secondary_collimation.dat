40|$|A {{current issue}} with the LHC {{collimation}} system is single-diffractive, off-energy protons from the primary collimators that pass completely through the <b>secondary</b> <b>collimation</b> system and are absorbed immediately downbeam in the cold magnets of the dispersion suppressor section. Simulations suggest that the high impact rate could result in quenching of these magnets. We have studied replacing the 60 cm primary graphite collimators, which remove halo mainly by inelastic strong interactions, with 5. 25 mm tungsten, which remove halo mainly by multiple coulomb scattering and thereby reduce the rate of single-diffractive interactions that cause losses in the dispersion suppressor...|$|E
40|$|The {{limiting}} {{location of}} the present LHC machine in terms of losses on cold magnets are the dispersion suppressors downstream of the betatron collimation insertion (IR 7). These losses are dominated by off-energy protons that have by-passed the upstream <b>secondary</b> <b>collimation</b> system but are lost where the dispersion starts to rise. A solution under consideration for intercepting these losses is the addition of new collimators in the dispersive area. This paper discusses first a proposition for the new layout in the DS, where space is made for the new collimators by replacing an existing dipole by shorter and stronger magnets. Furthermore, simulations with SixTrack are presented, which quantify the gain in cleaning from the new collimators...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effects of collimation designs on the depth dose distribution of close energy electron beams for two different linear accelerators (LINACs) with different types of <b>secondary</b> <b>collimation</b> systems. METHODS: Saturne- 42 (trimmer) and Oncor (cone) linear accelerators were used for the study. Depth dose measurements were done at constant SSD with solid water phantom and plane-parallel ionization chamber. RESULTS: Depth dose distributions for both LINACs with the same nominal energies (9 - 12 MeV) and same incident mean energies (8. 1 - 10. 8 MeV) on phantom surface were found to be different. The discrepancies of the depth dose distribution curves were increased, with an increasing difference in incident mean energy. CONCLUSION: The current study shows that the depth dose parameters may vary between two different LINACs for electron beams although the same nominal energy is used. If differences are not within acceptable ranges, the machines should not be used in place of each other...|$|E
30|$|Electronic {{collimation}} {{does not}} only result in unnecessary exposure, it also causes areas to be {{hidden from view}} on the final digital image. Goske et al. [10] already showed {{a case of a}} stomach perforation of an infant initially missed <b>secondary</b> to electronic <b>collimation.</b> We further stress the importance of assessing the entire image with three more cases.|$|R
40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{radiation source}} {{is essential in}} studies of tissue response in animal models. This paper reports on the evaluation and commissioning of a new irradiator suitable for studies using small animals or cell culture. The Faxitron is a 160 -kVp x-ray machine that was adapted from an x-ray imaging unit through modifications to facilitate experimental irradiation. The x-ray unit is housed in a shielded cabinet, and is configured to allow multiple irradiation positions {{and a range of}} field sizes and dose rates. Use of this machine for animal irradiation requires characterisation of relevant dosimetry, and development of methodology for <b>secondary</b> beam <b>collimation</b> and animal immobilisation. In addition, due to the limitation of the irradiator, the optimal selection of three characteristics of the x-ray beam is important. These three characteristics, namely, the dose rate, the beam uniformity, and the field size are inter-dependent and the selection of a combination of these parameters is often a compromise and is dependent on the application. Two different types of experiments are selected to illustrate the applicability of the Faxitron. The Faxitron could be useful for experimental animal irradiation if the experimental design is carried out carefully to ensure that accurate and uniform radiation is delivered...|$|R
40|$|We {{link the}} lack of FR I type {{structure}} among quasars to the void of radio loud quasars below a critical disk luminosity of ~ 10 ^ 46 erg/sec in the PG sample. We argue that the opening angle of the obscuring torus in radio loud quasars depends {{on the power of}} the central engine, approaching the jet's beaming angle near the FR I/FR II break. Consequently, low power radio quasars would either be classified as radio galaxies (FR I) or strongly core-boosted (BL Lac) object, depending on the aspect angle, and no conspicuous transitional population would be expected for FR I sources. A closing torus with decreasing power would not only obscure the optical nucleus for most aspect angles but would also enhance the entrainment of the cool torus material into the jet stream, causing obscuration along the jet's periphery, as well as the jet's deceleration to form a FR I source. Above a critical luminosity, the wider torus allows for FR II type jets and visibility of the nuclear optical emission, characteristic of radio loud quasars. Apparently, at the same engine power the torus opening in radio weak quasars and Seyferts is substantially wider than in radio loud quasars, probably because of different dynamics or feeding mechanisms in disk and elliptical galaxies. This provides a clue for the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy of quasars if the the jet/torus interaction leads to injection of relativistic e^+/- pairs via p-p collisions. Strong jet/torus interaction may lead to a substantial injection of <b>secondary</b> pairs and <b>collimation</b> in radio loud quasars, while weak interaction in radio weak quasars leads neither to pair injection nor to good collimation.

40|$|The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{stores and}} collides proton and $^{ 208 }$Pb$^{ 82 +}$ beams of {{unprecedented}} energy and intensity. Thousands of superconducting magnets, operated at 1. 9 K, guide the very intense and energetic particle beams, {{which have a}} large potential for destruction. This implies the demand for a multi-stage collimation system to provide protection from beam-induced quenches or even hardware damage. In heavy-ion operation, ion fragments with significant rigidity offsets can still scatter out of the collimation system. When they irradiate the superconducting LHC magnets, the latter risk to quench (lose their superconducting property). These <b>secondary</b> <b>collimation</b> losses can potentially impose a limitation for the stored heavy-ion beam energy. Therefore, their distribution in the LHC needs to be understood by sophisticated simulations. Such simulation tools must accurately simulate the particle motion of many different nuclides in the magnetic LHC lattice and simulate their interaction with the collimators. Previous simulation tools used simplified models for the simulation of particle-matter interaction and showed discrepancies compared to the measured loss patterns. This thesis describes the development and application of improved heavy-ion collimation simulation tools. Two different approaches are presented to provide these functionalities. In the first presented tool, called STIER, fragmentation at the primary collimator is simulated with the Monte-Carlo event generator FLUKA. The ion fragments scattered out of the primary collimator are subsequently tracked as protons with ion-equivalent rigidities in the existing proton tracking tool SixTrack. This approach was used to prepare the collimator settings for the 2015 LHC heavy-ion run and its predictions allowed reducing undesired losses. More accurate simulation results are obtained with the second presented simulation tool, in which SixTrack is extended to track arbitrary heavy ions. This new tracking tool, called hiSixTrack, is actively coupled to FLUKA to simulate the interaction of heavy ions with matter. The new software is used to study the collimation performance for future LHC configurations. The simulation results are combined with experimental input from a quench test experiment to deduce potential intensity limitations and define required upgrades of the collimation system for High Luminosity LHC...|$|E
