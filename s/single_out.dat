40|$|We {{present an}} {{experiment}} investigating {{the effects of}} <b>singling</b> <b>out</b> an individual on trust and trustworthiness. We find that (a) trustworthiness falls {{if there is a}} <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> subject; (b) non-singled out subjects discriminate against the <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> subject when they are not responsible of the distinct status of this person; (c) under a negative frame, the <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> subject returns significantly less; (d) under a positive frame, the <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> subject behaves bimodally, either selecting very low or very high return rates. Overall, <b>singling</b> <b>out</b> induces a negligible effect on trust but is potentially disruptive for trustworthiness...|$|R

25|$|Occasionally, a three digit code is {{attached}} to the recipe number by hyphenation. The first digit of this code represents the year the cake was produced, and the other two numbers indicate the production number within that year. For instance, the seven digit sequence 8653-602, would indicate the second production in 2006 of factory recipe 8653. Some productions of cakes are valued over others because production numbers can indicate if a tea was produced earlier or later in a season/year. This information allows one to be able to <b>single</b> <b>out</b> tea cakes produced using a better batch of máochá.|$|E
