500|$|The video {{begins with}} Williams {{waiting for his}} laundry {{to be done in}} a store, before getting out for a walk. Meanwhile, Barlow is {{standing}} {{on the other side of}} the street. As the song starts the two of them start walking towards their cars whilst looking at each other. When they get inside, the scenes are intercut with the two of them dancing with their female partners. Later in the video, they are shown <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> having a drink whilst singing the song's words. As the second chorus starts, Williams and Barlow are at a pond, fishing and laughing. Scenes of them looking each other secretly are also shown. In the middle of [...] "Shame"'s bridge they start taking their shirts off. Shortly, they are shown climbing up a cliffs. After they get on the top they want to jump, however, they realize it's too high. Instead they hug each other and walk away as the video finishes.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] {{was shot by}} Tom Boxer in a club in Neptun, Romania. It was filmed {{in the period of}} Alessia's and Croitoru's argument over compensation, with Inna initially not appearing in it, before another version was released on 7 November 2009 incorporating footage of the singer in Turkey. The visual opens with a glass falling down in front of a black backdrop, with it breaking, and then sees Taylor mixing in a club. Following this, the focus alternates on female strippers and a group of partying people. Subsequently, a girl sporting an orange dress walks around the club, eventually drawing the attention of a male, with her <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and watching a man mixing drinks. After the group of people—including masked men—further perform to the track, the clip ends with a shot of one's white T-shirt with an unknown blue figure on it. Scenes interspersed through the main clip portray Inna posing in swimsuit during a ship trip, footage of loudspeakers or two topless men fighting sporting yellow pants.|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E

2500|$|As [...] "a genuine beatnik" [...] Hedrick was {{employed}} at a 'beatnik' bohemian <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> at Vesuvio Cafe, a famous hangout in San Francisco’s North Beach. Vesuvio Cafe employed Hedrick {{to sit in}} the window dressed in full beard, turtleneck, and sandals and create improvisational drawings and paintings.

5000|$|Aside {{from her}} past {{love affair with}} Sam Martino, there is little {{evidence}} of close personal relationships in Myka's past prior to her arrival at Warehouse 13. As we see glimpses into her past, she is portrayed as a person who is somewhat cold and distant from those around her. In the episode [...] "Age Before Beauty", we learn that Myka was the unpopular sibling, her sister being the well-liked one. In [...] "Merge with Caution", when Myka arrives at her ten-year high school reunion, she is not well remembered. While attending a reunion social gathering, we see Myka <b>sitting</b> alone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> drinking vodka tonics. Aside from a brief encounter with Kurt Smoller, there is no interaction between her and her former classmates. Myka even turns down an offer from Kurt to join the group of friends with whom he is sitting, hinting that her past association with Kurt's friends was unpleasant. In the episode [...] "The Greatest Gift" [...] we see Myka in an alternate reality, brought about by Pete's interaction with an artifact, where she is a Secret Service agent still working in Washington, D.C. Pete finds Myka sitting alone in a bar on Christmas Eve and tries to convince her that they're partners in another reality. Pete tells her that his Myka is surrounded by people who love her, to which she responds, [...] "I have friends", but it is clear Myka realizes that she really doesn't have any true friends.|$|R
5000|$|Having {{grown up}} in New York City, {{the only child of}} {{divorced}} parents, Rudolf has stated that he has found greater inspiration and a stronger sense of belonging in his adopted city of Miami. Rudolf first lived temporarily in Miami while doing session work with producer Timbaland. After relocating to Los Angeles in 2010 while writing and producing for several artists, Rudolf returned to New York for a brief time in 2012 to begin work on his upcoming album. He missed living in Miami and later that year made it his permanent residence. In the documentary Ferraris and Helicopters, Rudolf explained his attraction to the city. [...] "When I moved down to Miami it was like moving to another planet because I was so used to New York, the energy and the craziness and everything. I came down here, I really didn't know too many people. I would go to this place called the Greek Place for breakfast, and I sort of found myself <b>sitting</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> talking to <b>the</b> old retirees, South American people, Orthodox Jews-and the local Floridians,and it became part of my daily life. I don't know how it happened. I just started hanging out and having conversations. I still talk to all those people, a lot of them when I go back there. It's cool because it gave me the feeling of a hometown rooting for you. Because I grew up in New York, and it's not really that hometown rooting for you kind of thing, it's more like everybody's just trying to do their own thing." ...|$|R
50|$|Affirmations {{begins with}} a gay, black man recounting his first night with a lover. The man’s name is Reginald T. Jackson. The story begins with Jackson <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> a <b>bar.</b> <b>The</b> man <b>sitting</b> next to him wanted to pick him up, but Jackson {{did not want to}} go. When the man began to cry as he remembered a past lover, Jackson gave in and allowed himself to go home with the other man. They ended up making love the next morning. Jackson says, “It was the best {{experience}} I have ever had.” Affirmations moves from Jackson’s story to Harlem’s African American Freedom Day. African American Freedom Day is a parade celebrating African American tradition. Affirmations documentation of the parade begins with mainstream images of Black culture. Drums, flutes and African American war veterans are all shown marching down the street in the parade. Portraits of Martin Luther King Jr., Frederick Douglass and Malcolm X are filmed floating {{down the center of the}} parade. Then a group of gay, black men come down the parade line. They are shouting, “Homophobia has to go!”They are followed by the Minority Task Force on AIDS. The film then documents a black man yelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pro-gay African American group from the side of the street. He screams, “You are not part of the African tradition.” The following messages are then displayed in text on the screen: I dream a world where homosex, desire, affection, love, no longer invite prosecution. I dream an end to silences that kill. I dream a slave song, a freedom anthem, voices, ancient, yet alive, lifting my life, yours, to new visions of liberation. I dream freedom, no longer needing to ask or witness what happens to dreams deferred? As the text fades out the film concludes with gay African Americans expressing their dreams for kinship and the right to be included in the Black community. While they reveal their wishes, Hallelujah! plays in the background.|$|R
