5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object <b>started</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
