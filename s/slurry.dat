5|$|Advanced systems {{played a}} key role in the rig's operation, from {{pressure}} and drill monitoring technology, to automated shutoff systems and modelling systems for cementing. The OptiCem cement modelling system, used by Halliburton in April 2010, played a crucial part in cement <b>slurry</b> mix and support decisions. These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on the rig that month.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2012, the <b>slurry</b> wall for the station site was being taken down. On June 25, 2012, a $324.6 million contract was awarded to E.E. Cruz and Company and Tully Construction Company for the station's plumbing, electricity, ancillaries, and entrances. In March 2013, the bulkhead separating the new construction from the 1970s-era tunnel at 99th Street was completed.|$|E
40|$|Cement <b>slurries</b> {{become more}} and more widely {{applicable}} in reinforcing and strengthening the rock mass. The processes taking place in fresh cement <b>slurries</b> were presented and their complex character analysed. The equations describing rheological models, e. g. cement <b>slurries,</b> were given. The selected cement <b>slurries</b> were analysed in laboratory conditions for various water-cement parameters and three temperatures. The obtained results were statistically analysed and the best fit of the rheological model to the individual cement <b>slurries</b> was shown...|$|R
40|$|Herbicide {{atrazine}} easily leaches to groundwater, {{where it}} is persistent. We studied whether sonication accelerates atrazine dissipation (100 mg·L− 1) in vadose zone sediment <b>slurries.</b> Sediments were from 11. 3 to 14. 6 m depths in an atrazine-contaminated groundwater area. The <b>slurries</b> and autoclave-sterilized <b>slurries</b> were sonicated (bath, 43 kHz, 320 W) for 0, 5, 10, 20, or 30 min once/twice a day, and atrazine concentrations were followed. Atrazine concentrations raised in the sterilized <b>slurries</b> sonicated twice a day for 10 min (86. 0 ± 7. 7 mg·L− 1), while they remained low in the <b>slurries</b> (56. 6 ± 10. 9 mg·L− 1) due to microbial degradation. Twice a day sonications for 20 – 30 min did not enhance microbial atrazine degradation. Chemical dissipation may {{have occurred in the}} sterilized <b>slurries</b> sonicated twice a day for 30 min. However, sonication did not decrease atrazine concentrations below those in the non-sonicated <b>slurries</b> (55. 1 ± 7. 8 mg·L− 1) and sterilized <b>slurries</b> (67. 1 ± 7. 9 mg·L− 1). Atrazine concentrations in the sterilized <b>slurries</b> were higher than in the <b>slurries,</b> indicating changes in sediment structure and adsorption due to autoclaving. Sonication parameters needed for releasing atrazine from interactions with particles may be close to those damaging microbial cells. This suggests difficulties in enhancing microbial atrazine degradation by sonication, though chemical degradation can be enhanced...|$|R
30|$|The <b>slurrying</b> {{concentration}} of the PCWS increased first and then decreased with increasing pH from 5 to 11. An acid environment was an unfavorable factor to the <b>slurrying</b> concentration. The optimal pH to obtain best <b>slurrying</b> concentration was 9. The additives used in this work themselves possess moderate alkalinity, and their activity can be restrained in acid or strong alkali conditions, leading to worse dispersion of particles and decreased <b>slurrying</b> concentration.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site. Inside the safe were various items, including a large glass bottle containing a whitish <b>slurry</b> which was subsequently {{identified as the}} oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist. Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water <b>slurry</b> at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO donated US$3 {{million as}} a part of the costs towards the {{rehabilitation}} of Borobudur after Mount Merapi's 2010 eruption.

30|$|Figure  2 {{shows that}} the <b>slurrying</b> {{concentration}} increased first and then decreased with increasing pH and that an acid environment of pH 5 resulted in the worst <b>slurrying</b> concentration and an alkaline environment of pH 9 resulted in the best <b>slurrying</b> concentration. The {{reason is that the}} additives themselves possess moderate alkalinity, and the activity of the additives can be restrained in acid or strong alkali conditions, leading to the dispersion of particles worsened and <b>slurrying</b> concentration decreased.|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of semiconductor wafer processing liquid waste, contaminated by heavy metals, was investigated to determine arsenic content. Arsenic and gallium concentrations were determined for waste <b>slurries</b> collected from gallium arsenide (GaAs) wafer processing at three industrial sources and compared to <b>slurries</b> prepared under laboratory conditions. The arsenic and gallium content of waste <b>slurries</b> was analyzed using {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) and it is reported that the arsenic content of the waste streams {{was related to the}} wafer thinning process, with <b>slurries</b> from wafer polishing having the highest dissolved arsenic content at over 1, 900 mgL- 1. Lapping <b>slurries</b> had much lower dissolved arsenic (< 90 mgL- 1) content, but higher particulate contents. It is demonstrated that significant percentage of GaAs becomes soluble during wafer lapping. Grinding <b>slurries</b> had the lowest dissolved arsenic content at 15 mgL- 1...|$|R
5|$|When prey is swallowed, it is {{liquefied}} in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting <b>slurry</b> is wafted {{through the}} canal system by {{the beating of}} the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes in the canals may help to transport nutrients to muscles in the mesoglea. The anal pores may eject unwanted small particles, but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth.|$|E
5|$|All of the inert {{versions}} {{went from}} the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, where they were used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a <b>slurry,</b> solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a <b>slurry</b> in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E

30|$|The role of AA Without AA {{hydrates}} agglomeration {{result in}} early onset of exponential torque (or pressure drop) increase and early deviation from Newtonian rheology. This {{may be attributed}} to onset of solid concentration gradient as demonstrated from the protype setup. Use of AA minimizes agglomeration and promotes dispersed <b>slurries.</b> dispersed (homogeneous) <b>slurries</b> exhibit Newtonian rheology. Newtonian <b>slurries</b> display gradual increase in viscosity with increase in HVF. However, at high HVF, AAs fail and agglomeration occurs. <b>Slurries</b> that experience severe agglomeration flow with a radial solid concentration gradient and exhibit shear thinning rheology. This suggests that shear thinning (or non-Newtonian) behavior of hydrate <b>slurries</b> is associated with particle interaction, agglomeration and solid concentration gradient.|$|R
40|$|As the IC {{industry}} progresses {{through each}} successive technology node on the ITRS roadmap, to continually produce more demanding devices, new consumable materials {{are required to}} realize the high yields necessary for success. For the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process, silica-based <b>slurries</b> have traditionally been used at technology nodes of 90 nm and higher, for both Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) and Inner Layer Dielectric (ILD) applications. However, at 65 nm and below, cerium oxide-based <b>slurries</b> are being introduced, since these <b>slurries</b> address {{many of the issues}} resulting from the use of silica-based <b>slurries.</b> This paper presents the evolution of cerium oxide-based <b>slurries</b> from their introduction at the 130 nm and 90 nm nodes, through their current use in high volume manufacture at the 65 nm node and also, the revolution necessary for these <b>slurries</b> to be effective at the 45 nm node and below...|$|R
5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the <b>slurry</b> wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant, which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone <b>slurry,</b> which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to <b>slurry,</b> usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E
40|$|Adjusting dietary {{composition}} {{is considered an}} effective way to reduce nutrient losses to the environment. The effects of various dietary protein and energy levels on manure composition (Ca, Mg, K, Na, N, P, and pH) were studied by determining total and direct available (free) nutrient concentrations in 8 <b>slurries</b> obtained from a feeding trial. Furthermore, the effects of dietary changes on NH 3 volatilization from manure <b>slurries</b> were studied. Increasing the crude protein (CP) content of the feed (108 to 190 g/ kg of dry matter) resulted in an average increase in total N and P content of the <b>slurries</b> of 56 and 48 %, respectively. Feeding the cows more energy (5, 050 to 6, 840 kJ/kg of dry matter) increased total N and P content of the <b>slurries</b> by 27 and 39 %, respectively. Total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) amounted to 52 to 77 % of the total N content present in manure <b>slurries.</b> A low protein content or a low energy content of the diets reduced TAN concentrations in the <b>slurries</b> by 43 % (CP) or 25 % (energy). Changes in the protein content or the energy content of the feed did not significantly affect the free:total ratios of Na, Ca, and Mg content of the <b>slurries.</b> In agreement with the calculated NH 3,aq (aqueous) content, the total amount of NH 3 volatilized from manure <b>slurries</b> was much greater (on average 10 times greater) when the cows were fed greater levels of CP. Although the <b>slurries</b> contained more TAN when cows were fed diets richer in energy, NH 3 volatilization from the <b>slurries</b> was lower...|$|R

30|$|Hydrate <b>slurries</b> {{generated}} without anti-agglomerant showed {{high shear}} thinning behavior and higher viscosities compared to systems with AAs. Also, shear thinning behavior increased with increasing hydrate volume fraction. Without AA hydrates agglomeration result in early onset of exponential viscosity increase and early deviation from Newtonian rheology. Use of AAs minimize agglomeration and dispersed <b>slurries</b> exhibit Newtonian rheology. Newtonian <b>slurries</b> display gradual increase in viscosity with increase in HVF. However, at high HVF AAs fail and agglomeration occurs. <b>Slurries</b> that experience severe agglomeration flow with a radial solid concentration gradient exhibit shear thinning rheology.

When high viscosity oils were used, the resulting <b>slurries</b> exhibited less shear thinning effects and less viscosity increase with increasing hydrate volume fraction. This suggests that for the same AA dosage, AA performance is enhanced by high oil viscosity.|$|R
5|$|With the {{increase}} of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming. Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production. Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required {{the use of a}} cooked rice <b>slurry</b> (米湯) to bind the tea brick together. The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly {{stems from the fact that}} it can be more easily transported and stored.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a <b>slurry</b> of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The key for gel-casting is the {{preparation}} of ceramic aqueous <b>slurries</b> with excellent rheological properties. The effect of ammonium polyacrylate and pre-oxidation on rheological properties of Si 3 N 4 <b>slurries</b> was investigated.
