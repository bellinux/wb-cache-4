[...] "Stephen" [...] opens with layered a cappella and vocoder harmonies, later transitioning into a dominantly driven pop song. According to the singer, [...] "Stephen" [...] showcases her more vulnerable side and encompasses humor throughout its lyrics: [...] "'Stephen' shows the vulnerable <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> but it's still a funny pop song.

The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E

[...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with.

The newly named [...] "Baphomet/Housecore Records" [...] secured distribution deals with Relapse Records in August 2001. Anselmo stated [...] "What you're going to get here with Baphomet/Housecore, it's going to be different. It's going to be a fresh approach. It's {{going to be a lot}} of home made shit, not all major label-produced monstrosities. I just got permission from Elektra to independently put out all the bands that I've ever fucking done.

Yet, the belief that contradictions are always false remains deeply intuitive. This paper confronts this belief head-on by explaining in detail how one specific contradiction is true. The contradiction in question derives from Priest's reworking of Berkeley's argument for idealism. However, technical aspects of the explanation offered here differ considerably from Priest's derivation. The explanation uses novel formal and epistemological tools to guide the reader through a valid argument with, not just true, but eminently acceptable premises, to an admittedly unusual conclusion: a true contradiction. The novel formal and epistemological tools concern points of view and changes in points of view. The result is an understanding of why the contradiction is true. ...|$|R
