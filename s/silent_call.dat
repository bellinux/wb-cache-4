6000|$|... (It is sometimes, {{though less}} frequently, the case, that this {{disposition}} {{to make a}} [...] "joy of grief" [...] extends to individuals of the other sex. But in us it is even less excusable and more disgusting, because it is our nature to shun the sick and afflicted; and, unless restrained by principles other than we bring into the world with us, men might {{follow the example of}} many animals in destroying the infirm of their own species. Indeed, instances of this nature might be adduced among savage nations.) Sometimes, however, from an original lusus naturae, or from the influence of circumstances, a man becomes a haunter of death-beds, a tormentor of afflicted hearts, and a follower of funerals. Such an abomination now appeared before Fanshawe, and beckoned him into the cottage. He was considerably beyond the middle age, rather corpulent, with a broad, fat, tallow-complexioned countenance. The student obeyed his <b>silent</b> <b>call,</b> and entered the room, through the open door of which he had been gazing.|$|E

The Novellos also parted company with Dodd, replacing them with Phil Gillespie. Sam Walker, also of <b>Silent</b> <b>Call,</b> joined to play Hammond organ and the trombone.|$|E

50|$|<b>Silent</b> <b>calls,</b> <b>calls</b> {{which remain}} <b>silent</b> when answered, are often due to callers using an {{automated}} dialler to make multiple calls in rapid succession, anticipating that many {{will not be}} answered; if an operator is not {{available at the time}} a call is answered, it will be <b>silent.</b> <b>Silent</b> <b>calls,</b> while not covered by TPS, can be reported to Ofcom.|$|R

5000|$|In 2003, OFCOM {{investigated}} {{two separate}} companies who {{were believed to}} be making <b>silent</b> <b>calls.</b> They were investigated under this section of the legislation because it was believed that they were [...] "causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety". Unofficial warnings were issued, but OFCOM did not use powers given to it under the act until 3 May 2005, when it issued a [...] "notification" [...] (a official written warning) to one of the companies. The terms of the notification imposed a maximum proportion of 5% <b>silent</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Silent</b> <b>Call</b> is a 1961 American drama film {{directed}} by John A. Bushelman and written by Tom Maruzzi.

50|$|In 1920, {{director}} Laurence Trimble persuaded Murfin {{to purchase}} a German Shepherd dog—Strongheart—that became the first major canine film star. Strongheart starred in four films that Trimble directed from Murfin's screenplays: The <b>Silent</b> <b>Call</b> (1921), Brawn of the North (1922), The Love Master (1924) and White Fang (1925).|$|E
50|$|Trimble trained Strongheart and {{directed}} him in four rugged outdoor adventure films scripted by Murfin: The <b>Silent</b> <b>Call</b> (1921), Brawn of the North (1922), The Love Master (1924) and White Fang (1925). Strongheart {{became the first}} major canine film star, preceding the fame of Rin Tin Tin by two years.|$|E

50|$|Brawn of the North is a lost 1922 American silent Northwoods film. It was {{produced}} by Laurence Trimble and Jane Murfin with release through Associated First National Pictures. The film stars Irene Rich and a new canine find by Trimble named Strongheart. This was the second film starring the dog after his introduction in The <b>Silent</b> <b>Call</b> (1921).|$|E
50|$|A <b>silent</b> <b>call</b> is a {{telephone}} call that is generated by a predictive dialler (or dialler) which {{does not have an}} agent immediately available to handle the call. In this instance the call, may be terminated by the dialler, and the called party receives a silence ("dead air") or a tone from the telephone company which indicates the call has been dropped.|$|E

The European premiere (1998) was in Karlsrhue, Germany.

50|$|The UK's Direct Marketing Association {{operates}} an opt-out scheme {{through the}} Telephone Preference Service. While the service will reduce unsolicited calls {{it does not}} stop solicited calls, market research <b>calls,</b> <b>silent</b> <b>calls</b> or overseas calls.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, OFCOM did not {{indicate}} what quantity of NAA is acceptable. It is likely that most people will work to 5%, however some dishonest companies are likely to make a high quantity of NAA calls {{in the same way}} they made a high quantity of <b>silent</b> <b>calls.</b> If this occurs, then the NAA message will become as much of a nuisance as <b>silent</b> <b>calls</b> are. The only solution to this would be for either OFCOM to issue guidance on the acceptable level (and then prosecute those who go above this level), or for the government to introduce new legislation. Either way, this is an area that is extremely difficult to police.|$|R
50|$|Nuisance calls {{encompass}} {{any type}} of unwanted, unsolicited, telephone call. Common types of nuisance calls include prank calls, telemarketing <b>calls,</b> and <b>silent</b> <b>calls.</b> Obscene phone calls and other threatening calls are criminal acts in most jurisdictions, particularly when hate crime is involved.|$|R
5000|$|People using {{telecommunications}} {{devices for}} the deaf (TDDs) and calling public agencies might expect the agency being called to answer with a TTY. The caller waits for [...] "TTY tones" [...] to be generated over the phone line. The answerer should place the phone receiver into the TTY coupler and type anything ("Hello, Go Ahead") so the caller knows it is connected. For public agencies that have a TTY, it is inappropriate to hang up on a <b>silent</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
5000|$|McGuire's {{first serious}} role came as the [...] "only girl" [...] in The <b>Silent</b> <b>Call</b> (1921). She is {{probably}} best remembered today for the parts of The Girl and Betsy O'Brien, alongside Buster Keaton, in Sherlock Jr. and The Navigator (both 1924) respectively. She also starred with Gladys Walton as a second lead in Playing with Fire (1921) for Universal, {{as well as in}} The Flame of Life (1923) with Priscilla Dean. By 1930, however, her film career had ended.|$|E
5000|$|Originally titled The Misfit, {{production}} {{began in}} January 1924 in Los Angeles.

[...] After previously casting her in Three Ages, Keaton cast Marion Harlan as the lead actress, but she became sick {{and was replaced by}} up-and-coming Keystone Studios actress Kathryn McGuire, who had previously starred in The <b>Silent</b> <b>Call</b> and was a Wampas Baby Star of 1923.|$|E
50|$|This {{is often}} cited as the first film to have a female {{werewolf}} in it, but an early short <b>silent</b> <b>called</b> The Werewolf (which is indeed the first werewolf film ever made) used that plot device first, in 1913. The 1913 film is now lost.|$|R
50|$|On 17 August, MP John Hemming {{received}} confirmation from OFCOM that {{usage of}} the NAA message would not be termed a persistent misuse, {{and there is no}} widespread belief that OFCOM will conclude that the six companies it is currently investigating should stop making <b>silent</b> <b>calls</b> and use the information message instead.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{completion}} of the album, the band was signed to the record label Time Divide Records Ltd. in November 2008. This signing, and subsequent likelihood of an album release, helped in the conscription of the necessary guest vocalists such as Nils K. Rue of Pagan's Mind and Andi Kravljaca of <b>Silent</b> <b>Call</b> (ex Seventh Wonder), among others. The album was finally released on 1 May 2009. Artwork for the album was designed by Mattias Norén, who had previously undertaken work for groups such as Outworld, Evergrey and Into Eternity, among others.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, {{three stories}} {{were added to}} the hospital, {{expanding}} the bed capacity to 75 and making it the tallest building in Rome at the time. Many modern advances were included, such as steam heating, electrical lights, <b>silent</b> <b>call</b> systems, hot and cold running water in each room, linoleum floors, three complete operating suites, a private telephone exchange, and a safe-gate elevator running from basement to roof. The next year, the hospital was recognized by the American College of Surgeons as one of only four hospitals in Georgia to meet the board's standards of excellence.|$|E
50|$|In July 2010 {{the band}} played their first live gig at the Luminaire in London, a {{performance}} that was praised for its high fidelity sound but critiqued for the undersized venue. During this time, Hinks {{had been working on}} a follow-up album and, on 5 August 2010, he announced that The Face of the Unknown would be released on 12 October of the same year under the Time Divide label. Guest vocalists announced included Michael Eriksen (Circus Maximus), Andi Kravljaca (<b>Silent</b> <b>Call),</b> Nick D'Virgilio (Spock's Beard), Jem Godfrey (Frost*) and Jonny Tatum (Eumeria).
