5|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} is {{one part of}} the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or government departments. Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about cultivated plants.|$|E
5|$|Most Stylidium species {{tend to be}} hardy {{species and}} can be easily {{cultivated}} in greenhouses or gardens. They are drought resistant, hardy to cold weather, and the species diversity in this genus gives gardeners {{a wide variety of}} choices. Most species that are native to Western Australia will be cold hardy to at least -1 to -2°C. The few that can be found all over Australia, like S. graminifolium, will tolerate a wider range of habitat since their native ranges includes a great diversity of ecoregions. Some species of triggerplants are <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> outdoors outside of the Australian continent including most of the United Kingdom and as far north as New York City or Seattle in the United States.|$|E

25|$|According to the United Nations World Food Program, in 2003, China fed 20 {{percent of}} the world's {{population}} with only 7 {{percent of the}} world's arable land. China ranks first worldwide in farm output, and, {{as a result of}} topographic and climatic factors, only about 10–15 percent of the total land area is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation.</b> Of this, slightly more than half is unirrigated, and the remainder is divided roughly equally between paddy fields and irrigated areas. Nevertheless, about 60 percent of the population lives in the rural areas, and until the 1980s a high percentage of them made their living directly from farming. Since then, many have been encouraged to leave the fields and pursue other activities, such as light manufacturing, commerce, and transportation; and by the mid-1980s farming accounted for {{less than half of the}} value of rural output. Today, agriculture contributes only 13% of China's GDP.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is {{a country}} {{situated}} in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation,</b> {{and in the early}} 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1948 Arab Israeli War, the Banias spring {{remained}} in Syrian territory, while the Banias River flowed through the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) into Israel. In 1953, {{at one of}} a series of meetings to regularize administration of the DMZs, Syria offered to adjust the armistice lines, and cede to Israel's 70% of the DMZ, in exchange for a return to the pre 1946 International border in the Jordan basin area, with Banias water resources returning to Syrian sovereignty. On 26 April, the Israeli cabinet met to consider the Syrian suggestions, with head of Israel’s Water Planning Authority, Simha Blass, in attendance. Blass noted that while the land to be ceded to Syria was not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation,</b> the Syrian map did not suit Israel’s water development plan. Blass explained that the movement of the International boundary in the area of Banias would affect Israel’s water rights. The Israeli cabinet rejected the Syrian proposals but decided to continue the negotiations by making changes to the accord and placing conditions on the Syrian proposals. The Israeli conditions took into account Blass’s position over water rights and Syria rejected the Israeli counter offer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{evaluated}} land suitability <b>for</b> Jatropha <b>cultivation</b> at {{a global}} scale under current and future climate scenarios. Areas that are <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> Jatropha <b>cultivation</b> include southern South America, the west and southeast coasts of Africa, the north of South Asia, and {{the north and south}} coasts of Australia. In the predicted climate change scenarios, areas near the equator become less <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> Jatropha <b>cultivation,</b> and areas further from the equator become more suitable.

500|$|Varieties {{producing}} green fruit, less strongly flavoured and {{sweeter than}} typical blackcurrants, are cultivated in Finland, {{where they are}} called [...] "greencurrants" [...] (viherherukka). In Poland, the Research Institute of Horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance, fruit quality, adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting. Researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry (Ribes grossularia), the red currant (Ribes rubrum) and the flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum). The resulting offspring were further back-crossed to R. nigrum. Cultivars produced include 'Tisel' and 'Tiben' in 2000 and 'Ores', 'Ruben' and 'Tines' in 2005. Further cultivars 'Polares' and 'Tihope' are being tested. Since 1991, New Zealand has become an important centre for research and development, as its temperate climate is particularly <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> of the crop. Breeding programmes are concentrating on yield, large fruit size, consistency of cropping and upright habit.|$|E
500|$|Both A.auricula-judae and {{the similar}} A.polytricha are popular in China, where the {{medicinal}} use of food is common; a soup containing {{the species is}} used medicinally for dealing with colds and fevers by reducing {{the heat of the}} body. There is evidence that the species were being cultivated in China as early as the Tang dynasty (618–907). Li Shizhen, in his Pen Tsao Kang Mu, quotes Tang Ying-chuan from that period as saying [...] "... put the steamed bran on logs, cover with straw, Wood Ear will grow". In the early 20th century, large volumes of A.auricula-judae were exported from Australia to China, and it is today still sold in Asian food shops for culinary use. It is also popular in Vietnam, although the climate is there more suited to A.polytricha. A report on small-scale fungi cultivation concluded that A.auricula-judae would be <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> only in cooler climates. According to a 2010 publication, the annual production of Auricularia species worldwide is the fourth highest among all industrially cultivated culinary and medicinal mushrooms, and in China, the estimated output was roughly 1.655 million tonnes (based on 2003 data), most of which are A.polytricha however (which has by and large replaced A.auricula-judae in international trade).|$|E

5000|$|Stymne {{believes}} that the application of genetic engineering {{is a prerequisite for}} successful completion of this transition since many plants that produce oils that are of interest to industry are not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> large-scale <b>cultivation.</b> <b>For</b> a long time, he has argued for the need for brand new oil crops that are not only <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> large-scale <b>cultivation</b> across large parts of Europe but also a <b>suitable</b> candidate <b>for</b> gene manipulation to tailor oil quality. [...] Stymne have suggested that Crambe abyssinica and Lepidium campestre may be suitable candidates with regard to agronomic and genetic engineering factors. [...] He has also highlighted that Lepidium campestre can be utilized to develop a perennial high-yielding oil crop which can thereby reduce environmental impact due to reduced need for plowing.|$|R
