25|$|Ancient Greek coins {{normally}} had distinctive {{names in}} daily use. The Athenian tetradrachm was called owl, the Aeginetic <b>stater</b> was called chelone, the Corinthian <b>stater</b> was called hippos (horse) an so on. Each city would mint {{its own and}} have them stamped with recognizable symbols of the city, known as badge in numismatics, along with suitable inscriptions, and they would often be referred to either {{by the name of}} the city or of the image depicted. The exact exchange value of each was determined by {{the quantity and quality of}} the metal, which reflected on the reputation of each mint.|$|E
25|$|Its {{early history}} {{reveals that the}} {{maritime}} importance of the island dates back to pre-Dorian times. It is usually stated on the authority of Ephorus, that Pheidon of Argos established a mint in Aegina, the first city-state to issue coins in Europe, the Aeginetic <b>stater.</b> One stamped <b>stater</b> (having the mark of some authority {{in the form of}} a picture or words) can be seen in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris. It is an electrum <b>stater</b> of a turtle, an animal sacred to Aphrodite, struck at Aegina that dates from 700 BC. Therefore, it is thought that the Aeginetes, within 30 or 40years of the invention of coinage in Asia Minor by the Ionian Greeks or the Lydians (c. 630 BC), might have been the ones to introduce coinage to the Western world. The fact that the Aeginetic standard of weights and measures (developed during the mid-7th century) was one of the two standards in general use in the Greek world (the other being the Euboic-Attic) is sufficient evidence of the early commercial importance of the island. The Aeginetic weight standard of about 12.3 grams was widely adopted in the Greek world during the 7th century BC. The Aeginetic <b>stater</b> was divided into three drachmae of 4.1 grams of silver. Staters depicting a sea-turtle were struck up to the end of the 5th century BC. Following the end of the Peloponnesian War, 404 BC, it was replaced by the land tortoise.|$|E
50|$|Celtic <b>staters</b> {{were also}} minted in present-day Czech Republic and Poland.

50|$|Celtic tribes {{brought the}} concept to Western and Central Europe after obtaining it {{while serving as}} mercenaries in north Greece. Gold <b>staters</b> were minted in Gaul by Gallic chiefs modeled after those of Philip II of Macedonia, which were brought back after serving in his armies, or those of Alexander and his successors. Some of these <b>staters</b> {{in the form of}} the Gallo-Belgic series were {{imported}} to Britain on a large scale. These went on to influence a range of <b>staters</b> produced in Britain. British Gold <b>staters</b> generally weighed between 4.5 and(-) 6.5 g.|$|R

25|$|Celtic coins often {{retained}} Greek subjects, such as {{the head}} of Apollo on the obverse and two-horse chariot on the reverse of the gold <b>stater</b> of Philip II, but developed their own style from that basis, thus establishing a Graeco-Celtic synthesis.|$|E

Further small vocabulary differences {{may be seen}} even between small villages.|$|E
25|$|These {{difficulties}} {{were eliminated}} in 570 BCE when pure silver coins were introduced. However, electrum currency remained common until approximately 350 BCE. The simplest {{reason for this}} was that, because of the gold content, one 14.1gram <b>stater</b> was {{worth as much as}} ten 14.1gram silver pieces.|$|E

25|$|Their tariffs are {{difficult}} to evaluate: they varied significantly. The average charge for a prostitute in 5th and 4th century ranged from three obols to a drachma. Expensive prostitutes could charge a <b>stater</b> (four drachmas), or more, like the Corinthian Lais in her prime did. In the 1st century BC, the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara, cited in the Palatine anthology, V 126, mentions a system of subscription of up to five drachma for a dozen visits. In the 2nd century, Lucian in his Dialogue of the Hetaera has the prostitute Ampelis consider five drachma per visit as a mediocre price (8, 3). In the same text a young virgin can demand a Mina, that is 100 drachma (7,3), or even two minas if the customer is less than appetizing. A young and pretty prostitute could charge a higher price than her in-decline colleague; even if, as iconography on ceramics demonstrates, a specific market existed for older women. The price would change if the client demanded exclusivity. Intermediate arrangements also existed; {{a group of friends}} could purchase exclusivity, with each having part-time rights.|$|E

[...] Under Roman occupation, the area thrived. The obvious {{reason for this}} is the major Roman road, Iter II (later known as Watling Street), that runs through the area and that gave rise to an associated Roman town at Magiovinium (Fenny Stratford). Possibly the oldest known gold coin in Britain was found here, a gold <b>stater</b> of the mid-2nd century BCE.|$|E

500|$|The 1877 Handy Book for Bible Readers {{states that}} [...] "Argurion, argenteus, denarius. This word occurs in two passages--(A) {{the account of}} the {{betrayal}} of our Lord for [...] "thirty pieces of silver" [...] (Matt. xxvi. 15; xxvii. 3, 5, 6, 9). These have usually been considered to be denarii, but on no sufficient ground. The parallel passage in Zechariah (xi. 12, 13), is translated [...] "thirty [...] of silver"; but which should doubtless be read, [...] "thirty shekels of silver", whilst it is observable that [...] "thirty shekels of silver" [...] was the price of blood to be paid {{in the case of a}} servant accidentally killed (Exod. xxi. 32). The passage may therefore be explained as [...] "thirty shekels of silver", not surrent shekels, but tetradrachms of the Attic standard of the Greek cities of Syria and Phoencia. These tetradrachms were common at the time of our Lord, and of them the <b>stater</b> was a specimen." ...|$|E
500|$|The 5th century BC Athenian tetradrachm ("four drachmae") coin {{was perhaps}} the most widely used coin in the Greek world before the time of Alexander the Great (along with the Corinthian <b>stater).</b> It {{featured}} the helmeted profile bust of Athena on the obverse (front) and an owl on the reverse (back). In daily use they were called [...] glaukes (owls), hence the proverb , 'an owl to Athens', referring to something that was in plentiful supply, like 'coals to Newcastle'. The reverse is featured on the national side of the modern Greek 1 euro coin. Drachmae were minted on different weight standards at different Greek mints. The standard that came to be most commonly used was the Athenian or Attic one, which weighed a little over 4.3grams. A drachma was approximately a day's pay for a skilled laborer. [...] So 30 pieces of silver (30 tetradrachm), at four drachmas each, [...] would roughly be comparable to four months' (120 days) wages.|$|E
