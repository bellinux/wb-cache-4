The consistent higher-order dynamic formulation for foam-type (soft) core sandwich beams was extended {{to the case of}} composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>plates.</b> Eight dynamic governing equations and the corresponding boundary conditions were derived through the application of Hamilton’s principle. The extended formulation was applied to the free vibration analysis of soft-core and honeycomb-core <b>sandwich</b> <b>plates</b> with anti-symmetric and symmetric lay-ups.

The <b>sandwich</b> <b>plates</b> were compared with the solid plates having the same mass per unit area.

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{responses}} of clamped circular monolithic and <b>sandwich</b> <b>plates</b> of equal areal mass have been measured by loading the plates at mid-span with metal foam projectiles. The <b>sandwich</b> <b>plates</b> comprise AISI {{304 stainless steel}} face sheets and aluminium alloy metal foam cores. The resistance to shock loading is quantified by the permanent transverse deflection at mid-span of the plates {{as a function of}} projectile momentum. It is found that the <b>sandwich</b> <b>plates</b> have a higher shock resistance than monolithic plates of equal mass. Further, the shock resistance of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>plates</b> increases with increasing thickness of sandwich core. Finite element simulations of these experiments are in good agreement with the experimental measurements and demonstrate that the strain rate sensitivity of AISI 304 stainless steel plays a significant role in increasing the shock resistance of the monolithic and <b>sandwich</b> <b>plates.</b> Finally, the finite element simulations were employed to determine the pressure versus time history exerted by the foam projectiles on the plates. It was found that the pressure transient was reasonably independent of the dynamic impedance of the plate, suggesting that the metal foam projectile is a convenient experimental tool for ranking the shock resistance of competing structures...|$|R
