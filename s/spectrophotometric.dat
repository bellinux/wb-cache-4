5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} may be quantitated {{in blood}} using <b>spectrophotometric</b> methods or chromatographic techniques {{in order to}} confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or {{to assist in the}} forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure.|$|E
5|$|When {{the glass}} {{electrode}} cannot be employed, as with non-aqueous solutions, <b>spectrophotometric</b> methods are frequently used. These may involve absorbance or fluorescence measurements. In {{both cases the}} measured quantity {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the sum of contributions from each photo-active species; with absorbance measurements the Beer-Lambert law is assumed to apply.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two <b>spectrophotometric</b> {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated <b>spectrophotometric</b> methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the color}} of phenol red can {{interfere}} with some <b>spectrophotometric</b> and fluorescent assays, many types of tissue culture media are also available without phenol red.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{experimental}} {{data that are}} used for the determination of solution equilibrium constants. Potentiometric data obtained with a glass electrode are {{the most widely used}} with aqueous solutions. The others are <b>Spectrophotometric,</b> Fluorescence (luminescence) measurements and NMR chemical shift measurements; simultaneous measurement of K and ΔH for 1:1 adducts in biological systems is routinely carried out using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry.|$|E
25|$|Under ISO 3632, {{determination}} of non-stigma content ("floral waste content") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material ("ash") are also key. Grading standards are {{set by the}} International Organization for Standardization, a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific <b>spectrophotometric</b> absorbance. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20–50 for all categories.|$|E
25|$|Recent <b>spectrophotometric</b> {{evidence}} suggests that turacoverdin may be closely related or identical to green pigments in the feathers of the northern jacana (Jacana spinosa), the blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), and the crested wood-partridge (Rollulus rouloul). As Ithaginis and Rollulus {{are members of the}} order Galliformes, this has led some researchers to assume support for a turacoverdin-bearing common ancestor of Musophagidae and Galliformes, making the presence of the pigment a symplesiomorphy for these groups. The pigment data specifically suggests that turacos evolved from a group of galliform species, which is represented by the extant genera Ithaginis and Rollolus. Based on the appearance of its green feathers, researcher Jan Dyck speculates that Rollolus is closer to a possible ancestor than Ithaginis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{no formal}} tests have been {{performed}} investigating the functional significance of turacoverdin coloration, speculation abounds. Moreau in 1958 observed that turaco species inhabiting forests {{are more likely to}} be green in color than species inhabiting other environments, which may offer concealment from predators. In fact, it has been observed that the greener and denser a turaco's forest habitat, the deeper green its plumage, while non-forest-dwelling turaco species tend to be devoid of the green pigment. This claim has not been studied rigorously from a biochemical or phylogenetic perspective, however, and awaits further research. Turacos may employ their unique green coloration for sexual or social advertisement, but again no <b>spectrophotometric</b> or biochemical studies have been conducted to test for sex differences in coloration, and to limited human perception there appears to be none.|$|E

500|$|Enzyme assays are {{laboratory}} {{procedures that}} measure {{the rate of}} enzyme reactions. Because enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyse, enzyme assays usually follow changes in the concentration of either substrates or products to measure the rate of reaction. There are many methods of measurement. <b>Spectrophotometric</b> assays observe change in the absorbance of light between products and reactants; radiometric assays involve the incorporation or release of radioactivity to measure the amount of product made over time. <b>Spectrophotometric</b> assays are most convenient since they allow {{the rate of the}} reaction to be measured continuously. Although radiometric assays require the removal and counting of samples (i.e., they are discontinuous assays) they are usually extremely sensitive and can measure very low levels of enzyme activity. [...] An analogous approach is to use mass spectrometry to monitor the incorporation or release of stable isotopes as substrate is converted into product.|$|E
500|$|Development of the {{spectrophotometer}} had direct {{relevance to}} World War II and the American war effort. The role of vitamins in health was of significant concern, as scientists wanted to identify Vitamin A-rich foods to keep soldiers healthy. Previous [...] methods of assessing Vitamin A levels involved feeding rats a food {{for several weeks}} and then performing a biopsy to estimate ingested Vitamin A levels. [...] In contrast, examining a food sample with a DU spectrophotometer yielded better results {{in a matter of}} minutes. The DU spectrophotometer could be used to study both vitamin A and its precursor carotenoids, and rapidly became the preferred method of <b>spectrophotometric</b> analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The CRI is {{calculated}} {{by comparing the}} color rendering of the test source {{to that of a}} [...] "perfect" [...] source, which is a black body radiator for sources with correlated color temperatures under 5000K, and a phase of daylight otherwise (e.g., D65). Chromatic adaptation should be performed so that like quantities are compared. [...] The Test Method (also called Test Sample Method or Test Color Method) needs only colorimetric, rather than <b>spectrophotometric,</b> information.|$|E
2500|$|Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are {{proteins}} of the superfamily containing heme as a cofactor and, therefore, are hemoproteins. CYPs use {{a variety}} of small and large molecules as substrates in enzymatic reactions. They are, in general, the terminal oxidase enzymes in electron transfer chains, broadly categorized as P450-containing systems. The term [...] "P450" [...] is derived from the <b>spectrophotometric</b> peak at the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the enzyme (450nm) when it is in the reduced state and complexed with carbon monoxide.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphatase {{denaturing}} {{was originally}} monitored using a phenol-phosphate substrate. When hydrolysed by the enzyme these compounds liberate phenols, {{which were then}} reacted with dibromoquinonechlorimide to give a colour change, which itself was measured by checking absorption at 610nm (spectrophotometry). Some of the phenols used were inherently coloured (phenolpthalein, nitrophenol) and were simply assayed unreacted. [...] <b>Spectrophotometric</b> analysis is satisfactory but is of relatively low accuracy because many natural products are coloured. For this reason, modern systems (since 1990) use fluorometry which is able to detect much lower levels of raw milk contamination.|$|E
