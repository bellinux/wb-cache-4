50|$|The {{short circuit}} {{inductance}} {{value of the}} step-up transformer is further increased {{from that of the}} three-times resonance design. The capacitance component of the secondary <b>side</b> <b>circuit</b> is also increased.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{resonant}} {{frequency of the}} secondary <b>side</b> <b>circuit</b> of the transformer in the early designs was decided to have no relation with the operating frequency of the inverter circuit, the {{resonant frequency}} was set to a much higher frequency {{than that of the}} inverter circuit. This greatly reduces the influence of the inverter circuit on the operating frequency. A ballast capacitor Cb is essential for stabilization of the lamp current.|$|E
5000|$|A {{phantom group}} is {{composed}} of three circuits that are derived from two single-channel circuits to form a phantom circuit. Here the phantom circuit is a third circuit derived from two suitably arranged pairs of wires, called <b>side</b> <b>circuits,</b> with each pair of wires being a circuit in itself {{and at the same}} time acting as one conductor of the third circuit. The [...] "side circuits" [...] within phantom circuits can be coupled to their respective voltage drops by center-tapped transformers, usually called [...] "repeating coils". The center taps are on the line side of the <b>side</b> <b>circuits.</b> Current from the phantom circuit is split evenly by the center taps. This cancels crosstalk from the phantom <b>circuit</b> to the <b>side</b> <b>circuits.</b> Phantom working increased the number of circuits on long distance routes in the early 20th century without putting up more wires. Phantoming declined with the adoption of carrier systems.|$|R
50|$|It is {{theoretically}} {{possible to}} create a phantom circuit from two other phantom circuits and so on up in a pyramid with a maximum 2n-1 circuits being derived from n original circuits. However, more than one level of phantoming is usually impractical. Isolation between the phantom <b>circuit</b> and the <b>side</b> <b>circuits</b> relies on accurate balance {{of the line and}} transformers. Imperfect balance results in crosstalk between the phantom and <b>side</b> <b>circuits</b> and this effect accumulates as each level of phantoms is added. Even small levels of crosstalk are unacceptable on analogue telecommunications circuits since speech crosstalk is still intelligible down to quite low levels.|$|R

50|$|The {{more recent}} {{inverter}} circuit {{was invented by}} Hitachi electronics in Japan. It has come into world wide use as the so-called three-times or third harmonic resonance circuit, shown in the figure as the “advanced technology“. The resonance frequency of the secondary <b>side</b> <b>circuit</b> is three {{times that of the}} primary side. A step-up transformer with a greater short-circuit inductance value is suitable for use in this case.|$|E

Mwila was part of Zambia's coaching bench during the President's Cup in South Korea but for undisclosed reasons, was sidelined after that and he missed the Seoul Olympics as a result. Although he asked for reasons why, the FAZ remained mute.|$|E
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{which is}} actually used in the so-called three-times resonance circuit has a flat shape. Although the magnetic path structure is closed, the leakage of the magnetic flux is considerably more {{than that of the}} conventional type. The transformer therefore has a larger short circuit inductance value. The design (refer to figure of the “past generation of technology“) is such that the short circuit inductance value of the step-up transformer is increased to some degree, whereby a resonance circuit is created by the short circuit inductance (Lsc in the figures) and a capacitance component obtained on the secondary side of the step-up transformer. The resonance frequency of the circuit is set to a frequency three times as high as the operating frequency of the inverter circuit in order to generate a third-order harmonic in the secondary <b>side</b> <b>circuit.</b> The lamp current waveform has a trapezoid shape. The ballast capacitor Crb also functions as a resonance capacitor. As a result the conversion efficiency of the inverter circuit is considerably improved, and the step-up transformer is further miniaturized.|$|E

40|$|Many {{transformers}} may {{be connected}} in parallel to a distribution busbar to supply the load. Restoration of power supply after a black-out is carried out by switching on the transformers one by one, producing high inrush current at the instant of switching of each transformer. It is proposed that circuit breakers connected to all transformer secondaries should be closed first. Then, closing the primary <b>side</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker of the first transformer also energizes all remaining transformers from the secondary side. Inrush current in the first transformer with closed secondary circuit breakers of all transformers does not increase to a very high value. No inrush current is produced during subsequent switching of any other transformer from the primary side, as they are already energized from the secondary side...|$|E

30|$|There {{has been}} a rather long history of {{research}} on the control and protection of AC faults in electric power transmission systems [1, 2]. Regarding the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) including multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) technologies, research effort has been made on the protection against DC faults [3, 4, 5, 6]. As for AC faults, control strategies of voltage source converter (VSC) for improving the AC fault ride-through capability of VSC-HVDC systems were proposed in [7, 8]. An approach of limiting the AC unbalanced fault on the VSC MTDC grids was proposed in [9]. Control and protection strategies were investigated in [10] for a hybrid MTDC system against AC faults. In most situations, AC faults can be isolated by AC circuit breakers. However, when an AC fault occurs at the nearby AC side of the converter, which is beyond the protection area of the nearby AC circuit breakers, the fault isolation is achieved by both blocking of the converter to prevent current flowing from the DC side and tripping the AC <b>side</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers. In the above situation, previous work has assumed that the blocking of the converter is successful. However, this assumption is not necessarily valid in terms of practical operation of converters, especially in the more advanced modular multilevel converter (MMC) [11, 12] in the current system. The MMC at the fault side has different conditions of blocking failure: ① for the communication outage of control signals where the whole converter can be out of control and cannot be blocked, although the occurrence of such a condition is considered to be rare; ② a more common condition {{is that one of the}} six converter arms is failed to be blocked; ③ the most common condition is that one sub-module (SM)/several SMs on one converter arm is/are failed to be blocked; ④ other conditions. Hence, it is worth identifying the potential risk to the MTDC system, analyzing the dynamic performance to reveal the fact that special control and protection is necessary to be conducted when the MTDC system is significantly affected under emergency conditions, while under other non-emergency conditions, the special control and protection may not be essential.|$|E
40|$|Behaviors are {{a product}} of {{underlying}} neural circuits, {{yet there is a}} paucity of mechanistic information about how nervous systems contribute to the repeated evolution of similar behaviors. Theoretical studies have predicted that the same behavioral output can be generated by neural circuits with different properties. Here, we test the theory in biological circuits by comparing the central pattern generator (CPG) circuits underlying swimming behaviors in nudibranchs (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Euthyneura, Nudipleura). In comparative studies of neural circuits, neurotransmitter content can serve as landmarks or molecular markers for neuron types. Here, we created a comprehensive map of GABA-immunoreactive neurons in six Nudipleura species. None of the known swim CPG neurons were GABA-ir, but they were located next to identifiable GABA-ir neurons/clusters. Despite strong conservation of the GABA-ergic system, there were differences, particularly in the buccal ganglia, which may represent adaptive changes. We applied our knowledge of neurotransmitter distribution along with morphological traits to identify the neuron type Si 1 in Flabellina, a species that swims via whole body left-right (LR) flexions and in Tritonia, a dorsal-ventral (DV) swimming species. Si 1 is a CPG member of the LR species Melibe, whereas its homologue in the LR species Dendronotus is not. In Flabellina, Si 1 was part of the LR CPG and despite having similar synaptic connections as Flabellina and Melibe, Si 1 in Tritonia was not part of its DV swim CPG. Side by <b>side</b> <b>circuit</b> comparison of Flabellina, Melibe and Dendronotus revealed different combinations of circuit architecture and modulation resulting in different circuit configurations for LR swimming. This includes differences in the role and activity pattern of Si 1, sensitivity to curare and the effect of homologues of C 2, a DV CPG neuron, on the LR motor pattern. These results collectively reveal three different circuit variations for generating the same behavior. It suggests that the neural substrate from which behaviors arise is phylogenetically constrained. While this neural substrate can be configured in multiple different ways to generate the same outcome, the possibilities are finite and, as seen here, similar structural and functional neural motifs are used in the evolution of these circuits...|$|E

5000|$|Double-sided flex {{circuits}} are flex circuits {{having two}} conductor layers. These flex circuits can be fabricated {{with or without}} plated through holes, though the plated through hole variation is much more common. When constructed without plated through holes and connection features are accessed from one <b>side</b> only, the <b>circuit</b> {{is defined as a}} [...] "Type V (5)" [...] according to military specifications. It is not a common practice but it is an option. Because of the plated through hole, terminations for electronic components are provided for on both <b>sides</b> of the <b>circuit,</b> thus allowing components to be placed on either side. Depending on design requirements, double-sided flex circuits can be fabricated with protective coverlayers on one, both or neither side of the completed circuit but are most commonly produced with the protective layer on both sides. One major advantage of this type of substrate is that it allows crossover connections to be made very easy. Many single <b>sided</b> <b>circuits</b> are built on a double sided substrate just because they have one of two crossover connections. An example of this use is the circuit connecting a mousepad to the motherboard of a laptop. All connections on that circuit are located on only one side of the substrate, except a very small crossover connection which uses the second side of the substrate.|$|R
