Both organizations had known {{for at least two}} years that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but did not act, because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War to do so. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about West German national <b>security</b> <b>advisor</b> Hans Globke, who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws (including the Nuremberg Laws). The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries.|$|E

5|$|On 8 December 1970, in {{response}} to a request from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a highly secret meeting was held at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam's (MACV) Saigon headquarters to discuss the possibility of an ARVN cross-border attack into southeastern Laos. According to General Creighton W. Abrams, the American commander in Vietnam, the main impetus for the offensive came from Colonel Alexander M. Haig, an aide to National <b>Security</b> <b>Advisor</b> Dr. Henry Kissinger. MACV had been disturbed by intelligence of a PAVN logistical build-up in southeastern Laos but was reluctant to let the ARVN go it alone against the North Vietnamese. The group's findings were then sent on to the Joint Chiefs in Washington, D.C. By mid-December, President Richard M. Nixon had also become intrigued by possible offensive actions in Laos and had begun efforts to convince both General Abrams and the members of his cabinet of the efficacy of a cross-border attack.|$|E

5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National <b>Security</b> <b>Advisor</b> more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E

40|$|<b>Security</b> <b>advisors</b> {{explore a}} client’s home to discover, document, explain, and {{recommend}} solutions for security problems. Evidence {{from the field}} shows that home-owners rarely follow through to implement better security. We re-imagine the advisory process from an information-transfer activity to a collaborative problem-solving activity. We use the precepts of collaboration engineering, including the Six Layer Model of Collaboration, {{to develop a new}} collaborative work system in which security experts and home owners work together to improve security. We provide evidence that the new work practice using the "SmartProtector" application based on new thinkLets for dyadic collaboration improves outcomes in the field. Results are interesting to three stakeholders. First, police officials, and other <b>security</b> <b>advisors</b> can use the approach to introduce collaborative security advisory services in their cities. Second, development teams for future advisory systems in any domain can use our approach to capture the design rationale for their systems. Third, collaboration engineers and researchers can use and expand on the thinkLets we codified for reuse in designing mobile advisory services...|$|R
