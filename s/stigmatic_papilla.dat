Among the 17, 240 genes predicted in A. thaliana, one-third were papilla specific while approximately half of the genes were detected in all tissues examined. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that genes related {{to a wide range of}} reproduction and development functions are expressed in papilla cells, particularly metabolism, transcription, and membrane-mediated information exchange. 	These results reflect the conserved features of general cellular function and also the specific reproductive role of papilla cells, highlighting a complex cellular system regulated by a diverse range of molecules in these cells.

40|$|Molecules {{contained}} in the sporophytically-derived coating of the pollen grain and in the superficial pellicle of the stigmatic papillae control the self-incompatibility response of the breeding system of Brassica. The stigmatic pellicle consists of a lipidic matrix in which float a mosaic of proteins many of which can rapidly be renewed from pools in the papillar cyto-plasm. A fraction of these proteins are involved in facilitating the passage of water to the pollen whilst another, possibly a glycoprotein, suppresses this activity in an incompatible mating. The pollen coating must also contain two sets of active molecules, one for identifying the stigmatic recognition molecules, and another for effecting the changes that take place tothe coat itself on compatible pollination. In essence, the self -incompatibility mechanism appears to operate through the control of water flow from 'the papilla to the grain. Even when incompatible grains manage to germinate by obtaining atmospheric water, their proteins will often stimulate a reaction in the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papilla</b> once the cuticle has been penetrated...|$|E
40|$|The pollen-stigma {{interaction}} of self-incompatibility in crucifers is correlated with glycoproteins localized {{in the cell}} wall of the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> that are encoded by the S locus glycoprotein (SLG) gene. When fused to the [beta]-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, the 5 [prime] upstream regulatory region of SLG directed high level expression in the papillae of transgenic Brassica plants. Histochemical and fluorometric assays revealed that, {{in addition to its}} primary site of expression in the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae,</b> the SLG-GUS fusion was also expressed in the transmitting tissue of stigma, style, and ovary, and in anthers. This conclusion was verified by the detection of transgene-encoded GUS transcripts and endogenous SLG-homologous transcripts by RNA gel blot analysis. Significantly, in anthers, the SLG promoter was active not only sporophytically in the nurse cells of the tapetum, but also in the haploid microspores. Because self-incompatibility systems exhibiting sporophytic control of pollen phenotype are thought to have evolved from systems with gametophytic control, we suggest that sporophytic control was acquired without loss of gametophytic function...|$|R

40|$|Pollination is an {{important}} early step in sexual plant reproduction. In Arabidopsis thaliana, sequential pollination events, from pollen adhesion onto the stigma surface to pollen tube germination and elongation, occur on the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papilla</b> cells. Following successful completion of these events, the pollen tube penetrates the stigma and finally fertilizes a female gametophyte. The pollination events {{are thought to be}} initiated and regulated by interactions between papilla cells and pollen. Here, we report the characterization of gene expression profiles of unpollinated (UP), compatible pollinated (CP) and incompatible pollinated (IP) papilla cells in A. thaliana. Based on cell type-specific transcriptome analysis from a combination of laser microdissection and RNA sequencing, 15, 475, 17, 360 and 16, 918 genes were identified as expressed in UP, CP and IP papilla cells, respectively, and of these, 14, 392 genes were present in all three data sets. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analyses identified 147 and 71 genes up-regulated in CP and IP papilla cells, respectively, and 115 and 46 genes down-regulated. Gene Ontology and metabolic pathway analyses revealed that papilla cells play an active role as the female reproductive component in pollination, particularly in information exchange, signal transduction, internal physiological changes and external morphological modification. This study provides fundamental information on the molecular mechanisms involved in pollination in papilla cells, furthering our understanding of the reproductive role of papilla cells...|$|E
40|$|In the Brassicaceae, {{targeted}} exocytosis to the stigmatic papillar {{plasma membrane}} under the compatible pollen grain is hypothesized to be essential for pollen hydration and pollen tube penetration. In contrast, polarized secretion is proposed to be inhibited in the stigmatic papillae during {{the rejection of}} self-incompatible pollen. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we performed a detailed time-course of post-pollination events to view the cytological responses of the stigmatic papillae to compatible and self-incompatible pollinations. For compatible pollinations in Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, vesicle secretion was observed at the stigmatic papillar plasma membrane under the pollen grain while Brassica napus stigmatic papillae appeared to use multivesicular bodies (MVBs) for secretion. Exo 70 A 1, {{a component of the}} exocyst complex, has been previously implicated in the compatible pollen responses, and disruption of Exo 70 A 1 in both A. thaliana and B. napus resulted in a loss of secretory vesicles/MVBs at the stigmatic papillar plasma membrane. Similarly, for self-incompatible pollinations, secretory vesicles/MVBs were absent from the stigmatic papillar plasma membrane in A. lyrata and B. napus; and furthermore, autophagy appeared to be induced to direct vesicles/MVBs to the vacuole for degradation. Thus, these findings support a model where the basal pollen recognition pathway in the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papilla</b> promotes exocytosis to accept compatible pollen, and the basal pollen recognition pathway is overridden by the self...|$|E
40|$|In Brassica self-incompatibility, the {{recognition}} of self/nonself pollen grains, {{is controlled by the}} S-locus, which encodes three highly polymorphic proteins: S-locus receptor kinase (SRK), S-locus protein 11 (SP 11; also designated S-locus Cys-rich protein), and S-locus glycoprotein (SLG). SP 11, located in the pollen coat, determines pollen S-haplotype specificity, whereas SRK, located on the plasma membrane of <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papilla</b> cells, determines stigmatic S-haplotype specificity. SLG shares significant sequence similarity with the extracellular domain of SRK and is abundant in the stigmatic cell wall, but its function is controversial. We previously showed that SP 11 binds directly to its cognate SRK with high affinity (Kd = 0. 7 nM) and induces its autophosphorylation. We also found that an SLG-like, 60 -kD protein on the stigmatic membrane forms a high-affinity binding site for SP 11. Here, we show that the 60 -kD stigmatic membrane protein is a truncated form of SRK containing the extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and part of the juxtamembrane domain. A transiently expressed, membrane-anchored form of SRK exhibits high-affinity binding to SP 11, whereas the soluble SRK (eSRK) lacking the transmembrane domain exhibits no high-affinity binding, {{as is the case with}} SLG. The different binding affinities of the membrane-anchored SRK and soluble eSRK or SLG will be significant for the specific perception of SP 11 by SRK...|$|E

Eight apricot cultivars of different geographical origin and characterised by a different self-compatibility behaviour were analysed. Whole pistils were removed from flowers at different phenological stages. Analyses were performed on frozen-hydrated specimens by Low-Temperature SEM. Morphological observations were conducted on: stigma (shape, size and presence of exudate), <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> (shape, size, density and distribution) and style (inner structures).

40|$|Pomegranate [Punica granatum (Punicaceae) ] is {{characterized}} by having two types of flowers on the same tree: hermaphroditic bisexual flowers and functionally male flowers. This condition, defined as functional andromonoecy, can result in decreased yields resulting from the inability of male flowers to set fruit. Morphological and histological analyses of bisexual and male flowers were conducted using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterize the different flower types observed in pomegranate plants and to better understand their developmental differences. Bisexual flowers had a discoid stigma covered with copious exudate, elongated <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae,</b> a single elongate style, and numerous stamens inserted on the inner wall of the calyx tube. Using fluorescence staining, high numbers of pollen tubes were observed growing through a central stylar canal. Ovules were numerous, elliptical, and anatropous. In contrast, male flowers had reduced female parts and exhibited shortened pistils of variable heights. <b>Stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> of male flowers had little exudate yet supported pollen germination. However, pollen tubes were rarely observed in styles. Ovules in male flowers were rudimentary and exhibited various stages of degeneration. Pollen from both types of flowers was of similar size, approximate to 20 mu m, and exhibited similar percent germination using in vitro germination assays. Pollen germination was strongly influenced by temperature. Maximal germination (greater than 74 %) was obtained at 25 and 35 degrees C; pollen germination was significantly lower at 15 degrees C (58 %) and 5 degrees C (10 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Angiosperm stigmas {{have long}} been known to exhibit high levels of {{peroxidase}} activity when they are mature and most receptive to pollen but the biological function of stigma peroxidases is not known. A novel stigma-specific class III peroxidase gene, SSP (stigma-specific peroxidase) expressed exclusively in the stigmas of Senecio squalidus L. (Asteraceae) has recently been identified. Expression of SSP is confined to the specialized secretory cells (papillae) that compose the stigma epidermis. The literature on stigma peroxidases and hypotheses on their function(s) is reviewed here before further characterization of SSP and an attempt to determine its function are described. It is shown that SSP is localized to cytoplasmic regions of <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> and also {{to the surface of}} these cells, possibly as a component of the pellicle, a thin layer of condensed protein typical of ‘dry’ stigmas. Enzyme assays on recombinant SSP showed it to be a peroxidase with a preference for diphenolic substrates (ABTS and TMB) and a pH optimum of 4. 5. In such assays the peroxidase activity of SSP was low when compared with horseradish peroxidase. To explore the function of SSP and other stigmatic peroxidases, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in stigmas of S. squalidus were investigated. Relatively large amounts of ROS, principally H 2 O 2, were detected in S. squalidus stigmas where most ROS/H 2 O 2 was localized to the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae,</b> the location of SSP. These observations are discussed in the context of possible functions for SSP, other peroxidases, and ROS in the stigmas of angiosperms...|$|R
40|$|Many {{flowering}} plants possess systems of self-incompatibility (SI) to prevent inbreeding. In Brassica, SI recognition {{is controlled by}} the multiallelic gene complex (S-haplotypes) at the S-locus, which encodes both the male determinant S-locus protein 11 (SP 11 /SCR) and the female determinant S-receptor kinase (SRK). Upon self-pollination, the S-haplotype–specific interaction between the pollen-borne SP 11 and the cognate stigmatic SRK receptor induces SI signaling in the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papilla</b> cell and results in rejection of the self-pollen. Our genetic analysis of a self-compatible mutant revealed the involvement of a cytoplasmic protein kinase, M-locus protein kinase (MLPK), in the SI signaling, but its exact physiological function remains unknown. In this study, we identified two different MLPK transcripts, MLPKf 1 and MLPKf 2, which are produced using alternative transcriptional initiation sites and encode two isoforms that differ only at the N termini. While MLPKf 1 and MLPKf 2 exhibited distinct expression profiles, both were expressed in papilla cells. MLPKf 1 localizes to the plasma membrane through its N-terminal myristoylation motif, while MLPKf 2 localizes to the plasma membrane through its N-terminal hydrophobic region. Although both MLPKf 1 and MLPKf 2 could independently complement the mlpk/mlpk mutation, their mutant forms that lack the plasma membrane localization motifs failed to complement the mutation. Furthermore, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay revealed direct interactions between SRK and the MLPK isoforms in planta. These results suggest that MLPK isoforms localize to the papilla cell membrane and interact directly with SRK to transduce SI signaling...|$|E
40|$|Seeds {{and grains}} are staple food supply {{around the world}} and their {{production}} is the result of successful double fertilization of female gametophytes by male gametophytes. In flowering plants, the highly reduced haploid male gametophyte (pollen grain) plays a critical role in fertilization and crop production through the generation of a pollen tube that delivers the male gametes (two sperm cells) to the egg and central cells within the female gametophyte (embryo sac) for double fertilization. Double fertilization and the functional specialization of the male gametophyte are two key innovations behind the evolutionary success of angiosperms. Pollen tube elongation involves typical polar cell growth and provides a marvelous system to study the fundamental events of morphogenesis, cellular compartmentation and signalling networks in establishing and maintaining cellular identities. Furthermore, pollen germination on the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papilla</b> cell surface and pollen tube elongation in the style offer an exceptional system to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell communication and signalling. Here, we summarize current knowledge and important discoveries of genes/proteins and mechanisms essential for pollen germination, pollen tube elongation and guidance in the style that highlight new insights into the elements regulating the complex interaction between these two partners during fertilization. In addition, during the past decade, study of plant biology has been enhanced by the development of advanced instruments and valuable data: highly annotated genomes, comprehensive genetic and transcriptomic resources, readily available T-DNA insertional mutants and revolutionary microscope and imaging systems. The simultaneous availability of these tremendous resources and tools opens a new era to conduct genome-wide and systematic investigation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing pollen germination and tube elongation...|$|E
60|$|With many heterostyled plants {{the stigma}} differs in {{roughness}} {{in the two}} forms, and when {{this is the case}} there is no known exception to the rule that the papillae on the stigma of the long-styled form are longer and often thicker than those on that of the short-styled. For instance, the papillae on the long-styled stigma of Hottonia palustris are more than twice the length of those in the other form. This holds good even in the case of Houstonia coerulea, in which the stigmas are much shorter and stouter in the long-styled than in the short-styled form, for the papillae on the former compared with those on the latter are as 100 to 58 in length. The length of the pistil in the long-styled form of Linum grandiflorum varies much, and the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> vary in a corresponding manner. From this fact I inferred at first that in all cases the difference in length between the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> in the two forms was one merely of correlated growth; but this can hardly be the true or general explanation, as the shorter stigmas of the long-styled form of Houstonia have the longer papillae. It is a more probable view that the papillae, which render the stigma of the long-styled form of various species rough, serve to entangle effectually the large-sized pollen-grains brought by insects from the short-styled form, thus ensuring its legitimate fertilisation. This view is supported {{by the fact that the}} pollen-grains from the two forms of eight species in Table 6.34 hardly differ in diameter, and the papillae on their stigmas do not differ in length.|$|R
50|$|The {{style is}} a narrow upward {{extension}} of the ovary, connecting it to the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae.</b> It may be absent in some plants in the case the stigma {{is referred to as}} sessile. Styles are generally tube-like — either long or short. The style can be open (containing few or no cells in the central portion) with a central canal which may be filled with mucilage. Alternatively the style may be closed (densely packed with cells throughout). Most syncarpous monocots and some eudicots have open styles, while many syncarpous eudicots and grasses have closed (solid) styles containing specialised secretory transmitting tissue tissue, linking the stigma to the centre of the ovary. This forms a nutrient rich tract for pollen tube growth.|$|R

In the latter the anthers are longer, and the divergent stigmas decidedly longer and apparently thinner than in the long-styled form. Owing to the state of the specimens, I could not decide whether the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> were longer in the one form than in the other.

Cardosin B was successfully expressed both in Arabidopsis and Tobacco plants, where it accumulated mainly in the vacuole but it was also detected in the cell wall. The glycosylation pattern of cardosin B was replicated in these systems—high-mannose type glycans. In tobacco leaves, cardosin B is transported through the Golgi in a RAB-D 2 a-dependent route, and is delivered to the vacuole via the prevacuolar compartment in a RAB-F 2 b-dependent pathway...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Penetration of pollen tubes through stigmatic tissues in Brassica napus L. {{may involve}} {{the release of}} cell wall modifying enzymes from the pollen tube tip. We have {{examined}} {{the expression of a}} pectin-degrading polygalacturonase (PG) enzyme in unpollinated and early and late pollinated stigmas via immunoblotting and immuno light microscopy using a PG polyclonal antibody. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that PG enzyme was present at low levels in unpollinated stigmas and at high levels in pollinated stigmas. The level of PG did not detectably increase between early and late pollinated stigmas. Immuno light microscopy demonstrated that PG enzyme was present in ungerminated pollen grains, <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> and in the tip of pollen tubes growing into the papillar wall. This latter evidence suggests that PG enzyme may {{play an important role in}} papillar cell wall penetration during pollination although other interpretations of the role of pollen PG should not be discounted...|$|R

40|$|An {{anhydrous}} fixation {{method has}} been used to examine the de- and rehydration of pollen grains of Brassica oleracea, and to follow their early development after both compatible and incompatible intraspecific pollinations. Conventional water-based fixation techniques were shown to present a very artefactual image. Using the anhydrous method, specific stages of de- and rehydration were recognized in the pollen cytoplasm, and the most dehydrated grains were found not to possess an organized plasma membrane, but rather a superficial mosaic composed of vesicles, membranes and granules. The surface of the <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> and of the pollen grain coating appear to be structurally adapted for the passage of metered quantities of water into the pollen grain. Evidence is presented that the self-incompatibility mechanism operating in these plants consists of a recognition stage occurring at the interface between the stigmatic pellicle and a membrane-like investment of the pollen coating, and a response phase involving the translocation of an inhibitor into the pollen grain cytoplasm. Since this system may be overridden by changes either in the plant or in its environment, the mechanism would seem to be uniquely adapted to changes in breeding strategy. © 1985...|$|R

Research focused on observation of compatibility and morphological analysis of the micro-gametophyte (characterization of pollen grain shape, viability and germination ability) and the macro-gametophyte (morpho-anatomic analysis of stigma structure by Scanning Electron Microscope observations). Directly on the stigmatic surface, observations were also carried out on pollen-pistil interaction, pollen retention on the stigma and germination ability. Moreover the pollen tube elongation in the style up to the ovary was observed. Results showed no anomaly involving the micro-gametophyte. Self-compatibility of the variety was confirmed, but poor pollen retention on the stigma was found, together with slow elongation of the pollen tube up to the ovary.

To investigate its role, we used a DEXAMETHASONE (DEX) -inducible system to generate transgenic plants that overexpressed a fusion of KNAT 2 with the hormone binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor. DEX-induced plants were similar to plants overexpressing the closely related KNAT 1 gene, indicating overlapping functions, although we observed differences as well. In particular, KNAT 2 -GR activation induced ectopic carpel features. First, KNAT 2 induced the homeotic conversion of nucellus into carpel-like structures. Second, KNAT 2 induced <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> on rosette leaves in the ap 2 - 5 background. Third, ectopic expression of the carpel identity gene AGAMOUS (AG) was observed in carpels and ovules. Interestingly, the homeotic conversion was not dependent on AG activity, because it was maintained in the ag- 1 ap 2 - 5 double mutant.

40|$|Cardosin A is an RGD-containing aspartic proteinase {{from the}} <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> of Cynara cardunculus L. A {{putative}} cardosin A-binding protein {{has previously been}} isolated from pollen suggesting its potential involvement in pollen 2013 pistil interaction [Faro C, Ramalho-Santos M, Vieira M, Mendes A, Simões I, Andrade R, Verissimo P, Lin X, Tang J & Pires E (1999) J Biol Chem 274, 28724201328729]. Here we report the identification of phospholipase D 03 B 1 as a cardosin A-binding protein. The interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation studies and pull-down assays. To investigate the structural and molecular determinants involved in the interaction, pull-down assays with cardosin A and various glutathione S-transferase-fused phospholipase D 03 B 1 constructs were performed. Results revealed that the C 2 domain of phospholipase D 03 B 1 contains the cardosin A-binding activity. Further assays with mutated recombinant forms of cardosin A showed that the RGD motif {{as well as the}} unprecedented KGE motif, which is structurally and charge-wise very similar to RGD, are indispensable for the interaction. Taken together our results indicate that the C 2 domain of plant phospholipase D 03 B 1 can act as a cardosin A-binding domain and suggest that plant C 2 domains may have an additional role as RGD/KGE-recognition domains.

Experiments were conducted to evaluate the reproductive biology, cytology and phenology of the Australian everlasting daisy Rhodanthe anthemoides and related species. The principal objective was {{the development of new}} cultivars with novel bract colours and an assessment of intra-specific variation, mutation breeding and inter-specific hybridisation with R. diffusa, R. manglesii and R. chlorocephala subsp. rosea was carried out. R. anthemoides is a variable eastern state species and plants collected from the New England region of N. S. W have a chromosome number of 2 n= 22 as does R. diffusa. Other distinct morphological types of R. anthemoides, mostly from the Alpine regions of N. S. W, returned counts of 2 n- 22 indicating that this species is cytologically divergent and in need of botanical revision with the recognition of at least one new species. R. anthemoides is outbreeding and features a conspicuous involcure, protandry and long <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> which aid in pollen presentation and favours insect pollination. The stigma in this species becomes receptive before it is fully exposed and remains receptive for at least 8 days. All of the above species are strongly self-compatible and in R. anthemoides the SI system functions by inhibiting pollen tube penetration of the stigma.

40|$|Two MADS box genes, Lily MADS Box Gene 2 (LMADS 2) and Eustoma grandiflorum MADS Box Gene 1 (EgMADS 1), with an {{extensive}} similarity to the petunia (Petunia hybrida) FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 7 / 11 and Arabidopsis AGL 11, were characterized from the lily (Lilium longiflorum) and lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum). The expression of LMADS 2 and EgMADS 1 mRNA {{was restricted to}} the carpel and was absent in the other flower organs or vegetative leaves. LMADS 2 mRNA was detected mainly in ovules and weakly in style tissues of the carpel, whereas EgMADS 1 mRNA was only expressed in the ovules. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing LMADS 2 or EgMADS 1 showed similar novel phenotypes resembling 35 S::AGAMOUS plants by significantly reducing plant size, flowering early, and losing inflorescence indeterminacy. Ectopic expression of these two genes also generated similar ap 2 -like flowers by inducing homeotic conversion of the sepals into carpel-like structures in which <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> and ovules were observed. In addition, the petals were converted into stamen-like structures in the second whorl of 35 S::LMADS 2 and 35 S::EgMADS 1 transgenic Arabidopsis. Our data indicated that LMADS 2 and EgMADS 1 are putative D functional MADS box genes in lily and lisianthus with a function similar to C functional genes once ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{development}} in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. cv. Columbia plants was investigated under spaceflight conditions on shuttle mission STS- 51. Plants launched {{just prior to}} initiation of the reproductive phase developed flowers and siliques during the 10 -d flight. Approximately 500 flowers were produced in total by the 12 plants in both the ground control and spaceflight material, {{and there was no}} significant difference in the number of flowers in each size class. The flower buds and siliques of the spaceflight plants were not morphologically different from the ground controls. Pollen viability tests immediately post-flight using fluorescein diacetate indicated that about 35 % of the pollen was viable in the spaceflight material. Light-microscopy observations on this material showed that the female gametophytes also had developed normally to maturity. However, siliques from the spaceflight plants contained empty, shrunken ovules, and no evidence of pollen transfer to <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> was found by light microscopy immediately post-flight or by scanning electron microscopy on fixed material. Short stamen length and indehiscent anthers were observed in the spaceflight material, and a film-like substance inside the anther that connected to the tapetum appeared to restrict the release of pollen from the anthers. These observations indicate that given appropriate growing conditions, early reproductive {{development in}} A. thaliana can occur normally under spaceflight conditions. On STS- 51, reproductive development aborted due to obstacles in pollination or fertilization...|$|R
60|$|This {{species is}} conspicuously heterostyled, {{as has been}} noticed by several authors. The pistil in the long-styled form is nearly {{twice as long as}} that of the short-styled. In the latter the stigmas are smaller and, {{diverging}} to a greater degree, pass out low down between the filaments. I could detect no difference in the two forms {{in the size of the}} <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae.</b> In the long- styled form alone the stigmatic surfaces of the mature pistils twist round, so as to face the circumference of the flower; but to this point I shall presently return. Differently from what occurs in L. grandiflorum, the long-styled flowers have stamens hardly more than half the length of those in the short-styled. The size of the pollen-grains is rather variable; after some doubt, I have come to the conclusion that there is no uniform difference between the grains in the two forms. The long-stamens in the short-styled form project to some height above the corolla, and their filaments are coloured blue apparently from exposure to the light. The anthers of the longer stamens correspond in height with the lower part of the stigmas of the long-styled flowers; and the anthers of the shorter stamens of the latter correspond in the same manner in height with the stigmas of the short-styled flowers.|$|R
40|$|Ovules are {{specialized}} {{reproductive organs}} that develop within the carpels of higher plants. In Arabidopsis, mutations in two genes, BELL 1 (BEL 1) and APETALA 2 (AP 2), disrupt ovule development. In Bel 1 ovules, the inner integument fails to form, the outer integument develops abnormally, and the embryo sac arrests at a late stage of megagametogenesis. During later stages of ovule development, {{cells of the}} outer integument of a Bel 1 ovule sometimes develop into a carpel-like structure with <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> and second-order ovules. The frequency of carpel-like structures was highest when plants were grown under conditions that normally induced flowering and was correlated with ectopic expression in the ovule of AGAMOUS (AG), an organ-identity gene required for carpel formation. Together, these results suggested that BEL 1 negatively regulates AG late in ovule development. Likewise, mutants homozygous for the strong AP 2 allele ap 2 - 6 sometimes displayed structures with carpel-like features in place of ovules. However, such abnormal Ap 2 ovules are much less ovulelike in morphology and form earlier than the Bel 1 carpel-like structures. Because one role of the AP 2 gene is to negatively regulate AG expression early in flower development, {{it is possible that}} AP 2 works in a similar manner in the ovule. A novel ovule phenotype observed in Bel 1 /Ap 2 - 6 double mutants suggested that BEL 1 and AP 2 genes function independently during ovule development...|$|R
40|$|On 9 th July, 1977, {{we found}} a single plant of the hybrid Senecio squalidus L. x S. vulgaris L. on sandy ground {{on the top of}} a disused railway {{embankment}} between Toft and Bourn, Cambs., v. c. 29, GR 52 / 338. 558; specimens are in herb. A. C. Leslie and CGE. A description of the plant follows: Plant 47 cm; stock 1 · 5 cm, short, thick; stems numerous, erect, much branched. Lower leaves all shrivelled or eaten by larvae of cinnabar moth (Callimorphajacobaeae) at time of gathering; upper leaves narrowly lanceolate, shallowly lobed or toothed, auriculate. Capitula numerous, ± cylindrical or narrowly ovoid, c 9 - 12 mm diameter; rays 7 - 9 (- 13 in cultivation), 3 - 4 mm long, eventually reflexed and coiled. Anthers with 14 % stainable pollen grains. Elongated <b>stigmatic</b> <b>papillae</b> fewer and more variable in length than in S. squalidus. Achenes pale and shrivelled. Chromosome no. 2 n = 30 (counts from six cells). This is the first record of this hybrid in Cambridgeshire and only the third cytologically confirmed British record. Stace (1977) reported two counts (one from Manchester, the other from Leicester), both from plants in long-established mixed populations of the parents. Senecio cambrensis Rosser is thought to have arisen from such a hybrid by chromosome doubling. The sterile triploid is the plant Druce called S. x baxleri, the correct citation for which is as follows...|$|R
