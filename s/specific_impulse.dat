25|$|A more {{conventional}} bipropellant could {{more than double}} the <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> However, although the exhaust gases from the peroxide-based engine are very hot, they are still significantly cooler than those generated by alternative propellants. Using a peroxide-based propellant greatly reduces the risk of a fire/explosion which would cause severe injury to the operator.|$|E
25|$|Based on work in {{the late}} 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been {{technically}} possible to build spaceships with nuclear pulse propulsion engines, i.e. driven {{by a series of}} nuclear explosions. This propulsion system contains the prospect of very high <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (space travel's equivalent of fuel economy) and high specific power.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the first}} stage of the Saturn V, {{carrying}} the weight of the upper stages, was able to achieve a mass ratio of about 10, and achieved a <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> of 263 seconds. This gives a delta-v of around 5.9km/s whereas around 9.4km/s delta-v is needed to achieve orbit with all losses allowed for.|$|E
40|$|The highly {{successful}} demonstration of ion propulsion on Deep Space 1 has stimulated {{the study of}} more demanding applications of ion propulsion. These future applications require ion thrusters capable of providing significantly greater <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> and total impulses than the current state-of-the-art Higher <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> aggravate the known wear out mechanisms of the ion accelerator system...|$|R
5000|$|Here {{are some}} {{examples}} of fuels, the energy conversion fractions and the corresponding <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> (assuming no losses): ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} using a continuous electromagnetic, or J X B, body force {{to accelerate the}} plasma. Argon and helium plasmas were accelerated in a cylindrical channel after a free jet had been established. The <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> and efficiencies obtained by expanding helium through an arc-jet-nozzle arrangement is compared to the <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> and efficiencies obtained using a continuous electromagnetic field to accelerate the gas. The dependence of the electromagnetic body force upon the accelerating arc current was found, in general, to agree with theoretical predictions...|$|R
25|$|The great {{disadvantage}} is {{the limited}} operating time. The jet of steam and oxygen can provide significant thrust from fairly lightweight rockets, but the jet has {{a relatively low}} exhaust velocity and hence a poor <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> Currently, such rocket belts can only fly for about 30 seconds (because of the limited amount of fuel the user can carry unassisted).|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1956 {{it became}} clear that the {{complexity}} of the ambitious design meant that 'Object D' could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> produced by the completed R-7 engines (304 sec instead of the planned 309 to 310 sec). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958. Object D would later fly as Sputnik 3.|$|E
25|$|The X-15 {{reaction}} control system (RCS), for maneuvering in low-pressure/density environment, used high-test peroxide (HTP), which decomposes into water and {{oxygen in the}} presence of a catalyst and could provide a <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> of 140 seconds. The HTP also fueled a turbopump for the main engines and auxiliary power units (APUs). Additional tanks for helium and liquid nitrogen performed other functions, for example the fuselage interior was purged with helium gas, and the liquid nitrogen was used as coolant for various systems.|$|E
40|$|A 0. 46 meter {{diameter}} Hall thruster was fabricated {{and performance}} tested at powers up to 72 kilowatts. Thrusts up to 2. 9 Newtons were measured. Discharge <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> ranged from 1750 to 3250 seconds with discharge efficiencies between 46 and 65 percent. Overall <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> ranged from 1550 to 3050 seconds with overall efficiencies between 40 and 57 percent. Performance data indicated significant fraction of multiple-charged ions during operation at elevated power levels. Cathode {{mass flow rate}} was {{shown to be a}} significant parameter with regard to thruster efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The end-Hall {{thruster}} {{can provide}} electric propulsion with fixed masses, <b>specific</b> <b>impulses,</b> and power-to-thrust ratios intermediate of an arcjet and a gridded (electrostatic) ion thruster. With these characteristics, this thruster {{is a candidate}} for missions of intermediate difficulty, such as the north-south stationkeeping of geostationary satellites...|$|R
50|$|From 1987 through 1991, the SDI Office funded Project Timberwind, a {{non-rotating}} nuclear thermal rocket {{based on}} particle bed technology. Although {{the project was}} canceled before testing in 1992 by the incoming Clinton Administration, the design was thought to achieve thrust-to-weight ratios of 30:1 and <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> of at least 1000 seconds.|$|R
25|$|An {{antimatter}} rocket {{would have}} a far higher energy density and <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> than any other proposed class of rocket. If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make antimatter in the quantities required and store it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light. Whether antimatter propulsion {{could lead to the}} higher speeds (>90% that of light) at which relativistic time dilation would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers as perceived by an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of antimatter that would be required.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper stage}} of the Delta IV, or DCSS, {{is based on the}} Delta III upper stage, but with {{increased}} propellant capacity. The 4-meter (13.1ft) version uses lengthened propellant tanks, while the 5-meter version has a 5-meter diameter liquid hydrogen tank and a further lengthened liquid oxygen tank. The second stage is powered by a RL10B2 engine, which features an extendable carbon-carbon nozzle to improve <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> Depending on variant, two different interstages are used to mate the first and second stages. A tapering interstage which narrows down from 5 m to 4 m in diameter is used on 4-meter variants, where a cylindrical interstage is used on 5-meter variants. Both interstages are built from composites.|$|E
25|$|As a side effect, these {{pressures}} on the rocket also act on the exhaust {{in the opposite direction}} and accelerate this exhaust to very high speeds (according to Newton's Third Law). From the principle of conservation of momentum the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant. This is called the rocket's <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> Because a rocket, propellant and exhaust in flight, without any external perturbations, may be considered as a closed system, the total momentum is always constant. Therefore, the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction, the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve in the opposite direction. This is especially true since the rocket body's mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass.|$|E
5000|$|... Sizing, which principally calculates mass, power, {{mass flow}} rate, thrust for both {{chemical}} and electric propulsion system;- Thermodynamics, evaluating <b>specific</b> <b>impulses,</b> combustion chamber and nozzle characteristics. Additionally, it performs a complete sizing for the liquid propulsion system;- Storage and Feed, where oxidiser and fuel characteristics plus bulk density and volume are determined.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear thermal rocket engines {{differ from}} {{conventional}} rocket engines in that thrust is created strictly through thermodynamic phenomena, with no chemical reaction. The nuclear rocket typically operates by passing hydrogen gas through a superheated nuclear core. Testing in the 1960s yielded <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> of about 850 seconds (8,340 m/s), about {{twice that of}} the Space Shuttle engines.|$|R
40|$|A rocket using atomic {{hydrogen}} propellant is discussed. An essential {{feature of the}} proposed engine is that the {{atomic hydrogen}} fuel is used as it is produced, thus eliminating the necessity of storage. The atomic hydrogen flows into a combustion chamber and recombines, producing high velocity molecular hydrogen which flows out an exhaust port. Standard thermodynamics, kinetic theory and wall recombination cross-sections are used to predict a thrust of approximately 1. 4 N for a RF hydrogen flow rate of 4 x 10 to the 22 nd/sec. <b>Specific</b> <b>impulses</b> are nominally from 1000 to 2000 sec. It is predicted that thrusts {{on the order of}} one Newton and <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> of up to 2200 sec are attainable with nominal RF discharge fluxes on the order of 10 to the 22 nd atoms/sec; further refinements will probably not alter these predictions by more than a factor of two...|$|R
25|$|Solid fuel rockets {{can remain}} stored for years, and is {{generally}} {{very difficult to}} ignite without {{an extended period of}} applied flame. This means they can be manhandled safely, and maintained with the rocket motor installed. However, the lower <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> of these engines, combined with the requirement for longer range, demanded a much larger weapon to store the required fuel. Hercules, still known officially as Nike B at this point, grew to become a much larger design. This, in turn, required a much larger booster to loft it, but this was solved by strapping together four of the existing Nike boosters to form a cluster known as the XM-42, with the only modification to the original M5 engine design being the addition of new holes to bolt them together, creating the M5E.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then throttles down to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine throttles down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine throttles back up to 102% before throttling back down to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{significant}} engineering failure, {{as noted by}} division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen was unsuitable {{for use as a}} rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> as compared to the US F-1 rocket engine in addition to using the very advanced full-flow staged combustion concept as opposed to the simple gas generator cycle used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion because Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia superbooster, and is probably the finest technical example of Glushko's abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program {{is a testament to the}} paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.|$|E
40|$|Compounds {{consisting}} of a carbon-based cage have a highly strained molecular structure and have become the subject of interest in recent years because they possess high heat of formation and so are highly energetic. In the present work, ab initio molecular modelling calculations {{have been used for}} analysing 28 carbon-cage structures with the aim of identifying the best candidates for synthesis particularly for use in propellant compositions. Density functional theory (B 3 LYP) was employed for the geometry optimisation of the proposed molecules using the 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) basis set. Calculated heats of formation and densities of the compounds have been used from the optimized structures to compute their <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> and density <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> in various configurations (solid and liquid) with an eye on propulsion applications. Detonation properties of the compounds have also been reported and comments have been made correlating the properties of the cage compounds with their molecular structures...|$|R
50|$|Class 1.1 {{solid rocket}} fuels are {{susceptible}} to sympathetic detonation. Conversely, class 1.3 fuels can be ignited by a nearby fire or explosion, but are generally not susceptible to sympathetic detonation. Class 1.1 fuels, however, tend to have slightly higher <b>specific</b> <b>impulses,</b> and therefore are used in those military applications where weight and/or size is at a premium, e.g. on ballistic and cruise missile submarines.|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{propulsion}} systems offer high <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> (greater than 1500) and high thrust-density {{as compared to}} conventional chemical rocket propulsion system. Understanding and simulating the physical processes in electromagnetic propulsion devices (as well as testing with refined diagnostic equipment) {{hold the key to}} improved performance and longevity of these devices. This in turn is an essential requirement for a practical application in future space endevors...|$|R
500|$|The engine {{produces}} a <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (Isp) of [...] in a vacuum, or [...] at sea level, has {{a mass of}} approximately , and is capable of throttling between 67% and 109% of its rated power level in one-percent increments. The RS-25 operates at temperatures ranging from [...] to 3300°C (6000°F).|$|E
500|$|Argon {{is used as}} a {{propellant}} in {{the development}} of the Variable <b>Specific</b> <b>Impulse</b> Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR). [...] Compressed argon gas is allowed to expand, to cool the seeker heads of some versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile and other missiles that use cooled thermal seeker heads. The gas is stored at high pressure.|$|E
500|$|The missile's {{propulsion}} system consisted of four XLR35-RM-1 engines, built by Reaction Motors Inc., which produced 2,000 pounds-force (8,900 Newtons) each and could independently swivel {{up to ten}} degrees either direction. The gimballing motion was used to control the flight path of the missile, replacing {{the system of the}} V-2 missile that used moving fins placed within a fixed engine. The gimbal system adds complexity to the engine mounting but preserves more of the energy of the rocket exhaust during maneuvering. The engines had a <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> of [...] sea level.|$|E
40|$|A model K 10 K {{resistojet}} {{produced by}} FAKEL Enterprise was evaluated at steady-state conditions with both nitrogen and xenon propellants. Performance and operational characteristics were documented for cold gas and heater power levels up to 8 W at mass flow rates from 0. 02 to 0. 2 g/s. Maximum <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> of 84 s on nitrogen and 49 s on xenon were achieved {{at the highest}} specific power levels tested...|$|R
50|$|However, Hall {{thrusters}} {{operate at}} the high <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> that is typical for electric propulsion. One particular advantage of Hall thrusters, as compared to a gridded ion thruster, is that the generation and acceleration of the ions {{takes place in a}} quasi-neutral plasma, so there is no Child-Langmuir charge (space charge) saturated current limitation on the thrust density. This allows much smaller thrusters compared to gridded ion thrusters.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of quasisteady multimegawatt MPD thrusters is significantly affected by anode thickness, location, and orifice radius, and by cathode length. Terminal voltage oscillations and electrode erosion are deferred until higher currents by anodes at more downstream locations and of smaller orifice radius and by cathodes of greater length. Without an optimized geometry, <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> of 3300 s and thrust efficiencies up to 31 % are {{implied by the}} best data...|$|R
500|$|Block IIA (RS-25C) – First flown on STS-89, the Block IIA {{engine was}} an interim model used whilst certain {{components}} of the Block II engine completed development. Changes included a new large throat main combustion chamber (which had originally been recommended by Rocketdyne in 1980), improved low pressure turbopumps and certification for 104.5% RPL to compensate for a [...] reduction in <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (original plans called for the engine to be certified to 106% for heavy International Space Station payloads, {{but this was not}} required and would have reduced engine service life). A slightly modified version first flew on STS-96.|$|E
500|$|Because the SABRE engine {{uses the}} {{atmosphere}} as reaction mass at low altitude, {{it will have}} a high <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (around [...] for SABRE 4, or [...] for SABRE 3), and burn about one fifth of the propellant that would have been required by a conventional rocket. Therefore, Skylon would be able to take off with much less total propellant than conventional systems. The weight reduction enabled by the lower quantity of propellant needed meant that the vehicle would not require as much lift or thrust, which in turn permits the use of smaller engines and allows for the use of a conventional wing configuration. While flying within the atmosphere, the use of wings to counteract gravity drag is more fuel-efficient than simply expelling propellant (as in a rocket), which again serves to reduce the total amount of propellant needed. The payload fraction would be significantly greater than normal rockets and the vehicle should be fully reusable, capable of performing in excess of 200 launches.|$|E

50|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of the system is}} surprising; <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> of greater than 100,000s are possible using existing materials. This is high performance, although not that which the technically daunting antimatter rocket could achieve, and the weight of the reactor core and other elements would make the overall performance of the fission-fragment system lower. Nonetheless, the system provides the sort of performance levels that would make an interstellar precursor mission possible.|$|R
40|$|A summary is {{presented}} of QED fusion-direct-electric engine systems, their features, and performance ranges. The principles {{and characteristics of}} inertial-electrostatic-fusion (IEF) power source systems are then reviewed, and their application to the diluted-fusion-product (DFP) engine concept for QIS missions is discussed. Particular attention is given to vehicle performance over a range of very high <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> and to specifications of a typical candidate DFP/IEF engine and a single-stage vehicle for rapid flight to 550 AU...|$|R
