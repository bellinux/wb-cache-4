50|$|Art Radio {{claims the}} most {{complete}} CD and LP library of world oldies standards, including some very valuable rare archive records from original <b>sound</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|This ensures video interoperability. However, as some {{of these}} {{standards}} (B/G/H, I and D/K) use different <b>sound</b> <b>carriers</b> (5.5 MHz, 6.0 MHz 6.5 MHz respectively), it {{may result in a}} video image without audio when viewing a signal broadcast over the air or cable. Some countries in Eastern Europe which formerly used SECAM with systems D and K have switched to PAL while leaving other aspects of their video system the same, resulting in the different <b>sound</b> <b>carrier.</b> Instead, other European countries have changed completely from SECAM-D/K to PAL-B/G.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} the IF signal {{consists}} of a video carrier signal at one frequency and the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> at a fixed offset. A demodulator recovers the video signal. Also at {{the output of the}} same demodulator is a new frequency modulated <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as intercarrier sound, and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.|$|R

40|$|The {{experimentally}} observed disappearance below T = 0. 5 K of the <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> {{in liquid}} He II {{as a separate}} wave mode and its subsequent propagation {{at the speed of}} the first sound (Peshkov [3]) may be interpreted as a resonant mode conversion of the <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> to the first sound. Near the resonant mode coupling point T = T*, where the frequencies of the two waves become equal, the anomalous effect of entropy changes on the first sound and density changes on the <b>second</b> <b>sound,</b> though generally small, become significant. This leads to the resonant mode coupling of the first <b>sound</b> and the <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> and forces them to lose their identities and hence pave the way for the resonant mode conversion of the <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> to the first sound.

40|$|Three {{dimensionality}} of 3 D pulsed <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> wave in He II {{emitted from}} a finite size heater is experimentally investigated and theoretically studied based on two-fluid model in this study.

The counterflow between the superfluid and normal fluid components becomes inverse in the rarefaction of 3 D <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> wave. The amplitude of rarefaction decreases due to the interaction between <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> wave and quantized vortices, which explains the experimental results about <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> wave near [Phys.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been renewed {{interest}} in <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> in superfluid Bose and Fermi gases. By using two-fluid hydrodynamic theory, we review the density response χ_nn(,ω) of these systems {{as a tool to}} identify <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> in experiments based on density probes. Our work generalizes the well-known studies of the dynamic structure factor S(,ω) in superfluid ^ 4 He in the critical region. We show that, in the unitary limit of uniform superfluid Fermi gases, the relative weight of <b>second</b> vs. first <b>sound</b> in the compressibility sum rule is given by the Landau [...] Placzek ratio ≡ (c̅_p-c̅_v) /c̅_v for all temperatures below T_c. In contrast to superfluid ^ 4 He, is much larger in strongly interacting Fermi gases, being already of order unity for T ∼ 0. 8 T_c, thereby providing promising opportunities to excite <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> with density probes. The relative weights of first and <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> are quite different in S(,ω) (measured in pulse propagation studies) as compared to Imχ_nn(,ω) (measured in two-photon Bragg scattering). We show that first and <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> in S(,ω) in a strongly interacting Bose-condensed gas are similar to those in a Fermi gas at unitarity. However, in a weakly interacting Bose gas, first and <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> are mainly uncoupled oscillations of the thermal cloud and condensate, respectively, and <b>second</b> <b>sound</b> has most of the spectral weight in S(,ω).
