5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was advisable. Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

25|$|Milkovich filed suit, {{alleging that}} the {{suggestion}} that he had lied had defamed him. Since perjury is a felony in Ohio, the statements {{were found to be}} defamatory and Milkovich was ruled a private figure, both of which were helpful to his case. However, the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the newspaper since it found Diadiun's column to be a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> which cannot be libelous, {{and that there was no}} actual malice, per Sullivan. Milkovich appealed to the Ohio Eleventh District Court of Appeals, which found that there was actual malice. In turn, the newspaper appealed to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed it on the grounds that there were no significant constitutional issues. In 1979 the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.|$|E

2500|$|According to Gordon v Selico [...] it is {{possible}} to misrepresent either by words or conduct. Generally, statements of opinion or intention are not statements of fact in the context of misrepresentation.

This was unwise; a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> from a Nobel prize winner was taken as a statement of fact. The next day, the Sunday newspapers were covered {{with the news that}} fusion had been achieved in ZETA, often with claims about how the UK was now far in the lead in fusion research.

It is hypothesized that these opinions will change and reflect positive attitudes towards the school in relation to the amount of contact experienced. The recording of the survey begins by referring to the paucity of research material on the subject; it continues by describing the method of collecting data on initial <b>opinions</b> by means <b>of</b> interviews, questionnaires and a <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinions</b> check sheet; it then analyses changes <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> by comparing the data of the later August <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinions</b> return with the earlier February one; and finally suggests reasons for change by analysing correlations of parental contact and increased positive attitude.

2500|$|Though a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> is {{generally}} not actionable as a misrepresentation, by giving an opinion a party may be held to have represented that they had better knowledge about certain facts. For instance in Smith v Land and House Property Corporation Bowen LJ held that Mr Smith could not enforce a contract against LHP to buy his property, because he had advertised that the current tenant, Mr Fleck, was [...] "most desirable". In fact, as Mr Smith knew, Mr Fleck had been missing his rent payments and was then declared bankrupt. So even though [...] "most desirable" [...] is an evaluative statement {{it is still a}} misrepresentation because it warrants the statement maker has good knowledge of certain facts.|$|E

2500|$|Observers and First Amendment law experts had {{expected}} that the Court would formalize its observation in Gertz that [...] "there {{is no such thing}} as a false idea" [...] into an opinion privilege against libel claims, expanding the traditional fair comment defense.

5000|$|Another {{important}} aspect of defamation {{is the difference between}} fact and opinion. Statements made as [...] "facts" [...] are frequently actionable defamation. <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> or pure opinion are not actionable. Some jurisdictions decline to recognize any legal distinction between fact and opinion. To win damages in a libel case, the plaintiff must first show that the statements were [...] "statements of fact or mixed <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and fact" [...] and second that these statements were false. Conversely, a typical defense to defamation is that the statements are opinion, relying on <b>opinion</b> privilege. One <b>of</b> the major tests to distinguish whether a statement is fact or opinion is whether the statement can be proved true or false in a court of law. If the statement can be proved true or false, then, on that basis, the case will be heard by a jury to determine whether it is true or false. If the statement cannot be proved true or false, the court may dismiss the libel case without it ever going to a jury to find facts in the case.|$|R
