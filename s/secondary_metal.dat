50|$|Goldsmiths {{used the}} {{techniques}} of soldering, plating and gilding to create a larger workable surface or to cover a <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> with {{a thin layer of}} gold for jewelry design. First, the goldsmith would start with a gold ingot, which would then be hammered into a sheet, a foil or a leaf of gold. Soldering is the process of joining together multiple sheets of metal to create a single larger piece. The way this was achieved was by using a more impure form of gold - that is one with a higher percent of non-gold metals - as a joining tool. The higher the impurity of gold, the more quickly it will melt, and as such the impure gold would melt before the pure and could then be used to attach two or more pieces of purer gold. This would create a larger surface while retaining the thickness of the gold sheets. Gold sheets could be hammered to a higher level of fineness; gold foil was approximately the thickness of {{a piece of paper and}} gold leaf could be as thin as 0.005 millimeters. The process of plating involved gold foil being hammered or smoothed over a core of glass or another metal. Gilding used gold leaf adhered or pressed onto a base of terracotta or a metal such as copper. Both of these techniques allowed for jewelry to have the appearance and associated prestige of gold, without using solid gold which was rare and expensive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In Taiwan, {{secondary}} copper smelters {{and zinc}} recovery plants primarily utilize recovering metal from scrap and dross, and handles mostly fly ash and slag with high temperature to produce ZnO from the {{iron and steel}} industry. The materials may contain organic impurities, such as plastic and organic chloride chemicals, and amounts of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) are produced during the smelting process. Therefore, <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> recovery industries are major emission sources of PCDD/Fs, {{which may have been}} demonstrated to elicit oxidative stress and to involve the production of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). Many studies have also indicated that the intake of antioxidants, smoking, age and exposure to environmental pollutants may be implicated to DNA damage or lipid peroxidation. This study therefore aims to elucidate the roles of occupational exposure like joining the smelting work, age, smoking and alcohol status, and antioxidant intake on oxidative damage in <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> recovery workers in Taiwan. 73 workers were recruited from 2 <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> recovery plants.

40|$|Platinum and {{platinum}} alloy {{surfaces are}} used as catalysts to promote the reduction of oxygen, one of the reactions used to generate electrical energy in low temperature fuel cells, which are sought as promissory clean power sources. In such devices, the oxygen reduction is the slowest of the two electrode reactions, significantly affecting {{the performance of the}} fuel cell. Oxygen reduction is also important for several biological problems, such as oxygen transport in living organisms. In my research, I analyzed the effect of concentrations of a <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> on the overall mechanism of oxygen reduction on platinum alloy catalysts. I employed dynamic Monte Carlo, a simulation program that studies the kinetics of reactions, and returns relevant data that can be analyzed. To better understand how to improve the oxygen current density, I studied two different cases involving a bimetallic surface. For the first case I employed an initial <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> M at varying concentrations with a 100 % increase in activation energy for the adsorption of oxygen, but a 10 % decrease in activation energy for the other four electron transfer reactions, while the second case I kept the above values, but reduced the activation energy for the adsorption of oxygen to a 10 % increase on metal M. I discovered that between 50 to 70 % metal concentration enabled the best sites for reduction for the first case, and 50 to 90 % metal concentration enabled the best sites for reduction for the second case. This is particularly important, for if it can be discovered that a <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> mixed with platinum can yield the results I discovered, then the reduction of oxygen may become commercially feasible, reducing the cost of the catalyst needed, and by increasing the current density yield resulting in greater reduction performance...|$|E

In this perspective, a pilot plant was designed for the treatment of small WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) via hydrometallurgy. The process is based on two different leaching steps, in nitric acid and in aqua regia, followed by electrodeposition processes, to mainly recover copper, silver and gold.

40|$|Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are porous {{coordination}} polymers {{with the}} potential to excel in catalysis and gas storage/separation. This dissertation will first discuss relevant types of MOFs, their characteristics, and previous functionalization methods. To fully gauge the utility of MOFs, novel materials with tunable properties are required as are appropriate design strategies to create these materials. Of specific interest is MOFs embedded with <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> binding groups. Chapter 2 will discuss a mild method to incorporate these functional groups into MOFs. The utilization of photocleavable protecting groups, a nitrobenzyl ether masking an aryl hydroxyl group, allows for the liberation of <b>secondary</b> <b>metal</b> binding sites upon photoirradiation. By combining mixed MOF systems with photochemical and chemical modification methods, multifunctional materials can be accessed from a single starting MOF. Exploration of new postsynthetic modification reactions is explored in Chapter 3. Initial studies focused on a radical initiated photochemical-click reaction to modify a terminal alkene with a free thiol to create a thioether. Depending on the chemical stability and pore size of the MOF material, this reaction was moderately successful at best. Additionally, optimization proved to be difficult due to the number of chemical species present {{during the course of the}} reaction. A simpler click Diels-Alder cycloaddition was studied as an alternative route to modify a terminal alkene embedded inside the MOF. The cycloaddition was found to proceed only if there was sufficient space available within the MOF pores and around the alkene moiety. Finally, in Chapter 4, chemically crosslinked organic ligands are studied to probe the tolerance of certain MOFs for geometrically restricted components. Extended oligomeric ligands based on these criteria are also discussed. Even using ligands with up to four organic struts tethered together, the canonical IRMOF structure can still be formed. This indicates that the limitations of coordination polymers are much less stringent than originally though...|$|E

Seven industrial sectors and product groups form the main users of PGMs in Europe, comprising the chemical, petroleum, and glass industries; jewelry, dentistry, electronic equipment, and car catalysts. Most relevant environmental impacts of secondary production in Europe and primary PGM production in South Africa, Russia, and Canada are taken into account, including emissions of sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide and total material requirement.

Recycling is key strategy to secure the long-term supply of these metals. To determine the recycling potential, the mass and the economic value of nine metals and metal families contained in information and communications technology and consumer equipment sold in Germany in 2007 and 2012 were estimated under consideration of uncertainties. The study focused on the critical metals and metal families cobalt, gallium, indium, palladium and rare earth elements (REE), as well as tantalum and the lead metals tin, gold and silver.
