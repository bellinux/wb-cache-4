40|$|Background and Aims: The {{aetiology}} {{for chronic}} fatigue syndrome (CFS) remains elusive although enteroviruses have been implicated {{as one of the}} causes by a number of studies. Since most CFS patients have persistent or intermittent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the presence of viral capsid protein 1 (VP 1), enterovirus (EV) RNA and culturable virus in the <b>stomach</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens of patients with CFS was evaluated. Methods: 165 consecutive patients with CFS underwent upper GI endoscopies and antrum biopsies. Immunoperoxidase staining was performed using EV-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) or a control mAb specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV). RT-PCR ELISA was performed on RNA extracted from paraffin sections or samples preserved in RNA later. Biopsies from normal stomach and other gastric diseases served as controls. 75 samples were cultured for EV. Results: 135 / 165 (82 %) biopsies stained positive for VP 1 within parietal cells, whereas 7 / 34 (20 %) of the controls stained positive (p(0. 001). CMV mAb failed to stain any of the biopsy specimens. Biopsies taken from six patients {{at the onset of the}} CFS/abdominal symptoms, and 2 – 8 years later showed positive staining in the paired specimens. EV RNA was detected in 9 / 24 (37 %) paraffin-embedded biopsy samples; 1 / 21 controls had detectable EV RNA (p, 0. 01); 1 / 3 patients had detectable EV RNA from two samples taken 4 years apart; 5 patient samples showed transient growth of non-cytopathic enteroviruses. Conclusion: Enterovirus VP 1, RNA and non-cytopathic viruses were detected in the <b>stomach</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens of CFS patients with chronic abdominal complaints. A significant subset of CFS patients may have a chronic, disseminated, non-cytolytic form of enteroviral infection, which could be diagnosed by <b>stomach</b> <b>biopsy.</b> C hronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) remains an elusive disease after more than two decades of research. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{story begins}} with Dr. J. Robin Warren. Dr. Warren was a {{pathologist}} at the Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) in Western Australia. A pathologist {{is a medical}} doctor who examines tissues and {{is responsible for the}} accuracy of laboratory tests. Pathologists interpret the results of these examinations and tests and provide information important for a patient’s diagnosis and recovery. Part of Warren’s duties as a pathologist was to examine histological sections from gastric biopsies. With the arrival in the early 1970 s of the fiberoptic endoscope, it was increasingly common to find good, well-fixed sections from gastrointestinal tissue. Prior to this, it was unusual for a pathologist to see good histological sections from any part of the stomach that was not post mortem. In 1979, after examining a hematoxylinand eosin-stained section of a <b>stomach</b> <b>biopsy</b> from a man with severe gastritis, Warren noticed a thin blue line {{on the surface of the}} tissue. When he increased magnification, he thought he saw bacteria. Fig. 2. A hematoxylin and eosin stained section of a <b>stomach</b> <b>biopsy</b> showing the presence of bacteria on the surface of cells. To get a better look at these bacteria, Warren ordered a Warthin-Starry silver stain of the histological section.

We found that <b>stomach</b> <b>biopsies</b> of elderly patients expressed NOX 5 and NOX 2 mRNA, but not NOX 1. The mRNA expression of NOX 5 (a lymphocyte NADPH oxidase) neither depended on age nor on the results of the stomach histology. In contrast, mRNA expression of NOX 2 (phagocyte NADPH oxidase) was a function of two variables. Increased NOX 2 mRNA levels were observed in biopsies with signs of chronic inflammation (p= 0. 01). Interestingly, however, there was also an age-dependent increase in NOX 2 mRNA levels (p= 0. 01).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The goal of {{this study}} was to gather more {{clinical}} information about the relationship between Helico-bacter species and gastric ulceration in horses. Twenty seven privately owned patients were selected for the clinical study.

50|$|Before the {{research}} of Marshall and Warren, German scientists found spiral-shaped bacteria in {{the lining of the}} human stomach in 1875, but they were unable to culture them, and the results were eventually forgotten. The Italian researcher Giulio Bizzozero described similarly shaped bacteria living in the acidic environment of the stomach of dogs in 1893. Professor Walery Jaworski of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków investigated sediments of gastric washings obtained by lavage from humans in 1899. Among some rod-like bacteria, he also found bacteria with a characteristic spiral shape, which he called Vibrio rugula. He was the first to suggest a possible role of this organism in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases. His work was included in the Handbook of Gastric Diseases, but it had little impact, as it was written in Polish. Several small studies conducted in the early 20th century demonstrated the presence of curved rods in the stomachs of many people with peptic ulcers and stomach cancers.

In humans, leptin is produced by adipocytes, placental cells and secretory cells of the mammary epithelium. Recently, it has been reported that stomach glands produce leptin in rats. OBJECTIVE: To test the expression of leptin protein in human stomach and localize, by immunocytochemistry. the specific cell type producing leptin. DESIGN: Endoscopic <b>stomach</b> <b>biopsies</b> of six patients were used to investigate leptin production in the fundic epithelium using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of RNA. Leptin protein was detected by immunoblot analysis and localized by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry (immunogold method). RESULTS: Human gastric epithelium expresses leptin mRNA and leptin protein. The cells in the lower half of the stomach glands were immunoreactive for leptin. Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry showed leptin immunoreactivity in the pepsinogen granules of chief cells, but the granules of a specific endocrine cell type in the basal portion of the glands were also positive. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gastric leptin could function in the short-term system to control feeding behaviour and is probably secreted in the stomach lumen by chief cells and into the stomach circulation by a special type of endocrine...|$|R
