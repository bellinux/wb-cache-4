30|$|The flame <b>spheroidisation</b> {{technique}} {{is a relatively}} fast, inexpensive process which can easily be scaled-up for commercialisation purposes. However, for manufacture of larger microspheres the tube furnace process usually yields better results. There are several parameters of the flame <b>spheroidisation</b> technique which can all affect {{the outcome of the}} sphere size and shape; particle separation before entering the flame is a key criterion to obtain dispersed uniform spheres; residence time in the flame is also an important factor as larger particles will require a longer residence time for the glass to spheroidise.

Several studies have utilised varying gases to create a flame including propane/oxygen, acetylene/oxygen, petrol/oxygen (Martinelli et al. 2010) and natural gas/air flames (Conzone et al. 2002; Fu et al. 2010; Lakhkar et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2006).|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects in railway operation is the interaction between rail and wheel. The contact conditions give rise to wear and damage in both components. Medium carbon steels are used in these components due to their combination of high strength and good wear properties in relation to cost. In service, high surface temperatures develop because of frictional heating on traction, braking, curving and occasional full slippage. Furthermore, long-term block braking may heat the wheel rim to over 500 °C. It is thus relevant to examine the high temperature performance of wheel material as well as the decrease in strength after thermal exposure. In the current thesis, two railway wheel steels are examined. These are the medium carbon steels UIC ER 7 T and ER 8 T (~ 0. 55 wt. % C), heat-treated to a near pearlitic microstructure with some 5 – 10 % pro-eutectoid ferrite in the wheel tread surface. Specimens were extracted from virgin wheels and pre-strained either monotonically or cyclically, to imitate plastic deformation developing in the wheel tread surface in service. Both un-deformed and pre-strained materials were heat treated at various temperatures from 250 °C to 650 °C for various time durations, and the change in room temperature hardness as measured before and after heat treatment was analysed. Samples were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), to examine microstructure degradation. Additionally, Electron Backscatter Diffraction Analysis (EBSD) was used to evaluate if orientation gradients in the pearlitic colonies affect the <b>spheroidisation</b> of the pearlitic microstructure that is observed at higher temperatures. Analyses after the room temperature hardness measurements showed that hardening due to strain ageing takes place at around 300 °C while microstructural degradation caused softening at higher temperatures. <b>Spheroidisation</b> of the pearlite started to become visible at 450 °C for the un-deformed material and at around 400 °C for the pre-strained. The spheroidised areas appear to have lost their initial orientation gradients after <b>spheroidisation</b> and obtain a more uniform orientation.

Known as electropulsing, the process has previously been successfully applied to cold-drawn pearlitic steel wire over a very short treatment period (current density > 10 3 A·mm - 2 and pulse width - 4 s) and with low energy expenditure. Once optimised, electropulsing treatment may offer potential time-and energy-saving advantages over traditional grain refinement techniques. However, to date, very little research on the effects of electropulsing on pearlitic steel exists in the literature and is limited to steel wire. The current work was conducted to determine whether electropulsing treatment is capable of producing similar grain refinement and <b>spheroidisation</b> behaviour in the microstructure of cold-deformed high carbon pearlitic steel sheet (0. 92 wt%C). High current density electropulsing treatment was applied to pearlitic steel samples of 40 to 70 % rolling reduction for 50 or 100 pulses.

40|$|In an {{investigation}} of nucleation of recrystallisation in an Interstitial Free steel {{it was found that}} new crystals were almost always contained within the rolled-out hot band grain envelopes and were mostly equiaxed. At a later stage they grew and had an aspect ratio of 2 : 1 but at the completion of recrystallisation were again equiaxed. This is explained by the notion that nucleation occurs relatively frequently in certain grains, that these nuclei have very similar orientations and are thus orientation pinned within the solute and precipitate containing envelopes of the hot band grains. Provided the misorientation is small the impinged group are capable of <b>spheroidisation</b> provided the driving force across the pinned boundary is sufficient to overcome the pinning, because, by definition, this pinned boundary is of high angle character. The theory, as it is presented as coalescence, relies on a form of Östwald ripening and therefore provides a possible explanation of why grain growth kinetics obeys a time exponent of between 1 / 2 and 1 / 3. A similar observation of high aspect ratio grains has been made many times in the case of cold rolled copper which forms cube texture. Again, nuclei are formed in the cube bands, but these are prevented from lengthening because of orientation pinning. However, when the length of a group of such impinged nuclei is sufficient, <b>spheroidisation</b> will produce equiaxed grains. © 2004 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This {{steel is}} of the {{eutectoid}} composition. Once the temperature is lowered below the eutectoid temperature, the austenite phase tends to undergo a eutectoid transformation (γ to α + Fe 3 C). The resultant microstructure, known as pearlite, comprises alternate lamellae of cementite and ferrite. Subsequent to casting, the alloy was normalised (annealed) just below the eutectoid temperature, in order to induce the carbides to take a spherical appearance, which results in the steel becoming softer and more ductile.

40|$|Being {{the single}} {{component}} transferring load and traction from {{the vehicle to}} the rail, the selection of materials and structural properties of railway wheels are critical. Carbon steel with a pearlitic microstructure is {{the most commonly used}} material due to its high strength, low cost and good wear properties. However, due to the two‐phase microstructure, pearlite is susceptible to softening at higher temperatures and degradation of mechanical properties. A new type of wheel steels with increased alloying content of silicon and manganese has shown improved resistance to rolling contact fatigue. However, a clear correlation between increased alloying content and strength and how the softening behaviour of the material affects the fatigue properties have not been studied so far. To foster further knowledge on these issues, two wheel steels were used in this work: a high Si‐Mn alloyed steel and a widely used lower alloyed steel. In virgin states the two selected steels were found to have fairly similar mechanical characteristics {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and different strain rates. Upon annealing, however, both materials begin to soften at temperatures above 500 °C. Higher temperatures approaching the ferrite‐austenite transformation temperature (about 750 °C) accelerates the microstructural degeneration. However the high Si‐Mn‐alloyed steel showed to have a better resistance against thermal softening, resulting in better mechanical properties and increased fatigue life compared to the low alloyed steel. Investigation of the microstructure revealed that the softening was caused by <b>spheroidisation</b> of cemenite lamellas in pearlite. Heavy pre‐deformation before annealing emphasised this degeneration of pearlite even more. Both silicon and manganese are considered to retard the softening towards higher annealing times and temperatures, by a decrease in carbon flux, which thereby limit the <b>spheroidisation</b> rate. The cementite <b>spheroidisation</b> leads to lowering of hardness, monotonic and cyclic strength and fatigue life times. As the high alloyed steel resists microstructural degeneration better at elevated temperatures it retains the mechanical properties better after high temperature exposure. This is particularly evident for the fatigue performance. As an example it can be mentioned that a certain high temperature exposure leads to hardness decrease of about 20 % for the high alloyed steel, while the low alloyed steel suffers a hardness reduction of about 25 %. For fatigue life times, however, the difference between the two materials is as much as a factor three in favour for the higher alloyed steel...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{measure in}} steel processing industry is achieving the required mechanical properties and micro {{structure of the}} material. A new phenomenon has been discovered recently which allows to refine ferrite grain significantly and to spheroidise carbides over {{a very short time}} compared to conventional heat treatment techniques. The newly developed technology based on the ASR (Accelerated <b>Spheroidisation</b> and Refinement) effect consists in heating a steel workpiece through thickness to a temperature no higher than Ac 1 and in subsequent plastic deformation. The energy introduced through plastic deformation causes the workpiece temperature to increase. This temperature increase, however, is not uniform throughout the workpiece cross-section, leading to substantial inhomogeneity. Fully austenitized regions, partially austenitized regions, and areas where no phase transformation occurred, coexist. In locations previously subjected to intensive plastic deformation, cementite lamellae disintegrate and globular carbides form. In regions subjected to milder plastic deformation, <b>spheroidisation</b> does not occur directly {{in the course of the}} thermomechanical treatment. Despite, the cementite lamellae show a stronger tendency to spheroidise during subsequent annealing. The combination of a suitable pre-heating temperature, an appropriate amount of strain and a possible reheating leads to transformation of initial ferrite-pearlite micro structure with lamellar pearlite into desired ferrite matrix with spheroidised carbides. Key microstructure parameters governing the properties of ferrite-pearlite steels include exactly the ferrite grain size, the distribution of defects within the ferrite grain and the distribution and morphology of carbides. The present article describes a new thermomechanical treatment technique which allows controlling these microstructure parameters and related mechanical properties in order to achieve their favourable combination in structural carbon steel C 45. The processing time is very short when compared to several-hour conventional heat treatments. This offers potential for achieving desired mechanical properties with time and energy savings...|$|E
