25|$|If the {{government}} {{agrees that the}} changes are worthwhile, a Bill is drafted, usually by Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is read and debated {{in both houses of}} parliament before it is either rejected, changed, or approved. An approved Bill must then receive the assent then handed down to either the Governor (State) or the Governor-General (Commonwealth). And then it must be put to the people through a Referendum and only a majority vote of all the States will ensure that law will be passed. Parliament often delegates legislation to local councils, <b>statutory</b> <b>authorities</b> and government departments, for sub or minor statute laws or rules such as Road Rules, but all law is answerable to the Commonwealth Constitution.|$|E

The existence of specific provisions in state codes for victim-offender mediation {{is important for}} providing a structure for states on implementing victim-offender mediation, including such factors as funding, liability, and mediator requirements. This article finds that currently 29 states have victim-offender media-tion or victim-offender-mediation-type <b>statutory</b> <b>authority,</b> though the states vary on range of comprehensiveness of the statues.

Each provincial council is an autonomous body not under the authority of any Ministry. Some of its functions had been undertaken by central government ministries, departments, corporations, and <b>statutory</b> <b>authorities,</b> but authority over land and police is not as a rule given to provincial councils. Between 1989 and 2006, the Northern and Eastern provinces were temporarily merged to form the North-East Province.

50|$|A {{statutory}} authority is an organisation established under separate legislation {{to manage a}} particular aspect of government administration. Most statutory bodies have their own board of management, selected or appointed in different ways. However, all must report to a Minister. <b>Statutory</b> <b>authorities</b> have varying degrees of independence {{to the government and}} public service. Some <b>statutory</b> <b>authorities</b> are dependent on government subsidies and grants and hence likely to very highly attuned to the wishes of the Minister and/or Director-General; others are funded in other ways (e.g. providing services) and enjoy greater independence as a consequence. However, as all <b>statutory</b> <b>authorities</b> exist under Queensland legislation, the Minister can assert control by changing the legislation within the Queensland Parliament. Strictly, employees of <b>statutory</b> <b>authorities</b> {{are not part of the}} Queensland Public Service, but where their positions are funded by the Queensland Government they are often treated as members of the Queensland Public Service for statistical and budgetary purposes.|$|E
