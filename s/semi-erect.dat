25|$|Appendages can be {{used for}} {{movement}} in a number of ways. The posture, the way the body is supported by the legs, is an important aspect. There are three main ways in which vertebrates support themselves with their legs - sprawling, <b>semi-erect,</b> and fully erect. Some animals may use different postures in different circumstances, depending on the posture's mechanical advantages. Interestingly, there is no detectable difference in energetic cost between stances.|$|E
25|$|The therapsids had {{sprawling}} forelimbs and <b>semi-erect</b> hindlimbs. This {{suggests that}} Carrier's constraint {{would have made}} it rather difficult for them to move and breathe at the same time, but not as difficult as it is for animals such as lizards, which have completely sprawling limbs. Advanced therapsids may therefore have been significantly less active than modern mammals of similar size and so may have had slower metabolisms overall or else been bradymetabolic (lower metabolism when at rest).|$|E

25|$|Eye colour {{varies from}} brown to blue, and {{occasionally}} eyes of differing colour occur; {{this is usually}} seen with merles. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable — some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others <b>semi-erect</b> ears (similar {{to those of the}} rough Collie). Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general a dog's appearance is considered by the American Border Collie Association to be irrelevant. It is considered much more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability than by its looks.|$|E
500|$|Drosera anglica is a {{perennial}} herb which forms an upright, stemless rosette of generally [...] leaves. As is typical for sundews, the laminae are densely covered with stalked mucilaginous glands, each tipped {{with a clear}} droplet of a viscous fluid used for trapping insects. The lamina, which is [...] long, is held <b>semi-erect</b> by a long petiole, bringing the total leaf size to 30–95mm. Plants are green, coloring red in bright light. In all populations except those in Kaua'i, D. anglica forms winter resting buds called hibernacula. These consist of a knot of tightly curled leaves at ground level, which unfurl in spring {{at the end of}} the dormancy period. The root system is weak and penetrates only a few centimeters, serving mainly as an anchor and for water absorption. Nitrogen is in short supply in bogs and trapping and digesting insects provides an alternate source.|$|E
2500|$|Dinocephalians ("terrible heads") {{included}} both carnivores and herbivores. They were large; Anteosaurus {{was up to}} 6m (20ft) long.

But this process was erratic and very slow — for example: all herbivorous therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had <b>semi-erect</b> hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semi-sprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semi-sprawling limbs.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mars Balearicus" [...] {{is a name}} used {{in modern}} {{scholarship}} for small bronze warrior figures from Majorca (one of the Balearic Islands) that are interpreted as representing the local Mars cult.

[...] "Mars" [...] is fashioned as a lean, athletic nude lifting a lance and wearing a helmet, often conical; the genitals are perhaps <b>semi-erect</b> in some examples.|$|E
2500|$|Mammals {{and birds}} {{typically}} have a fully erect posture, though each evolved it independently. In these groups the legs are placed beneath the body. This is often {{linked with the}} evolution of endothermy, as it avoids Carrier's constraint and thus allows prolonged periods of activity. The fully erect stance {{is not necessarily the}} [...] "most-evolved" [...] stance; evidence suggests that crocodilians evolved a <b>semi-erect</b> stance in their forelimbs from ancestors with fully erect stance as a result of adapting to a mostly aquatic lifestyle, though their hindlimbs are still held fully erect. [...] For example, the mesozoic prehistoric crocodilian Erpetosuchus is believed to have had a fully erect stance and been terrestrial.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1969, P-Orridge {{returned}} to Hull {{to meet up}} with friend John Shappero, who partnered with P-Orridge to turn COUM Transmissions into an avant-garde artistic and musical troupe. They initially debated as to how to define [...] "COUM", later deciding that like the name [...] "dada" [...] it should remain open to interpretation. P-Orridge designed a logo for the group, consisting of a <b>semi-erect</b> penis formed out of the word COUM with a drip of semen coming out of the end, while the motto [...] "Your Local Dirty Banned" [...] (a pun on [...] "band") was emblazoned underneath. Another logo designed by P-Orridge consisted of a hand-drawn seal accompanied by the statement [...] "COUM guarantee disappointment"; from their early foundation, the group made use of wordplay in their artworks and adverts.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "sprawling" [...] posture is {{the most}} primitive, and is the {{original}} limb posture from which the others evolved. The upper limbs are typically held horizontally, while the lower limbs are vertical, though upper limb angle may be substantially increased in large animals. [...] The body may drag along the ground, as in salamanders, or may be substantially elevated, as in monitor lizards. [...] This posture is typically associated with trotting gaits, and the body flexes from side-to-side during movement to increase step length. [...] All limbed reptiles and salamanders use this posture, as does the platypus and several species of frogs that walk. Unusual examples can be found among amphibious fish, such as the mudskipper, which drag themselves across land on their sturdy fins. [...] Among the invertebrates, most arthropodswhich includes the most diverse group of animals, the insectshave a stance best described as sprawling. There is also anecdotal evidence that some octopus species (such as the Pinnoctopus genus) can also drag themselves across land a short distance by hauling their body along by their tentacles (for example to pursue prey between rockpools) - there may be video evidence of this. The <b>semi-erect</b> posture is more accurately interpreted as an extremely elevated sprawling posture. This mode of locomotion is typically found in large lizards such as monitor lizards and tegus.|$|E

60|$|This was Red-Eye. And right gingerly he crept out or his {{cave and}} descended to the ground. Ignoring me, he {{proceeded}} to reconnoitre. He bent forward from the hips as he walked; and so far forward did he bend, and so long were his arms, that with every step he touched the knuckles of his hands to the ground {{on either side of}} him. He was awkward in the <b>semi-erect</b> position of walking that he assumed, and he really touched his knuckles to the ground in order to balance himself. But oh, I tell you he could run on all-fours! Now this was something at which we were particularly awkward. Furthermore, it was a rare individual among us who balanced himself with his knuckles when walking. Such an individual was an atavism, and Red-Eye was an even greater atavism.|$|E
60|$|On the whole, {{it will be}} clear, I think, to the {{impartial}} reader {{from this}} rapid survey that the helplessness and awkwardness of a {{fish out of water}} has been much exaggerated by the thoughtless generalisation of unscientific humanity. Granting, for argument's sake, that most fish prefer the water, as a matter of abstract predilection, to the dry land, it must be admitted per contra that many fish cut a much better figure on terra firma than most of their critics themselves would cut in mid-ocean. There are fish that wriggle across country intrepidly with the dexterity and agility of the most accomplished snakes; there are fish that walk about on open sand-banks, <b>semi-erect</b> on two legs, as easily as lizards; there are fish that hop and skip on tail and fins in a manner that the celebrated jumping frog himself might have observed with envy; and there are fish that fly through the air of heaven with a grace and swiftness that would put to shame innumerable species among their feathered competitors. Nay, there are even fish, like some kinds of eels and the African mud-fish, that scarcely live in the water at all, but merely frequent wet and marshy places, where they lie snugly in the soft ooze and damp earth that line the bottom. If I have only succeeded, therefore, in relieving the mind of one sensitive and retiring fish from the absurd obloquy cast upon its appearance when it ventures away for awhile from its proper element, then, in the pathetic and prophetic words borrowed from a thousand uncut prefaces, this work will not, I trust, have been written in vain.|$|E
6000|$|He now moved {{very rapidly}} and very noiselessly for so large an animal, so I told the Dyaks to follow {{and keep him}} in sight while I loaded. The jungle was here full of large angular {{fragments}} of rock from the mountain above, and thick with hanging and twisted creepers. Running, climbing, and creeping among these, {{we came up with}} the creature {{on the top of a}} high tree near the road, where the Chinamen had discovered him, and were shouting their astonishment with open mouths: [...] "Ya Ya, Tuan; Orangutan, Tuan." [...] Seeing that he could not pass here without descending, he turned up again towards the hill, and I got two shots, and following quickly, had two more by the time he had again reached the path, but he was always more or less concealed by foliage, and protected by the large branch on which he was walking. Once while loading I had a splendid view of him, moving along a large limb of a tree in a <b>semi-erect</b> posture, and showing it to be an animal of the largest size. At the path he got on to one of the loftiest trees in the forest, and we could see one leg hanging down useless, having been broken by a ball. He now fixed himself in a fork, where he was hidden by thick foliage, and seemed disinclined to move. I was afraid he would remain and die in this position, and as it was nearly evening. I could not have got the tree cut down that day. I therefore fired again, and he then moved off, and going up the hill was obliged to get on to some lower trees, on the branches of one of which he fixed himself in such a position that he could not fall, and lay all in a heap as if dead, or dying.|$|E
60|$|And {{what did}} the old master himself look like? Well, {{painters}} have always been fond of reproducing their own lineaments. Have we not the familiar young Raffael, painted by himself, and the Rembrandt, and the Titian, and the Rubens, and a hundred other self-drawn portraits, all flattering and all famous? Even so primitive man has drawn himself many times over, not indeed on this particular piece of reindeer horn, but on several other media to be seen elsewhere, in the original or in good copies. One of the best portraits is that discovered in the old cave at Laugerie Basse by M. Elie Massénat, where a very early pre-Glacial man is represented {{in the act of}} hunting an aurochs, at which he is casting a flint-tipped javelin. In this, as in all other pictures of the same epoch, I regret to say that the ancient hunter is represented in the costume of Adam before the fall. Our old master's studies, in fact, are all in the nude. Primitive man was evidently unacquainted as yet with the use of clothing, though primitive woman, while still unclad, had already learnt how to heighten her natural charms by the simple addition of a necklace and bracelets. Indeed, though dresses were still wholly unknown, rouge was even then extremely fashionable among French ladies, and lumps of the ruddle with which primitive woman made herself beautiful for ever are now to be discovered {{in the corner of the}} cave where she had her little prehistoric boudoir. To return to our hunter, however, who for aught we know to the contrary may be our old master himself in person, he is a rather crouching and <b>semi-erect</b> savage, with an arched back, recalling somewhat that of the gorilla, a round head, long neck, pointed beard, and weak, shambling, ill-developed legs. I fear we must admit that pre-Glacial man cut, on the whole, a very sorry and awkward figure.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{singular}} and very interesting sight {{to watch a}} Mias making his way leisurely through the forest. He walks deliberately along {{some of the larger}} branches in the <b>semi-erect</b> attitude which the great length of his arms and the shortness of his legs cause him naturally to assume; and the disproportion between these limbs is increased by his walking on his knuckles, not on the palm of the hand, as we should do. He seems always to choose those branches which intermingle with an adjoining tree, on approaching which he stretches out his long arms, and seizing the opposing boughs, grasps them together with both hands, seems to try their strength, and then deliberately swings himself across to the next branch, on which he walks along as before. He never jumps or springs, or even appears to hurry himself, and yet manages to get along almost as quickly as a person can run through the forest beneath. The long and powerful arms are of the greatest use to the animal, enabling it to climb easily up the loftiest trees, to seize fruits and young leaves from slender boughs which will not bear its weight, and to gather leaves and branches with which to form its nest. I have already described how it forms a nest when wounded, but it uses a similar one to sleep on almost every night. This is placed low down, however, on a small tree not more than from twenty to fifty feet from the ground, probably because it is warmer and less exposed to wind than higher up. Each Mias is said to make a fresh one for himself every night; but I should think that is hardly probable, or their remains would be much more abundant; for though I saw several about the coal-mines, there must have been many Orangs about every day, and in a year their deserted nests would become very numerous. The Dyaks say that, when it is very wet, the Mias covers himself over with leaves of pandanus, or large ferns, which has perhaps led to the story of his making a hut in the trees.|$|E
60|$|According to {{a popular}} impression, {{the absence of a}} tail is eminently {{distinctive}} of man; but as those apes which come nearest to him are destitute of this organ, its disappearance does not relate exclusively to man. The tail often differs remarkably in length within the same genus: thus in some species of Macacus it is longer than the whole body, and is formed of twenty-four vertebrae; in others it consists of a scarcely visible stump, containing only three or four vertebrae. In some kinds of baboons there are twenty-five, whilst in the mandrill there are ten very small stunted caudal vertebrae, or, according to Cuvier (90. Mr. St. George Mivart, 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1865, pp. 562, 583. Dr. J.E. Gray, 'Cat. Brit. Mus.: 'Skeletons.' Owen, 'Anatomy of Vertebrates,' vol. ii. p. 517. Isidore Geoffroy, 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tom. ii. p. 244.), sometimes only five. The tail, whether it be long or short, almost always tapers towards the end; and this, I presume, results from the atrophy of the terminal muscles, together with their arteries and nerves, through disuse, leading to the atrophy of the terminal bones. But no explanation can at present be given of the great diversity which often occurs in its length. Here, however, we are more specially concerned with the complete external disappearance of the tail. Professor Broca has recently shewn (91. 'Revue d'Anthropologie,' 1872; 'La Constitution des vertebres caudales.') that the tail in all quadrupeds consists of two portions, generally separated abruptly from each other; the basal portion consists of vertebrae, more or less perfectly channelled and furnished with apophyses like ordinary vertebrae; whereas those of the terminal portion are not channelled, are almost smooth, and scarcely resemble true vertebrae. A tail, though not externally visible, is really present in man and the anthropomorphous apes, and is constructed on exactly the same pattern in both. In the terminal portion the vertabrae, constituting the os coccyx, are quite rudimentary, being much reduced in size and number. In the basal portion, the vertebrae are likewise few, are united firmly together, and are arrested in development; but they have been rendered much broader and flatter than the corresponding vertebrae in the tails of other animals: they constitute what Broca calls the accessory sacral vertebrae. These are of functional importance by supporting certain internal parts and in other ways; and their modification is directly connected with the erect or <b>semi-erect</b> attitude of man and the anthropomorphous apes. This conclusion is the more trustworthy, as Broca formerly held a different view, which he has now abandoned. The modification, therefore, of the basal caudal vertebrae in man and the higher apes may have been effected, directly or indirectly, through natural selection.|$|E
