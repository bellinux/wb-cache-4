40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{to what extent}} differences in competition intensity (assessed through estimated markups) between economic sectors explain international differences in hourly labour productivity gains at the sector level {{in a set of}} OECD countries. Results indicate the presence of a non-linear relationship between competition and labour productivity gains. Increased competition would benefit productivity growth in low-competition sectors, but would be detrimental above a certain level. This negative effect seems however fragile as it is no more significant when the sample is restricted to the most competitive sectors. Besides, in the manufacturing sectors characterized by relatively high competition and sunk costsmore intense competition would slow productivity gains. This result is in line with the European Commission view (Roeger et al., 2008) that margins need to reach a certain level in order to stimulate innovation in these sectors. At the opposite, greater competition in services would consistently promote productivity gains. Labour productivity, Competition, Cross-country and <b>Sectoral</b> <b>Study...</b>|$|E

40|$|This Report {{presents}} {{the work that}} has been undertaken {{in the first three}} years of the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP). The Programme was established by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) with the aim of establishing a research framework for the integrated assessment of climate change impacts in the UK. Its specific objective is to coordinate and integrate a stakeholder-led assessment of the impacts of climate change at a regional and national level. Assessments under the UKCIP will provide Government and private-sector decisionmakers with information needed to underpin the development of strategies to adapt to climate change. Studies within the Programme fall into two broad groups: sub-UK scoping <b>studies</b> and <b>sectoral</b> <b>studies,</b> which are undertaken in a modular way within a common framework. In {{the first three years of}} the Programme five sub-UK assessments studies have been undertaken, four <b>sectoral</b> <b>studies</b> are underway and four further studies are at inception. The results of completed studies are contained in a set of separate Summary and Technical reports for each area 1. In addition, tools to support studies have been developed. This Report has four purposes: 1. To explain the approaches and methods which have been developed within the Programme, for the benefit of organisations and the research community within the UK and internationally; 2. To enable the next stage of the work of UKCIP to be planned, so that it meets the needs for national policy and supports organisations at a regional and national scale to prepare adaptation responses; 3. To provide a concise synthesis of the results of studies obtained so far and cross-cutting themes emerging, so these can be assimilated in policy-making and strategic planning; 4. To provide a portfolio of future studies for the next phase of the research programme which is needed to achieve a national assessment. The UKCIP integrating framework is presented in Chapter 1. Results of the sub-UK scoping studies are presented in Chapter 2 and the methodological work underway in the <b>sectoral</b> <b>studies</b> is presented in Chapter 3. This Chapter also contains a review of current sectoral work which is related to the UKCIP framework. In Chapter 4, an attempt is made to integrate and assess study findings and the methods used.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Non-State Actors (NSAs) is {{relatively}} new within the parlance of civil society organisations (CSOs) or Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) connotations. The term NSA emerged from the 2000 Cotonou Agreement which regulates the cooperation mechanism {{between the two groups}} of countries as it tries to expand the scope of coverage of definitions of CSOs and/or NGOs. Within this context, the place of NSAs in the socio-economic and political transformation of post-military Nigeria as from 1999 has become an issue of public discourse. On the one hand, government is wont to suspect the genuine intensions of civil CSOs whose claim to legitimacy looks tenuous in view of reported lack of transparency, accountability and internal democracy. On the other, the civil society groups accuse government of “hidden agenda” by surreptitiously excluding them from active involvement in development policy initiation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The need for partnership between the civil society and government is however underscored in various international instruments to which Nigeria subscribes. These include the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and the Cotonou Agreement of 2000. A pattern of tripartite cooperation among the government, external development-support funding agencies such as World Bank and the European Commission is evident in the emerging trends. However, without adequate capacity for constructive engagement of state actors and appreciable resources for collaborative initiatives, it is apparent that little or no success would come out of ongoing efforts to make NSAs critical partners in the development process. Broadly, this paper sets out to provide a <b>sectoral</b> <b>study</b> on the NSAs in Nigeria. This paper traces the emergence of NSAs as the broadening of sphere of civil society partnering with state actors within the particular framework of the Cotonou Agreement. It then analyses the strategic position of NSAs and the antecedents to current mutual distrust between state and NSAs. More specifically, the paper attempts a conceptual framework of relations between NSAs and government/donor agencies, the nature and structure of NSAs in Nigeria, and the roles or expected roles of NSAs in the political, social and economic development of the country. Relying mainly on secondary sources, it goes further to classify NSAs in Nigeria and undertakes a broad review of NGO activism based on their focal sectors. A review of emerging trends and implications for NSAs is then undertaken before projecting into the future of NSA participation in development in Nigeria. We supported some of the ideas with analysis of a sample database of NSAs developed by collating different database available in the country. The paper concludes with some recommendations. ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Despite the decline of collective bargaining and trade union membership in the British private sector over the past thirty years, and much academic discussion of 'marketisation' in the public sector, national collective bargaining in English local government has remained remarkably robust - {{as demonstrated by the}} Workplace Employment Relations Surveys (Millward et al. 2000). Most academic research on employment relations in the public sector has focused on 'change'. In this study I wish to examine the roots of 'continuity' and a surprising institutional survival. After three decades of reform, national collective bargaining still remains central to the local government employment relations architecture, and contrary to the 'hollowing out' thesis, national agreements are still the bulwark upon which both national and local government (and the related actors: trade unions, management, politicians) rely upon to engage in the process of joint regulation in the workplace. The study has three main objectives: Firstly, to explore why the institutional actors support or do not support the national collective bargining framework in English local government. Secondly, the extent to which national collective bargaining is supported and promoted applying an institutional theory analytical framework. Thirdly, what institutional processes explain the resilience of national collective bargaining in English local government? A <b>sectoral</b> <b>study</b> is used to explore the political dynamics that underlie the survival of national collective bargaining in English local government. This follows a 'firm in sector' methodology (Smith et al., 1990), in which a benchmark authority is compared and contrasted with eight other local authorities. The authorities were chosen by taking account of factors such as size (employing more than 2000 workers); type (metroplitan (7) and shire (2); geography (north (2), midlands (4), south west (1) and south east (2); and status (are they part of the national collective bargaining framework or outside of it.) The 'firm in sector' methodology allows for the examination of issues at an organisational level, building on the Workplace Employment Relations Surveys, which have focused more at a macro level. The study will drill down in detail within the benchmark authority; however, the study is nevertheless dependent on understanding the wider sectoral landscape in which the benchmark authority is located and therefore considers how its experiences compare with local authorities who chose to belong or not belong to the national collective bargaining framework. The thesis makes three contibutions. Firstly, it raises the issue of continuity within English local government employment relations and why national collective bargaining has continued to survive and remain relevant. Secondly, it considers what makes English local government different {{from other parts of the}} public sector, and what we can learn from this difference. Thirdly, it highlights the value of a new institutional perspective, as a tool for employment relations analysis...|$|E

40|$|The {{volume of}} {{international}} trade flows has likely significantly increased, and to address the determinants {{of international trade}} is one of major concerns amongst trade economists. This {{is also the case}} for Vietnam, a nation which has been in transition, as it integrated into the global economy through trade whilst moving from a command to a market economy in the last three decades, and has experienced a significant increase in international trade activities. Trade and world economic integration are seen as the impetus for accelerating the well-beings of the domestic Vietnamese communities and international community in the region. However, an understanding of the link between trade and economic integration from the perspective of Vietnam is missing. Empirical studies on Vietnamese trade are in lack to address these determinants (see, Le, 1996; Nguyen, 2010). This thesis identifies the key factors that have driven the impressive growth of Vietnamese exports during the world economic integration process (1986 - 2010). Importantly, this study applies the gravity equation to investigate these factors by the two aspects, namely, the aggregate and sectoral exports analysis. The gravity equation has been frequently applied in empirical studies to examine bilateral trade flows. I make use of this equation in addressing the key determinants of Vietnamese export flows. The applied models for Vietnamese exports are based on Frankle (1993). This study focuses on a large sample of 54 main trading partners of Vietnam over a 25 year period. This large sample is divided into different country groups with two categories: income and regional basis, which provides important insights on how the trade policy should look like by different trading partners. For sectoral analysis, 24 key exporting sectors are selected. The aggregate bilateral gravity models introduce useful information to explain the determinants of bilateral exports of Vietnam. Generally, such factors as economies of scale, economic development, exchange rate, domestic openness, trade costs, and regional trade agreements (the memberships of ASEAN and APEC) are found to significantly contribute to the performance of total bilateral exports. However, the results suggest that openness of trading partners has not been always beneficial for total exports of Vietnam. Similarly, the WTO membership tends to divert Vietnam&rsquo;s bilateral exports to non-member trading partners for most country panels. Additionally, a comparison of Vietnam and Singapore (an Asian country that is economically better positioned than Vietnam) is carried out using the same models. I found that both results are rather consistent. The outcomes of sectoral estimations address the key determinants by accounting for the bilateral exports for a large number of key export sectors. The results confirm important roles of economic sizes, economic development, endowment difference, domestic openness, bilateral exchange rate, trade costs, the ASEAN and APEC trade arrangements in determining sectoral bilateral exports of Vietnam. However, the <b>sectoral</b> <b>study</b> also points out that the influence of some gravity variables, such as foreign openness or WTO trade preference, are not in line with the thesis&rsquo; hypothesis.
