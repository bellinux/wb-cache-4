40|$|Background: It is {{important}} {{to emphasize that the}} aspects of pretreatment techniques, as well as the composition and mechanism of adhesion, may decisively influence the effectiveness of the restorative materials in sealing cavity margins and preventing marginal leakage. Aims: This study assessed the in vitro influence of surface preparation techniques on the microleakage of glass ionomer restorations in primary teeth. Materials and methods: The study groups were divided into three different techniques: (1) The chemomechanical caries removal (CMCR) method using the Apacaries gel, (2) the erbium:yttrium aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser method and (3) the atraumatic restorative technique (ART). The teeth restored with a glass ionomer restorative material (Fuji IX GP capsule, GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The dye penetration was measured in micrometers using a polarized light microscope and specific computer software. Results: The results showed that the mean microleakage level after was lowest with the CMCR method using Apacaries gel and highest with the Er:YAG laser. There was a statistically significant difference regarding the mean microleakage level between the group with the CMCR method using Apacaries gel and the Er:YAG laser. Conclusion: Marginal leakage was significantly higher with preparations made using the Er:YAG laser than with the CMCR method using Apacaries gel and <b>spoon</b> <b>excavator</b> (p < 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} fluid flow in dentin after restoration of carious teeth with resin composite bonded with a total-etching adhesive, with or without glass-ionomer cement lining. The roots of extracted third molars were removed and the crowns were connected to a fluid flow-measuring device. Each carious lesion was stained with caries detector dye and caries was removed using slow-speed burs and <b>spoon</b> <b>excavators.</b> Caries-excavated teeth were divided into two groups for restoration with resin composite bonded with a total-etch adhesive: (i) without lining; and (ii) lined with glass-ionomer cement before bonding. In non-carious teeth, cavities of similar dimensions were prepared, divided into two groups, and restored in the same manner. Fluid flow was recorded, after restoration, for up to 1 month. Caries-affected dentin was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the bonded interfaces were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. No significant difference in fluid flow was observed between the two restorative procedures or between the carious and non-carious groups. The SEM images showed that the dentinal tubules of acid-etched, caries-affected dentin were usually still occluded, while some were patent. Limited penetration of fluorescent dye into dentin and into the bonded interfaces of restored carious teeth was observed. © 2009 Eur J Oral Sci. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{case report}} {{describes}} {{the treatment of}} a necrotic immature permanent central incisor with complete crown fracture, suspected root fracture, and sinus tract, which was not treated with conventional apexification techniques. Instead, a regenerative approach based on the trauma literature’s methods for revascularization was provided. The root canal was gently debrided of necrotic tissue with a sharp <b>spoon</b> <b>excavator</b> and irrigated for only one third of its length with NaOCl and then medicated with calcium hydroxide. After 15 days the sinus tract had healed, and the tooth was asymptomatic. The tooth was accessed, calcium hydroxide was removed, bleeding was stimulated to form an intracanal blood clot, and mineral trioxide aggregate was placed coronally to the blood clot. After 8 months, a coronal calcified barrier was radiographically evident and accompanied with progressive thickening of the root wall and apical closure. Two {{and a half years}} after treatment was initiated, the tooth remained asymptomatic, and the sinus tract had not reappeared. The progressive increase in the thickness of the dentinal walls and subsequent apical development suggest that appropriate biologic responses can occur with this type of treatment of the necrotic immature permanent tooth with sinus tract.

40|$|The aims of this {{in vitro}} study were both to {{determine}} the time necessary for removal of carious dentin (efficiency) and the Knoop Hardness Number (KHN) of the remaining dentin (effectiveness), using a chemomechanical method (Carisolv) or hand excavation. Thirty human molars were bisected through occlusal carious lesions into two equal halves. Each half was randomly excavated by hand in circular movements with a <b>spoon</b> <b>excavator</b> or using Carisolv gel according to the manufacturer's instructions. The duration of carious dentin removal was recorded. Tooth sections were resin-embedded, ground flat and polished. Dentin KHN was determined at distances of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mum from the cavity floor. Data were analyzed by Wilcoxon's test (alpha= 0. 01), ANOVA and Student's t test (alpha= 0. 05). The median of the time necessary for chemomechanical excavation was significantly greater than for hand excavation. KHN means (± SD) at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 µm for chemomechanical method were, respectively: 15. 6 (± 4. 96), 18. 0 (± 6. 22), 21. 3 (± 9. 30), 24. 3 (± 9. 25), 28. 5 (± 11. 80); and for hand excavation were: 21. 2 (± 10. 26), 23. 4 (± 9. 49), 28. 2 (± 11. 62), 31. 0 (± 12. 17), 34. 3 (± 11. 95).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{in vitro}} {{the effect of}} retentive grooves, GIC type and insertion method on the fracture resistance of Class II glass-ionomer cement (GIC) restorations. Methods: Premolars were divided into 12 groups (n= 10) according to three variables: retentive grooves [presence (PR) or absence AR) ], GICs type [Ketac-Molar (KM), Fuji VIII (F 8) and RelyX Luting (RX) ], and insertion method [syringe injector (SI) or <b>spoon</b> <b>excavator</b> (SE) ]. The specimens were subjected to fracture resistance test. Data were submitted to three-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons were performed using a Tukey test (P < 0. 05). Results: Mean fracture resistance values (Kgf) +/- standard deviations (SD) were: KM (PR+SI) 65. 66 +/- 2. 5; KM (PR+SE) = 62. 58 +/- 2. 1; KM (AR+SI) = 57. 11 +/- 1. 9; KM (AR+SE) = 51. 94 +/- 2. 3; F 8 (PR+SI) = 63. 05 +/- 2. 1; F 8 (PR+SE) = 60. 12 +/- 2. 3; F 8 (AR+SI) = 55. 11 +/- 1. 9; F 8 (AR+SE) = 49. 20 +/- 1. 6; RX (PR+SI) = 50. 99 +/- 2. 4; RX (PR+SE) = 48. 81 +/- 2. 5; RX (AR+SI) = 45. 53 +/- 2. 6; RX (AR+SE) = 41. 88 +/- 3. 0. Statistically significant differences were observed among all the groups tested (P= 0. 001).

40|$|Statement of problem: Residual zinc oxide-eugenol cement may {{adversely}} affect retention of zinc phosphate cement. Purpose of this study: was to measure retention of cast restorations cemented with zinc phosphate cement after cleaning the fitting (internal) surfaces from residues of zinc oxide-eugenol provisional cement using different cleaning methods. Material and methods: Sixty standard stainless steel models {{of a standard}} complete crown preparation were prepared. Cast crowns using Type III dental alloy (Midas, Jclenko, N. Y, USA) were fabricated then cemented on their respective models using zinc oxide-eugenol cement (Temp Bond, Kerr, CA, USA). They were stored in artificial saliva at 37 ° for 7 days. The castings were separated from their models using a universal testing machine (Model 1197, Instron, UK). Cleaning of all models was done with a <b>spoon</b> <b>excavator.</b> Specimens were then equally divided into 6 groups of different cleaning methods of residues of zinc oxide-eugenol cement on the fitting surfaces of the cast restorations (hand cleaning, hand cleaning/ultrasonic cleaning, airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic cleaning, hand cleaning/ steam cleaning, airborne-particle abrasion/steam cleaning and chemical cleaning). Castings were cemented back using zinc phosphate cement then stored in artificial saliva at 37 ° for 7 days. Retention was measured using a universal testing machine. Data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, non-parametric one-way ANOVA and post-Hoc, non-parametric Tukey Type test. (Alpha value was set at 0. 05). Results: Airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic cleaning showed the highest crown retention among other methods. Only airborne-particle abrasion/ultrasonic cleaning, hand cleaning/ultrasonic cleaning and hand cleaning/steam cleaning showed significantly higher crown retention than that of only hand cleaning (P= 0. 027). Conclusion: A combination of airborne-particle abrasion /ultrasonic cleaning, hand cleaning/steam cleaning and hand cleaning/ultrasonic cleaning produced significantly higher crown retention values than that of only hand cleaning.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Pulpotomy {{procedures}} {{for the treatment of}} pulp exposure or disease have traditionally used an approach from the occlusal surface in primary molars, with a rotating bur or a <b>spoon</b> <b>excavator</b> being used to excise the pulp under clean conditions and with a medicament being applied to the amputation site. The purpose of this study was: (1) to determine the feasibility of performing a sterile scalpel excision of coronal pulpal tissue and (2) to evaluate wound healing after a shield has been placed to prevent all substances from touching the blood clot at the amputation site. Using sterile operating room procedures, four of five teeth in five dogs were rendered free of cultivable bacteria after antimicrobial treatments were applied. These findings replicated a preliminary in vivo experiment of 45 teeth which demonstrated that antimicrobial agents applied to tooth enamel in dogs were effective beyond the 0. 001 level of significance, as compared to a control group. Furthermore, in the main study, negative cultures were obtained during 72 percent of the trials following each of the five major steps in the pulpotomy procedure. This included 80 percent negative cultures for bacteria after pulpal excision and blood clot formation, and 100 percent freedom from cultivable bacteria after a resin diaphragm was cemented to place. In eight experimental teeth (three from the preliminary study and all five from the main study) the buccal dentin over the coronal portion of the pulp was removed by use of a tissue-protecting device without grossly macerating the pulpal tissue. In seven of these eight teeth, the coronal portion of the pulp tissue was amputated with a scalpel severance and pulpal biopsies were removed through the buccal preparation. In all eight teeth, the cavity preparation was accomplished without applying medicaments to the blood clot at the amputation site. A resin-stainless steel diaphragm was constructed under sterile conditions and secured in a buccal preparation without touching the pulpal amputation for a convalescence of 14 - 21 days, and this shield provided a buccal wall for closure with an amalgam restoration. In one animal which had not received a previous autotransfusion for medical research, histologic sections of the pulp tissue in two root canals demonstrated satisfactory wound healing (a moderate and a mild inflammatory infiltrate was considered reversible). Three of the five dogs in the main study exhibited pulpal necrosis which was attributed to an interference in the immune system by previous autotransfusion research, and histologic evaluation of pulpal wound healing was therefore inconclusive. This study demonstrates that the enamel surface can be rendered free of cultivable bacteria in the dog and the operative site can be maintained in this condition throughout pulpotomy, with the coronal portion of the pulp being removed without grossly macerating the pulp. Under these conditions {{there appears to be a}} potential for satisfactory wound healing, with possible implications for the clinical situation...|$|E
