40|$|Dynamically Ordered self-organized {{dissipative}} structure {{exists in}} various forms and at different scales. This investigation first introduces {{the concept of an}} isolated embedding system, which embeds an open system, e. g., dissipative structure and its mass and/or energy exchange with its surroundings. Thereafter, scale-invariant theoretical analysis is presented using thermodynamic principles for Order creation, existence, and destruction. The <b>sustainability</b> <b>criterion</b> for Order existence based on its structured mass and/or energy interactions with the surroundings is mathematically defined. This criterion forms the basis for the interrelationship of physical parameters during sustained existence of dynamic Order. It is shown that the sufficient condition for dynamic Order existence is approached if its <b>sustainability</b> <b>criterion</b> is met, i. e., its destruction path is blocked. This scale-invariant approach has the potential to unify the physical understanding of universal dynamic ordering based on entropy considerations. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|This paper articulates and applies {{frameworks}} for examining whether consumption is excessive. We consider two {{criteria for the}} possible excessiveness (or insufficiency) of current consumption. One is an intertemporal utility-maximization criterion: actual current consumption is deemed excessive if it {{is higher than the}} level of current consumption on the consumption path that maximizes the present discounted value of utility. The other is a <b>sustainability</b> <b>criterion,</b> which requires that current consumption be consistent with non-declining living standards over time. We extend previous theoretical approaches by offering a formula for the <b>sustainability</b> <b>criterion</b> that accounts for population growth and technological change. In applying this formula, we find that some poor regions of the world are failing to meet the sustainability criterion: in these regions, genuine wealth per capita is falling as investments in human and manufactured capital are not sufficient to offset the depletion of natural capital. ...|$|E

40|$|Global {{sustainability}} strategies require assessing whether countries’ development trajectories are sustainable over time. However, sustainability {{assessments are}} limited because losses of natural capital and its ecosystem services through deforestation {{have not been}} comprehensively incorporated into national accounts. We update the national accounts of 80 nations that underwent tropical deforestation from 2000 to 2012 and evaluate their development trajectories using weak and strong sustainability criteria. Weak sustainability requires that countries do not decrease their aggregate capital over time. We adopt a strong <b>sustainability</b> <b>criterion</b> that countries do not decrease {{the value of their}} forest ecosystem services with respect to the year 2000. We identify several groups of countries: countries, such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India, that present sustainable development trajectories under both weak and strong sustainability criteria; countries, such as Brazil, Peru, and Indonesia, that present weak sustainable development but fail the strong <b>sustainability</b> <b>criterion</b> as a result of rapid losses of ecosystem services; countries, such as Madagascar, Laos, and Papua New Guinea, that present unsustainable development pathways as a result of deforestation; and countries, such as Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone, in which deforestation aggravates already unsustainable pathways.

30|$|<b>Sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> can be binding, when {{included}} in a legal framework. They {{can also be a}} part of a voluntary sustainability standard. Frameworks with <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria,</b> primarily of a voluntary, non-obligatory character, which have been initiated by private actors, exist in different branches, such as biofuel, forestry, coffee, and cotton industries. <b>Sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> are usually developed to serve certain purposes.

The development of a legal framework or a sustainability standard with <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> should involve the setup of an organizational structure and an update of a minimum set of the criteria, as well as a system for accrediting the competence of private actors, who help to control the fulfillment of the criteria at different stages.|$|R

The domestic and foreign debt positions of the central government are treated separately, to capture the influence of exchange rate changes on the relative costs of domestic and foreign borrowing.

30|$|<b>Sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> {{and their}} content should {{be linked to}} the {{understanding}} of what is sustainable development and sustainability. So far, <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> is not a clearly defined concept. It has been defined differently by different researchers.

In a number of sources, the assessment function of <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> has been highlighted. Thus, Zink defines <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> as criteria that are applied to assess opportunities and risks deriving from economic, environmental, and social sustainability dimensions [13]–[15]. Koplin et al. point out that <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> of an environmental character form requirements placed on suppliers aiming to reduce the input of natural resources and minimize environmental risks by improving the efficiency of suppliers [16]. To my mind, Koplin's argument can be even expanded to other groups of the involved actors, e.g., to producers at different stages of the production process.|$|R

The results of the analysis highlight that to safeguard the sustainable quality of biofuels and their production, {{the list of the}} EU <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> should be elaborated further. Other criteria that regulate various aspects of environmental, social and economic sustainability need be added. For example, {{there is a need for}} further elaboration of the sustainable agricultural practices and tolerable use of water resources. Furthermore, as long as the EU requirements to fulfill the <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> have global impacts, the perspective of the involved actors from other regions and countries should be taken into account.

More generally, the paper suggests that the list of <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria,</b> incorporated in a legal framework, should neither be too long, nor too short. A long list is not easy to implement. For a short list, as illustrated by the EU, it could be difficult to guarantee sustainability. Consequently, to the extent possible, the legislated list of <b>sustainability</b> <b>criteria</b> should be complemented by non-binding recommendations, explanations and guidelines.

Conflicts between various ecosystem services (economic production of food, fodder and fuels, biodiversity, social and cultural values, etc.) that are provided by fertile land are increasing as well. Hence, a developed thinking on how to balance between these services is desirable. There is a significant amount of information available on biofuels and their sustainability. In this paper, different initiatives and sustainability criteria for biofuels are presented and assessed. 35 criteria were found in emerging sustainability assessment frameworks.
