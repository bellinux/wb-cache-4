40|$|Abstract: The <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks</b> {{have been}} used in many {{countries}} of the world including Sri Lanka over a long period and it {{plays a major role in}} the building and construction industry. However, in order to make the indoor environment of the building as thermally comfortable as well as for achieving high structural performances, it is useful to use an alternative material to make blocks and bricks. Rice Husk Ash (RHA) is a by-product obtained from the combustion of rice husk which consists of non-crystalline silicon dioxide RHA having pozzolanic properties would reduce the demand of Portland cement whose cost has risen in Sri Lanka. The paper focuses on the study of structural characteristics and thermal performance of Rice Husk Ash (RHA) based <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks</b> through an experimental investigation. Strength characteristics of the blocks were investigated by conducting laboratory experiments. Thermal behavior of the block was investigated by comparing the variation of indoor temperatures in two model houses constructed with the <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks</b> and Rice husk Ash (RHA) based <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks.</b> It was found that the optimum compressive strength of RHA based cement <b>sand</b> <b>block</b> is achieved at 5 % replacement level.

40|$|The <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks</b> are cement {{composites}} {{and have}} been widely used in many countries including Sri Lanka. Rice husk ash (RHA) is a waste material with pozzolanic properties. The use of RHA as a substitute of cement is a sustainable application which solves the problem of its disposal by minimizing the environmental pollution. This paper discusses on the performance of a cellular <b>sand</b> cement <b>block</b> containing rice husk ash through an experimental investigation. The burning temperature of the RHA obtained from power plant is 650 °C. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) was partially replaced with RHA having different fineness at 5 %, 10 % and 15 % replacement levels to produce <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks.</b> Particle size of the finer RHA was less than 75 jim. Compressive strength increased up to the 10 % cement replacement level only with finer RHA. Replacement percentage beyond the 10 % lead to decrease the compressive strength of <b>sand</b> cement <b>block.</b> However, cement replacement with coarser RHA decreased the compressive strength at all the replacement percentages. The density of <b>sand</b> cement <b>block</b> decreased as RHA content increased. Moreover, higher water absorption capacity was observed at higher RHA content...|$|R

For that reason, many marquetarians have switched to fret or scroll saw techniques. Other requirements are a pattern of some kind, some brown gummed tape (IE as the moistened glue dries it causes the tape to shrink and so the veneer pieces are pulled closer together), PVA glue and a base-board with balancing veneers on the alternate face to compensate stresses. Finishing the piece will require fine abrasive paper always backed by a <b>sanding</b> <b>block.</b> Either ordinary varnish, special varnishes, modern polyurethane -oil or water based- good waxes and even the technique of french polish are different methods used to seal and finish the piece.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{different approaches}} to creating mathematical models to provide abrasive finishing. It highlights the features of abrasive finishing of precision parts at the final processing stages. The paper persuasively argues {{that it is necessary}} to take into consideration the law of size distribution in the batch of simultaneously treated work-pieces with double-sided lapping of precision plane-parallel and cylindrical parts, such as end bars and cylinders for measuring the pitch diameter. The paper also proposes geometric models of the batch of simultaneously treated work-pieces for plane-parallel and cylindrical parts when lapping them in a double-disk lapping machine as a "general work-piece". On the basis of geometrical models an expression is created to calculate the change of a working pressure or the distributed load (for cylindrical parts) in the process of abrasive finishing. The paper presents the experimental study results of changing geometrical dimensions in the batch of work-pieces of the end measures of length in abrasive process thereby confirming the validity of the proposed approach to creating model. There is a justification that in the mathematical model should be introduced expressions describing the change of abrasiveness of the abrasive used for different kinds of lapping, including that of applied to the final lapping. A mathematical model is presented in the form of integrodifferential equations describing how the rate of linear material removal in double-sided finishing depends on the speed of relative movement of the work-pieces on the lap (<b>sanding</b> <b>block),</b> as well as on the pressure or distributed load (for cylindrical parts), and acceleration of relative motion, with appropriate exponents. The expression taking into account the change of the abrasiveness of the abrasive used is introduced in the differential equation. The model is presented in a generalized form, taking into account all possible processing factors. In specific cases it can be significantly simplified. The model can be used to calculate the finishing machine rates of processing the batches of work-pieces...|$|E

40|$|Coconut shells are {{produced}} in significant quantities in Sri Lanka as coconut tree {{has a large}} amount of usage in the country. Although coconut shell has different usages, considerably large amount of them remain in the environment as waste. Coconut shells dumped improperly to the environment provide breeding places for disease vectors such as rats and mosquitoes. Utilization of coconut shell as building material will be an important step to improve sustainability. In this study, an attempt was made to utilize Crushed Coconut Shell (CCS) in the manufacturing of masonry blocks as for the replacement of coarse aggregate (i. e., chips). Solid masonry blocks having the sizes of 360 mm × 100 mm × 170 mm were casted with the mix proportion of 1 : 5 Cement: Sand. Coconut shells were crushed, sieved and added to the mixture in different proportions to determine its optimum percentage of utilization. The blocks were experimented for 7, 14 and 28 day compressive strength. Compressive strength of crushed coconut shell based <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks</b> with 20 %, 25 %, 30 % (volume basis) of CCS have been examined, so as to investigate whether crushed coconut shell can be used as fully replacement of coarse aggregates and its optimum percentage. The structural performances of crushed coconut shell based <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks</b> were compared with the same percentage of coarse aggregate <b>sand</b> cement <b>blocks</b> (i. e., control blocks). Water absorption capacity was investigated for this CCS based masonry blocks and was compared with conventional cement <b>sand</b> <b>block</b> with coarse aggregate. The optimum percentage of utilization of CCS was identified by considering maximum compressive strength that was obtained using laboratory experiments. It was found that the maximum compressive strength of CCS based cement <b>sand</b> <b>block</b> is achieved at 25 % replacement level.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{greatest}} challenges in the construction sector throughout the world is the development of appropriate building materials that can reduce energy consumption. In this work, an investigation on the thermophysical properties of three wet composite building materials was carried out: the black pouzzolan, the red pouzzolan and <b>sand</b> cinder <b>blocks.</b> Experimental measurements were carried out on these three materials each with a water contentranging between 0 and 5 %. Using an asymmetrical hot plate device, a transient method, the thermal effusivity and volumetric heat capacity were estimated experimentally with respect to water content. With the values of the mass specific heat capacity of pouzzolans, sand and cement separately measured by the Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) method, the values of the volumetric heat capacity of these composite materials were evaluated according to their water content calculated from the theoretical developed model. The results obtained are in good agreement with those determined experimentally with the asymmetrical hot plate method (maximum standard deviations 5 %). Results reveal that the thermal conductivity of red pouzzolan cinder blocks (e. g. lambda = 0. 503 W m(- 1) K- 1 at 0 % water content) and of black pouzzolan cinder blocks (e. g. lambda = 0. 549 W m(- 1) K- 1 at 0 % water content) are lower than that of <b>sand</b> cinder <b>blocks</b> (e. g. lambda = 0. 875 W m(- 1) K- 1 at 0 % water content). Results also show that pouzzolans cinder blocks have higher volumetric heat capacity than <b>sand</b> cinder <b>blocks.</b> These results further confirm that blocks based on pouzzolans are better insulator materials than <b>sand</b> <b>blocks</b> (usually uses) and can contribute significantly to the energy saving and thus reduce the GHG emission in the air-conditioning building...|$|R

This simple invention developed and patented by Tim Hartley is worth the while for any farmer or farmers group involved in irrigation. It removes sand from the borehole, at the well-point or the river, while under online pressure. Here is how it works. Sandy water enters {{the bottom of the}} Trap equipment under pressure up to 10 bar and clean water comes out {{from the top of the}} Sand Trap under the same pressure. The rising speed of the water is slower than the settling speed of the sand which can therefore never reach the Trap s outlet only the clean water can. The accumulated sand can periodically be flushed through from the Trap by opening the flush valve. The maximum flow rate of the trap is 4, 000 litres/ hour. For higher flow rates, two or more sand traps would have to be installed in parallel. The device costs ZAR 980 South African Rand (t 142), excluding transport.

40|$|Although {{there are}} many ancient {{buildings}} constructed with earth as a walling material, bricks and cement blocks have overtaken this material in the recent history. With the sustainable concepts being actively promoted in the construction industry, stabilized earth is becoming popular {{in many parts of}} the world due to various environmental problems associated with the use of conventional materials such as clay mining, sand mining, etc. Some recent advances in manually and hydraulically operated machines have allowed the manufacturing of compressed stabilized earth bricks and blocks (CSEB) which could easily compete with burnt clay bricks and cement <b>sand</b> <b>blocks.</b> These blocks have a distinct advantage of use of machines for manufacturing which allow a greater freedom for controlling the quality. Since different sizes and types of stabilized earth blocks are available, it is important to investigate the performance of those as walling materials. Therefore, an experimental study was conducted to assess the performance of stabilized earth bricks manufactured to the standard brick size, interlocking solid blocks, interlocking hollow blocks and plain solid blocks. In this study, the stabilized earth brick walls, which were constructed with different bond patterns such as Flemish, English and Stretcher, have been investigated for the performance in load carrying capacity and load deformation characteristics. The bricks were bonded with cement sand mortar. Both hollow and plain interlocking blocks were bonded with a soil cement paste. The performance of different CSEB units was compared in the study and also it was compared with that of burnt clay bricks and cement <b>sand</b> <b>blocks.</b> The results revealed that burnt clay brick and stabilized earth brick wall panels behave in a similar manner.
