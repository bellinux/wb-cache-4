500|$|A year later, {{while working}} with Tin Machine on their second album, he mused on his {{previous}} few albums: [...] "You can tell I was terribly unhappy {{in the late}} '80s. ... I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never Let Me Down had good songs that I mistreated. I didn't really apply myself. I wasn't quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{was supposed to be}} doing. I wish there had been someone around who could have told me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was thinking about when she told me about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

At first, he didn't get it hundred percent. I think he wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going for because it's such a comic sample. But once I broke down the idea to him, another angle: 'I don't need you no more, don't {{want to see you}} no more, you get no love.' Then it clicked." ...|$|E

60|$|She glided up to me, {{she threw}} her arms about me and {{kissed me on the}} lips, and I think I kissed her back, but really I am not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did or said, for my head swam. When it cleared again she was {{standing}} in front of me, looking at me reflectively.|$|E

60|$|Reader, {{it is not}} {{pleasant}} to dwell on these details. Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was {{what was to be}} expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment? Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me condense now. I am sick of the subject.|$|E
