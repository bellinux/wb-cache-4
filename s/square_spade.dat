25|$|Sloping {{shoulder}} spades: Sloping shoulder spades {{usually have}} a sloping shoulder, with the two outside lines on the obverse and reverse at an angle. The central line is often missing. This type is generally smaller than the prototype or <b>square</b> shoulder <b>spades.</b> Their inscriptions are clearer, and usually consist of two characters. They {{are associated with the}} Kingdom of Zhou and the Henan area. Their smaller size indicates that they are later in date than the <b>square</b> shoulder <b>spades.</b>|$|R
25|$|Pointed {{shoulder}} spades: This type of spade {{has pointed}} shoulders and feet, {{and a long}} hollow handle. There are three parallel lines on the obverse and reverse, and occasionally inscriptions. They are found in N.E. Henan and in Shanxi, territory of the Duchy of Jin, later to become Zhao. They are held to be somewhat later in date than the <b>square</b> shouldered <b>spades.</b> Their shape seems to be designed for ease of tying together in bundles, rather than developed from any particular agricultural instrument.|$|R
25|$|Square foot spades: This type has square feet, {{a square}} crutch, and a central {{line on the}} obverse. The reverses are {{normally}} only three lines, apart from on spades produced by some mints {{in the state of}} Zhao that also produced pointed foot spades. These have numerals on the reverse. The mints that produced <b>square</b> foot <b>spades</b> are more numerous than those that produced the pointed foot spades. Their weights are compatible with the half jin denomination. They are associated with the states of Han, Zhao, Liang, Zhou, and Yan. Their find spots include the provinces of Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang. The type is no doubt contemporary with the pointed foot spades; some mints issued both types, and the two are found together in hoards.|$|R
2500|$|Ming knives: Ming knives are {{generally}} smaller than pointed tip knives, and their tips are approximately straight. This type of knife money takes {{its name from}} the character on the obverse, which has traditionally been read as ming (...) [...] Other proposals have been yi (...) , ju (...) , ming (...) , and zhao (...) [...] A mint for Ming knives was unearthed at Xiadu, to the south west of Peking. This was the site of Yi, capital of the State of Yan from 360 BC, so the reading of yi has found favour recently. Moulds have also been discovered in Shandong. These coins themselves have been found, often in great quantities, in the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Manchuria, and even as far afield as Korea and Japan. They are found together with pointed and <b>square</b> foot <b>spade</b> money.|$|R
5000|$|Sharp cornered spades': these form a {{distinct}} sub-series of the <b>square</b> foot <b>spades.</b> They differ {{slightly from the}} normal type as they have small triangular projections on the handle. The inscriptions of the three larger types include the characters jin (...) and nie (...) [...] While nie {{was the name of}} a river in Henan, the character cannot be readily construed as part of a place name, as it is found in conjunction with other place names such as Lu Shi and Yu. According to the Fang Yan (an ancient book on dialects),nie meant the same as hua (...) , money or coin. Thus the charactersjin nie mean “metal coin”. The weights of the larger coins seem slightly higher than the 14 grams of the jin standard. Their find spots correspond with the states of Liang and Han.|$|R
5000|$|Square foot spades: {{this type}} has square feet, a square crutch, and a central {{line on the}} obverse.

They are associated with the states of Han, Zhao, Liang, Zhou, and Yan. They are found in the provinces of Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang. The type is contemporary, along with the pointed foot spades. Some mints issued both types, and the two are found together in hoards.|$|R

Camps for youth in the 5-20 age range are subsidized by J+S, and also receive some basic material (wool blankets, denim <b>square</b> units, ropes, <b>spades,</b> etc.) from J+S for these occasions. J+S is also deeply involved in leader training, because unit leaders are basically special youth sport trainers.|$|R

25|$|Although for {{discussion}} purposes the Zhou coins are divided up into categories of knives, spades, and round coins, {{it is apparent}} from archaeological finds {{that most of the}} various kinds circulated together. A hoard found in 1981, near Hebi in north Henan province, consisted of: 3,537 Gong spades, 3 Anyi arched foot spades, 8 Liang Dang Lie <b>spades,</b> 18 Liang <b>square</b> foot <b>spades</b> and 1,180 Yuan round coins, all contained in three clay jars. Another example is a find made in Liaoning province in 1984, which consisted of 2,280 Yi Hua round coins, 14 spade coins, and 120 Ming knives. In 1960 in Shandong, 2 Yi Hua round coins were found with 600 Qi round coins and 59 Qi knives. At Luoyang a find was made in 1976 of 116 flat handled spades of various types (Xiangyuan, Lin, Nie, Pingyang, Yu, Anyang, and Gong), 46 Anzang round coins, 1 yuan round coin, and small/sloping shoulder spades from Sanchuan, Wu, Anzang, Dong Zhou, Feng, and Anzhou.|$|R
25|$|Square {{shoulder}} spades: <b>Square</b> shoulder <b>spade</b> coins have <b>square</b> shoulders, {{a straight}} or slightly curving foot, and three parallel {{lines on the}} obverse and reverse. They are found in quantities of up to several hundreds in the area corresponding to the Royal Domain of Zhou (south Hebei and north Henan). Archaeological evidence dates them to the early Spring and Autumn period, around 650 BC onwards. The inscriptions on these coins usually consist of one character, {{which can be a}} number, a cyclical character, a place name, or the name of a clan. The possibility that some inscriptions are the names of merchants has not been entertained. The crude writing is that of the artisans who made the coins, not the more careful script of the scholars who wrote the votive inscriptions on bronzes. The style of writing is consistent with that of the middle Zhou period. Over 200 inscriptions are known; many have not been fully deciphered. The characters {{can be found on the}} left or the right of the central line and are sometimes inverted or retrograde. The alloy of these coins is typically 80% copper, 15% lead, and 5% tin. They are found in hoards of hundreds, rather than thousands, sometimes tied together in bundles. Although there is no mention in the literature of their purchasing power, it is clear that they were not small change.|$|R
