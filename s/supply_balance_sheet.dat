40|$|The paper {{describes}} how the Slovenian accession to European Union (EU) influenced the conditions on vegetable market in Slovenia. Slovenia remains the net importer of fresh vegetables. Annually, it imports larger quantities of vegetables than there are produced by agricultural holdings. The <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> for vegetables {{is the basis of}} an analysis of vegetable consumption on the level of entire country and allows the comparison with other countries. Data have shown that the degree of self-sufficiency varies a lot between years due to weather conditions. Although the conditions for vegetable growing in Slovenia are favourable, domestic production is too low to meet the domestic consumption. Many investigations have also shown that Slovenian people consume too small amounts of vegetables. This statement is supported by the <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> for vegetables. The human consumption per capita in Slovenia is gradually increasing, but it is still low in comparison with the EU countries...|$|E

40|$|Analyses of {{national}} markets for organic agricultural products are {{constrained by the}} lack of official statistics on production, consumption or international trade in any European country. As a result there are several, often very contradictory and inconsistent estimations on the amount of the organic production or consumption in the EU or even in individual EU countries. The main sources for market data estima-tions are surveys with market actors and sometimes extrapolations of household or retailer panel studies. One possibility to reduce the problem of inconsistent market data for a geographical region is to use the method of <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> (SBS). By using SBS which compare the resources and uses of a product, it is easier to detect inconsistencies between produc-tion, consumption or foreign trade data. Additional quality checks can support the identification of inconsistencies between organic and conventional market data...|$|R
30|$|However, {{previous}} {{studies have found that}} rapid loan <b>supply</b> worsens <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> strength. Again this background this study examined whether higher loan growth always transforms into higher loan losses under the influence of important macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation and unemployment. Many studies have suggested that borrowers do not default immediately after receiving a loan; rather, it usually takes 3  years or more (Berger and Udell 2004). Similarly, Foos et al. (2010) and Salas and Salas and Saurina (2002) revealed that the growth in abnormal loans in previous years is directly associated with loan losses at both the aggregate and the individual bank level.|$|R

To determine and analyze them, we started with the classification of assets (monetary and non-monetary) and liabilities (monetary and nonmonetary). The actual values of these elements were established {{on the basis of}} information <b>supplied</b> by the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> followed by the calculus of the net monetary statement and of the net non-monetary statement. These indicators provide relevant and reliable information to the users of financial statements and, in the future, they should be taken into account because they bring additional information about the financial position of the entity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} rescue measures adopted during {{the global financial}} crisis helped to sustain the supply of bank lending. The analysis proposes a setup that allows testing for structural shifts in the bank lending equation, and employs a novel dataset covering large international banks headquartered in 14 major advanced economies for the period 1995 - 2010. While stronger capitalisation sustains loan growth in normal times, banks during a crisis can turn additional capital into greater lending only once their capitalisation exceeds a critical threshold. This suggests that recapitalisations may not translate into greater credit <b>supply</b> until bank <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> are sufficiently strengthened. bank lending channel, monetary policy, financial crisis, rescue packages, recapitalisation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of a central bank {{contains}} valuable information {{for the quality of}} a currency. As an illustration we analyze the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the Federal Reserve System (FED) during the subprime crisis between June 2007 and December 2008. Until September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the FED did not expand strongly. However, the structure of the FED assets varied pronouncedly. Starting in September 2008 the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> expanded dramatically. The calculation of certain <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> ratios supports the assessment of an important decrease {{of the quality of the}} currency.
