5|$|Leaders of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Baptists</b> and United Methodists led {{opposition}} to the amendment during Wilkinson's administration, activating the Coalition Against a State Lottery. Despite the opposition, Kentucky voters approved the lottery amendment {{by a vote of}} 694,577 to 446,937 in the November 1988 elections. Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the lottery. The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's lottery commission. The recommendations included the establishment of a lottery board whose president and members would be appointed by the governor and could only be removed by the governor, and earmarked the first year's proceeds to be split evenly between early childhood education programs, programs for the elderly, and a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. Legislators insisted on more legislative control of the lottery and did not favor explicit earmarks for the proceeds, preferring to allocate them in the 1990 legislative session. They also objected to the lottery board's exemption from open records and open meetings laws.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2000, Carter, {{a third-generation}} <b>Southern</b> <b>Baptist,</b> {{announced}} that he was severing connections to the <b>Southern</b> <b>Baptist</b> Convention over its opposition to women as pastors.

This statement followed a position of the Convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands. Carter described the reason for his decision as due to: [...] "an increasing inclination on the part of <b>Southern</b> <b>Baptist</b> Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a <b>Southern</b> <b>Baptist</b> and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them." [...] The New York Times called Carter's action [...] "the highest-profile defection yet from the <b>Southern</b> <b>Baptist</b> Convention." ...|$|R
