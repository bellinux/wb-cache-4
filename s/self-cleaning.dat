5|$|Heavy metals are {{relatively}} scarce in the Earth's crust but {{are present in}} many aspects of modern life. They are used in, for example, golf clubs, cars, antiseptics, <b>self-cleaning</b> ovens, plastics, solar panels, mobile phones, and particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|September 2009 saw {{the opening}} of the university's Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information. This £11 million state of the art {{building}} is dubbed as the quietest building in the world and has other technologically sophisticated features such as <b>self-cleaning</b> glass. Advanced research into quantum computing, nanotechnology, materials and other disciplines are being undertaken in the building.|$|E
5|$|The high {{temperature}} stability, low vapor pressure, {{good wear resistance}} and ability to withstand arc corrosion of rhenium are useful in <b>self-cleaning</b> electrical contacts. In particular, the discharge occurring during the switching oxidizes the contacts. However, rhenium oxide Re2O7 has poor stability (sublimes at ~360°C) and therefore is removed during the discharge.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (rhenium, for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), emission control devices (palladium), and in <b>self-cleaning</b> ovens (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} lubricating greases, paint dryers, and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the ammonium ion form soluble soaps).|$|E
5|$|The {{wings are}} {{transparent}} with black or brown veins and a brown-black patch {{at the base}} of apical cells 2 and 3. These patches are sometimes fused into a continuous zigzag of dark brown to black discolouration. The basal cell is often opaque and amber-coloured. As on many insects, the wing membranes are coated on either side by a repeating pattern of cuticular nanostructures, about 200nm in height, separated by about 180nm. These are thought to aid in anti-reflective camouflage, anti-wetting and <b>self-cleaning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Much of Raël's {{advocacy}} concerning futuristic {{technology is}} described in his 2001 book, Yes to Human Cloning. He supported human genetic engineering {{in order to avoid}} genetically inherited diseases and to reduce the economic burden on society. He said that no distinctive emphasis needed to be allocated to a particular race or religion. Elsewhere in the book, he stated that nanotechnology will make it possible to have micro-distributive power generation (essentially a power plant in each house), fur-like furnishings that are <b>self-cleaning</b> with hair-like fibers that move on their own, and biological robots. Nanostructures control biology, so Raël expected that meat and salads will someday be grown in a machine via molecular construction.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL had {{a rocking}} grate and <b>self-cleaning</b> hopper ashpan {{with water and}} steam {{sprayers}} to dampen down the ash {{to prevent it from}} entering axle boxes, motion areas and other friction-sensitive places. They had <b>self-cleaning</b> type smokeboxes and their axle boxes were grease-lubricated.|$|E
25|$|Most normal ear canals have a <b>self-cleaning</b> and self-drying mechanism, {{the latter}} by simple evaporation.|$|E
25|$|Iranian {{scientists}} at Gilan University created <b>self-cleaning</b> coatings for the textile factories and in construction verified surfaces.|$|E
25|$|<b>Self-cleaning</b> water {{filters are}} used to keep the system clean and running without the need to shut down or replace {{cartridges}} and bags.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 Fujishima and {{his group}} {{discovered}} the superhydrophilicity phenomenon for titanium dioxide coated glass exposed to sun light. This resulted {{in the development of}} <b>self-cleaning</b> glass and anti-fogging coatings.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{symptoms}} of external otitis lead many people to attempt {{to clean out the}} ear canal (or scratch it) with slim implements, <b>self-cleaning</b> attempts generally lead to additional traumas of the injured skin, so rapid worsening of the condition often occurs.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the acute}} {{external}} otitis generally resolves {{in a few}} days with topical washes and antibiotics, complete return of hearing and cerumen gland function may take a few more days. Once healed completely, the ear canal is again <b>self-cleaning.</b> Until it recovers fully, it may be more prone to repeat infection from further physical or chemical insult.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with many LMS standard {{features such as}} a <b>self-cleaning</b> smokebox, rocking firegrate, self-emptying ashpan, side window cab and a simplified footplate together with others which followed NCC practice, such as a water top-feed on a parallel boiler (as opposed to the taper boilers {{being used by the}} LMS at the time), Dreadnought type vacuum brake gear, Detroit sight feed cylinder lubricator and a cast number plate.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, C class heavy goods {{locomotive}} C 5 {{was equipped with}} a new front end, based on the Association of American Railroads (AAR) design of <b>self-cleaning</b> smokebox, to improve steaming qualities. The results were very promising, and in 1934 A2 998 was selected {{for a series of}} further tests aimed at further front end improvement, conducted under the direction of VR Rolling Stock branch engineer, Edgar Brownbill.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{makes use}} of a special {{photocatalytic}} concrete called TX Active {{for the construction of}} two decorative sculptures that resemble the symbol for water used on maps. This material reacts with ultraviolet light and pulls pollutant particles of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxide out of the air and converts them to less harmful substances. The sculptures contain a compound that makes them <b>self-cleaning,</b> so they should stay white {{for as long as they}} stand.|$|E
25|$|Neodymium(III) {{chloride}} is {{also used}} to modify titanium dioxide. The latter {{is one of the most}} popular inorganic photocatalyst for decomposition of phenol, various dyes and other waste water contaminants. The catalytic action of titanium oxide has to be activated by UV light, i.e. artificial illumination. However, modifying titanium oxide with neodymium(III) chloride allows catalysis under visible illumination, such as sun light. The modified catalyst is prepared by chemical coprecipitation–peptization method by ammonium hydroxide from mixture of TiCl4 and NdCl3 in aqueous solution). This process is used commercially on large scale on 1000 liter reactor for using in photocatalytic <b>self-cleaning</b> paints.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} impact of modern style washlets differs from regular flush toilets. Modern toilets use less water than old toilets, and the <b>self-cleaning</b> options also {{reduce the amount of}} detergent. Some toilets even change the amount of water for the flush depending if the seat was flipped up (indicating male urination) or not. They also cause less toilet paper to be used. On the other hand, these toilets also consume energy, and are estimated to consume 5% of the energy of the average Japanese household. In rural areas, toilets that use very little or no water have also been designed. These are also considered as emergency toilets in case of earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|An {{expanded}} bed chromatographic adsorption (EBA) {{column for}} a biochemical separation process comprises a pressure equalization liquid distributor having a <b>self-cleaning</b> function below a porous blocking sieve plate {{at the bottom}} of the expanded bed, an upper part nozzle assembly having a backflush cleaning function at the top of the expanded bed, a better distribution of the feedstock liquor added into the expanded bed ensuring that the fluid passed through the expanded bed layer displays a state of piston flow. The expanded bed layer displays a state of piston flow. The expanded bed chromatographic separation column has advantages of increasing the separation efficiency of the expanded bed.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to rectify these problems, {{locomotive}} C5 was fitted in 1933 with a new front end, based on the Association of American Railroads (AAR) design of <b>self-cleaning</b> smokebox, to improve steaming qualities. The results were very promising and led to further experimental work, using A2 class locomotive A2998 as a test bed and conducted {{under the direction of}} VR Rolling Stock branch engineer Edgar Brownbill, in streamlining the steam passages and other changes to reduce back pressure on the exhaust side and increase efficiency. These changes, referred to as 'Modified Front End', were such an improvement {{that the rest of the}} A2 and C classes were progressively modified, as well as all of the K, N, S and X classes.|$|E
25|$|The Mini-14 {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1973 by Sturm, Ruger & Co. The name Mini-14 was coined because it resembles a smaller version of the military M14 rifle. Designed by L. James Sullivan and William B. Ruger, it incorporated numerous innovations and cost-saving engineering changes. The Mini-14 rifle employs an investment cast, heat-treated receiver and is mechanically similar to the M1 Garand rifle, with a <b>self-cleaning,</b> fixed-piston gas system. Initial rifles were produced with a complex, exposed bolt hold open device with no button for manual engagement. Stocks were somewhat angular and heat shields were made of wood. These rifles, with serial number prefixes before 181, were tooled and redesigned with a new stock, new bolt hold-open mechanism, and other small changes.|$|E
25|$|Photocatalytic {{coatings}} {{are those}} that include components (additives) that catalyze reactions, generally through a free radical mechanism, when excited by light. The photocatalytic activity (PCA) of a material provides a measure of its reactive potential, based {{on the ability of}} the material to create an electron hole pair when exposed to ultra-violet light. Free radicals formed can oxidize and therefore breakdown organic materials, such as latex binders found in waterborne coatings. Antimicrobial coatings systems take advantage of this by including photocatalytically active compounds in their formulations (i.e. titanium dioxide) that cause the coating to “flake” off over time. These flakes carry the microbes along with them, leaving a “clean” coating behind. Systems like this are often described to be <b>self-cleaning.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wood-burners emit large {{quantities}} of flying sparks which necessitate an efficient spark-arresting device generally housed in the smokestack. Many different types were fitted, the most common early type being the Bonnet stack that incorporated a cone-shaped deflector placed before {{the mouth of the}} chimney pipe, and a wire screen covering the wide stack exit. A more-efficient design was the Radley and Hunter centrifugal stack patented in 1850 (commonly known as the diamond stack), incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce a swirl effect in the chamber that encouraged the embers to burn out and fall to the bottom as ash. In the <b>self-cleaning</b> smokebox the opposite effect was achieved: by allowing the flue gasses to strike a series of deflector plates, angled {{in such a way that}} the blast was not impaired, the larger particles were broken into small pieces that would be ejected with the blast, rather than settle in the bottom of the smokebox to be removed by hand at the end of the run. As with the arrestor, a screen was incorporated to retain any large embers.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also <b>self-cleaning</b> and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E
25|$|Rochester is {{a leading}} private {{university}} and a major center for diverse fields of research. The university has eight Nobel Prize winners among its faculty and alumni. The university consistently ranks among the top 40 colleges and universities nationwide in federally financed science, engineering, medical, and other research, with a total research budget of around $395 million spread across many departments and research centers, including the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, a laser-based nuclear fusion facility, and the extensive research facilities at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Recently, the university has also engaged {{in a series of}} new initiatives to expand its programs in biomedical engineering and optics, including the construction of the new $37 million Robert B. Goergen Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics on the River Campus. Other new research initiatives include a cancer stem cell program and a Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. UR also has the ninth highest technology revenue among U.S. higher education institutions, with $46 million being paid for commercial rights to university technology and research in 2009. Notable patents include Zoloft and Gardasil. WeBWorK, a web-based system for checking homework and providing immediate feedback for students, was developed by University of Rochester professors Gage and Pizer. The system is now in use at over 800 universities and colleges, as well as several secondary and primary schools. Rochester scientists work in diverse areas; for example, physicists developed a technique for etching metal surfaces, such as platinum, titanium and brass, with powerful lasers, enabling <b>self-cleaning</b> surfaces that repel water droplets and will not rust if tilted at a 4 degree angle; and medical researchers are exploring how brains rid themselves of toxic waste during sleep.|$|E
500|$|SRI {{performed}} {{a study in}} the 1990s for Whirlpool Corporation that led to modern <b>self-cleaning</b> ovens. [...] In the 2000s, [...] SRI worked on Pathway Tools software for use in bioinformatics and systems biology to accelerate drug discovery using artificial intelligence and symbolic computing techniques. [...] The software system generates the BioCyc database collection, SRI's growing collection of genomic databases used by biologists to visualize genes within a chromosome, complete biochemical pathways, and full metabolic maps of organisms.|$|E
500|$|... "Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink" [...] {{was written}} by Hy Conrad and {{directed}} by Andrei Belgrader. The idea of hiding the crucial piece of evidence in a vacuum bag {{had been on the}} writing table for years at the time that this episode was written. The writers' problem was that they could not get a realistic idea on how to use it. One idea had actually been to have a killer hack up his victim, place the dismembered limbs into a <b>self-cleaning</b> oven, then vacuum out the remains and have the bag filled with the victim. The writers saw this possibility as too gruesome for the show. Other ideas had included hiding something valuable in the bag and having the killer stalk Monk while trying to recover it.|$|E
500|$|Aluminum and {{magnesium}} {{are most often}} welded using alternating current, {{but the use of}} direct current is also possible, depending on the properties desired. Before welding, the work area should be cleaned and may be preheated to [...] for aluminum or to a maximum of [...] for thick magnesium workpieces to improve penetration and increase travel speed. AC current can provide a <b>self-cleaning</b> effect, removing the thin, refractory aluminum oxide (sapphire) layer that forms on aluminum metal within minutes of exposure to air. This oxide layer must be removed for welding to occur. When alternating current is used, pure tungsten electrodes or zirconiated tungsten electrodes are preferred over thoriated electrodes, as the latter are more likely to [...] "spit" [...] electrode particles across the welding arc into the weld. Blunt electrode tips are preferred, and pure argon shielding gas should be employed for thin workpieces. Introducing helium allows for greater penetration in thicker workpieces, but can make arc starting difficult.|$|E
500|$|The {{treatment}} of the upper floors provides a striking contrast. 134,000 green, orange, lime and yellow glazed terracotta tiles cover the façades in 13 irregularly oriented vertical panels on the external perimeter. The façades facing the inner courtyard are lined with another eight panels covered with grey tiles, a design which project architect Maurits van der Staay says was intended to [...] "ensure that the upper storeys did not detract from the transparency of the ground floor and to maximise the amount of light reflected back into the offices." [...] The façades are hung on an internal chassis carrier system (a similar system is in use in another Piano development on Berlin's Potsdamer Platz). Pierced by rows of identical windows repeated across the entire development, the façades {{are expected to be}} effectively <b>self-cleaning</b> and immune to fading. The colours of the façades are evoked in the design of many of the development's interior fittings, such as lift-door reveals, handrails and lift displays. The tiles were produced in Germany by NBK of Emmerich am Rhein and mounted on prefabricated façade units in Wrocław, Poland, by Schneider Fassadenbau.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic design}} of the [...] "Britannias" [...] owed much to LMS {{building}} practices, especially when considering Riddles' previous career with the said railway. [...] However, {{in keeping with the}} necessity to follow best practice in creating standardised steam locomotives, they utilised a variation of both boiler and trailing wheel of the Merchant Navy Class, while weight was kept within the margins laid down by the Light Pacifics, all of which were designed by Oliver Bulleid. [...] The firebox was also similar in having a rocking grate, which allowed the fire to be rebuilt without stopping the locomotive, removing both ash and clinker on the move; but unlike the SR Pacifics, the inner firebox was constructed of copper instead of steel, and lacked thermic syphons. A <b>self-cleaning</b> smokebox was used, which enabled ash to flow into the atmosphere, reducing the workload of the engine cleaner {{at the end of a}} working day. A single chimney was placed on top of the smokebox, which was unusual for a [...] "Pacific" [...] type of locomotive. This was because the blastpipe was designed by S.O. Ell at Swindon Works, who claimed that [...] "better results could be obtained from a well-designed single chimney than some of the previous double chimney arrangements". The [...] "Britannias" [...] had [...] driving wheels, a compromise that took into account the intended mixed-traffic role they were designed for. This meant that they were large enough for sustained fast running with heavy passenger trains, yet small enough to allow them to undertake more mundane tasks such as freight haulage.|$|E
