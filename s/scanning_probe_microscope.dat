50|$|Microthermal {{analysis}} is a materials characterization technique which combines the thermal analysis principles of {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) with high spatial resolution of scanning probe microscopy. The instrument consists of a thermal probe which is basically a fine platinum/rhodium alloy wire (5 micro meter in diameter) coated by a sheath of silver (Wollaston wire). The wire is bent into V-shape and the silver sheath is etched away to form a fine pointed tip. The probe acts as both the heater as well as temperature sensor. The probe {{is attached to a}} conventional <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscope</b> and can be scanned over the sample surface to spatially resolve the thermal behavior of the sample.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of instruments used for surfaces and nanostructures characterization. Individual techniques of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy provide different information of the sample surface. The resolution of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy, providing 3 D topography information, reaches subnanometer values or even an atomic level. Therefore, the <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> microscopy {{is one of the most}} employed method in the field of nanotechnology. The thesis describes the details of development of two <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopes</b> intended for measurement under ultra high vacuum conditions. As for the first one, many changes were proposed leading to its better variability, extended functionality and increased user comfort. The second microscope is being design with the aim of its combination with other analytic techniques, especially with scanning electron microscopy. An integral part of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopes</b> is a precise positioning system for navigation of the probe to the selected site. Therefore, the thesis also deals with the development of linear piezoceramic actuators used not only in the ultra high vacuum compatible microscopes but also as a general purpose nanomanipulators...|$|R

50|$|From 1981 to 1983 Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer {{worked at}} IBM in Zurich, Switzerland {{to study the}} quantum {{tunnelling}} phenomenon and eventually create a practical instrument, a <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscope</b> from quantum tunnelling theory that read very small forces exchanged between a probe and {{the surface of a}} sample. The microscope was not initially well received due to the complex nature of the underlying theoretical explanations. In 1984 Jerry Tersoff and D.R. Hamann while at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey began publishing articles that tied the theoretical with the experimental results obtained by the instrument. This was closely followed in 1985 with functioning commercial instruments, and in 1986 with Gerd Binnig, Quate, and Gerber's invention of the atomic force microscope, then Binnig's and Rohrer's Nobel Prize in Physics for the SPM.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopes</b> and <b>scanning</b> {{electron}} microscopes cannot do {{any form}} of optical sectioning as these microscopes only interact with {{the surface of a}} sample.

40|$|<b>Scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{can be used}} {{to image}} and {{chemically}} characterize surfaces down to the atomic scale. However, the localized tip-sample interactions in <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopes</b> limit high-resolution images to the topmost atomic layer of surfaces, and characterizing the inner structures of materials and biomolecules is a challenge for such instruments. Here, we show that an atomic force microscope {{can be used to}} image and three-dimensionally reconstruct chemical groups inside a protein complex. We use short single-stranded DNAs as imaging labels that are linked to target regions inside a protein complex, and T-shaped atomic force microscope cantilevers functionalized with complementary probe DNAs allow the labels to be located with sequence specificity and subnanometre resolution. After measuring pairwise distances between labels, we reconstruct the three-dimensional structure formed by the target chemical groups within the protein complex using simple geometric calculations. Experiments with the biotin-streptavidin complex show that the predicted three-dimensional loci of the carboxylic acid groups of biotins are within 222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 02632 ̆ 026 of their respective loci in the corresponding crystal structure, suggesting that <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscopes</b> could complement existing structural biological techniques in solving structures that are difficult to study due to their size and complexity. 1 DP 2 -EB 018657 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesDP 2 EB 018657 /EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States 2015 - 09 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25664622 PMC 442905...|$|R
50|$|The {{tunneling}} {{phenomenon is}} used as a probe to study nano-structure on a surface with the help of scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The STM is a powerful device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. The STM can be used not only in an ultra-high vacuum, but also in air {{and a variety of other}} media and at temperatures ranging from nearly zero to hundreds of kelvin. This idea was enhanced to create the atomic force microscope (AFM), which is a very high-resolution type of <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscope</b> with resolution of fractions of a nanometer. The AFM is one of the foremost tools for imaging, measuring and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. The application of RTM includes the visualization and measurement of surface features having sizes and dimensions as small as one nanometer in research and development laboratories as well as a process to control environment.|$|E
50|$|Each {{nanolithography}} {{technique has}} varying factors of resolution, time consumption, and cost. There are three basic methods used by nanolithography. One involves using a resist material which {{acts as a}} “mask” to cover and protect {{the areas of the}} surface that are intended to be smooth. The uncovered portions can now be etched away, with the protective material acting as a stencil. The second method involves directly carving the desired pattern. Etching may involve using a beam of quantum particles, such as electrons or light, or chemical methods such as oxidation or SAM’s (self-assembled monolayers). The third method places the desired pattern directly on the surface, producing a final product that is ultimately a few nanometers thicker than the original surface. In order to visualize the surface to be fabricated, the surface must be visualized by a nano-resolution microscope, which include the <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscope</b> (SPM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM). Both microscopes can also be engaged in processing the final product.|$|E
50|$|Another unique {{property}} of resilin is its high resilience. Recombinant resilin demonstrated excellent mechanical properties {{similar to that}} of pure resilin. Elvin et al. aimed to compare the resilience of rec1-Resilin to other rubbers, a <b>scanning</b> <b>probe</b> <b>microscope</b> of used. This study compared the resilience of rec1-Resilin to two different types of rubber: chlorobutyl rubber and polybutadiene rubber, both rubbers with high resilience properties. This study concluded that rec1-Resilin was 92% resilient compared to chlorobutyl rubber at 56% and polybutadiene rubber at 80%, respectively. With such high mechanical resilience, the properties of rec1-Resilin can be applied to other clinical applications within the field of Materials Engineering and Medicine. This study on recombinant resilin has led to several years of research on the use of resilin like proteins for several biomedical applications that retains the mechanical properties of resilin.  The ongoing results of the studies involving recombinant resilin may lead to further research in which other unexplored mechanical properties and chemical structure of resilin may be investigated.|$|E
