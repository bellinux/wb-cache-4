25|$|Regional geology {{can have}} a large effect on the {{characteristics}} of ground motion. The site response of the ground motion may vary in different locations of the city according to the local geology. A seismic zonation map for a whole country may, therefore, be inadequate for detailed <b>seismic</b> <b>hazard</b> assessment of the cities. This necessitates the development of microzonation maps for big cities for detailed <b>seismic</b> <b>hazard</b> analysis. Microzonation maps can serve as a basis for evaluating site-specific risk analysis, which is essential for critical structures like nuclear power plants, subways, bridges, elevated highways, sky trains and dam sites. Seismic microzonation can be considered as the preliminary phase of earthquake risk mitigation studies. It requires multi-disciplinary contributions as well as comprehensive understanding of the effects of earthquake generated ground motions on man made structures. Many large cities around the world have put effort into developing microzonation maps for the better understanding of earthquake hazard within the cities.|$|E

RFS 2001-01 replaced RFS I.2.c, published in 1981, however it has been criticised for continuing to require a deterministic assessment (rather than a probabilistic approach) that relies primarily on the strongest 'historically known' earthquake near a site. This leads {{to a number of}} problems including the short period (in geological timescales) for which there are records, the difficulty of assessing the characteristics of earthquakes that occurred prior to the use of seismometers, the difficulty of identifying the existence of all earthquakes that pre-date the historic record, and ultimately the reliance on one single earthquake scenario. Other criticisms include the use of intensity in the evaluation method, rather than spectral acceleration, which is commonly used elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|The 2015 Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 3, or UCERF3, is {{the latest}} {{official}} earthquake rupture forecast (ERF) {{for the state of}} California, superseding UCERF2. [...] It provides authoritative estimates of the likelihood and severity of potentially damaging earthquake ruptures in the long- and near-term.

[...] This information is used to inform engineering design and building codes, planning for disaster, and evaluating whether earthquake insurance premiums are sufficient for the prospective losses. A variety of hazard metrics [...] can be calculated with UCERF3; a typical metric is the likelihood of a magnitude M 6.7 earthquake (the size of the 1994 Northridge earthquake) in the 30 years (typical life of a mortgage) since 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{striking}} concentrations of mid-crustal seismicity in western Washington outside of Puget Sound are the Saint Helens Zone (SHZ) and Western Rainier Zone (WRZ) {{at the southern}} edge of the Puget Lowland (see seismicity map, right). [...] Indeed, it is mainly by their seismicity that these faults are known and have been located, neither showing any surface faulting. [...] The SHZ and WRZ lie just outside the topographical basin that constitutes the Puget Lowland (see image), do not participate in the uplift and basin pattern, and unlike the rest of the faults in the Puget Lowland (which are reverse or thrust faults reflecting mostly compressive forces) they appear to be strike-slip faults; they reflect a geological context distinctly {{different from the rest of}} the Puget Lowland. [...] In particular, to the southeast of Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier they reflect a regional pattern of NNW oriented faulting, including the Entiat Fault in the North Cascades and the Portland Hills and related faults around Portland (see QFFDB [...] ). [...] Yet the SHZ and WRZ may be integral to the regional geology of Puget Sound, possibly revealing some deep and significant facets, and may also present significant <b>seismic</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The most studied {{earthquake}} faults (such as the Nankai megathrust, the Wasatch fault, and the San Andreas fault) {{appear to}} have distinct segments. [...] The characteristic earthquake model postulates that earthquakes are generally constrained within these segments. As the lengths and other properties of the segments are fixed, earthquakes that rupture the entire fault should have similar characteristics. These include the maximum magnitude (which {{is limited by the}} length of the rupture), and the amount of accumulated strain needed to rupture the fault segment. [...] Since continuous plate motions cause the strain to accumulate steadily, seismic activity on a given segment should be dominated by earthquakes of similar characteristics that recur at somewhat regular intervals. For a given fault segment, identifying these characteristic earthquakes and timing their recurrence rate (or conversely return period) should therefore inform us about the next rupture; this is the approach generally used in forecasting <b>seismic</b> <b>hazard.</b> UCERF3 is a notable example of such a forecast, prepared for the state of California. Return periods are also used for forecasting other rare events, such as cyclones and floods, and assume that future frequency will be similar to observed frequency to date.|$|E
30|$|High-resolution aeromagnetic surveys over forearc basins {{can detect}} faults and folds in weakly {{magnetized}} sediments, thus providing geologic constraints on tectonic evolution and improved understanding of <b>seismic</b> <b>hazards</b> in convergent-margin settings.

Similarities in aeromagnetic anomaly patterns and magnetic stratigraphy between the two regions suggest that we can expect the aeromagnetic method to yield useful structural information that may contribute to earth-hazard and energy resource investigations in other forearc basins.|$|R
