40|$|To {{elucidate}} mechanisms {{involved in}} deoxyribonucleic acid-mediated gene transfer, we transferred the {{herpes simplex virus}} thymidine kinase gene (TK) into mouse Ltk- cells. Independent TK+ clones (transformants) and derivatives of each were tested for phenotypic expression and the presence and arrangement of TK sequences. Initially, transformants expressed viral TK unstable, with 10 % of the cells in each generation losing both the TK+ phenotype and virally derived TK sequences. After a prolonged period in culture, stable subpopulations arose from which the TK+ phenotype and viral sequences were no longer lost at detectable frequency. Analysis of unstable cell populations indicated that individual viral deoxyribonucleic acid molecules were reduced in size, but were linked to other deoxyribonucleic acid to form molecules {{large enough to be}} precipitated in a Hirt fractionation. We term these molecules transgenomes. Analysis of independent unstable subclones derived from the primary transformants demonstrated that individual transgenomes could contain multiple copies of the viral TK <b>sequences.</b> <b>Recipient</b> cell lines frequently possessed more than one type of transgenome and possibly multiple copies per cell of each type.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Limbal {{allotransplantation}} {{is increasingly}} {{being used for}} ocular surface repair in patients with limbal stem cell dysfunction. However, it is uncertain whether donor cells survive long term on the ocular surface and whether patients maintain the early benefits of the procedure. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the long term outcome of clinical limbal allografts and to correlate outcome with donor cell survival. METHODS: Five patients who had undergone allotransplantation-four keratolimbal allografts and one tarsoconjunctival allograft-from 3 - 5 years previously, and for whom residual frozen donor ocular tissue was available, were reviewed. Survival of donor cells lifted from the recipient ocular surface by impression cytology was investigated by DNA fingerprinting using primers detecting variable nucleotide tandem repeat <b>sequences.</b> <b>Recipient</b> buccal cells and scleral samples from the remnant donor eye were used to genotype recipients and donors, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction products were sized by Genescan analysis. RESULTS: An objective long term benefit from the procedure (improved Snellen acuity, reduced frequency of epithelial defects, reduced vascularisation, and scarring) was recorded for four patients. Some subjective benefit was also reported. However, in no instances were donor cells recovered from the ocular surface at 3 - 5 years post-graft. Initial experiments to examine sensitivity indicated that any surviving donor cells must have constituted less than 2. 5 % of cells sampled. CONCLUSION: Limbal stem cell allotransplantation can provide long term benefits, as measured by objective criteria. However, such benefits do not necessarily correlate with survival of measurable numbers of donor cells on the ocular surface...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Consider a {{placebo-controlled}} preventive HIV {{vaccine efficacy}} trial. An HIV amino acid se-quence is measured from each volunteer who acquires HIV, and these sequences are aligned {{together with the}} reference HIV sequence represented in the vaccine. We develop genome scanning methods to identify positions at which the amino acids in infected vaccine <b>recipient</b> <b>sequences</b> either (A) are more divergent from the reference amino acid than the amino acids in infected placebo <b>recipient</b> <b>sequences</b> or (B) have a different frequency distribution than the placebo sequences, irrespective of a reference amino acid. We consider t-test-type statistics for problem A and Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and Kullback–Leibler-type statis-tics for problem B. The test statistics incorporate weights to reflect biological information contained in different amino acid positions and mismatches. Position-specific p-values are obtained by approximating the null distribution of the statistics either by a permutation procedure or by a nonparametric estimation. A permutation method is used to estimate a cut-off p-value to control the per comparison error rate at a prespecified level.
