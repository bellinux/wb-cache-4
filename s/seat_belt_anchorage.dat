Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 210 specifies requirements for {{the layout of the}} anchorages relative to the seating reference point and seat back angle established by the SAE J 826 H-point manikin. Sled testing and computational simulation has established that belt anchorage locations {{have a strong}} effect on occupant kinematics, particularly for child occupants using the belt as their primary restraint. As part of a larger study of vehicle geometry, the locations of the anchorage points in the second-row, outboard seating positions of 83 passenger cars and light trucks with a median model year of 2005 were measured. The lower anchorage locations spanned the entire range of lap belt angles permissible under FMVSS 210 and the upper anchorages (D-ring locations) were distributed widely as well. Combined with the findings from concurrent research on the effects of belt geometry, these results suggest that occupant kinematics in frontal impact can be expected to differ widely across vehicles due to differences in belt geometry...|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the application of}} a pseudo-dynamic (PsD) method to the dynamic analysis of passenger seats for the automotive industry. The project of such components involves a structural test considering the action of dynamic forces arising from a crash scenario. The laboratory certification of these automotive components consists essentially on the inspection of the propagation and extension of plastic deformations zones in metallic members of the seat structure as consequence of the mutual action between the seat and the passenger fastened to the <b>seat</b> via <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>anchorages.</b> This work presents a relatively simple experiment using PsD techniques as a novel method to performa test equivalent to the dynamic model of a dummy-seat pair subjected to impulsive loads from a car crash. Essentially, the PsD test method is a hybrid and hierarchic computer-driven testing procedure where a numerical algorithm and experimental step are used and combined on-line in order to solve a problem in the scope of structural dynamics. The implementation of the method is not expensive and has the leading advantage of offering the operator a total control of any intermediate structure state during the test still keeping the realism of a real dynamic testing.

40|$|A {{series of}} sled tests was {{conducted}} to examine the performance of booster <b>seats</b> under <b>belt</b> geometries representing the range found in the rear seats of current vehicles. Twelve tests were performed with the standard 6 YO Hybrid III ATD and 29 tests were performed with {{a modified version of}} the 6 YO ATD. The modified dummy has a pelvis with more realistic shape and flesh stiffness, a gel abdomen with biomechanically-based stiffness characteristics, and a custom neoprene jacket. Shoulder <b>belt</b> upper <b>anchorage</b> was set at the FMVSS No. 213 <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> location and 64 mm inboard and outboard from this location. Lap <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations were chosen to span the range of lap belt angles permitted under FMVSS 210, using the FMVSS No. 213 <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations and forward <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> locations that produce a much steeper lap belt angle. Four booster seats that provide a range of static belt fit were used. The ATDs were positioned using either the standard FMVSS No. 213 seating procedure or an alternate UMTRI procedure that produces postures closer to those of similar-size children. Kinematic results for the standard and modified dummies under the same test conditions were more similar than expected. The current version of the modified 6 YO is less sensitive to lap belt geometry than the prototype version of the dummy. The seating procedure had a greater affect on kinematic results. The UMTRI seating procedure produced greater knee-head excursion differences and less forward torso rotation than the FMVSS No. 213 procedure. Shifting the shoulder <b>belt</b> upper <b>anchorage</b> 128 mm laterally produced minimal variations in kinematics for a given booster seat/lap belt condition, likely because the belt-routing features of the booster seats limited the differences in static shoulder belt score to less than 10 mm. Moving the lap belt geometry from rearward (shallow angle) to forward (steep angle) produced less desirable kinematics with all booster seats tested. The forward position of the lap <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> allows greater forward translation of the booster and ATD before the belt engages the pelvis. Steeper belt angles are associated with better lap belt fit for children sitting without boosters, so designing rear <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> for children who sit with and without boosters may involve a performance tradeoff...|$|R
40|$|Final, April 2011 ‐May 2012 In a {{previous}} study, a computational model of child occupants 6 to 10 years old (YO) was validated {{using data from}} a sled test series with the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid‐III ATDs. Simulations using this model were used to identify characteristics of a vehicle seat and belt geometry that would improve occupant protection for older children not using booster seats. The current report presents a series of sled tests {{to examine the effects}} for other occupants using vehicle seats optimized for 6 ‐ to 10 ‐year‐old children. Tests were conducted with a 12 MO CRABI seated in a Graco SnugRide rear‐facing infant restraint and a Hybrid III 50 th male ATD. Seat cushion length was set to 450 mm, 400 mm, and 350 mm. Lap belt conditions included one representing the mid‐range of FMVSS No. 210, “Seat belt assembly anchorages,” allowable <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> conditions as well as one more forward but closer to the vehicle seat H‐point. Shoulder belt conditions included the standard FMVSS No. 213 shoulder belt anchorage as well as one positioned closer to the adult male shoulder. Vehicle seats from a 2008 Dodge Town and Country were used, and some tests included modifications to make the front support structure of the seat cushion stiffer. The tests with the midsize adult male ATD showed no negative consequences from design changes intended to improve protection for children. Kinematics were similar among all conditions tested. For the rear‐facing infant restraint, none of the tests exceeded the 70 ° rotation angle requirement of FMVSS No. 213, although shorter cushion length and more forward belt locations produced larger rotations. The three tests with the more forward lap belt geometry slightly exceeded the 3 ‐ms‐chest clip acceleration limit of 60 g, but a review of all chest acceleration curves suggests that the vehicle seat may produce higher chest accelerations than the FMVSS No. 213 test bench. In tests with the shortest seat cushion length, the infant seat showed acceptable kinematics even though less than 80 percent of the child restraint base was initially supported on the vehicle seat. These preliminary tests with rear vehicle seat configurations selected to optimize protection for older child occupants produced good restraint kinematics for infants in a rear‐facing only child restraint and for adult mid‐size males. Additional research to identify possible negative consequences for other types of child restraints should be conducted. If shorter cushion lengths are chosen as a safety countermeasure for older children, the current child restraint installation requirement to have at least 80 percent of the base contacting the vehicle seat will need to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} performance of automotive child restraint systems (CRS) that conform to international proposals for a universal restraint concept to be adopted by both restraint and vehicle manufacturers. The concept is known as Isofix (International Standards Organisation FIXing), and is intended to ensure optimum compatibility and coupling between vehicle and CRS. In order to quantify {{the benefits of the}} proposed Isofix concept it has been necessary to establish the performance limits and benefits offered by current commercially available adult belt retained CRS. A considerable body of knowledge existed on the performance and limitations of the then current CRS. However, during 1995 a significant amendment was introduced affecting ECE R 44, the compliance standards applicable to CRS in Europe to which most rnanufacturers require their products to conform (separate national standards also exist). In 1995 amendment 03 was added to ECE R 44 and became a catalyst for considerable development activity by manufacturers of child restraints, that resulted in new or revised product ranges. These new products, in particular forward facing Group 1 (9 - 15 kg) child restraints have significantly improved dynamic performance in frontal impacts, notably in modern vehicles whose <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> <b>anchorage</b> positions have been optimised for restraint of adults, but are commonly less effective in restraining framed CRS. It was important therefore to re-assess existing systems as the baseline for a realistic evaluation of the proposed Isofix concepts (chapter 10). It was evident that, of the different Isofix concepts being proposed, no overall evaluation of their relative performance had, to that date, been undertaken. A programme involving the design and manufacture of not only suitable test equipment but, in a number of cases, prototype devices, was undertaken. The resulting data have formed the basis of input to the ISO Working Group 1, the body responsible for the evolution of the Isofix concept. This programme also highlighted a number of shortfalls in the proposed concepts. The major results of this test programme have been published at international level, and were used to inform the Isofix discussions. During the programme of comparative evaluation of not only the Isofix but the current belt retained devices, it became clear to the writer that in a frontal impact the orientation of the occupant with respect to the direction of travel had significance. A literature survey produced evidence of minimal research in this area. Hence it was decided by the writer to include a programme of parametric tests to investigate the significance of occupant orientation, given that commercially available CRS often include a feature to vary the recline angle of the seat. The Isofix set-up was particularly suitable for this exercise in that it eliminated many of the variables associated with belt retained devices. The results of this work have been published at intemationallevel. A review of the available accident data indicates that side impacts are potentially more life threatening than the more common frontal impacts due to the proximity of the occupant to an intruding vehicle or object. However, current European certification standards do not require the evaluation of CRS in a side impact. This is considered to be an area where improvements, particularly aided by an Isofix type attachment concept, can be made. Therefore the final area of research undertaken by the writer was to develop and propose a test to evaluate CRS in a realistic side impact scenario. This involved the simulation of not only the acceleration imparted to the target vehicle occupant but in addition the intrusion component. This work, which again has been presented at international level, contributed towards a proposal to amend the European certification standard for CRS to include a side impact evaluation. This thesis commences with a review of the accident data currently available, and looks at how the physiological and anatomical properties of the child, vehicle design, and the inherent potential for misuse and mis-installation of the current generation of CRS, impact upon child safety. This is followed by an overview of the lsofix proposal before the results of the writer's detailed testing of both current belt retained and proposed Isofix CRS concepts (chapters 10 and 11) are reported. The subsequent chapters (12 and 13) detail the results of the writer's investigation into CRS orientation in a frontal impact {{and the development of a}} representative side impact test, based on a single sled, for inclusion in the European certification procedure. The document concludes with discussion and conclusions relating to the future of CRS design and evaluation. The major findings of this research were: • contrary to initial expectations, significant CRS recline angle in a forward facing device has been proven to be undesirable; • Isofix CRS with rigid lower anchors have been shown to be beneficial, particularly in side impacts, their efficacy in a forward impact being compromised by rotation in devices that do not incorporate an anti-rotation device; • a side impact test has been developed which more accurately represents the input to a CRS seen in a rear vehicle incident. Such a test is not only desirable but essential to drive CRS manufacturers into improving side impact protection for occupants...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws and public {{education}} campaigns on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use are assessed {{on the basis of}} observational or self-reported data on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. Previous studies focusing on front seat occupants have shown that self-reports indicate a greater <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage than observational findings. Whether this over-reporting in self reports applies to rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage, and to what extent, have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the over-reporting factor for rear seat passengers and whether this varies by gender and under different compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use conditions. Methods The study was conducted in the Veneto Region, an area in the North-East of Italy with a population of 4. 7 million. The prevalence of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use among rear seat passengers was determined by means of a cross-sectional self-report survey and an observational study. Both investigations were performed in two time periods: in 2003, when rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use was not enforced by primary legislation, and in 2005, after rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use had become compulsory (June 2003). Overall, 8138 observations and 7902 interviews were recorded. Gender differences in the prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined using the chi-square test. The over-reporting factor, defined as the ratio of the self-reported to the observed prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use, was calculated by gender before and after the rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> legislation came into effect. Results Among rear seat passengers, self-reported rates were always higher than the observational findings, with an overall over-reporting factor of 1. 4.

The developed model showed that travelling on a national road is negative for not wearing the <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> Finally, the variable with the highest impact on not wearing a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> is being a passenger on the back seats. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{mandatory}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws on driver behavior and traf � c fatalities. Using a unique panel data set on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage in all U. S. jurisdictions, we analyze how such laws, by in � uencing <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use, affect the incidence of traf � c fatalities. Allowing for the endogeneity of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage, we � nd that such usage decreases overall traf � c fatalities. The magnitude of this effect, however, is significantly smaller than the estimate used by the National Highway Traf � c Safety Administration. In addition, we do not � nd signi � cant support for the compensating-behavior theory, which suggests that <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use also has an indirect adverse effect on fatalities by encouraging careless driving. Finally, we identify factors, especially the type of enforcement used, that make <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws more effective in increasing <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage...|$|R
50|$|The 1972 Volkswagen ESVW1 Experimental Safety Vehicle {{presented}} passive <b>seat</b> <b>belts.</b> Volvo {{tried to}} develop a passive three point seatbelt. In 1973 Volkswagen announced they had a functional passive <b>seat</b> <b>belt.</b> The first commercial car to use automatic <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> was the 1975 Volkswagen Golf.|$|R
50|$|<b>Seat</b> <b>belts</b> - Since 80% {{of deaths}} in SUV rollovers were from ejection, <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use would help prevent fatalities.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 New York State {{passed the}} first U.S. law {{requiring}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use in passenger cars. <b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws {{have since been}} adopted by 49 states (New Hampshire has not). NHTSA estimates the resulting increased <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use saves 10,000 {{per year in the}} United States.|$|R
50|$|In India, all cars {{manufactured}} after March 25, 1994 {{are equipped}} with front <b>seat</b> <b>belts.</b> The rule was extended for rear seats in 2002. The usage of <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> is to be implemented by the respective states, with most states making <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage for front seat passengers mandatory in 2002. Older vehicles that did not originally have <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> were exempted. However, enforcement is weak {{in most parts of}} the country.|$|R
50|$|<b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> {{legislation}} is another hotly contested issue, as many drivers {{feel that their}} rights are violated by such laws. Despite this, 49 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws requiring <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use by at least all occupants of the front seat. New Hampshire {{is the only state}} with no such requirement for adults (anyone under eighteen must use a <b>seat</b> <b>belt).</b> The majority of states do not require rear seat occupants to wear <b>seat</b> <b>belts,</b> but {{it would be wise to}} check each individual state's law. In 24 states, the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law is considered to be only a secondary offense, meaning that a police officer can only ticket a person for violating the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law if the driver has already been stopped for another reason. The effectiveness of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws varies considerably throughout the country, with some areas observing over 95% usage and others with less than 40% usage.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to explore selfreported <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and group differences in different scenarios in a Brazilian sample and research the variables related to it. 120 college students answered a questionnaire with variables from the theory of planned behavior in order to evaluate the intention of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use among car occupants. Results indicated that attitude and intention were the variables that most contributed to explaining <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. Intention was highly correlated with <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use, and attitude was correlated with intention. <b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> use was more frequent among drivers and taxi passengers, but not among front and rear seat passengers. The article discusses the implications of the findings for possible interventions to encourage the use of <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> among drivers and passengers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Seat</b> <b>belt</b> use was {{observed}} in 1, 628 cars with air bags and manual belts and 34, 223 cars with manual <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> only. Sixty-six percent of drivers in cars with air bags wore <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> compared to 63 percent of drivers in cars with manual belts only. The study found no evidence for the speculation that drivers with air bags will reduce their <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use because they believe an air bag alone provides sufficient protection...|$|R
