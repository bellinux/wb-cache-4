5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E

25|$|The {{cells were}} {{extremely}} small, with three concrete walls with no windows, and a <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> {{door with a}} five-inch square window facing the corridor. The cells contained only a wash basin/toilet combination (cold water only), and a radio selector (there were two channels), and a concrete pad covered with a sheet of plywood four inches off the floor on which the inmates slept. Inmates could not control {{the volume of the}} radio nor the temperature of the cell. The lights in the cell remained on 24 hours a day, but were dimmed to 25 watts at night.|$|E
25|$|The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted {{sheet metal}} steel receiver, {{but due to}} the higher {{operating}} pressures of the 5.56×45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower). The machined <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> billet action avoided cracking problems the AK-series had with steel stamped sheet actions, but this made the Galil heavier.|$|E
25|$|The G-1, {{produced}} from February 1942, {{was the first}} production version of the G-series and the first production Bf 109 with a pressurized cockpit. It could be identified by the small, horn-shaped air intake for the cockpit compressor just above the supercharger intake, on the left upper cowling. In addition, the angled armour plate for the pilot's head {{was replaced by a}} vertical piece which sealed-off the rear of the side-hinged cockpit canopy. Small, triangular armour-glass panels were fitted into the upper corners of this armour, although there were aircraft in which the plate was <b>solid</b> <b>steel.</b> Silica gel capsules were placed in each pane of the windscreen and opening canopy to absorb any moisture which may have been trapped in the double glazing. The last 80 G-1s built were lightweight G-1/R2. In these GM-1 nitrous oxide 'boost' was used, and the pilot's back armour was removed, as were all fittings for the long-range drop tank. A few G-1 flown by I./JG 1 are known to have carried the underwing 20mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas.|$|E

500|$|A second <b>Solid</b> <b>Steel</b> album called Foley Room Recorded Live in Brussels was {{recorded}} in Brussels at the Ancienne Belgique in 2007 and was released for free in November 2008. According to Tobin's official website, [...] "After months of {{back and forth and}} despite everyone's best efforts the mix was in danger of being edited into the ground to accommodate big labels and publishers. Rather than release a compromised version commercially, {{the decision was made to}} give it away for free instead." ...|$|E
500|$|Taxi tests {{began in}} October 1945, but the {{heatshield}} {{proved to be}} too short and {{the heat from the}} engine exhaust melted the duralumin skin of the rear fuselage as well as the rubber tire of the tailwheel. Modifications to rectify the problems took until late December. By this time a second prototype had been completed with a <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> tailwheel and an enlarged tailplane. After a few taxiing tests, it was transferred to the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) for full-scale windtunnel testing that lasted until February 1946. On the 26th of that month, the Council of People's Commissars issued requirements that the aircraft should have a maximum speed of [...] at sea level and a speed of [...] at an altitude of [...] It should be able to climb to that altitude in 4 1/2 minutes or less and it should have a range of [...] at 90% of maximum speed. Two prototypes were to be ready for flight testing on 1 September.|$|E
500|$|HM Prison Maze was {{considered}} one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe. In addition to [...] fences, each H-Block was encompassed by an [...] concrete wall topped with barbed wire, and all gates on the complex were made of <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> and electronically operated. Prisoners had been planning the escape for several months. Bobby Storey and Gerry Kelly had started working as orderlies in H7, which allowed them to identify weaknesses in the security systems, and six handguns had been smuggled into the prison. Shortly after 2:30 pm on 25 September, prisoners seized control of H7 by simultaneously taking the prison officers hostage at gunpoint in order to prevent them from triggering an alarm. One officer was stabbed with a craft knife, and another was knocked down by a blow to the back of the head. One officer who attempted to prevent the escape was shot in the head by Gerry Kelly, but survived. By 2:50 pm the prisoners were in control of H7 without an alarm being raised. A dozen prisoners also took uniforms from the officers, and the officers were also forced to hand over their car keys and details of where their cars were, for possible later use during the escape. A rearguard was left behind to watch over hostages and keep the alarm from being raised until they believed the escapees were clear of the prison, when they returned to their cells. At 3:25 pm, a lorry delivering food supplies arrived at the entrance to H7, whereupon Brendan McFarlane and other prisoners took the occupants hostage at gunpoint and took them inside H7. The lorry driver was told the lorry was being used in the escape, and he was instructed what route to take and how to react if challenged. Storey told the driver, [...] "This man [...] is doing 30 years and he will shoot you without hesitation if he has to. He has nothing to lose." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Alcatraz being {{designed}} {{to house the}} [...] "worst of the worst" [...] of criminals who caused problems at other prisons, under the guidelines and regulations set by the strict prison administrators, courts could not direct a prisoner to be directly sent to Alcatraz, however notorious they were for misbehavior and attempted escape from other prisons. Prisoners entering Alcatraz would undergo vigorous research and assessments prior to their arrival. Security in the prison was very tight, with the constant checking of bars, doors, locks, electrical fixtures, and other areas to ensure that security hadn't been broken. During a standard day the prisoners would be counted 13 times, and the ratio of prisoners to guards was the lowest of any American prison of the time. The front door was made of <b>solid</b> <b>steel,</b> virtually impossible for any prisoners to escape through. The island had many guard towers, most of which have since been demolished, which were heavily guarded at various points in the day at times when security may have been breached; for instance, there were guard towers {{on each of the}} industry buildings to ensure that inmates didn't attempt to escape during the work day shifts. The recreation yard {{and other parts of the}} prison had a 25-foot fence around it topped with barbed wire, should any inmates attempt to escape during exercise. One former employee of the jail likened his prison job to being a zoo keeper or his old farm job, due to the fact that prisoners were treated like animals, sending them out to [...] "plough the fields" [...] when some of them worked during the day, and then counting them up and feeding them and so on. He referred to those four years of his life working in the prison as a [...] "total waste of his life". The corridors were regularly patrolled by the guards, with passing gates along them; the most heavily trafficked corridor was [...] "Broadway" [...] between B and C Block, due to its being the central corridor of the prison and passed not only by guards but other prison workers.|$|E
500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, looking more like a flat-bed truck, with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wheels are}} {{generally}} {{made from a}} composite material consisting of coarse-particle aggregate pressed and bonded together by a cementing matrix (called the bond in grinding wheel terminology) to form a solid, circular shape. Various profiles and cross sections are available depending on the intended usage for the wheel. They may also be made from a <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> or aluminium disc with particles bonded to the surface. Today most grinding wheels are artificial composites made with artificial aggregates, but the history of grinding wheels began with natural composite stones, such as those used for millstones.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{withstand}} the high g-forces experienced during pullup after a dive attack, much of the aircraft's center-section was cut from a <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> block. It was powered by a similar Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior air-cooled radial engine as used by the Great Lakes design, and had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The crew of two sat in tandem in separate cockpits, with the observer in the rear cockpit armed with a single flexibly mounted machine gun, and the pilot with a single fixed [...] synchronized machine gun firing through the aircraft's propeller arc. Its bombload was carried on a crutch under the fuselage that swung down to ensure the bomb would clear the propeller when dropped in a steep dive.|$|E
2500|$|When {{played as}} a folk instrument, the violin is usually {{referred}} to in English as a fiddle (although the term fiddle can be used informally {{no matter what the}} genre of music.) A fiddle is essentially the same as a classical violin. Many old-time pieces call for cross-tuning the instrument out of standard GDAE tuning. Some players of American styles of folk fiddling (such as bluegrass or old-time) have their bridge's top edge cut to a slightly flatter curve, making techniques such as a [...] "double shuffle" [...] less taxing on the bow arm. A flatter bridge top reduces the range of motion needed for alternating between double stops on different string pairs. Fiddle players who use <b>solid</b> <b>steel</b> core strings may prefer to use a tailpiece with fine tuners on all four strings, instead of the single fine tuner on the E string used by many classical players.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{tools of}} a {{reinforcing}} bar ironworker are pliers, tie wire reel, rod buster bag, and a rebar hook.

[...] The pliers have a hook bend handle, and a spring in between the handles for self-opening of the pliers. [...] The pliers cut ACSR, screws, nails and most hardened wire. [...] Also, the pliers is finished with a black oxide paint to resist rust on the tool. [...] A tie wire reel is a lightweight aluminum alloy mechanism used for dispensing tie wire efficiently. [...] A rod buster bag, a pouch, is a split-leather double bottom bag used for holding tools while {{they are not in}} use.

2500|$|The term {{case-hardening}} {{is derived}} from the practicalities of the carburization process itself, which is essentially the same as the ancient process. The steel work piece is placed inside a case packed tight with a carbon-based case-hardening compound. This is collectively known as a carburizing pack. The pack is put inside a hot furnace for a variable length of time. Time and temperature determines how deep into the surface the hardening extends. However, the depth of hardening is ultimately limited by the inability of carbon to diffuse deeply into <b>solid</b> <b>steel,</b> and a typical depth of surface hardening with this method is up to 1.5mm. Other techniques are also used in modern carburizing, such as heating in a carbon-rich atmosphere. Small items may be case-hardened by repeated heating with a torch and quenching in a carbon rich medium, such as the commercial products Kasenit / Casenite or [...] "Cherry Red". Older formulations of these compounds contain potentially toxic cyanide compounds, while the more recent types such as Cherry Red do not.|$|E
2500|$|Strings {{were first}} made of sheep gut (commonly known as catgut, which despite the name {{did not come}} from cats), or simply gut, which was stretched, dried, and twisted. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century, strings were made of either gut, silk, aluminum, or steel. Modern strings may be gut, <b>solid</b> <b>steel,</b> {{stranded}} steel, or various synthetic materials such as perlon, wound with various metals, and sometimes plated with silver. Most E strings are unwound, either plain or gold-plated steel. Currently, violin strings are not made with gut as much, but many performers use them to achieve a specific sound especially in historically informed performance of Baroque music. Strings have a limited lifetime. When a violinist plays a string, oil from their hands and sweat can slowly damage the strings. As well, rosin from the bow can accumulate on the part that is bowed. Eventually, when oil, dirt, sweat and rosin accumulate, the string can become old and dirty. Apart from obvious things, such as the winding of a string coming undone from wear, players generally change a string when it no longer plays [...] "true" [...] (with good intonation on the harmonics), losing the desired tone, brilliance and intonation. String longevity depends on string quality and playing intensity. In the 2010s, a huge variety of strings are available.|$|E
