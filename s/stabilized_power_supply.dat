The orthogonal optimization design develops from conventional orthogonal design. According {{to the results}} of variance and variance ratio analysis in the orthogonal design, the next searching direction and range of each variable are determined, which is able to be circulating in the optimization of searching. The orthogonal optimization solution is performed intelligently until error value of the variance ratio for each variable is approximately equal. Since the tolerance of an optimal solution is obtained when the parameter design is completed, this method does not need special tolerance design. The authors take a <b>stabilized</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> circuit as an example to optimize the circuit parameters.

Accordingly, the crystallization process is performed by an electronically controlled temperature field. The high precision temperature control requires precisely working temperature measurement systems, well <b>stabilized</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> devices and an advanced control strategy. In this project, temperature measurement systems and DC voltage power supplies are used in combination with PC based PID software controllers. After installing and testing all the necessary hardware components, the determination of specific operating characteristics and critical process stages was carried out, for example with respect to permitted temperature ranges and maximum heating and cooling rates. These investigations form the basis for heater identification and furnace modeling. Thus, the PID multivariable control design was realized and the software control algorithm was developed. The algorithm functionality and correctness were tested by computer simulation and numerous experiments. In this way, the control precision was improved to #+-# 0. 1 K at an operating point of 1238 C. A safety control system using supplemental thermocouples was developed for process supervision and detection of critical situations, for example violation of maximum temperature limits and thermocouple breaks. In addition, {{the development and implementation of}} a manual controller were realized. This allows to manually control the process at any time.

In smart community, residents manage their home appliances to coop-erate on <b>stabilizing</b> renewable <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> energy saving, and information communications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving service searching scheme (EPS) for smart community to enable residents to receive some Internet bandwidth from cooperative nearby homes so as to obtain pervasive Internet access at the cheap cost. Specifically, the EPS enables a resident to send a service request to nearby homes, and the latter responds the request with either uploading data via Internet connection or forwarding data to other homes via WiFi. As the Internet and WiFi bandwidth for homes is limited, the homes assign residents with different priorities and prefer to serve residents with high priorities. The priority is determined by a proximity score between residents and home owners, and the identity information is not disclosed in the calculation process. Moreover, the EPS preserves the location privacy of residents by adopting the multiple pseudonym techniques. Detailed privacy analyses in terms of the identity privacy and the location privacy are provided. In addition, the communication efficiency is validated through extensive simulations.
