The second stage is reached when the tunneling barriers are high enough to prevent electrons from tunneling. The third stage occurs when the high barrier starts to lower. And finally, in the fourth stage, the tunneling barriers allow electrons to freely tunnel again. In simple words, when the clock signal is high, electrons are free to tunnel.

These terms are also positive for meaningful time-frequency points where the <b>signal</b> energy <b>is</b> concentrated. On the other hand, cross-terms are complex in general, and their values depend on the relative phase between the contributing signals.

However, the degrees of their effects were largely different and depended on which microarray data were used. Therefore, these heuristic parameters remained unoptimized (default values; highest_r_score[*]=[*] 10, threshold[*]=[*] 2).

This method consists of transforming high glitch gates into modified devices which filter out the glitches when a control signal is applied. When the control signal is high, the F-Gate operates as normal but when the control <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> <b>low,</b> the gate output is disconnected from the ground. As a result it can never be discharged to logic 0 and glitches are prevented.|$|E

50|$|Modulation {{techniques}} {{make use}} of the fact that technical noise usually decreases with increasing frequency (often referred to as a 1/f noise) and improves on the signal contrast by encoding and detecting the absorption signal at a high frequency, where the noise level is low. The most common modulation techniques, wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) and frequency modulation spectroscopy (FMS), achieve this by rapidly scanning the frequency of the light across the absorbing transition. Both techniques have the advantage that the demodulated <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> <b>low</b> in the absence of absorbers but they are also limited by residual amplitude modulation, either from the laser or from multiple reflections in the optical system (etalon effects). The most frequently used laser-based technique for environmental investigations and process control applications is based upon diode lasers and WMS and often referred to as tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). The typical sensitivity of WMS and FMS techniques is in the 10−5 range.|$|E
50|$|An {{acoustic}} emission (AE) sensor {{works on}} principle of measuring the high-frequency energy signals produced during cutting process. It also measures the AE energy {{resulting from the}} fracture when a tool breaks. It is best suited to applications where the level of background AE <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> <b>low</b> compared {{to the sound of}} tool breakage. This makes the AE sensor ideal for breakage detection of small drills and taps. It is easy to install on both new and existing machines. AE sensor detects force proportional monitoring signals even in machining operations, which generate very small cutting forces. In combination with true power, it increases the reliability of breakage monitoring. It is used especially with solid carbide tools, or very small tools on large machines and multi spindles. Most of the sensors have to be attached to the machine tool surface. However, there are alternative methods of AE wave transmitting. A rotating, wireless AE sensor consists of a rotating sensor and a fixed receiver. An AE sensor can also receive the acoustic waves via a jet of cooling lubricant, which can be connected directly to the tool or workpiece.|$|E
