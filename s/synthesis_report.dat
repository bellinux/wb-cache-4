The Global Forest Resources Assessment [...] provides comprehensive reporting on forests worldwide every five years. FRA 2015 is the most recent global assessment. The results, data and analyses are available online in different formats, including the FAO <b>synthesis</b> <b>report</b> Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: How are forests changing?, the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 Desk Reference containing summary tables, 234 country reports and the FRA 2015 Infographics.
