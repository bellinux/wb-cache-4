5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41percent of all the area that burned. Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the region}} was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> North African coast after being {{detached}} from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters and illness rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly. Progress had been slow, and a northeasterly wind had also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he learned from a passing vessel that there was a French squadron {{in the region}}, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return. At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that the distant ships were the enemy and he turned away from the French and tacked into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted the distant British vessel and were ordered to give chase.|$|E
5|$|Training teams {{arrived from}} the 2/3rd Battalion, which had already fought the Japanese in New Guinea, and a program of jungle warfare {{training}} began, progressing from individual fieldcraft to large-scale exercises. In June, amphibious training was carried with the Australians working with the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment around Trinity Beach. The following month, a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Joshua, arrived. In early August, the battalion moved by road to Cairns. On 8 August 1943, the 2/43rd embarked upon HMAS Manoora, bound for Milne Bay in New Guinea. There, the battalion undertook further training in preparation for its debut in the Pacific. In mid-August, it moved by landing craft to Buna. It continued training there until 5 September, when the 24th Brigade embarked in landing craft for beaches near Lae, arriving {{the day after the}} main landing as part of follow-on forces behind the 20th and 26th Brigades. For 11 days, the battalion advanced west as part of a two-pronged advance on Lae, the 7th Division advancing overland from Nadzab while the 9th Division moved along the coast. Initially, there was only limited opposition from the Japanese as the battalion advanced through the villages of Buso and Apo, and the Singaua Plantation. The Burep River was crossed, but the Australian advance west was slowed by numerous water obstacles and eventually torrential rain which flooded the Busu River. At this point, Japanese resistance stiffened and after the 24th Brigade forced its way across the Busu, the 2/43rd advanced <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> coast, reaching Wagan to the south of Malahang airfield. On 16 September, the 7th Division entered Lae, with the 2/43rd situated around the Butibum River. The advance on Lae cost the battalion 18 killed and 25 wounded.|$|E

25|$|Inimicus are piscivorous ambush predators. They are nocturnal and {{typically}} lie partially buried {{on the sea}} floor or on a coral head during the day, covering themselves with sand and other debris to further camouflage themselves. They have no known natural predators. When threatened, they spread their brilliantly colored pectoral and caudal fins as a warning. Once dug in, they are very reluctant to leave their hiding places. When they do move, they display an unusual mechanism of subcarangiform locomotion---they crawl <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> seabed, employing the four lower rays (two on each side) of their pectoral fins as legs.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Royal Marines in {{the house}} saw the {{approaching}} Amtracs that had been engaged earlier by Lieutenant Trollope and his section. The vehicles pushed on toward Moody Brook to link up with Sánchez-Sabarots forces. His amphibious commandos were plodding <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> road to reinforce their colleagues besieging Government House after taking some prisoners near the racecourse. Major Norman had earlier advised Governor Hunt that the Royal Marines and the governor could break out to the countryside {{and set up a}} 'seat of government' elsewhere, but when he finally met the commander-in-chief of the Argentine operations, Admiral Büsser, he agreed to surrender his troops to the now overwhelming Argentine forces at 9:30 am. Hunt would later state in London that the defenders fired 6,000 rounds in the fighting at Government House and elsewhere.|$|E

He still controlled Rome's praetorian guards, was well-stocked with African grain, and was surrounded on all sides by the seemingly impregnable Aurelian Walls. He ordered all bridges across the Tiber cut, reportedly on the counsel of the gods, and left the rest of central Italy undefended; Constantine secured that region's support without challenge. Constantine progressed <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Via Flaminia, allowing the weakness of Maxentius to draw his regime further into turmoil. Maxentius' support continued to weaken: at chariot races on 27 October, the crowd openly taunted Maxentius, shouting that Constantine was invincible. Maxentius, no longer certain that he would emerge from a siege victorious, built a temporary boat bridge across the Tiber in preparation for a field battle against Constantine. On 28 October 312AD, the sixth anniversary of his reign, he approached the keepers of the Sibylline Books for guidance. The keepers prophesied that, on that very day, [...] "the enemy of the Romans" [...] would die. Maxentius advanced north to meet Constantine in battle.|$|E

2500|$|Carnival in Natal, {{known as}} [...] "Carnatal", {{is one of}} the largest {{off-season}} carnivals in Brazil. Carnatal takes place sometime in November or December, in the streets around Machadão Stadium (traffic around the stadium changes radically during Carnatal days). The transit department isolates about [...] of streets, creating a ring, along which the party takes place. During the days of party, a huge truck (called [...] "trio elétrico"), with a band on the top and sound boxes all around, drives <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> streets. The crowd follows the trio elétrico singing, dancing, jumping to the sound of the music.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{trade-off}} with gill size regarding lifestyle. [...] To achieve fast speeds, gills {{need to be}} small – water will be passed through them quickly when energy is needed, compensating for their small size. [...] However, organisms which {{spend most of their}} time moving <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> bottom do not naturally pass much water through their cavity for locomotion; thus they have larger gills, along with complex systems to ensure that water is constantly washing through their gills, even when the organism is stationary. [...] The water flow is controlled by contractions of the radial and circular mantle cavity muscles.|$|E
2500|$|Ford Motor Company {{presented}} [...] "Ford's Magic Skyway", a WED Imagineering-designed pavilion, {{which was}} the second-most popular exhibit at the fair. It featured 50 actual (motorless) convertible Ford vehicles, including Ford Mustangs, in an early prototype of {{what would become the}} PeopleMover ride system. Audience members entered the vehicles on a main platform as they moved <b>slowly</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> track. The ride moved the audience through scenes featuring life-sized, audio-animatronic dinosaurs and cavemen. Walt Disney Productions had earlier been asked by General Motors to produce their exhibit, which also featured a similar ride and dioramas, but Disney had declined this job.|$|E
