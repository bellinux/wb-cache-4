40|$|Load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) walls {{sheathed}} {{with double}} layers of gypsum plasterboard {{on both sides}} have demonstrated good fire resistance and attracted increasing interest for use in mid-rise CFS structures. As the main <b>connection</b> method, <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> between CFS and gypsum sheathing {{play an important role}} in both the structural design and fire resistance of this wall system. However, studies on the mechanical behavior of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with double-layer gypsum sheathing are still limited. In this study, 200 monotonic tests of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with single- or double-layer gypsum sheathing at both ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted. The failure of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with double-layer gypsum sheathing in shear was different from that of single-layer gypsum sheathing connections at ambient temperature, and it could be described as the breaking of the loaded sheathing edge combined with significant screw tilting and the loaded sheathing edge flexing fracture. However, the screw tilting and flexing fracture of the loaded sheathing edge gradually disappear at elevated temperatures. In addition, the influence of the loaded edge distance, double-layer sheathing and elevated temperatures is discussed in detail with clear conclusions. A unified design formula for the shear strength of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with gypsum sheathing is proposed for ambient and elevated temperatures with adequate accuracy. A simplified load–displacement model with the post-peak branch is developed to evaluate the load–displacement response of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with gypsum sheathing at ambient and elevated temperatures...|$|R

An insufficiently tightened <b>screw</b> <b>connection</b> may loosen in operation, and excessive tightening can damage parts; for example, if the nuts holding {{the wheel of}} a car in place are too loose, or damaged by overtightening, a wheel may come off at speed.

If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw. Since wire strands may not be contained by the screw head in a basic screw terminal, stranded wires may be crimped into a ferrule to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a [...] "bare" [...] wire termination.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of bolted connections as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis.
