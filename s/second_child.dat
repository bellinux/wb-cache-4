40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} provide information concerning the developmental differences in early language production and comprehension between 21 month-old first born and <b>second</b> born <b>children.</b> Furthermore, the study explored the assumption that more opportunities to hear conversations between the parent and the older sibling provide an advantage for <b>second</b> born <b>children</b> in learning personal pronouns. Spontaneous speech productions of 16 first born children were compared to those of 16 <b>second</b> born <b>children</b> while in dyadic interactions with their mothers. First born children were observed in two 25 minute free-play dyadic interactions with their mothers. <b>Second</b> born <b>children</b> were observed in one 25 minute free-play mother-child dyadic interaction and in one 25 minute free-play mother-child-older sibling triadic interaction. All children were administered controlled tasks involving production and comprehension of first and second person pronouns. Compared to first borns, <b>second</b> born <b>children</b> are not significantly delayed in general language development. Second borns' speech productions differ depending {{on whether or not}} their older sibling was present. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Sex-ratio {{at birth}} in {{families}} with previous girls {{is worse than}} those with a boy. Our aim was to prospectively study in a large maternal and child unit sex-ratio against previous birth sex and use of traditional medicines for sex selection. Main Outcome Measures: Sex-ratio among mothers in families with a previous girl and in those with a previous boy, prevalence of indigenous medicine use and sex-ratio in those using medicines for sex selection. Results: Overall there were 806 girls to 1000 boys. The sex-ratio was 720 : 1000 {{if there was one}} previous girl and 178 : 1000 if there were two previous girls. In <b>second</b> <b>children</b> of families with a previous boy 1017 girls were born per 1000 boys. Sexratio in those with one previous girl, who were taking traditional medicines for sex selection, was 928 : 1000. Conclusion: Evidence from the <b>second</b> <b>children</b> clearly shows the sex-ratio is being manipulated by human interventions. More mothers with previous girls tend to use traditional medicines for sex selection, in their subsequent pregnancies. Those taking such medication {{do not seem to be}} helped according to expectations. They seem to rely on this method and so are less likely use more definitive methods like sex selective abortions. This is the first such prospective investigation of sex ratio in <b>second</b> <b>children</b> looked at against the sex of previous children. More studies are needed to confirm the findings...|$|R
