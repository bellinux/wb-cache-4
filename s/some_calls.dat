5|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{finally came}} into force on 1 December 2009, {{granting}} Parliament powers {{over the entire}} EU budget, making Parliament's legislative powers equal to the Council's in nearly all areas and linking the appointment of the Commission President to Parliament's own elections. Despite <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> for the parties to put forward candidates beforehand, only the EPP (which had re-secured their position as largest party) had one in re-endorsing Barroso.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a {{relatively}} quiet bird, {{but it has a}} warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or displays of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> of an almost musical nature.|$|E

5|$|The La and Ac variant {{remains the}} most common in the literature, despite <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> for a change to the Lu and Lr variant. In terms of {{chemical}} behaviour, and trends going down group 3 for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium are similar to their group 1–2 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the most common (trivalent) ions of the f-block elements consistently matches {{their position in the}} f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the trivalent ions of the first three f-block elements are Ce 1, Pr 2 and Nd 3.|$|E
5|$|The four NATO {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} during Operation Deny Flight also forced NATO members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft, including increased stealth capabilities. Deny Flight also demonstrated {{the necessity of}} better communications and integration among forces operating together, and led to <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> for technical training of UN personnel to work with NATO military systems. Finally, {{the rules of engagement}} established under Deny Flight also {{played an important role in}} shaping the rules of engagement for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations {{of the two}} martins {{are quite}} different. Mascarene martin has a warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or {{displays}} of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent. The song of Brazza's martin consists {{of a series of}} short notes increasing in frequency which are followed by a complex buzz and sometimes completed by a number of clicks. The song becomes increasingly loud, although the final clicks are quite soft. The song {{is similar to that of}} the banded martin, and does not resemble that of the Mascarene martin, suggesting unresolved taxonomic problems.|$|E

After the chicken is browned, white wine {{is added to the}} cooking pan. <b>Some</b> recipes <b>call</b> for leaving the chicken in the pan while the wine is reduced, while others call for first {{removing}} the chicken, then using the wine to deglaze the pan, and then pouring the wine sauce over the chicken.|$|R

5|$|USMC sources {{documented}} the Harrier as holding an 85 percent aircraft availability {{record in the}} Iraq War; in just under a month of combat, the aircraft flew over 2,000 sorties. When used, the LITENING II targeting pod achieved greater than 75 percent kill effectiveness on targets. In a single sortie from USS Bonhomme Richard, a wave of Harriers inflicted heavy damage on a Republican Guard tank battalion in advance of a major ground assault on Al Kut. Harriers regularly operated in close support roles for friendly tanks, one of the aircraft generally carrying a LITENING pod. Despite the Harrier's high marks, the limited {{amount of time that}} each aircraft could remain on station, around 15–20 minutes, led to <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> from within the USMC for the procurement of AC-130 gunships, which could loiter for six hours and had a heavier close air support capability than the AV-8B. AV-8Bs were later used in combination with artillery to provide constant fire support for ground forces during heavy fighting in 2004 around the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah. The urban environment there required extreme precision for airstrikes.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> are known.|$|E
25|$|The {{court has}} ruled that the $2.7 billion in school funding was {{inadequate}} and distributed unfairly. It then recommend the Kansas legislature increase funding to schools and {{change the way the}} money was distributed.

25|$|Tinamous {{are rarely}} seen but often heard within their range {{and have a}} wide variety of calls. They are among the most {{characteristic}} bird vocalizations of South America and Central America, often resembling sounds made by a flute or a whistle. <b>Some</b> <b>calls</b> are uniform and monotone, while others have multiple phrases. They vary in intensity and can often be heard from afar. Trying to locate a bird by its call is not easy.|$|E
25|$|The Ballarat Civic Hall is a {{large public}} {{building}} constructed in 1958 as a general purpose venue. Its stripped classical design was heavily criticised during its planning, however it has gained some cultural significance to the city with its cavernous spaces holding many significant events over the years. Civic Hall was closed in 2002 {{and there have been}} moves to redevelop it for many years with <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> to retain the building as a venue.|$|E
25|$|Relationships in the orca {{population}} can {{be discovered}} through their vocalizations. Matrilines {{who share a}} common ancestor from only a few generations back share mostly the same dialect, comprising a pod. Pods who share <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> indicate a common ancestor from many generations back, and make up a clan. Interestingly, the orcas use these dialects to avoid in-breeding. They mate outside the clan, which {{is determined by the}} different vocalizations. There is evidence that other species of dolphins may also have dialects.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{creation}} of the European Council presidency, former president Van Rompuy and former Commission President Barroso had begun to compete with each other as Van Rompuy had benefited from the general shift in power from the Commission to the European Council yet with Barroso still holding the real powers. At international summits they continued previous practice of both going at the same time. The complicated situation had renewed <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> to merge the posts, possibly at the end of Barroso's term in 2014. However some member states had expected to oppose {{the creation}} of such a high-profile post.|$|E
25|$|A {{search of}} records related to Bonie's cell phone found {{a series of}} pings that night, as well as <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> from towers in Orange and Rockland counties, {{northwest}} of {{the city on the}} other side of the Hudson River. Bonie has relatives living there. One detective, Malcolm Reiman, worked with a ballistics expert to narrow a search area based on Bonie's known departure and arrival times at his house and an estimated rate of road travel speed. Within that area, they searched road embankments, primarily in Harriman State Park, a large wooded protected area that straddles the border between the two counties, but did not find Moore's body.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the night}} that the woman ritually {{traditionally}} immerses is about 12 days after menstruation began, it often coincides with a woman's ovulation, and thus improves the chances of successful conception if sexual relations occur on that night. However, for certain women, this period extends far past the date of ovulation, and {{in combination with the}} ban on sexual relations during the niddah state, effectively results in the woman being unable to conceive. In the case of this effective infertility, rabbis try on a case-by-case basis to relax halakhic strictures in order to facilitate conception. There have been <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> within Orthodox Judaism for the custom to be modified so that the time between the end of menstruation and the end of niddah isn't as long for these women.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} NGOs {{and human rights}} organisations have criticised the PRC government for failing {{to comply with the}} UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, accusing PRC of penalising and abusing lower tier prostitutes, many of whom are victims of human trafficking, while exonerating men who buy sex, and ignoring the ongoing problems of governmental complicity and involvement in the sex trade industry. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women reads: Art. 6: States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women. However, it does not advocate a system of legal and regulated prostitution. There has, though, been <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> for legalization; a minor rally for this caused was held in 2010 organized by sex worker activist Ye Haiyan, who was arrested by police for her role in organizing the protests.|$|E
25|$|However, despite <b>some</b> <b>calls</b> from leading politicians, {{the issue}} was {{divisive}} within Hughes' Labor Party, and he hoped conscription could be avoided through sufficient volunteerism. A mass campaign to mobilise new recruits was started in November 1915 and proved to be successful {{over the next six}} months at sustaining a steady flow of new troops to the front. Hughes had left for Great Britain (where conscription had just been introduced) in January 1916 to take part in the planning of the Allied war effort. Whilst abroad he went on extended tours on the front lines, and formed a strong personal bond with the soldiers that he visited, particularly those recovering in English and French hospitals. It became unthinkable to him that Australia should let these men down, and the strategic situation convinced him that conscription would be necessary to maintain Australia's war effort. Upon his return to Australia, he found that the domestic situation had shifted significantly, and the state of recruitment was dire. Hughes received word from Deputy Prime Minister George Pearce that troop replacements would be insufficient by December 1916 even at the most generous estimates.|$|E
