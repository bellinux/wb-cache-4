40|$|The {{popularity}} of variable-rate technology (VRT) has grown. However, the limitations and errors {{of this technology}} are generally unknown. Therefore, a spatial data model was developed to generate “as-applied ” surfaces to advance precision agricultural (PA) practices. A test methodology based on ASAE Standard S 341. 2 was developed to perform uniform-rate (UR) and variable-rate (VR) tests to characterize distribution patterns testing four VRT granular applicators (two spinner spreaders and two pneumatic applicators). Single-pass UR patterns exhibited consistent shapes for three of the applicators with patterns shifts observed for the fourth applicator. Simulated overlap analysis showed {{that three of the}} applicators performed satisfactorily with most CVs less than 20 % while one applicator performed poorly (CVs> 25 %). The spinner spreaders over-applied at the margins but the pneumatic applicators under-applied suggesting a required adjustment to the effective <b>swath</b> <b>spacing.</b> Therefore, it is recommended that CVs accompany overlap pattern plots to ensure proper calibration of VRT application. Quantification of the rate response characteristics for the various applicators illustrated varying delay and transition times. Only one applicator demonstrated consistent delay and transition times. A sigmoidal function was used to model the rate response for applicators. One applicator exhibited a linear response during a decreasing rate change. Rate changes were quicker for the two newer VR control system...|$|E

Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a <b>swath</b> of <b>space,</b> that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{being used as a}} test case for the embargo feature. The embargo should lift on March 8, 2012. Airborne laser scanning, {{collected}} in a sampling mode, {{has the potential to be}} a valuable tool for estimating the biomass resources available to support bioenergy production in rural communities of interior Alaska. In this study, we present a methodology for estimating forest biomass over a 201, 226 -ha area (of which 163, 913 ha are forested) in the upper Tanana valley of interior Alaska using a combination of 79 field plots and high-density airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) collected in a sampling mode along 27 single strips (<b>swaths)</b> <b>spaced</b> approximately 2. 5 km apart. A model-based approach to estimating total aboveground biomass for the area is presented. Although a design-based sampling approach (based on a probability sample of field plots) would allow for stronger inference, a model-based approach is justified when the cost of obtaining a probability sample is prohibitive. Using a simulation-based approach, the proportion of the variability associated with sampling error and modeling error was assessed. Results indicate that LiDAR sampling can be used to obtain estimates of total biomass with an acceptable level of precision (8. 1 ± 0. 7 [8 %] teragrams [total ± SD]), with sampling error accounting for 58 % of the SD of the bootstrap distribution. In addition, we investigated the influence of plot location (i. e., GPS) error, plot size, and field-measured diameter threshold on the variability of the total biomass estimate. We found that using a larger plot (1 / 30 ha versus 1 / 59 ha) and a lower diameter threshold (7. 6 versus 12. 5 cm) significantly reduced the SD of the bootstrap distribution (by approximately 20 %), whereas larger plot location error (over a range from 0 to 20 m root mean square error) steadily increased variability at both plot sizes...|$|R
40|$|PosterInternational audienceModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the key {{instrument}} aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, continuously generates data as {{the satellites}} {{cover the entire}} surface of earth every one to two days. This data is important to many scientific analyses, however, data procurement and processing can be challenging and cumbersome for user communities. Our current work is focused on enabling calculations {{using a combination of}} land and atmosphere products over land. Before performing the calculation the data must be downloaded and transformed, from a <b>swath</b> <b>space</b> and time system to a sinusoidal tiling system. Downloading data for a single product for an entire year can take several days for a single product and involves downloading via FTP many small files (on average ~ 83, 000 files) in hierarchical data format (HDF 4). The data processing, a swath-to-sinusoidal reprojection, is computationally intensive and currently available community tools only work for single sinusoidal tiles. We have developed a data-processing pipeline that downloads the MODIS products and reprojects them on HPC systems. HPC systems do not traditionally run these high-throughput data-intensive jobs and hence we need to address unique challenges for our pipeline. The first stage in the pipeline uses a catalog to determine what files need to be downloaded and downloads identified data sets. The downloaded files will in the future trigger an event that causes the reprojection job to be entered into a job queue. The output data is stored in an archival system. The resulting reprojected data will soon be widely available to the community through a front-end web portal. The portal will allow users to download reprojected data (~ 1 TB/year) for the following land and atmosphere products: MODO 4 _L 2 (Aerosol), MOD 05 _L 2 (Water Vapor), MOD 06 _L 2 (Cloud), MOD 07 _L 2 (Atmosphere Profile) and MOD 11 _L 2 (Land Surface Temperature Emissivity). In this talk we will describe the architecture of the overall system and pipeline. Our long term plan is to allow users to reproject data on-demand and/or run algorithms on the reprojected MODIS data such as an evapotranspiration calculation...|$|R

40|$|Besides pre-launch and {{on-board}} calibration, {{the method}} of vicariously calibrating space sensors became a reliable tool for sensor calibration. One possibility of vicarious calibration is to inter-calibrate sensors aboard different satellite platforms directly. This leads {{to a better understanding}} of differences in global data sets, which are produced directly as products by these sensors. In the following, the capability of inter-satellite calibration is demonstrated using a snow target near Barrow, Alaska. It is shown, that at a polar sites the TOA radiance of different sensors, such as SeaWiFS, AHVRR and MERIS can be compared vicariously. Because of overlapping <b>swaths</b> the <b>space</b> sensors view the same target on the same day with small differences in the local crossing times. In the scope of this case study, SeaWiFS, AHVRR and MERIS datasets were selected for the following day: 28 / 29 March 2002 between 21 : 28 and 00 : 23 GMT. Additionally to the satellite data, ground-truth data were taken into account, assumptions about the atmosphere were made and differences in the sun-ground-satellite viewing geometry were accounted by means of radiative transfer code (RTC) calculations. This case study was carried out in the framework of AO- 1107. The goal of this project is to compare, ENVISAT’s MERIS/AATSR and ADEOS- 2 ’s GLI’s sensor output (e. g., TOA radiance).

Argo’s payload is optimized to provide a detailed first-look characterization of the geology, composition, impact and tectonic history, volatiles/atmosphere, and solar-wind interaction of the KBO target. This payload and the Neptune flyby also provides the opportunity to complete our reconnaissance of former KBO, Triton.

40|$|A huge <b>swath</b> of {{parameter}} <b>space</b> in {{the context}} of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) has been ruled at after run I of the LHC. Various exclusion contours in the m_g̃-_χ̃_ 1 ^ 0 plane were derived by the experimental collaborations, all based on three-body gluino decay topologies. These limits are however extremely model dependent and do not always reflect the level of exclusion. If the gluino-neutralino spectrum is compressed, then the current mass limits can be drastically reduced. In such situations, the radiative decay of the gluino g 1 can be dominant and used as a sensitive probe of small mass splittings. We examine the sensitivity of constraints of some Run I experimental searches on this decay after recasting them within the MadAnalysis 5 framework. The recasted searches are now part of the MadAnalysis 5 Public Analysis Database. We also design a dedicated search strategy and investigate its prospects to uncover this decay mode of the gluino at run II of the LHC. We emphasize that a multijet search strategy may be more sensitive than a monojet one, even in the case of very small mass differences. Comment: 34 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|Gravitational wave {{astronomy}} {{has tremendous}} potential for studying extreme astrophysical phenomena and exploring fundamental physics. The waves produced by {{binary black hole}} mergers will provide a pristine environment in which to study strong field, dynamical gravity. Extracting detailed information about these systems requires accurate theoretical models of the gravitational wave signals. If gravity is not described by General Relativity, analyses {{that are based on}} waveforms derived from Einstein's field equations could result in parameter biases and a loss of detection efficiency. A new class of "parameterized post-Einsteinian" (ppE) waveforms has been proposed to cover this eventuality. Here we apply the ppE approach to simulated data from a network of advanced ground based interferometers (aLIGO/aVirgo) and from a future spaced based interferometer (LISA). Bayesian inference and model selection are used to investigate parameter biases, and to determine the level at which departures from general relativity can be detected. We find that in some cases the parameter biases from assuming the wrong theory can be severe. We also find that gravitational wave observations will beat the existing bounds on deviations from general relativity derived from the orbital decay of binary pulsars by a large margin across a wide <b>swath</b> of parameter <b>space.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|The {{uncommon}} {{nature of}} the GOCE reentry campaign, sharing an uncontrolled orbital decay with a finely controlled attitude along the atmospheric drag direction, made the reentry predictions for this satellite an interesting case study, especially because nobody was able to say a priori {{if and when the}} attitude control would have failed, leading to an unrestrained tumbling and a sudden variation of the orbital decay rate.

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{new methods}} of screening for and tuning chiral space {{and in so doing}} identifies a promising set of chiral ligands for asymmetric synthesis. The carbafructopyranosyl- 1, 2 -diamine(s) and salens constructed therefrom are particularly compelling. It is shown that by removing the native anomeric effect in this ligand family, one can tune chiral ligand shape and improve chiral bias. This concept is demonstrated by a combination of (i) x-ray crystallographic structure determination, (ii) assessment of catalytic performance, and (iii) consideration of the anomeric effect and its underlying dipolar basis. The title ligands were identified by a new mini version of the in situ enzymatic screening (ISES) procedure through which catalyst-ligand combinations are screened in parallel, and information on relative rate and enantioselectivity is obtained in real time, without the need to quench reactions or draw aliquots. Mini-ISES brings the technique into the nanomole regime (200 to 350 nmol catalyst/ 20 ml organic volume) commensurate with emerging trends in reaction development/process chemistry. The best-performing b-D-carbafructopyranosyl- 1, 2 -diamine–derived salen ligand discovered here outperforms the best known organometallic and enzymatic catalysts for the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of 3 -phenylpropylene oxide, one of several substrates examined for which the ligand is “matched. ” This ligand scaffold defines a new <b>swath</b> of chiral <b>space,</b> and anomeric effect tunability defines a new concept in shaping that chiral space.

Human existence in the natural environment constitutes such a small <b>swath</b> of both <b>space</b> and time that our very presence amounts to an insignificant interruption {{in the history of the}} universe. As such, the ways in which we connect with our environment are attempts to mediate this gap between the scale of the human and natural domains. In manipulating the space around us, we are testing hypotheses and understandings of the world around us. Architecture, in this manner, can be seen as a tool used to cross the boundary between ourselves and the external. Our built works are a method of translating between our inner consciousness and the exterior environment, between the infinitely small and vast. This thesis begins with the acknowledgement that the built environment exists as a mediation between man and nature. Every built object is a direct result of a continuing effort to connect and simultaneously exploit the land for own own use. When human constructs at all scales exceed their utilitarian lifetimes, they are often discarded. But instead, they can be seen as containing an embedded wealth of both scientific and cultural knowledge that documents intricacies of past times, places, and spaces. These obsolete artifacts of an industrial past and a post-industrial present are often sited in landscapes that shaped and were shaped by their presence. These latent structures remain a major unrealized asset in our society today, ripe for re-invention, re-interpretation, and rehabilitation. This project proposes that architecture can act as a sort of intermediary between man and the environment, bridging the interval between anthropic and cosmic time...|$|R
40|$|The ATLAS and CMS {{experiments}} at the CERN LHC {{have collected}} about 20 fb^- 1 of data each {{at the end}} of their 8 TeV run, and ruled out a huge <b>swath</b> of parameter <b>space</b> in the context of Minimally Supersymmetric Standard Model(MSSM). Limits on masses of the gluino (g̃) and the squarks of the first two generations(q̃) have been pushed to the TeV range. Light third generation squarks namely stop and sbottom of sub-TeV masses, on the other hand, are still allowed by their direct search limits. Interestingly, the discovery of a Standard Model(SM) higgs boson like particle with a mass of ∼ 125 GeV favours a light third generation which is also motivated by naturalness arguments. Decays of stop and sbottom quarks can in general produce a number of distinct final states which necessitate different search strategies in the collider experiments. In this paper we, on the other hand, propose a general search strategy to look for third generation squarks in the final state which contains a top quark in the sample along with two additional hard leptons and substantial missing transverse momentum. We illustrate that a search strategy using the dileptonic M_T 2, the effective mass m_eff and jet substructure to reconstruct the hadronic top quark can be very effective to reduce the SM backgrounds. With the proposed search strategy, we estimate that the third generation squarks with masses up to about 800 GeV can be probed at the 14 TeV LHC with a 100 fb^- 1 data set. We also interpret our results in two simplified scenarios where we consider the stop (sbottom) pair production followed by their subsequent decay to a top quark and the second lightest neutralino (lightest chargino). In this case also we find that stop (sbottom) mass up to 1 TeV (0. 9 TeV) can be discovered at the 14 TeV LHC with 100 fb^- 1 integrated luminosity.

After mapping the geopotential with unrivalled accuracy and detail {{for four years}} from an extremely low circular polar orbit, on 21 October 2013 the low thrust ion propulsion motor used to contrast the atmospheric drag was automatically shut down when the pressure in the xenon propellant tank dropped below a critical threshold. Then the satellite entered in "fine-pointing mode" (FPM), a phase of orbital altitude decay with active fine attitude control carried out {{by a set of}} magnetotorquers. According to the pre-launch specifications, the attitude control system was expected to compensate the gravity gradient and the aerodynamic torques up to an average drag force along the orbit of 20 mN. However the system proved itself much more robust than envisaged, remaining operational until reentry, with drag forces exceeding 2000 mN. The uncommon nature of the GOCE reentry campaign, sharing an uncontrolled orbital decay with a finely controlled attitude along the atmospheric drag direction, made the reentry predictions for this satellite an interesting case study, in particular because nobody was able to say a priori if and when the attitude control would have failed, leading to an unrestrained tumbling. Therefore, even though the casualty expectancy for this reentry was slightly above the internationally recognized alert threshold of 1 / 10, 000, i. e. about 1 / 5000, it presented a number of challenges and opportunities from the prediction and risk evaluation points of view.
