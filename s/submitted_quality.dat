In 2006, {{a study by the}} federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ranked quality of care at HHC among the highest in New York City in the areas of heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia. [...] HHC reported that of the 50 hospitals in New York City that voluntarily <b>submitted</b> <b>quality</b> data to CMS, HHC hospitals held seven of the top nine places - and all ranked in the top 17—when judged by 10 specific measures of healthcare quality for the treatment of patients with life-threatening heart and pulmonary conditions, and that Brooklyn’s Coney Island Hospital achieved a first place ranking among all New York City hospitals, public or private.|$|E
5000|$|PQRS {{developed}} from several pieces of Congressional legislation. In 2006 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act (TRHCA) included a provision for a 1.5% incentive payment to eligible providers who successfully <b>submitted</b> <b>quality</b> data to CMS. This provision included {{a cap on}} payments. The 2007 Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act extended the program through 2008 and 2009. It also removed the TRHCA payment cap. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act made PQRS permanent in 2008 and increased the incentive payment to 2%. [...] Initially only an incentive program, in 2010 the Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced penalties for providers who do not submit qualifying PQRS data. Penalties increase annually according to a schedule and begin {{two years after the}} reporting period. Calendar year 2014 was the last year for a PQRS incentive. There is no incentive payment for 2015 PQRS reporting. Beyond 2015, there is potential to obtain an incentive under the Physician Value Based Payment Modifier (VM) program.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} surgical injury during deceased donor organ procurements. METHODS: Organ damage was classified into three tiers, from 1 - 3, with the latter rendering the organ non-transplantable. For 12 consecutive months starting in January of 2014, 36 of 58 organ procurement organization's (OPO) 's prospectively <b>submitted</b> <b>quality</b> data regarding organ damage (as reported by the transplanting surgeon and confirmed by the OPO medical director) seen on the procured organ. RESULTS: These 36 OPOs recovered 5401 of the nations's 8504 deceased donors for calendar year 2014. A total of 19043 organs procured were prospectively analyzed. Of this total, 59 organs sustained damage making them non-transplantable (0 intestines; 4 pancreata; 5 lungs; 6 livers; 43 kidneys). The class 3 damage was spread over 22 (of 36) reporting OPO's. CONCLUSION: While damage to the procured organ is rare with organ loss being approximately 0. 3 % of procured organs, loss of potential transplantable organs does occur during procurement...|$|E

Specifically targeted towards engaging students in a rich inquiry investigation, we layered a socio-scientific narrative and an interactive rule set into a multi-user virtual environment gaming engine to establish a virtual world through which students learned about science inquiry, water quality concepts, and the challenges in balancing scientific and socio-economic factors. Overall, students were clearly engaged, participated in rich scientific discourse, <b>submitted</b> <b>quality</b> work, and learned science content. Further, through participation in this narrative, students developed a rich perceptual, conceptual, and ethical understanding of science.

Houck is one of many researchers to present setting and attaining personal and academic goals as a positive coping method in high-stress situations. The purpose of this inquiry was to analyse and understand how grade eight learners' organize their conversation and what they converse about on their experiences in utilizing goal-setting strategies towards better time-management and self determination in completing a class assignment. This inquiry utilized an ethnomethodological Design whereby both Content Analysis and Conversation Analysis were my mode of analysis. Through the qualitative Content Analysis I was able to identify ten categories or themes that explained the experiences these grade eight learners had in utilizing goal-setting strategies towards better time management and self-determination in completing a class assignment. The Conversation Analysis of the video recorded conversation {{of a small group of}} six grade eight learners was analysed on four levels. On the experience of completing an assignment utilizing goal-setting strategies the inquiry found that, the participants demonstrated an understanding of the benefits of goal-setting (planning, prioritizing and meeting deadlines) within the school learning context. As expected, goal-setting has made a positive difference in the attitude of these participants towards themselves, their abilities and their school work. Additionally, through this conversation participant voices and perspectives were honored as they refined ideas and judged whether there was anything of merit offered by their fellow participants. It is recommended that teachers and therapists working with grade eight learners converse with learners within the classroom on how to approach their different learning areas' workload utilizing goal-setting strategies in order to achieve the learning outcomes successfully...|$|R

The astrometric deviation increases as the photometric deviation increases and Δ is directed towards the planet when the light curve has positive deviation and vice versa. We also present excess centroid shift maps for lens systems with various values of the planetary separation, planet/primary mass ratio, and source size to show the changes in the pattern of excess centroid shifts with these parameters.
