40|$|AbstractSimilar to {{the current}} trends in America that were {{recognized}} by the Association of American Medical College and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in their 2009 report titled “Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians,” Taiwanese medical students are lacking {{in their ability to}} apply their knowledge of basic sciences to real-life situations. The report recommended developing a competency-based approach to learning and also called for an increase in integrated and interdisciplinary courses in the education of medical students. Such a class, which would encourage students to look at biological concepts through chemical and physical principles, has been developed at Chang Gung University, and it strives to develop the medical student’s ability to work in groups, think critically, and clearly and convincingly present ideas. The course requires students to present biological topics in groups after working closely with a teacher, and it trains the students to identify useful and trustworthy sources, to constructively criticize each other, and work together to present a cohesive and informative presentation for their peers. From my teaching experience, classes such as this have led me to conclude that the teacher’s role does not simply encompass that of the informant, but also the facilitator of the academic success of the students, and this has led me to create certain class policies for teachers that help <b>students</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>field</b> success in class...|$|E

These questions fuelled an investigation at first theoretical, then incorporating an empirical study centered on attaining understanding relating to the elements and dynamics involved in making visual art. The resultant study aims to offer an approach to gaining comprehensive understanding of the artistic creative process, an understanding that may inform art teaching practice, so that art teachers may better understand the related dynamics of their pedagogical processes. Historically the artistic creative process has been accepted as one consisting of different sequential stages of development. This view however, is evolving due to the growing understanding of interrelated dynamics of life processes offered by, for example, neurological studies of the brain. New thinking links earlier philosophical and psychological ideas presented by such thinkers as James (1894) and Dewey (1934), to the work of Baars (1999), Brown (2000), Ellis (1999), Zeki (2000), in offering {{a deeper understanding of the}} natural human creative process. The reflective aspect of the artistic creative process is thus related to the way that we process information every minute of our lives; essentially it is the way we progress through life, minute by minute, learning and evolving, affirming self through finding meaning. Study of current theory relating to the processes of the brain inevitably incorporates modern thinking that revolves around dynamic processes. Originating in thermodynamics, Chaos Theory has travelled far from physics to become incorporated into a broad spectrum of disciplines. It offers a common language that relates to the dynamics of human nature, and as such is totally applicable to areas of learning and human interaction. Here used metaphorically, Chaos Theory serves to elucidate interactive aspects of the discipline of art making, with much to offer an understanding of the artistic creative process as it describes exactly the same process of change and growth through experience. A metaphorical use of the language of Chaos Theory provides visual art making with a means of sharing ideas with other academic disciplines that also constantly deal with the dynamics of the human condition, found for example in the close connections between the methods of exploration of both artists and scientists. In studying the phenomenon of ‘scale’ the physicist Feigenbaum commented on the connections between perceptions of artists and those of scientists, pointing to the way in which their perceptions and analysis of things coincide (Gleick, 1987). The visual analysis evident in the work of Turner or Ruskin reflects the same process of detailed conceptual exploration of material collected by the senses as that <b>of</b> a <b>student</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> scientific exploration. Chaos Theory is important also in that it provides a language accessible by varying levels of expertise, whether at a simple metaphorical or a more sophisticated level. This work charts these dimensions because “The challenge is to reverse the disconnectedness of the present world and to develop a curriculum that is not based on separateness of knowledge from life and being, but upon their inherent unity and integration” (Lovat and Smith, 1995, p. 248).

40|$|Writing {{is one of}} the macro-skills {{that can}} be {{developed}} through practice and enough exposures of individuals to the field of their interests. This skill can also be identified in the so-called theses as outputs presented by the authors—either <b>students</b> or practitioners <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>field.</b> According to Bitchener [1], “Writing an empirically based thesis requires a clear understanding of what is expected or required for each part or section” (p. 1). However, there are still some unpublished theses under criticism as manifested in the negative feedback or reactions of both general and specialized audience based on the quality in general, and on the clarity of thoughts in particular. In thesis, a good facility of the English language is indeed significant which makes the individual reader easily understand the flow of the ideas <b>of</b> <b>any</b> topic covered in the study. This paper aims to determine and analyze the linguistic features frequently used in theses <b>of</b> teacher education <b>students</b> at Batangas State University-JPLPC Campus, Malvar, Batangas in the academic year 2013 - 2014. The linguistic features used in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the parts of theses have been observed to determine its clarity in terms of form, use, and meaning, namely: present and past tenses, present perfect tense, passive and active voices, citations and qualifications, and commentary have been the main focus of this study. Based on the analysis and interpretation of the data coded and classified, results reveal that almost all of the concepts in the introduction of theses are certainly lifted and copied as indicated in the authors’ incorrect and improper citations. Theses read and coded appear {{to be a little more}} one percent use of qualifications which denotes discredits of points regarding the issue or concepts reviewed as reflected in the students’ strong claim for the said concepts. There is also a little amount of commentary to the theories or concepts and even to some findings reviewed. Therefore, the theses read and reviewed based on the sections can be improved and edited for clarity and viability, if possible for publication purposes...|$|R
