Yields of wheat, pea, bean, maize and potato predicted from data for climate, soil {{and land use}} technology were compared with observed yields from farm trials and from <b>seed</b> <b>station</b> and research station trials. The predicted range of yield for each crop suitability class enclosed the mean farm yields 13 times out of 16 and yields on seed stations and research stations 10 times out of 15 and 14 times out of 21 respectively. The variability of the observed yields exceeded the predicted range of yields. The method is considered as validated. The method appears to be applicable for multi-year studies at a broad scale, but yield variation according to the weather {{from year to year}} is not accounted for. The variances of the yields on farms are greater than the variances in <b>seed</b> <b>station</b> and research station trials.

40|$|Invasive {{species are}} {{generally}} regarded as detrimental to native communities because they cause increased competition and community structure alterations. There is therefore a critical {{need to understand the}} ecological processes underlying the establishment and spread of invasive species. While most studies to date have focused on the role of competition in species invasions, trophic dynamics may also play a fundamental role in the establishment and spread of non-natives, especially in cases when a non-native species experiences differential predation pressure relative to a native competitor. Herein I explore the potential for differential granivory pressure by a native rodent (Heermann’s kangaroo rat, Dipodomys heermanni arenae) on native shrubs and an invasive plant (Veldt grass, Ehrharta calycina). Veldt grass, a perennial tufted grass native to South Africa and introduced to California in 1929, is highly invasive, and the shift of native coastal dune scrub to a grassland, dominated by Veldt grass, {{is considered one of the}} factors that led to the decline of the federally endangered Morro Bay kangaroo rat. However, kangaroo rats are largely graminivores (consume grass seed) and are known to consume invasive grasses and other plants. Differential seed preferences for native and Veldt seed were examined by placing feeding stations containing each seed type in habitats dominated by either native plants or Veldt grass. Each feeding station was monitored using motion-activated game cameras and the amount of each seed type collected by nineteen individually-marked, wild kangaroo rats was documented. These marked kangaroo rats were monitored both in native and Veldt grass habitats, allowing for the testing of habitat origin (Native vs. Veldt), sex (male or female) and seed type on the amount of seed taken. Nine of the kangaroo rats harvested Veldt grass seed. Though females collected more seed than males, there was no difference between the amounts (% of available seed) of Veldt grass and native seed collected. Habitat of origin (i. e., habitats with Veldt grass present or habitats without Veldt grass) had no effect on the amount of seed collected or the type of seed collected. During <b>seed</b> <b>station</b> trials, kangaroo rats were also recorded removing seed heads from naturally occurring Veldt grass stalks, providing clear documentation that Heermann’s kangaroo rats do collect Veldt grass seed. Accompanying laboratory seed preference trials were also conducted to confirm the consumption of Veldt grass seed. These controlled laboratory trials revealed that Heermann’s kangaroo rats will consume Veldt grass seed, although Veldt grass seed was consumed in smaller amounts (g) than millet and sunflower seed, which were presented simultaneously. These findings indicate that non-native Veldt grass may provide an additional or alternative source of seed for kangaroo rats, which could provide a partial explanation for why kangaroo rats are able to survive in monocultures of Veldt grass...|$|E
40|$|We know {{surprisingly}} {{little about the}} fate of seeds of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) under natural conditions. Here we investigate seed removal, predation and caching of Brazil nuts by scatter-hoarding rodents in the wet and dry seasons, based on an experimental approach using 900 thread-marked seeds. We tracked the fate of seeds handled by these animals to examine how seasonal food availability may influence caching rates, dispersal distances and cache longevity. Most seeds exposed to dispersal trials were removed by scatter-hoarders during the first week in both seasons and seeds were generally buried intact in single-seeded caches within 10 m of <b>seed</b> <b>stations.</b> <b>Seeds</b> were removed significantly faster and buried at greater distances during the dry season. The proportion of seeds buried intact was considerably higher in the wet season (74. 4 %) than in the dry season (38. 2 %). Most (99. 4 %) of the 881 primary caches monitored were recovered, but these had a significantly shorter lifetime in the dry season. Our results show that rodents are highly skilled at retrieving buried Brazil nuts and that caching behaviour appears to be affected by seasonal resource abundance. Reduced seed availability due to intensive harvest could potentially create a dry-season scenario where most seeds succumb to pre-dispersal predation, thereby adversely affecting the natural regeneration of Brazil nut trees...|$|R

50|$|From 1925 to 2006 the Agency and its {{precursors}} {{were based}} at East Craigs in Edinburgh. The Agency was first {{formed by the}} then Board of Agriculture for Scotland. The origins of SASA {{can be traced back}} to the opening of a full-time <b>seed</b> testing <b>station</b> in 1914 at 21 Duke Street, Edinburgh. Following the introduction of the Testing of Seeds Order 1917, the unit moved to larger premises at 7 Albany Street in 1918. In May 1925 the <b>Seed</b> Testing <b>Station</b> moved to new purpose built laborotaries at East Craigs along with the Plant registration Station. The Board of Agriculture changed its name to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAFS) in 1960, and in 1961 the operations at East Craigs were renamed Agricultural Scientific Services of DAFS. In 1992, the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA) was formed as an executive agency taking on the role of Agricultural Scientific Services for the then Scottish Office. Following devolution in Scotland, the Agency became a part of the Environment and Rural Affairs Department. In 2000 SASA began developing plans to relocate from East Craigs due to the age of the facilities and the demands put upon them by new technologies, a suitable site was eventually identified on the Agency's own farm at Roddinglaw. SASA finally relocated to purpose built facilities at Roddinglaw in 2006. As of April 2008 SASA ceased to be an agency and became a division of the Rural affairs department, this forced a change of name, however to maintain the established acronym the name Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture was chosen.|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} seeds is {{essential}} for plant breeding with very different variability of relevant traits for different crops. In DPPN we have developed a modular phenoSeeder system consisting of an industrial pick-and-place robot and different measurement stations. It enables precise and effi-cient seed handling with low error rates and collecting seed traits such as size or weight of dif-ferent plant species. The robot is equipped with different tools used for seed handling. Depend-ing on seed size, each tool uses a specifically designed needle to which vacuum or overpressure is supplied to suck or release individual seeds, respectively. The picking system has been success-fully tested for seeds of various species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus or Hordeum vulgare varying in size from 180 μm to 8 mm. The seed handling cycle starts at a so called <b>seed</b> source <b>station.</b> It consists of a circular glass pane on which the seeds are manually dispersed and which is uniformly illuminated by an LED ring from below. A color camera underneath the glass pane acquires images of the seeds. The images are analyzed to extract both seed positions and properties such as projected seed area, length and width. For the different seed types individual segmentation parameters have been determined. The position of a single seed is defined by its image coordinates describing the seed’s center of mass. A 2 D-homography is used to map image coordinates to world coordinates which can be approached by the robot. After picking up a seed, it can be carried to measure-ment stations like a balance or a 3 D-reconstruction <b>station.</b> Each single <b>seed</b> gets its own ID and all measured traits are transferred to a database allowing seed-to-plant tracking in phenotyping pipelines. The modular software concept {{makes it possible to}} simply add new measurement stations without having to change the existing software. After traits are measured, the seed is released either into a pot with soil or at a defined position of a well plate. Currently a sowing procedure without moving to a measurement station takes 2. 9 to 3. 3 seconds depending on the pot’s distance to the <b>seed</b> source <b>station.</b> In case that a seed could not be released, the robot moves to a needle cleaner station where two rotating brushes clean the needle. Another part within DPPN is the construction of a quickSeeder system, based on a similar robot as that of the phenoSeeder. It will enable fast planting of seeds of which the respective traits were scored and which were placed in well plates by the phenoSeeder sys-tem beforehand...|$|R

40|$|An {{agent-based}} {{model of}} {{the transition to a}} hydrogen transportation economy explores influences on adoption of hydrogen vehicles and fueling infrastructure. Attention is given to whether significant penetration occurs and, if so, to the length of time required for it to occur. Estimates are provided of sensitivity to numerical values of model parameters and to effects of alternative market and policy scenarios. The model is applied to the Los Angeles metropolitan area In the benchmark simulation, the prices of hydrogen and non-hydrogen vehicles are comparable. Due to fuel efficiency, hydrogen vehicles have a fuel savings advantage of 9. 8 cents per mile over non-hydrogen vehicles. Hydrogen vehicles account for 60 % of new vehicle sales in 20 years from the initial entry of hydrogen vehicles into show rooms, going on to 86 % in 40 years and reaching still higher values after that. If the fuel savings is 20. 7 cents per mile for a hydrogen vehicle, penetration reaches 86 % of new car sales by the 20 th year. If the fuel savings is 0. 5 cents per mile, market penetration reaches only 10 % by the 20 th year. To turn to vehicle price difference, if a hydrogen vehicle costs $ 2, 000 less than a non-hydrogen vehicle, new car sales penetration reaches 92 % by the 20 th year. If a hydrogen vehicle costs $ 6, 500 more than a non-hydrogen vehicle, market penetration is only 6 % by the 20 th year. Results from other sensitivity runs are presented. Policies that could affect hydrogen vehicle adoption are investigated. A tax credit for the purchase of a hydrogen vehicle of $ 2, 500 tax credit results in 88 % penetration by the 20 th year, as compared with 60 % in the benchmark case. If the tax credit is $ 6, 000, penetration is 99 % by the 20 th year. Under a more modest approach, the tax credit would be available only for the first 10 years. Hydrogen sales penetration then reach 69 % of sales by the 20 th year with the $ 2, 500 credit and 79 % with the $ 6, 000 credit. A carbon tax of $ 38 per metric ton is not large enough to noticeably affect sales penetration. A tax of $ 116 per metric ton makes centrally produced hydrogen profitable in the very first year but results in only 64 % penetration by year 20 as opposed to the 60 % penetration in the benchmark case.

40|$|Crops thrive {{best when}} given {{a good start}} in life. For those crops which are {{normally}} propagated by seed, every effort {{must be made to}} keep pathogens at bay, at least until the crop is well-established. Obvious though this is, farmers throughout the world have, in the past, tended to underestimate the value of using pathogen-free seeds. Severe, even total, crop losses often arise from the presence of pathogens in the seed. Increasingly, farmers are demanding higher quality seed; and high quality seed must always be disease-free. To establish standards, most countries have introduced comprehensive seed certification schemes. To maintain these standards, <b>seed</b> testing <b>stations</b> have been established. These stations are responsible for issuing certificates which give buyers and sellers an accurate indication of quality. Nowadays, the seed trade is very much an international business, and there is a consequent need for some standardization of seed testing methodologies. <b>Seed</b> testing <b>stations</b> must be capable of identifying a wide range of pests, including insects, viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes. They also {{need to be able to}} detect mycotoxins (poisonous substances produced by fungi) which can affect seed viability, germination and vigour. National crop improvement programmes, most of which are assisted by the International Agricultural Research Centres, rely heavily of the storage and exchange of plant germplasm, usually in the form of seeds. The risks of transferring seed-borne pathogens in such exchanges are high. The international seed trade increases the problem still further, hence the need for adequate seed certification and quarantine procedures at both national and international levels In order to advance the development of such procedures, CTA, in collaboration with the Danish Government's Institute of Seed Pathology for Developing Countries, held a seminar on the topic in June 1988 in Denmark. Seed experts familiar with the latest methodologies for detection and control of seed-borne pathogens, met to discuss recent progress with seed pathologists from 20 ACP countries. The meeting concluded that the need to increase awareness of the importance of using diseasefree seed was as great as ever; too many farmers continue to underestimate the dangers of not doing so. Seed pathologists in ACP countries would benefit from improved training opportunities so as to increase the standard of seed testing generally. The ACP participants felt that a newsletter for the exchange of relevant information would assist them to achieve the higher quality standards that must be pursued.

40|$|Endozoochorous {{plant species}} that have obligate {{dispersal}} mutualisms with megafauna {{are at risk}} of extinction because of the unique conservation threats associated with large animals. This study examines Balanites maughamii which appears to have similar dispersal attributes to Sclerocarya birrea and Balanites wilsoniana, both of which are considered to be obligate elephant fruits. Here, I emphasize the traits that make B. maughamii suitable for elephant dispersal and examine the cues required for seed germination. Large, fleshy fruits with a single, exceptionally hard seed which requires a crushing force of > 2. 0 kN to promote germination are characteristic of this species. Using scent analysis of ripe fruits, the range of volatile that are responsible for the pungent odour were identified as being those which should function in mammal-attraction. Finally I examine the potential for long-distance dispersal by elephants using a gut passage time experiment, which revealed that elephants retain seed for approximately 48 hours, equating to a 4 - 8 km dispersal distance. Using fruit and <b>seed</b> bait <b>stations</b> to determine which other animals interact with B. maughamii, I found that small mammals may {{play a significant role in}} seed predation and that there is little evidence to suggest extensive secondary dispersal by rodents. These finding allude to the vulnerability of the long-term maintenance of B. maughamii in the absence of elephants, who appear to be their only legitimate disperser...|$|R
40|$|Hatchery {{and seed}} {{production}} trials for the Omani endemic abalone Haliotis mariae were carried out at the land-based Mirbat Abalone <b>Seed</b> Production <b>Station</b> in Oman between 1999 and 2000. The methods developed for broodstock conditioning, induction of spawning and fertilization, larval settlement, and {{the handling of}} small juveniles are shown. Abalone collected in the post-monsoon period and held for 2 months matured faster than those collected before the monsoon and held for 6 months.  Spawning induction {{of males and females}} had 63 % and 11 % success rates respectively, and the morphology of early larval stages is shown. Survival rates of veliger larvae introduced to settlement plates ranged from 35. 9 % to 73. 7 %, but the survival of post-larvae was low at 0. 1 % to  3. 6 %. The high mortality rate was attributed to invasions of filamentous green- and coralline algae on settlement plates and occurrence of low quantity of diatoms as food. Juveniles reacted best to  2 % ethanol as anaesthetic, dropping off culture plates within 4 min and recovering within 17 min.  Cultured abalone reached an average shell length of 52. 9 mm over 13 months, which translates to an increment of 4. 1 mm. mon- 1. The overall conclusion of these preliminary research trials confirms  that H. mariae can be cultured successfully in Oman. Further studies on the standardization of the techniques would help in stock enhancement programmes and commercial farming...|$|R
40|$|Diploma thesis {{was focused}} on the {{determination}} of seed production and their germination of selected species in the Apiaceae family. Selected species were common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) and cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris). Further was conducted determination weight of thousand seeds of both species and at common hogweed was also determined by the number of seeds containing endosperms, thus seeds potentially capable of germination. Before determining the germination the seeds were stored at different temperature conditions for the long term. Under laboratory conditions was detected in the case of common hogweed very low germination {{and in the case of}} cow parsley zero germination. The average seed production per plant was at 888 hogweed seeds and at cow parsley 1 194 seeds. The average weight thousand of seeds was at common hogweed 2, 79 grams and at cow parsley 2, 12 grams. The endosperms were detected in less than half of the examined <b>seed</b> at each <b>station...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this project, we {{reviewed}} existing understandings of how {{children and families}} engage in informal science learning during visits to museums and gardens. We then developed and implemented a learning workshop designed to increase children’s science learning and interest by engaging them in activities related to gardening and plant growth. Our workshop was titled “Little Farmers” and was a one-day event that {{took place at the}} San Luis Obispo Children’s Museum. The main goal was to facilitate parent-child interactions in an informal science learning setting. In order to do this, we developed several activities that included: seed planting, reading, coloring book, games, photo opportunity, and prompting signage. The visitors {{on the day of the}} workshop consisted of about 20 families with young children, ranging from 2 to 10 years of age. The most popular and engaging activity was the <b>seed</b> planting <b>station,</b> where parents and children worked together to plant the seeds and discuss the process of growth. We designed the workshop to be guided by the parent or the child in order to facilitate their interactions. However, lack of facilitation at each station led to low participation in several activities, including our games. Due to the low interest in our games, we chose to do a follow-up activity with a local Girl Scout troop to see if the games were effective. There was a positive response, which revealed that an older audience and increased facilitation was crucial to interest in the games, which led to learning. Overall, our workshop was a success at providing a space for parent-child interactions to engage in informal science learning...|$|R

A series experiments were carried out to evaluate five treatments % (w/w) including: T 1 :Hurdeume 0 Vetch 100, T 2 : Hurdeume 25 Vetch 75, T 3 : Hurdeume 50 Vetch 50, T 4 : Hurdeume 75 Vetch 25, T 5 : Hurdeume 100 Vetch 0 as randomized complete blocks design during three years (from 2004 to 2007) with 3 replications at Maraghe <b>station.</b> <b>Seeds</b> were planted in 20 cm row spacing in autumn. ANOVA {{results showed that the}} effects of treatments were significant (p≤% 1). The results at three growth stages showed that the highest wet and dry forage yield before and after flowering and also stubble and grain yield belong to T 3, T 4 and T 5 treatments. The lowest yield was obtained from T 1 treatment. But for highly ratio present of legume in T 3 this treatment recommended for dry lands. In flowering stage of vetch, gravimetric soil water content in 3 different depth (0 - 10, 10 - 20. 20 - 30 cm) of soil were significantly different between treatments and in each depth highest value belong to T 3 respectively 23. 39, 25. 43 and 25. 90 %...|$|R
