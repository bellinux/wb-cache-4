The motivation for this line of research is that firms are questioning if principal-agent conflicts are involved when the CEO is also chairman of the board. The performance measures used in this study are: return on assets, Tobin's q, and market-to-book value. The efficiency+H 12 measure used is general <b>selling</b> and administration <b>expenses</b> to total assets. This study is particularly unique in the way top management structures are grouped. Top management structures are grouped by chairman to avoid the possible principal-agent conflicts that may occur when a chairman is not CEO but holds another executive position.
