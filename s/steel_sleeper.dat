50|$|From the 1970s, they {{ceased to}} operate in fixed sets and at various times were used on the Brisbane Limited, Canberra Express, Gold Coast Motorail, Indian Pacific (to Broken Hill), North Coast Overnight Express, The Alice and Sydney/Melbourne Express in company with HUB, {{stainless}} <b>steel</b> <b>sleeper</b> and non air-conditioned stock.|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages include: When trains derail and {{the wheels}} hit the {{sleepers}}, timber sleepers tend {{to absorb the}} blow and remain intact, while concrete sleepers tend to shatter {{and have to be}} replaced. Initial costs are greater, and they are unsuitable for change of gauge, unless this is already taken into account. Concrete sleepers are up to 300 lbs heavier than their wooden counterparts. As a result, larger sized ballast is required to both support and hold in place the sleepers on the roadbed. Additionally, they do not absorb as much vibration from passing trains as wooden sleepers do. This can cause degradation of the sleepers themselves ranging from small cracks to complete failure over time. This problem is most prevalent when the sleepers are located next to joints in the rails. For this reason, most railroads do not use concrete sleepers on turnouts and interlockings.Another potential fault is lateral rigidity which may cause cumulative metal fatigue, particularly on reverse curves where the stresses are accentuated by the abrupt change of lateral forces. This in turn may be the cause of gauge corner cracking in the rails themselves as well as the <b>steel</b> <b>sleeper</b> reinforcement.German rails have experienced cracking of their sleepers on high speed lines. Damaged concrete sleepers cannot be repaired. Old concrete sleepers can be used for things like retaining walls, else they might be crushed to recycle gravel and the steel reinforcing.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> {{were tried}} as an {{alternative}} to timber; Acworth writing in 1889 describes the production of <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> on the London & North Western Railway, and there is an illustration showing rolled channel section (shallow upturned [...] "U" [...] shapes) with no shaped ends, and with three-part forged chairs riveted direct. However <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> seem not to have enjoyed widespread adoption until about 1995. Their dominant usage now is for life extension of existing track on secondary routes. They have a significant advantage on weak formations and poor ballast conditions, as the bearing area is at a high level, immediately under the rail seat.|$|R

50|$|The {{line between}} Blackburn and Clitheroe was {{temporarily}} closed in November 2008 {{due to a}} major refurbishment. The £5 million scheme included 11,651 yards of continuous welded rail, 16,000 new concrete or <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> and 40,000 tonnes of ballast. Replacement bus services ran between Clitheroe and Blackburn. The line re-opened on 28 November 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{technically}} innovative, {{in response to}} the terrain and conditions. The country was flat but difficult for conventional railway tracks due to flooding, lack of suitable timber for sleepers and termite attack. In 1884 Phillips patented a system for taking railways across such country which utilised special U-section <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> laid directly on the ground. During floods the line could be submerged without washing out the ballast and embankments normally used, so that it could quickly be put back into service when the waters subsided. The <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> were also impervious to termite attack, and although initially more expensive than timber sleepers, were cheaper to lay and maintain. The bridges along the line were also designed to be submersible. This system was particularly suited to the Gulf country and was specified for the Normanton to Croydon line with Phillips engaged to supervise the construction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of gold at Croydon in 1885, soon led to further growth in Normanton, {{as it became}} the supply base for miners. At that time the government was proposing to build a railway linking the Cloncurry copper mines and Normanton. By the end of 1886, the population at Croydon had reached 2,000, so {{the decision was made}} to divert the railway construction to Croydon utilising the materials that had been already delivered to Normanton. Tenders were called in July 1887, and the Normanton to Croydon railway line to Croydon completed in July 1891 (now known as the Gulflander). [...] The rail line featured innovative <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers,</b> designed by George Phillips. Burns Philp was the shipping agent for the <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers,</b> manufactured in Glasgow and transported to Normanton. The growth of the Croydon goldfield provided wealth for Burns Philp during the somewhat brief time it operated.|$|R
50|$|The Normanton to Croydon Railway runs 94 {{miles in}} a roughly {{south-east}} direction from Normanton to Croydon, in the Gulf country of North-west Queensland. The line, carried {{for most of}} its length on Phillips patent <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers,</b> runs over level country and crosses a number of streams by low-level bridges. It has stations {{at each end of the}} line with several stopping places in between.|$|R
5000|$|The railway was {{initially}} intended for temporary military purposes only, {{to be worked}} by means of animal power such as Argentine mules or Cape donkeys, but steam traction was soon adopted. The track was laid on <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> with [...] rail and had very severe curves and gradients. Climbing out of the Khan River gorge, the gradient was 1 in 19 (5¼%) with curves of 180 ft.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project has investigated {{the performance of}} interspersing <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> into existing timber sleepers with track structure comprising BHP 41 kg rail, 685 mm sleeper centre spacings and 1067 mm gauge. The {{method of data collection}} was by the development of testing equipment and a computer software program designed specifically to record relative deflections of sleepers whilst subjected to load from a 15. 5 tonne axle (90 tonne) Diesel-electric locomotive. Deflection data from five test sites over a period of 43 weeks was obtained. The five test sites comprised different combinations of <b>steel</b> and/or timber <b>sleepers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The line {{is still}} open, with rail of 30 kg/m relaid for about 50% of the line, with the balance being 21 kg/m. <b>Steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> have been {{installed}} {{at a rate}} of 1 in 4 to 1 in 3, and the maximum axle load is 15.75 tonnes. The maximum grade is 1 in 50 (2%), the minimum radius curve is 200m, and the line speed is 30 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} built with <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> to be termite-proof, and as this {{resulted}} in the line being virtually maintenance free (for the level of traffic involved), it {{is the main reason}} the line has survived, although closure was proposed several times. In 1929 locomotive use ceased and the weekly service was provided by a railmotor. It is still operating, run mainly for tourists and called the Gulflander.|$|R
5000|$|In 1917, General Manager Hoy {{authorised}} a {{trial of}} the system and a test circuit was laid on the veld at Canada Junction, 9 mi from Johannesburg. The dog-bone test circuit was 742 yd around, laid with light [...] rails on 7 lb <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> and hook bolts. The track included tight curves of as low as 37 ft radius and steep gradients of as much as 1 in 17 (5.88%).|$|R

50|$|Croydon is {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of a railway line linking {{it with the}} port of Normanton. The line was built between 1888 and 1891 when Croydon was an important goldfield and is the last isolated line of Queensland Rail still in use. It utilised an innovative system of submersible track with patent <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> and retains buildings and equipment of considerable interest, both {{in their own right}} and as part of this system.|$|R
50|$|For {{the supply}} of clothes, food and fuel to the nursing home Lainz, the Vienna City Administration decided to {{construct}} a manually operated narrow gauge railway. The Lehmann & Leyer company constructed a 4 km network with a track gauge of , with a base made of <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> and flat bottom rails. The work was completed in three months. At the crossing points of the tracks {{as well as the}} branches to the pavilions 61 cast-iron turntables were constructed.|$|R
50|$|In 1867 Phillips {{had taken}} part in the {{exploration}} of the country around Normanton with William Landsborough, working for him a surveyor. Soon afterwards, he surveyed the area chosen as a port to become the town of Normanton. The country was difficult for conventional railway tracks due to flooding, lack of suitable timber and voracious termites. In 1884 Phillips patented a system for taking railways across such country which utilised special U section <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> laid directly on the ground. During floods the line could be submerged without washing out the ballast and embankments normally used, so that it could quickly be put back into service when the waters subsided. The <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> were also impervious to termite attack, and although initially more expensive than timber sleepers, were cheaper to lay and maintain. It was this system that was specified for the Normanton to Croydon line and Phillips was engaged to supervise the construction. After the railway was completed he maintained an interest in the area, serving as Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Carpentaria, inspecting artesian bores and writing a report on ports and railways in 1909.|$|R
5000|$|The {{growth of}} {{traffic on the}} NCL has {{resulted}} in a number of improvements, including relaying with heavier rail, re-sleepering with concrete and <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> and a higher axle load. The entire line now has a 20-tonne axle load and continuously welded rail. The major coal haulage section between Gladstone and Rockhampton is [...] rail, whilst the balance of the line to Townsville is a combination of [...] & [...] The Townsville-Cairns section is [...] & [...] The lower weight rail is used for passing loops.|$|R
5000|$|For the {{restoration}} of WHR (Caernarfon), the Ffestiniog Railway imported not only South African steam engines (some built in Manchester by Beyer Peacock and Company as recently as 1958) but also the rails and <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers</b> on which to run them. This track included eighty completely made up panels of [...] gauge (adjusted before use to [...] gauge) straight track (for the laying of which a special rail mounted track laying gantry - 'The Forth Bridge' - was built by Winson Engineering Ltd). The greater part of the rail came with a job lot of <b>steel</b> <b>sleepers,</b> clips, screws, bolts and fishplates, all to several different patterns, {{which had to be}} sorted by WHR and FR volunteers before they could be used. The bulk of the track including all the curved sections was built up on site with rails moved forward to the railhead using specially built rail grab trolleys known as RRMs - [...] "Roland's Rail Movers", named after WHLR Ltd construction manager Roland Doyle. These proved to be a highly successful innovation and they have been used on all subsequent tracklaying. Amusingly, they have also acquired the nickname [...] "Roland Rats", a title believed to have originated among the track gangs at the Porthmadog end, who also use the same technology.|$|R
