40|$|Abstract- Inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{consists}} of gyroscopes and accelerometers, which {{are known as}} inertial sensors. These sensors are prone to various deterministic and random errors which need to be compensated. This work presents a calibration and stochastic modeling technique for six degree of freedom inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> in order to remove these errors from inertial sensors. Calibration of inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> is carried out to estimate the coefficients which transform the raw output of sensors into meaningful data. In this paper, allan variance technique is used to model and analyze various random errors present in inertial sensors. This paper covers the theoretical basis of calibration and allan variance along with implementation of these techniques to inertial sensors.

40|$|One of the {{foundational}} students’ misconceptions of area measurement is conceiving area as {{the length of}} a line, instead the size of a surface. They do not see area as the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> covering a surface. Therefore, this study intends to develop learning activities and materials that support students in developing their understanding of area as the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> covering a surface. This research is conducted based on the view of the design research approach consisting of two cycles. The subjects of the study are taken from the third grade students of two primary schools in Surabaya. Meanwhile, the learning activities in this study are based on the view of PMRI (Indonesia realistic mathematics education). We found that student need to understand physically quantity of area and the <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> of area before they are introduced to the meaning of area as the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> covering a surface. Learning activity that provides students with the experience of covering activity and comparing area problems could lead to the discussion on the physically quantity of area, the <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> of area, and its properties (no gap, no overlapping, and unit consistency); meanwhile, learning activity that engaging students in comparing area of tiled floors can be used to develop students’ understanding of measuring area as the process of finding the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>units.</b> Keywords: Area, area <b>measurement,</b> the <b>unit</b> of area <b>measurement,</b> design research...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA compact 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{that uses}} the light-source-stepping method (LSSM) is developed. The LSSM {{proposed}} by the authors is a phase-shifting fringe projection method for shape measurement. The authors also developed a linear LED device for high-speed shape measurement using the LSSM. A compact and high-speed 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> can be realized using a linear LED device. However, the LSSM is difficult to utilize because the phase-shifting amount is not uniform. The phase-shifting amount depends on {{the distance from the}} grating plate. It is therefore necessary to consider carefully the locations of the linear LED device and the grating plate. In this paper, the design method for a 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{that uses the}} LSSM is shown, and a prototype of a compact 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> with a linear LED device is developed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} methodologies for incorporating phasor measurements into conventional state estimator. The angle measurements {{obtained from}} Phasor <b>Measurement</b> <b>Units</b> are handled as angle difference measurements rather than incorporating the angle measurements directly. Handling {{in such a}} manner overcomes the problems arising due to the choice of reference bus. Current measurements obtained from Phasor <b>Measurement</b> <b>Units</b> are treated as equivalent pseudo-voltage measurements at the neighboring buses. Two solution approaches namely normal equations approach and linear programming approach are presented to show how the Phasor <b>Measurement</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>measurements</b> can be handled. Comparative evaluation of both the approaches is also presented. Test results on IEEE 14 bus system are presented to validate both the approaches...|$|R

40|$|A multi-objective optimal phasor <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{placement}} model using integer {{linear programming}} {{is presented in}} this article. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes two objectives, i. e., minimization of phasor <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> numbers and maximization of measurement redundancy. To calculate the redundancy criteria, the single-line outage and the phasor <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> loss are considered simultaneously. A linear formulation is presented for both objective functions. Also herein, to address conflicting attributes and identify Pareto optimal solutions of the multi-objective optimal phasor <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> placement problem, a new multi-objective mathematical programming method is proposed. Finally, a new index, i. e., minimum distance to utopia point, is implemented to select the most preferred solution among the available Pareto front based options on the goal to achieve judicious decision makers. Two test systems, i. e., a modified 9 -bus and an IEEE 118 -bus test systems, are used to illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed framework...|$|R

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{performance}} of location estimation in wireless positioning systems, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) is widely used as a criterion for selecting <b>measurement</b> <b>units.</b> Since GDOP represents the geometric effect {{on the relationship between}} measurement error and positioning determination error, the smallest GDOP of the <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> subset is usually chosen for positioning. The conventional GDOP calculation using matrix inversion method requires many operations. Because more and more <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> can be chosen nowadays, an efficient calculation should be designed to decrease the complexity. Since {{the performance of}} each <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> is different, the weighted GDOP (WGDOP), instead of GDOP, is used to select the <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> to improve the accuracy of location. To calculate WGDOP effectively and efficiently, the closed-form solution for WGDOP calculation is proposed when more than four measurements are available. In this paper, an efficient WGDOP calculation method applying matrix multiplication that is easy for hardware implementation is proposed. In addition, the proposed method can be used when more than exactly four measurements are available. Even when using all-in-view method for positioning, the proposed method still can reduce the computational overhead. The proposed WGDOP methods with less computation are compatible with global positioning system (GPS), wireless sensor networks (WSN) and cellular communication systems...|$|R
