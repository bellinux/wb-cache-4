5|$|With {{the failure}} of the 3rd Battalion, 27th Infantry, to hold the high knob on Battle Mountain after its attacks on September 8 and 9, the 24th Infantry <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to retake Battle Mountain. K Company, 24th Infantry, and C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion, dug in on the hill east of and beneath Battle Mountain, {{fortified}} their position with barbed wire and mine fields, and placed registered artillery and mortar fires on all approaches to the position. The regimental commander planned to contain the North Koreans on Battle Mountain by artillery and mortar fire. The North Koreans on Battle Mountain attacked the lower American defensive position many times on subsequent nights, but all their attacks were driven off. After a month of almost constant battle the North Koreans gained and held possession of the crest of Battle Mountain. The defensive fires of the 24th Regiment and attached artillery, however, contained them there and they were unable to exploit the possession on the peak or attack further.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued the {{attitude}} of the East towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played a big role in the West's advancements over the East. According to David Landes, after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, it seemed like the East <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement {{on the basis of their}} indigenous traditions and achievements. The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not see the need to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.|$|E

500|$|Lenalee is {{introduced}} in D.Gray-mans sixth manga chapter when she shows exorcist newcomer Allen Walker the Black Order. While {{on a mission}} to slay Akumas with Allen, Lenalee explains her past. Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young, and she was forced to become an Exorcist as a child. Because she was separated from her brother, Komui Lee, her only remaining family member, she tried repeatedly to escape but was restrained. As a result, she hated the Order and Innocence. When Komui joined the Order to be with her, she <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to escape. She now fights for her brother as well as her friends, knowing she has a home and family to return to. Her perception of the [...] "world" [...] consists of her friends and family; whenever one of her friends dies, it seems to her as if a part of her world has been destroyed. Lenalee's Innocence are the , her Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, {{take the form of a}} pair of black, knee-high boots that give her the ability to run at high speeds, jump to great heights, walk on water, create whirlwinds and use sound waves as footholds.|$|E

[...] When introduced in 1990, this route was numbered 604, which was intended to group it with the old numbering scheme for rapid transit routes. In 1996, the TTC overhauled its rapid transit route numbers and <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to market the Harbourfront route as 'rapid transit'. The number was changed to 510. The tracks were later extended in two directions to form the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront routes.|$|E

Although the accused had gone beyond the point [...] "necessary to break the resistance" [...] and had [...] "as a result, transgressed the Führer's order, that the National Socialist state well knows how to render his opponent harmless, but beyond that, eschews all vengeance". The court noted that the SA in the Wuppertal industrial area {{had to contend with}} especially persistent communist opponents, who never <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to organize underground, even after the Machtergreifung; and that this behavior of the state's attorney has given impetus to this element. On April 1, 1935, {{more than a year after}} the camp was closed, the court lifted the injunction and gave the accused a reprimand.|$|E

2500|$|Producer and pianist Sergio George {{helped to}} revive salsa's {{commercial}} {{success in the}} 1990s by mixing salsa with contemporary pop styles with Puerto Rican artists like Tito Nieves, La India, and Marc Anthony. George also produced the Japanese salsa band Orquesta de la Luz. Brenda K. Starr, Son By Four, Víctor Manuelle, and the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan enjoyed crossover success within the Anglo-American pop market with their Latin-influenced hits, usually sung in English. More often than not, clave was not a major consideration in the composing or arranging of these hits. Sergio George is up front and unapologetic about his attitude towards clave: [...] "Though clave is considered, {{it is not always}} {{the most important thing in}} my music. The foremost issue in my mind is marketability. If the song hits, that's what matters. When I <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to impress musicians and started getting in touch with what the people on the street were listening to, I started writing hits. Some songs, especially English ones originating in the United States, are at times impossible to place in clave."

2500|$|By September, Ferdinand Foch the {{commander}} of [...] (GAN) and co-ordinator of the Somme offensive, had <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to get the armies on the Somme (Tenth, Sixth, Fourth and Reserve) to attack simultaneously, which had proved impossible and instead make separate sequenced attacks, successively to envelop the German fortifications. Foch wanted to increase the size and tempo of attacks, to weaken the German defence and achieve rupture, a general German collapse. Haig had been reluctant to participate in August, when the Fourth Army was not {{close enough to the}} German third position to make a general attack practicable. The main effort was being made north of the Somme by the British and Foch had to acquiesce, while the Fourth Army closed up to the third position. To help the Fourth Army, the Reserve Army was to resume attacks against Thiepval {{and for the first time}} attack into the Ancre river valley, the Fourth Army was to capture the German intermediate and second positions from Guillemont to Martinpuich and then the third position from Morval to le Sars, as the Sixth Army attacked the intermediate line from Le Fôret to Cléry, then the third position from the Somme to Rancourt. On the south side of the river, the Tenth Army would commence its postponed attack from Barleux to Chilly.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout August 2008, {{media outlets}} {{claimed that the}} club was in {{complete}} disarray and that City were {{on the brink of}} financial meltdown, with Shinawatra asking a now disillusioned former chairman John Wardle for a £2 million loan and new manager Hughes threatening to resign unless finance problems were sorted out and the board <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to seemingly sell Stephen Ireland and Vedran Ćorluka behind his back. City supporters were also growing restless with Shinawatra – supporters who had seen many false dawns in their lifetimes, the situation looked bleak and an [...] "out with Shinawatra" [...] tone was beginning to gain favour with some City fans, much in the same manner of Peter Swales' departure in 1994. Rumours began spreading throughout the footballing world in August 2008 that Shinawatra's position as owner of the club was just not viable because of his frozen financial backing, and it was believed he was considering selling Manchester City to a new owner(s), claims which were refuted by club and manager at the time. Hughes, however, later acknowledged after Shinawatra left that he was [...] "close" [...] to leaving City because of the [...] "confusion" [...] at the club, further saying, [...] "the reality wasn't exactly what was described and sold to me" [...] when talking about Shinawatra's broken promises when he signed on for the job.|$|E

6000|$|An {{observer}} {{with more}} social light {{might have been}} more puzzled to account for Berry's toleration by these girls, who apparently associated with him on equal terms. Since he was not a servant, he was their equal in Lemuel's eyes; perhaps his acceptance might otherwise be {{explained by the fact that}} he was very amusing, chivalrously harmless, and extremely kind-hearted and useful to them. One must not leave out of the reckoning his open devotion for Miss Swan, which in itself would do much to approve him to her, and commend him to Miss Carver, if she were a generous girl, and very fond of her friend. It is certain that they did tolerate Berry, who made them laugh even that night in spite of themselves, till Miss Swan said, [...] "Well, what's the use?" [...] and <b>stopped</b> <b>trying</b> to discipline him. After that they had a very sociable evening, though Lemuel kept his distance, and would not let them include him, knowing what the two girls really thought of him. He would not take part in Berry's buffooneries, but talked soberly and rather austerely with Miss Carver; and to show that he did not feel himself an inferior, whatever she might think, he was very sarcastic about some of the city ways and customs they spoke of. There were a good many books about--novels mostly, but not the kind Statira used to read, and poems; Miss Carver said she liked to take them up when she was nervous from her work; and if the weather was bad, and she could not get out for a walk, a book seemed to do her almost as much good. Nearly all the pictures about in the room seemed to be Miss Swan's; in fact, when Lemuel asked about them, and tried to praise them in such a way as not to show his ignorance, Miss Carver said she did very little in colour; her lessons were all in black and white. He would not let her see that he did not know what this was, but he was ashamed, and he determined to find out; he determined to get a drawing-book, and learn something about it himself. To his thinking, the room was pretty harum-scarum. There were shawls hung upon the walls, and rugs, and pieces of cloth, which sometimes had half- finished paintings fastened to them; there were paintings standing round the room on the floor, sometimes right side out, and sometimes faced to the walls; there were two or three fleeces and fox-pelts scattered about instead of a carpet; and there were two easels, and stands with paints all twisted up in lead tubes on them. He compared the room with Statira's, and did not think much of it at first.|$|E
