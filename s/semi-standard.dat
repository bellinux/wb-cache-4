50|$|The USP has an {{accessory}} rail {{at the front}} of the frame that allows for attachments of aftermarket equipment like laser sights and weapon lights. The rail is of proprietary design (versus the more common picatinny rail) so equipment options are limited when compared to other tactical pistols. For instance, one of the few weapon lights compatible with the USP is the UTL (Universal Tactical Light) made by Insight Technology and is only available through H&K dealers. As a workaround, some companies have offered adapters that convert the USP's rail for use with attachment that mount to picatinny rails. SureFire makes adapters for both the USP and USP Compact that are compatible with their accessories, and GG&G makes the two similar adapters for compatibility with Streamlight's TLR range of weapon lights and lasers. In theory, since both companies' adapters use the <b>semi-standard</b> picatinny design, the adapters should accept any standard pistol mounted weapon light, but because the USP has such a large trigger guard and since there is no strict standard for rail placement, some lights may not be within finger reach of the operator.|$|E

Local refinement strategies for standard, <b>semi-standard</b> and non-standard T-splines – also by making use of the Bézier extraction operator – are presented for meshes of even and odd polynomial degrees. A technique is presented to determine the nesting between two T-spline meshes, again exploiting the Bézier extraction operator. Finally, the hierarchical refinement of standard, <b>semi-standard</b> and non-standard T-spline meshes is discussed.

40|$|Presented {{here is an}} {{introduction}} to An[Q[t]], the ring of symmetric polynomials in n variables over the ring of rational polynomials. We examine both the special case when t = 0, correlating to n and known simply as the ring of symmetric polynomials, and the general case. The first case introduces the Schur polynomials, a class of symmetric polynomials indexed by partitions that serve as a basis of the additive abelian groups corresponding to the decomposition of An. Schur polynomials manifest themselves throughout mathematics, from representation theory to combinatorics. We are primarily interested in the combinatorial interpretation in terms of certain <b>semi-standard</b> Young tableaux. We consider the matrix that translates from monomial to Schur symmetric polynomials, the entries of which correspond {{to the number of}} particular <b>semi-standard</b> Young tableaux and are known as Kostka numbers. In An[Q[t]] we encounter the Hall-Littlewood polynomials and demonstrate that the translation matrix from these polynomials to the Schur polynomials has entries in N(t), the set of polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients. We present and provide a proof that these Kostka polynomials have a combinatorial interpretation, namely they t-count certain <b>semi-standard</b> Young tableaux with a weight determined by a statistic called charge...|$|E

The bijection involves an insertion procedure reminiscent of Schensted insertion, which leads us to an analogue of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth Algorithm. A partial ordering {{on the set of}} composition of n into infinitely many parts is used to prove that the nonsymmetric Schur functions are a basis for all polynomials. The poset given by this ordering is isomorphic to the poset L(n, m − 1) of partitions which fit inside an m × n − 1 rectangle.

If $A$ is <b>semi-standard</b> graded (i. e., $A$ is finitely generated as a $k[A_ 1]$-module), {{it has the}} $h$-vector $(h_ 0, h_ 1, [...] ., h_s) $, which encodes the Hilbert function of $A$.
