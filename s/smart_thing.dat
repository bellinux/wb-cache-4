Smart {{spaces are}} open complex {{computing}} systems, {{consisting of a}} large variety of cooperative <b>smart</b> <b>things.</b> Central to building smart spaces is the support for sophisticated coordination among diverse <b>smart</b> <b>things</b> collaborating to accomplish specified tasks. Multi-agent systems are often used as the software infrastructures to address the coordination in smart spaces. However, since agents in smart spaces are dynamic, resource-bounded and have complicated service dependencies, current approaches to coordination in multi-agent systems encounter new challenges when applied in smart spaces. In this paper, we present Baton, a service management system to explicitly resolve the particular issues stemming from smart spaces while coordinating agents (delegating <b>smart</b> <b>things</b> in <b>smart</b> spaces). Baton is designed as a complement to coordination approaches in multi-agent systems {{with a focus on}} mechanisms for service discovery, service composition, request arbitration and dependency maintenance.
