As they were in negotiations, group member Professor Griff made anti-Semitic remarks {{in an interview with}} The Washington Times, in which he said that Jews were the cause of [...] "the majority of the wickedness" [...] in the world. Public Enemy received media scrutiny and criticism from religious organizations and liberal rock critics, which added to charges against the group's politics being racist, homophobic, and misogynistic. Amid controversy, Chuck D was given an ultimatum by Schocklee and Stepheny to dismiss Griff from the group or the production deal would fall through. He fired Griff in June, but he later rejoined and has since denied holding anti-Semitic views and apologized for the remarks. Several people who had worked with Public Enemy expressed concern about Chuck D's leadership abilities and role as a <b>social</b> <b>spokesman.</b> Def Jam director of publicity Bill Adler later said that the controversy [...] "partly ... fueled the writing of [...] ".|$|E

By August 10, however, Ridenhour denied that he had disbanded the group, and stated that Griff had been re-hired as [...] "Supreme Allied Chief of Community Relations" [...] (in contrast to his previous position with the group as Minister of Information).

50|$|Social {{minister}} Erwin Buchinger {{announced on}} 30 July 2008 {{that he would}} not stand for parliament; while he claimed that it would be up to Faymann whether he would stay on as social minister, it was rumoured that Faymann would choose someone from the Austrian Trade Union Federation as social minister instead, due to tradition and the need for reconciliation with the unions. While Buchinger stated on 2 August 2008 he was not tired of politics and was not at all ruling out staying on as social minister, president of the National Council Barbara Prammer (also SPÖ) said that possible successors for Buchinger as social minister would be Renate Csörgits, chairwoman of the social issues committee in the National Council, and family issues spokeswoman Andrea Kuntzl. On 3 August 2008, ÖVP <b>social</b> issues <b>spokesman</b> Werner Amon laid claim to the social ministry after the election, declaring that this would be an issue in coalition talks after the election; the SPÖ immediately denounced this claim. The Faction of Social Democratic Unionists (Fraktion Sozialdemokratischer Gewerkschafter), the SPÖ's union wing, also laid claims to the social ministry, although some union leaders stated that the incumbent Buchinger would also count as being from the unions, as his position and actitivites within the Public Employment Service Austria (Arbeitsmarktservice Österreich) were proof enough of his unionist mindset.|$|R
40|$|Having as {{background}} {{the debate}} about the relationship between the use of natural resources, economy and sustainability, the objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss the place for extraction in the context of development considering the different perspectives of this activity in the Brazilian Amazon. Based on literature review and secondary data it is contextualized that historically the development strategies designed to Brazil’s Amazon region are guided in extractive activities promoted by the holders of political and economical power and promoted by the state. Currently, it recurs in academic discourses and government <b>spokesmen,</b> <b>social</b> movements and companies, the need to rethink the use of natural resources, adding value to extractive products and enhancing the knowledge of traditional populations. It discusses the recognition of the diversity of populations, ecosystems and ways of managing natural resources, emerging new actors, new products and conflicts. However, in this dispute scenario, the challenge of implementing these principles in terms of strategies for development continues...|$|R
50|$|The Greens {{determine}} all {{of their}} candidate lists through voting of party members at party conventions; the federal convention on 7 September 2008 had to decide on who {{was placed in the}} first positions on the national list and would therefore enter parliament. Party leader Van der Bellen and vice-leader Eva Glawischnig were set to be placed in positions one and two; two immigrant women (Alev Korun from Turkey and Beatrice Achaleke from Cameroon) vied for third place (with Burgenland leading candidate Christiane Brunner and two minor candidates), and three long-time party members (security <b>spokesman</b> Peter Pilz, <b>social</b> issues <b>spokesman</b> Karl Öllinger and budget spokesman Bruno Rossmann) vied for places four and six. Pilz, a long-time MP and former party leader, threatened to withdraw from politics if he was not selected on the fourth place of the national candidate list; Öllinger was also on the Viennese list, but Pilz and Rossmann could only remain MPs if they were selected for safe positions on the national list. Pilz stated he would not vie for sixth place if rejected for fourth place. In the first round Korun got 42% and Achaleke 38%, with 19% for the three other candidates; Korun won against Achaleke in the run-off with 54% to 46%. Pilz was selected in the first vote with 51% to Öllinger's 35%, with Rossmann and a minor candidate both gaining 7%. Chief secretary Sburny lost the selection for fifth place against Burgenland leading candidate Brunner, youth and children issues spokeswoman Barbara Zwerschitz and two minor candidates (who already vied for third place) after three rounds of voting (34% to 31% to 25% to 11%, 44% to 36% to 20% and 59% to 41%); her defeat was likely due to strong criticism of the office cumulation, as she would have become both an MP and remained chief secretary. Öllinger, Rossmann and four minor candidates vied for sixth place, which Öllinger won in the first vote 52% to 28% to 18%. Helene Jarmer, president of the Austrian Alliance of the Deaf (Österreichischer Gehörlosenbund) was selected for the seventh place over the two minor candidates from before with 89%; Rossmann was selected for eighth place, Zwerschitz for ninth.|$|R
