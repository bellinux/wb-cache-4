40|$|The current {{context of}} globalization, {{financial}} markets mondialisation, internationalization {{of production and}} intensification of international trade relations represents references that justify {{the need for an}} international project of reducing international accounting differences between the local accounting referential. Recent developments in the area of financial reports improvements interest devotes international accounting convergence solution as the way forward. Regardless of the approach chosen by each country in the process of international accounting convergence, the situation of conflict situation between state vs. accounting profession persists nowadays. This situation has led to the establishment of a dual financial reporting system at the national level, not at all beneficial to the users of financial information. The success of international accounting convergence process is reduced {{to the level of the}} consolidated <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of listed companies. The next step that needs to be done is also to provide solutions of accounting convergence to the rest of the companies, and also to extend the normalization process for the <b>statutory</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> too. Positive effects of international accounting referential, confirmed by recent studies, become a solid base for adopting IFRS for <b>statutory</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> too. The main impediment that needs to be eliminated is to convince the state that this step is appropriate for all players of accounting information market. Considering romanian current situation, where from now IFRS is used to report the <b>statutory</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of listed companies too, we try, by an empirical approach at the level of BVB, to look for the impact of such a legislative change.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of, and {{interaction}} between reinsurance and derivative hedging for {{property and casualty}} insurance companies in the United States. To investigate an insurer’s operation on investment, underwriting and derivative hedging simultaneously, a dynamic theoretical model is constructed to study the impact of reinsurance on investment hedging derivatives and underwriting hedging derivatives separately. The main predictions made by the model are as follows. (1) Underwriting hedging derivatives serve as a substitute to reinsurance. (2) The relationship between investment hedging derivatives and reinsurance depends on the hedging cost function and the correlation between an insurer’s investment and underwriting business. (3) Investment hedging derivatives are positively correlated {{with the amount of}} risky investments. The theoretical predictions are supported by empirical evidence taken from derivative transactions reported by U.

40|$|Abstract: The {{traditional}} approach to Property/Casualty rate indications {{starts with a}} methodology that uses internal data to forecast the Ultimate Loss Ratio, with losses making up {{about half of the}} expenses. For parties that are external to the insurer, this approach to forecasting a key component of future profitability is impractical as they generally {{do not have access to}} the necessary data. Using publicly available information, that is, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Schedule P of the <b>statutory</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> from 1992 to 2010, we develop by line of business forecasts of the relativity to the industry Loss Ratio. To develop these forecasts, we use a weighted regression methodology that incorporates key ideas from fixed-effects regression, instrumental variables regression, credibility theory, as well as a flexible covariance structure for the residuals. Results indicate that the proposed approach of using lagged relativities from insurer own and other lines of business can provide adequate fits for many lines of business and for the combined results of the insurer as a whole...|$|R

On the other hand, we should acknowledge the impact of the activities of credit institutions on monetary statistics, such as the figures about monetary mass and crediting of the domestic private sector, all of them representing a concern of those who establish policies. It is known that normalization and harmonization of the Romanian accounting with international standards ensure that the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> of credit institutions to provide the necessary information to all categories of users in decision-making process, reflecting the differences on economic performance and at the same time, risks in the business environment.

40|$|Recent years {{a series}} of scandals in the banking and {{financial}} world imply that banks as a category of service organizations need to increase transparency. The <b>statutory</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> ignores factors that may be of importance to create {{an image of a}} transparent and legitimate company which makes firms to embrace the opportunity and complement the <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> with supplementary information. Since the company's survival depends largely on the legitimacy obtained from shareholders and investors, that is why banks’ actions must be consistent with shareholder and investors’ expectations and demands on the banks business. Reporting for intellectual capital through annual reports can contribute to a better insight into the organization and how does it behave with respect to shareholder and investor. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to create an understanding of how service organizations can create transparency and legitimacy through external reporting of intellectual capital. A case study of the four major banks in Sweden has been adopted during the study considering actor approach. The results were generated by textual analysis of the annual reports between 2002 and 2011 by applying a unique analysis method which consists of two encoding passes. The first coding was based on the identification of signals human, structural and customer capital in order to create a comprehensive picture of how the reporting of intellectual capital has changed over the years. By the second round signal characters in form of legitimacy-building strategies were identified: change the company, change perception or manipulate perception. The theoretical framework built on the agent, legitimate and signal theory was tested in the case studies result. An analysis of the signals and signal characters has shown that banks tend to increase transparency and create legitimacy primarily by emphasizing structural capital through the signal character – change perception. This means that banks are trying to inform shareholders and investors primarily through reporting of various processes, policies, programs or systems without demonstrating any changes in terms of structural capital. The study also underlines a strong link between the theories given that service organizations can reduce information gaps by signaling information requested on the market by shareholders and investors and thereby increase transparency which creates legitimacy.
