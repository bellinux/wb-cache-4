5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is typically}} inoffensive towards humans, but if disturbed, can inflict a severe bite. Across {{much of its}} range, it is a frequent catch (intentional or not) in bottom trawls and probably also set nets and demersal gillnets; the meat is eaten and the rough skin is made into a type of leather called <b>shagreen</b> for use in wood finishing.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called <b>shagreen,</b> had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E

50|$|Raorchestes coonoorensis {{is a small}} frog. Only {{males have}} been collected; the five males in the type series measure 20.7 - 23.8 mm in snout-vent length. Snout is long (longer than {{horizontal}} diameter of the eye) and tympanum is rather distinct. Body is slender and hind-limbs are relatively long. Hands have no webbing but have lateral dermal fringes; toes are slightly webbed. Dorsum bears spinular projections, {{and much of the}} dorsal surfaces are <b>shagreened</b> with some granular projections. Upper eyelids are <b>shagreened</b> with some prominent horny spinules, and sides of head are <b>shagreened</b> with prominent tubercles. Dorsum is light-reddish brown, grey, or light-grey, with a light black stripe between the eyes and a pair of brown concave stripes running from behind the eye to the vent. Loreal and tympanic regions are dark-brownish black, and upper and lower jaws have brownish bands alternating with light grey. Both fore and hind-limbs have dark-brownish cross bands. Ventral side is grey with variable-sized dark-brown specks; hands and feet are greyish.|$|R
50|$|Males measure 35 - 46 mm {{and females}} 44 - 60 mm in snout-vent length. The {{skin on the}} dorsum is <b>shagreened</b> to {{granular}} and medium brown in colour with irregular ochre spots or reticulations.|$|R
5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that {{spends most}} of the day lying still on the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The litter size varies from two to 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and <b>shagreen,</b> a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low resilience of angel sharks to fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{porcupine}} ray consists {{mainly of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes, which it digs {{up from the}} sea floor. It is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The porcupine ray has long been valued for its rough and durable skin, which {{was made into a}} <b>shagreen</b> leather once used for various utilitarian and ornamental purposes, such as to cover sword hilts and shields. It is caught incidentally by coastal fisheries. Because it must be handled carefully due to its thorns, its commercial significance is limited. Unregulated fishing has led to this species declining in many parts of its range, and thus has been listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|While {{large enough}} to perhaps be dangerous, the bignose shark seldom comes into contact with humans due to its {{preference}} for deep water. This species is a bycatch of gillnet, bottom trawl, and deep-set pelagic longline fisheries (particularly those targeting tuna) {{in many parts of}} its range. It is regularly taken in Cuban waters and used to produce liver oil, <b>shagreen,</b> and fishmeal. Elsewhere, such as in Southeast Asia, the meat is consumed and the fins shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup. The bignose shark is not used commercially in United States, where it is listed as Prohibited Species under the 2007 Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic tunas, swordfish and sharks, or in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile a Japanese colony was {{established}} in Ayutthaya. The colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer-hide and sappan wood to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and Japanese handicrafts (swords, lacquered boxes, high-quality papers). From Ayutthaya, Japan was interested in purchasing Chinese silks, as well as deerskins and ray or shark skins (used to make a sort of <b>shagreen</b> for Japanese sword handles and scabbards).|$|E

25|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{very similar}} to S. richteri. The punctures are from where pilosity arises, and these are often elongated on the dorsal and ventral portions of the head. On the thorax, striae are present, but they are less engraved with fewer punctures than in S. richteri. On the petiole, the punctates are located on the sides. The postpetiole, when viewed above, has a strong <b>shagreen</b> with distinct transverse punctostriae. The sides are covered in deep punctures, where they appear smaller but deeper. In S. richteri, the punctures are larger and more shallow. This gives a more opaque appearance to the surface. In some cases, punctostriae may be present around the rear portion. The pilosity appears similar to that of S. richteri. These hairs are erect and vary in length, appearing long {{on each side of the}} pronotum and mesonotum; on the head, the long hairs are seen in longitudinal rows. Numerous appressed pubescent hairs are on the petiolar scale; this is the opposite in S. richteri, as these hairs are sparse. Workers appear red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or completely black gaster. Gastric spots are sometimes seen in larger workers, where they are not as brightly coloured as those in S. richteri. The gastric spot usually covers a small portion of the first gastric tergite. The thorax is concolorous, ranging from light reddish-brown to dark-brown. The legs and coxae are usually lightly shaded. The head has a consistent colour pattern in large workers, with the occiput and vertex appearing brown. Other parts of the head, including the front, genae, and the central region of the clypeus, are either yellowish or yellowish brown. The anterior borders of the genae and mandibles are dark-brown; they also both appear to share the same coloured shade with the occiput. The scapes and funiculi range from being the same colour as the head or shares the same shade with the occiput. Light-coloured areas of the head in small to medium-sized workers is restricted to only the frontal region, with a dark mark resembling an arrow or rocket being present. On occasion, nests may have a series of different colours. For example, workers may be much darker, and the gastric spot may be completely absent or appear dark-brown.|$|E
