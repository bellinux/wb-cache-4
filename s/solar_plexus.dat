25|$|As {{soon as the}} Artful Dodger came onstage, Gavroche came to mind. It {{was like}} {{a blow to the}} <b>solar</b> <b>plexus.</b> I started seeing all the {{characters}} of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables—Valjean, Javert, Gavroche, Cosette, Marius, and Éponine—in my mind's eye, laughing, crying, and singing onstage.|$|E
25|$|Moving up to middleweight, Petrosyan {{marked his}} arrival in the weight class {{that he would go}} on to {{dominate}} by winning the eight-man 72kg/158lb tournament at Janus Fight Night 2006 in Padua, Italy, on December 2, 2006. He took a unanimous decision win against Cédric Muller in the quarter-finals and TKO'd Frane Radnić in the semis, knocking him down twice in round one with a left cross to the <b>solar</b> <b>plexus,</b> before beating Marco Piqué via another unanimous decision in the final.|$|E
25|$|In {{the pure}} {{fighting}} art of SMR, {{the aim is}} to use the staff defeat an opponent armed with one or two swords. The staff is a flexible weapon and can be used in several ways. A practitioner can use the greater length of the staff to keep the opponent at a distance. It is also used, when applicable, to get very close to the opponent and then to control the opponent's arms or hands. The staff {{can be used in a}} manner that enables the wielder to defeat the opponent without killing him. Common methods include controlling the opponent's hands, wrists, and other targets by using the staff to either strike, thrust or otherwise manipulate the target-areas. When applicable, more lethal strikes are aimed at the opponent's more vital areas such as the head, <b>solar</b> <b>plexus</b> and temples.|$|E

The students agreed to pay Eddy 10 percent annually of income derived from her work, and $1,000 if they failed to practice or teach it. She at first taught them to rub patients' heads, to [...] "lay [...] hands where the belief is to rub it out forever"; Kennedy would manipulate each student's head and <b>solar</b> <b>plexus</b> before class in preparation. The head rubbing was abandoned when the women complained about having to take their hair down, and the stomach rubbing held no appeal for them either. Eventually Eddy told them to ignore {{that part of the}} manuscript, and from then on Christian Science healing did not involve touching patients.|$|E

The rower has legs straight, body leaning back, and arms pulled in so that the oar handle is a few inches from the <b>solar</b> <b>plexus.</b> This is the beginning of what is called the recovery or the slide.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 January 2014, Savage {{released}} [...] "Love in Yellow", {{a promotional}} single meant to celebrate Valentine's Day 2014. The song, {{which has a}} retro R and Funk sound, was produced by Spellz. Savage was featured on Reekado Banks's 2014 single [...] "Turn It Up", which was produced by Don Jazzy. On 1 May 2014, Mavin Records released [...] "Dorobucci" [...] featuring Savage, Don Jazzy, Dr SID, D'Prince, Reekado Banks, Korede Bello and Di'Ja. The song, which was produced by Don Jazzy, is the record label's first collaborative release since {{the release of the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>Plexus</b> album in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{developed}} by Stapp {{as an added}} safety measure was an improved version of the currently used shoulder strap and lap belt. The new high-strength harness withstood 45.4 g (445m/s²), compared to the 17 g (167m/s²), which was the limit that could be tolerated with the old combination. Basically, the new pilot harness added an inverted [...] "V" [...] strap crossing the pilot's thighs added to the standard lap belt and shoulder straps. The leg and shoulder straps and the lap belt all fastened together at one point, and pressure was distributed evenly over the stronger body surfaces, {{rather than on the}} <b>solar</b> <b>plexus,</b> {{as was the case with}} the old harness.|$|E
2500|$|I have {{a theory}} about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from {{watching}} her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has {{lost a lot of}} weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her <b>solar</b> <b>plexus</b> [...] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.|$|E
2500|$|Tiwatope Savage-Balogun (born 5 February 1980), {{better known}} by her stage name Tiwa Savage, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter, {{performer}} and actress. She currently has a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Savage signed a recording contract with Mavin Records in 2012. Savage also signed a management and publishing deal with Roc Nation in June 2016, which she later confirmed via Instagram. She co-wrote the track [...] "Collard Greens & Cornbread" [...] off Fantasia Barrino's Grammy-nominated album, Back to Me. Savage was featured on <b>Solar</b> <b>Plexus,</b> a compilation album released by Mavin Records. She did backup vocals for George Michael {{at the age}} of 16, and lent vocals to other musicians such as Mary J. Blige, Chaka Khan, Blu Cantrell, Emma Bunton, Kelly Clarkson, Andrea Bocelli, and Ms. Dynamite, amongst others. Furthermore, she has performed on stage with Sting, 50 Cent, The Black Eyed Peas, Eminem, Robbie Williams and Destiny's Child, to name a few.|$|E
2500|$|Savage {{established}} her {{own label}} imprint, 323 Entertainment, with her then-manager and husband Tunji [...] "Tee Billz" [...] Balogun whom she got engaged to on 5 February 2013. She joined Don Jazzy's Mavin Records in 2012 after the label she co-owns {{teamed up with}} the executive producer. She {{was one of the}} lead artists on <b>Solar</b> <b>Plexus,</b> the record label's 2012 compilation album. Savage started recording her debut studio album in 2010. She networked with Berklee alumni Keith Harris, Derek Pate, Scott Coleman, Radar Ellis, and Darien Dorsey while attending the aforementioned music school. During her interview with Brenda Pike, she said she collaborated with producers Chuck Harmony, Warren [...] "Oak" [...] Felder, and So Sick (Da Grin), among others. Moreover, she said that her debut album will include records in her native tongue. Savage was featured on Flavour N'abania's [...] "Oyi Remix" [...] in 2012. Prior to collaborating with Flavour, she recorded her own version of the song.|$|E
2500|$|Gonnosuke withdrew to a Shinto shrine at Mount Homan in Chikuzen province, (modern-day, Fukuoka Prefecture), {{where he}} would {{practice}} daily in perfecting his swordsmanship, praying and performing Shinto purifying rituals for 37 days. It is also said, however, that he spent several years on the road studying other martial arts in various dojos until he {{ended up at the}} Shinto shrine. After one of his regular (exhausting) training sessions, he collapsed from fatigue and reputedly had a vision of a divine being {{in the form of a}} child, saying to Gonnosuke: [...] "know the <b>solar</b> <b>plexus</b> [...] with a round stick". In another version he had the vision in a dream late at night. He took it upon himself to create the jo deliberately longer than the average katana of the day, 128cm, as opposed to the sword's total length of approx. 100cm, and use that length to his advantage in a fight. Gonnosuke, drawing on his own considerable experience with the spear, longstaff, naginata and sword, devised a series of jo-techniques for use to counter and defeat a swordsman. Arguably, he also developed techniques to target Musashi's trade-mark X-block.|$|E
2500|$|Scorpion {{made one}} {{appearance}} in the 1996 animated series [...] in the [...] ("Sting of the Scorpion"). His rivalry with Sub-Zero is vaguely explored, as no explicit mention is ever made of Sub-Zero killing him. Scorpion instead serves as an independent entity of evil who is first seen in a flashback sequence being banished to [...] "the realm of lost souls" [...] (designed to resemble his [...] "Lair" [...] stage in UMK3) for having died with dishonor, and has now returned {{to the land of}} the living to resurrect the dishonored dead in all realms, especially Shang Tsung. When Sub-Zero and Scorpion finally meet, Sub-Zero threatens to make Scorpion pay for the death of his clan but is defeated by a single kick to the <b>solar</b> <b>plexus.</b> Liu Kang beats Scorpion in mortal combat in Sub-Zero's stead, and Raiden returns Scorpion back to the underworld as his undead army disappears. His spear was again a green snake-like head attached to a length of gold chain, which merely binds Liu Kang instead of impaling him before he breaks free. Scorpion was the lone ninja character in the show who never unmasked, and his voice actor was uncredited.|$|E
2500|$|An exultant Stilwell {{immediately}} delivered {{this letter}} to Chiang despite pleas from Patrick J. Hurley, Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering {{the message and}} work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang. Stillwell wrote in his diary about handing over Roosevelt's message: [...] "I handed this bundle of paprika to the Peanut and than sank back with a sigh. The harpoon hit the little bugger right in the <b>solar</b> <b>plexus</b> and went right through him. It was a clean hit, but beyond turning green and losing his powers of speech, he did not bat an eye". The British journalist Jonathan Fenby wrote about Roosevelt's letter: [...] "Unless the President was ready for America to take over effective control of China, or halt Lend-Lease supplies and abandon the KMT to its fate, his stern words merely amounted to bluff". Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation of China, Chiang gave a formal reply {{in which he said}} that Stilwell must be replaced immediately and he would welcome any other qualified U.S. general to fill Stilwell's position. Chiang called Roosevelt's letter the [...] "greatest humiliation I have been subjected to in my life" [...] and stated it was [...] "all too obvious that the United States intends to intervene in China's internal affairs". Chiang told Hurley the Chinese people were [...] "tired of the insults which Stillwell has seen fit to heap upon them". Chiang delivered a speech before the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, which was leaked to the press, which called Roosevelt's letter a form of imperialism and stated that to accept Roosevelt's demands would make him no different from the Japanese collaborator Wang Jingwei in Nanking. On 12 October 1944, Hurley reported to Washington that Stilwell was a [...] "fine man, but was incapable of understanding or co-operating with Chiang Kai-shek", going on to say that if Stilwell remained in command, all of China might be lost to the Japanese. Before sending his cable, Hurley showed it to Stilwell who accused Hurley [...] to his face of [...] "cutting my throat with a dull knife".|$|E

60|$|At the <b>solar</b> <b>plexus,</b> {{the dynamic}} {{knowledge}} is this, that I am I. The <b>solar</b> <b>plexus</b> {{is the center}} of all the sympathetic system.

60|$|However, {{having more}} or less {{determined}} the four primary motions, {{we can see the}} further unfolding.

60|$|From the <b>solar</b> <b>plexus</b> {{first of}} all pass the great vitalistic {{communications}} between child and parents, the first interplay of primal, pre-mental knowledge and sympathy. It is a great subtle interplay, and from this interplay the child is built up, body and psyche. Impelled from the primal conscious center in the abdomen, the child seeks the mother, seeks the breast, opens a blind mouth and gropes for the nipple. Not mentally directed and yet certainly directed. Directed from the dark pre-mind center of the <b>solar</b> <b>plexus.</b> From this center the child seeks, the mother knows. Hence the true mindlessness of the pristine, healthy mother. She {{does not need to}} think, mentally to know. She knows so profoundly and actively at the great abdominal life-center.|$|E
