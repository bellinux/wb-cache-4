5|$|The {{character}} of Henry Dion {{appears to be}} a composite of several real life serial killers. His fondness for conversing with his victims' bodies and the gregarious demeanour shown during this seems to be based on Milwaukee-based murderer Jeffrey Dahmer, who would also, like Dion, document his victims photographically. The habit of photographing victims, and the notion of killing women to use them as props, stems from killer Henri Nadeau, who murdered several women in order to use them as mannequins for his photography. The use of an overbearing matriarchal figure as a <b>stressor</b> harkens to Edmund Kemper, who was driven to kill young women by his hatred of his mother, who he eventually murdered before turning himself in; both Dion and Kemper cut their mother's vocal folds from their throats after killing them.|$|E

A sample of 427 Sri Lankan Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim youth (mean age = 14. 5) completed a survey with measures of exposure to disaster-related <b>stressors</b> and daily <b>stressors,</b> psychological distress (posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety), and psychosocial distress. The results indicated that daily <b>stressors</b> significantly mediated relations between war- and tsunami-related <b>stressors</b> and psychological and psychosocial distress.

40|$|Introduction: Cardiac surgery, due {{to being}} {{associated}} with <b>stressors,</b> has many physiological, psychological, emotional, growths, and spiritual potential consequences. However, {{few studies have been}} conducted about identifying the <b>stressors.</b> Therefore, the objective {{of the study was to}} determine patients’ perceptions of <b>stressors</b> associated with coronary artery bypass surgery. Methods: In this descriptive study during the two-month investigation, qualified patients for participation in the study (68 persons) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery on the third to fifth postoperative day were selected and with using of Revised Cardiac Surgery <b>Stressors</b> Scale (RCSSS), interpersonal, intrapersonal, and extra personal <b>stressors</b> were determined. Results: The findings showed that intrapersonal <b>stressors</b> are perceived more than interpersonal and extra personal <b>stressors</b> by patients. In the analysis of data, the highest <b>stressors</b> were "pain and discomfort", "the need to have heart surgery", "death due to illness or surgery", "being away from home and work", "having chest tube". Conclusion: In this study the intrapersonal <b>stressors</b> were perceived more than interpersonal and extra personal <b>stressors</b> by patients, which nurses should put emphasis on identification and elimination of intrapersonal <b>stressors</b> based on the needs of patients...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveaaThis study {{aimed to}} examine whether {{educational}} <b>stressors</b> and relational <b>stressors</b> are associated with burnout in medical students and to test social support as a moderator between <b>stressors</b> and burnout. MethodsaaA total of 263 medical students attending Gyeongsang National University composed the study sample. A standardized questionnaire was used to investigate educational and relational <b>stressors,</b> three dimensions of burnout, and social support of medical students.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{activities}} {{have increased the}} number of <b>stressors</b> acting on ecosystems. When multiple <b>stressors</b> act simultaneously, there is a greater probability of additive, synergistic and antagonistic effects occurring among them. Where additive and synergistic effects occur, managers may yield disproportionately large benefits where they first act upon synergies. <b>Stressors</b> act, however, at different spatial and temporal scales. Global <b>stressors</b> (e. g., ocean acidification and warming) tend to change slowly over long periods of time, although their intensity and effects are contingent on local conditions. On the other hand, local <b>stressors</b> tend to change rapidly over shorter, more defined spatial and temporal scales. Hence, local <b>stressors</b> can be subject to a greater degree of control through local management (e. g., eutrophication and overfishing) while global <b>stressors</b> are characterized by an intrinsic inertia whose effects last for decades, if not centuries. Although the reduction of carbon emissions is an international priority for managing global <b>stressors,</b> it requires international agreements and management applications that take considerable time to develop. Managers, however, may ‘buy time’ by acting on <b>stressors</b> whose governance is local (e. g., reducing nutrient input) and are known to synergize with global <b>stressors</b> (e. g., enriched CO 2). Such local actions may potentially disrupt synergies with the more slowly changing global <b>stressors</b> that can only be reduced over longer time scales...|$|R

As per Carver, these efforts can focus on problem management or emotional regulation. Dysfunctional strategies are possible, too. Studies found that a high caregiver burden often comes along with dysfunctional strategies what means activities which don’t solve the problem but worsen it (e.g. self-criticism, substance abuse).|$|E

However, {{the role of}} individual differences in stress appraisal in shaping the function of challenging <b>stressors</b> and work outcomes has been rarely discussed. Drawing on the individual differences perspective, the authors propose that employees higher in challenge appraisal {{are more likely to}} have challenging <b>stressors</b> and are more responsive to such <b>stressors</b> to have a higher positive affect at work. Results obtained from 117 employees supported the hypotheses. The results indicated that challenge appraisal is positively related to challenging <b>stressors.</b> In addition, challenging <b>stressors</b> has a positive association with positive affect at work when challenge appraisal is high but has a null association when challenge appraisal is low. The findings suggest that challenging <b>stressors</b> does not necessarily bring positive work outcomes as suggested in past studies and highlight the importance of considering dispositional tendency in stress appraisal when looking into the function of challenging <b>stressors</b> and work outcomes...|$|R

Methods: During a two month investigation, qualified nurses (n = 68) of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass were selected on the third to fifth day after surgery. With the use of Revised Cardiac Surgery <b>Stressors</b> Scale (RCSSS), interpersonal, intrapersonal and extrapersonal <b>stressors</b> were determined. Results: The findings showed that the most interpersonal, intrapersonal and extrapersonal <b>stressors</b> were; “the need to have cardiac surgery”, “death due to illness or surgery”, “needing assistance with various activities”, “doctors and nurses discussing about other patients”, “having chest tube” and “Payment of hospital and medical bills”. Conclusion: Identification of <b>stressors</b> in patients with coronary artery bypass graft helps nurses in taking better care of them. It would make a better ground for the officials and practitioners towards managing the <b>stressors,</b> especially interpersonal and extrapersonal <b>stressors.</b> Thereby patients are helped to cope with <b>stressors...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Psychological <b>stressors</b> might {{contribute}} to the severity of chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis by dysregulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of cortisol, {{a key component of}} the HPA axis, in reaction to psychological stress in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: Serum cortisol, clinical indicators of disease severity (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and self-report measures of daily <b>stressors</b> were measured monthly for 6 months in 62 patients with psoriasis. RESULTS: In addition to the previous findings in this sample showing that peak levels of daily <b>stressors</b> predicted an increase in disease severity a month later, the peak levels of daily <b>stressors</b> were also significantly associated with a lower cortisol level. Moreover, patients who persistently experienced higher levels of daily <b>stressors</b> had lower mean cortisol levels than patients who experienced lower levels of daily <b>stressors.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that daily <b>stressors</b> influence disease outcome in patients with psoriasis by affecting cortisol levels at moments of high stress. Furthermore, patients with persistently high levels of <b>stressors</b> seem to have a specific psychophysiological profile of lowered cortisol levels and may be particularly vulnerable to the influence of <b>stressors</b> on their psoriasis...|$|R
