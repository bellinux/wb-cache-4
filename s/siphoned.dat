40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>siphon</b> browsing on the feeding behaviour {{and growth of}} Macoma balthica, a deposit-feeding bivalve, was studied in three manipulative experiments. Browsing was simulated by removing part of the inhalant <b>siphon</b> with scissors, or studied by exposing the bivalves to shrimps (Crangon crangon). Smaller <b>siphons</b> resulted in a reduction of the sediment surface area that could be grazed, {{and a decrease in}} <b>siphon</b> activity in M. balthica. Disturbance of the <b>siphons</b> by shrimps also reduced <b>siphon</b> activity. <b>Siphons</b> were reduced in size in the presence of shrimps. Immunological analyses of the stomachs of C. crangon identified this species as a consumer of <b>siphon</b> tips. Growth of M. balthica was negatively influenced by <b>siphon</b> browsing, probably due to three interactive factors: extra energy needed for <b>siphon</b> regeneration, less time available for feeding, and a smaller area from which to collect food. Burying depth was reduced in M. balthica with smaller <b>siphons.</b> However, individuals with similar <b>siphon</b> size were buried less deep in the sediment when not exposed to <b>siphon</b> browsing, suggesting an immediate response to absence of browsers...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>siphon</b> weight {{limits the}} {{elongation}} of the <b>siphon</b> of deposit-feeding benthic bivalves under natural conditions. Were {{this to be}} so, it would imply that foraging and predator avoidance place conflicting demands on these animals, since {{an increase in the}} feeding radius on the surface would be associated with a decrease in the burying depth, and vice versa. The paper presents methods with which to measure <b>siphon</b> length and equations to transform <b>siphon</b> weight to <b>siphon</b> length in two benthic bivalves, Scrobicularia plana and Macoma balthica. Relatively heavy <b>siphons</b> are longer, but also thicker, than lightweight ones. We conclude that most individual bivalves stretch their <b>siphons</b> fully while feeding. However, bivalves with heavy <b>siphons</b> keep part of the <b>siphon</b> in reserve within the shell. <b>Siphon</b> cropping therefore results in an immediate reduction in <b>siphon</b> length, unless the <b>siphon</b> is heavy and a reserve is available. The feeding radius of M. balthica and S. plana is a linear function of shell size. S. plana use half of their <b>siphon</b> length to feed on the surface and the other half to bury themselves, but if the <b>siphon</b> weight is below average, the proportion extended over the surface decreases with <b>siphon</b> size. However, among the animals with a short <b>siphon,</b> those with a good body condition take no risks and live as deeply as possible. A comparison between species reveals that the weight of the extended inhalant <b>siphon</b> per cm amounts, on average, to 0. 6 % of the total body weight...|$|R

To supplement this pool, Berger also continued recruiting for the SS-TV and police regiments, which were not under Wehrmacht control, and were still below the strengths approved by Hitler. This continued to create friction between the Wehrmacht and SS, as potential Wehrmacht recruits were <b>siphoned</b> off to forces under Himmler's control.

5|$|Upon formation, the {{division}} drew its personnel from all Australian states {{and consisted of}} three four-battalion infantry brigades—the 9th, 10th and the 11th—and a number of supporting elements including engineers, artillery and medical personnel. Only rudimentary initial training was undertaken before elements of {{the division}} began the embarkation process in May and June 1916 as they were moved to the United Kingdom, where the individual sub units concentrated for the first time, received arms and other equipment and began the task of undertaking further training at Lark Hill, on Salisbury Plain. In July the division's artillery component was formed, consisting of three batteries of 18-pounders and one 4.5inch howitzer battery. The process of raising and training took some time and consequently the division was not transferred to France until mid November 1916. Prior to this, however, the division endured proposals to break it up to provide reinforcements to the other four Australian divisions that were already in France. Although these threats passed, in early September 1916, following losses around Pozières, almost 3,000 men from the 3rd Division were transferred. Throughout October it seemed likely that further drafts would be <b>siphoned</b> away from the division, however, this did not occur and in early November two divisional exercises were undertaken. Finally, on 21 November 1916, the 3rd Division crossed the English Channel and arrived in France.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{numerical}} simulation study for water conveyance of inverted <b>siphon</b> on water security {{is of great}} significance. The inverted <b>siphon</b> is thin-walled concrete structure, and cracks will appear according to temperature loads. Generally speaking, the temperature difference between {{the internal and external}} and the basic difference of temperature are considered as the main factors influencing the cracks. Static analysis of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure is the foundation of design and construction, includes the calculation and analysis of stress and strain of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure. The stress and strain of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure not only are the index of inverted <b>siphon</b> structure rigidity, but also are the basis of identifying whether the inverted <b>siphon</b> structural damage occur. Using the basic theories of temperature and stress field of concrete, this paper adopts 3 d finite element to simulate and calculate Shaba inverted <b>siphon,</b> and gets stress and deformation distribution of inverted <b>siphon</b> during operation period. The results show that inverted <b>siphon</b> structure is economic and reasonable, can meet the stiffness requirement, and can provide beneficial reference to the design and construction for other inverted <b>siphon</b> structure.

5|$|It {{is clear}} {{nevertheless}} that the gradual {{decline of the}} indigenous Byzantine naval power in the 10th and 11th centuries, when it was eclipsed by the Italian city-states, chiefly Venice and later Genoa, was of great long-term significance for {{the fate of the}} Empire. The sack of the Fourth Crusade, which shattered the foundations of the Byzantine state, was {{due in large part to}} the absolute defencelessness of the Empire at sea. This process was initiated by Byzantium itself in the 9th century, when the Italians were increasingly employed by the Empire to compensate for its own naval weakness in the West. The Italian republics also profited from their role as intermediaries in the trade between the Empire and Western Europe, marginalizing the Byzantine merchant marine, which in turn had adverse effects on the availability of Byzantine naval forces. Inevitably however, as the Italian republics slowly moved away from the Byzantine orbit, they began pursuing their own policies, and from the late 11th century on, they turned from protection of the Empire to exploitation and sometimes outright plunder, heralding the eventual financial and political subjugation of Byzantium to their interests. The absence of a strong navy was certainly keenly felt by the Byzantines at the time, as the comments of Kekaumenos illustrate. Strong and energetic emperors like Manuel Komnenos, and later Michael VIII Palaiologos, could revive Byzantine naval power, but even after landing heavy strokes against the Venetians, they merely replaced them with the Genoese and the Pisans. Trade thus remained in Latin hands, its profits continued to be <b>siphoned</b> off from the Empire, and after their deaths, their achievements quickly evaporated. After 1204, and with the brief exception of Michael VIII's reign, the fortunes of the now small Byzantine navy were more or less tied to the shifting alliances with the Italian maritime republics.|$|E
5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} {{version of}} Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, {{preceded by a}} series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. From its debut, the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart. The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning, but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon,Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1984–85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek. The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy! <b>siphoned</b> ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history, and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011. The program has become America's longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version of The Price Is Right which began airing in 1972. The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAscidians have {{powerful}} capacities for regeneration but {{the underlying}} mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we examine oral <b>siphon</b> regeneration in the solitary ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Following amputation, the oral <b>siphon</b> rapidly reforms oral pigment organs (OPO) at its distal margin prior to slower regeneration of proximal <b>siphon</b> parts. The early stages of oral <b>siphon</b> reformation include cell proliferation and re-growth of the <b>siphon</b> nerves, although the neural complex (adult brain and associated organs) is not required for regeneration. Young animals reform OPO more rapidly after amputation than old animals indicating that regeneration is age dependent. UV irradiation, microcautery, and cultured <b>siphon</b> explant experiments indicate that OPOs are replaced as independent units based on local differentiation of progenitor cells within the <b>siphon,</b> rather than by cell migration from a distant source in the body. The typical pattern of eight OPOs and <b>siphon</b> lobes is restored with fidelity after distal amputation of the oral <b>siphon,</b> but as many as 16 OPOs and lobes can be reformed following proximal amputation near the <b>siphon</b> base. Thus, the pattern of OPO regeneration is determined by cues positioned along the proximal distal axis of the oral <b>siphon.</b> A model is presented in which columns of <b>siphon</b> tissue along the proximal–distal axis below pre-existing OPO are responsible for reproducing the normal OPO pattern during regeneration.

50|$|There are {{two leading}} {{theories}} about how <b>siphons</b> cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity. The traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid {{down on the}} exit side of the <b>siphon</b> resulted in reduced pressure {{at the top of}} the <b>siphon.</b> Then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir, up into the reduced pressure {{at the top of the}} <b>siphon,</b> like in a barometer or drinking straw, and then over. However, it has been demonstrated that <b>siphons</b> can operate in a vacuum and to heights exceeding the barometric height of the liquid. Consequently, the cohesion tension theory of <b>siphon</b> operation has been advocated, where the liquid is pulled over the <b>siphon</b> in a way similar to the chain model. It need not be one theory or the other that is correct, but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure. The atmospheric pressure with gravity theory obviously cannot explain <b>siphons</b> in vacuum, where there is no significant atmospheric pressure. But the cohesion tension with gravity theory cannot explain CO2 gas <b>siphons,</b> <b>siphons</b> working despite bubbles, and the flying droplet <b>siphon,</b> where gases do not exert significant pulling forces, and liquids not in contact cannot exert a cohesive tension force.|$|R
