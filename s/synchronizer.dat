25|$|The first British <b>synchronizer</b> gear {{was built}} by the {{manufacturer}} of the machine-gun {{for which it was}} designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers'. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this was not because it was a copy (as is sometimes reported): it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. The fact is that both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine oil pump spindle, as in Saulnier's design; a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally, on the port side of the forward fuselage, where it was readily accessible for adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Berthold {{had often}} flown a Pfalz D.III in {{preference}} to the Albatros D.V. In May 1918, the new Fokker D.VII entered service. Berthold borrowed {{one of the}} new machines from Jagdgeschwader 1 for a surrepitious test flight. He liked its lightness on the controls, remarking hopefully that he could even fly it with his damaged right arm. On the morning of 28 May, he mounted a brand-new Fokker D.VII and for the first time, led his air wing into combat. Although it was a ground support mission, he took the opportunity to score his 29th victory. The following day, he downed two more enemy aircraft, despite a malfunctioning gun <b>synchronizer</b> that nearly shot away his own propeller and caused a crash-landing. Berthold's drug addiction did not handicap him in the air. Georg von Hantelmann, one of his pilots, noted that despite his undiminished martial skills, his morphine addiction made him temperamentally erratic. Nevertheless, his subordinates remained loyal to him.|$|E

[...] The German high command was protective of the <b>synchronizer</b> system, instructing pilots not to venture over enemy territory in case they were forced down and the secret revealed, but the basic principles involved were already common knowledge, and {{by the middle of}} 1916 several Allied synchronizers were already available in quantity.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>synchronizer</b> {{acts as an}} {{external}} trigger for both the camera(s) and the laser. [...] While analogue systems {{in the form of}} a photosensor, rotating aperture and a light source have been used in the past, most systems in use today are digital. [...] Controlled by a computer, the <b>synchronizer</b> can dictate the timing of each frame of the CCD camera's sequence in conjunction with the firing of the laser to within 1 ns precision. [...] Thus the time between each pulse of the laser and the placement of the laser shot in reference to the camera's timing can be accurately controlled. [...] Knowledge of this timing is critical as it is needed to determine the velocity of the fluid in the PIV analysis. Stand-alone electronic synchronizers, called digital delay generators, offer variable resolution timing from as low as 250 ps to as high as several ms. With up to eight channels of synchronized timing, they offer the means to control several flash lamps and Q-switches as well as provide for multiple camera exposures.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{synchronized}} guns of the 1915–1917 period had {{a rate of}} fire in {{the region}} of 400 rounds per minute; at this comparatively leisurely rate of fire a <b>synchronizer</b> can be geared down and rendered fairly reliable. To control a faster gun, with (say) a cyclic rate of 800 or 1,000 rounds a minute, a gear had to work faster, making it more liable to failure. The intricate mechanism of a mechanical linkage system, especially of the [...] "push rod" [...] type, tended to shake itself to pieces when driven at this sort of speed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Special <b>synchronizers</b> {{exist for}} special clock {{relations}} such as mesochronous, multi-synchronous and ratiochronous clocks, while variants of N-flip-flop <b>synchronizers</b> are employed when the communicating clocks are asynchronous. N-flip-flop <b>synchronizers</b> {{are also used}} in all special cases, {{at the cost of}} longer latency than when using specialized <b>synchronizers.</b> The reliability of N-flip-flop <b>synchronizers</b> is expressed by the standard MTBF formula. This paper describes cases of coherent clocks that suffer of a higher failure rate than predicted by the MTBF formula; that formula assumes uniform distribution of data edges across the sampling clock cycle, but coherent clocking leads to drastically different situations. Coherent clocks are defined as derived from a common source, and phase distributions are discussed. The effect of jitter is analyzed, and a new MTBF expression is developed. An optimal condition for maximizing MTBF and a circuit that can adaptively achieve that optimum are described. We show a case study of metastability failure in a real 40 nm circuit and describe guidelines used to increase its MTBF based on the rules derived in the paper.

2500|$|Typical PIV {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} a camera (normally a digital camera with a CCD chip in modern systems), a strobe or laser with an optical arrangement to limit the physical region illuminated (normally a cylindrical lens to convert a light beam to a line), a <b>synchronizer</b> {{to act as an}} external trigger for control of the camera and laser, the seeding particles and the fluid under investigation. A fiber optic cable or liquid light guide may connect the laser to the lens setup. [...] PIV software is used to post-process the optical images.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>synchronizer</b> {{controls}} the timing between image exposures and also permits image pairs {{to be acquired}} at various times along the flow. For accurate PIV analysis, it is ideal that {{the region of the}} flow that is of interest should display an average particle displacement of about 8 pixels. [...] This is a compromise between a longer time spacing which would allow the particles to travel further between frames, making it harder to identify which interrogation window traveled to which point, and a shorter time spacing, which could make it overly difficult to identify any displacement within the flow.|$|E
