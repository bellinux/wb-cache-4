40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the process of creative thinking in X class in solving geometry problems based on Wallas stages reviewed by student’s Adversity Quotient (AQ). This study used a qualitative descriptive method. Subjects were determined through purposive sampling which is based on several criteria, namely: (1) in the category of adversity quotient to be analyzed (climber, camper, quitter) and (2) have good communication skills (based on information from the teacher). Finally, subjects were taken for this research is 1 person for each category of AQ. The techniques of collection the data was done by doing task-based interview. The task in this research is Test of Problem Solving. The data analysis techniques include three activities there are classification, data presentation and conclusion. Data validation was done by time triangulation and perseverance. Based on the results of data analysis, it can be concluded that: (1) Stages of climber’s creative thinking process in solving geometry problems are: (a) In the preparation stage, climber understood the given problem in a relatively short time, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to convey the information with its own language, (b) In the incubation stage, climber was doing reflection activity, (c) In the illumination stage, <b>student</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to specify the idea, (d) In the verification stage, climber were trying to determine the size by trial and error, the <b>student</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to determine the size fluently, student didn’t give up eventhough student did some mistakes in defining the size; (2) Stages of camper’s creative thinking process in solving geometry problems are: (a) In the preparation stage, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to understand the problem well with a relatively short time, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to convey the information by its own language, (b) In the incubation stage, camper was doing reflection activities, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> thinking of similar problems are encountered in daily lives, (c) In the illumination stage, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to specify an idea and trying to imagine a real problem, (d) In the verification stage, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> trying to determine the size by trial and error in a way student chose one side-size and then determine the other size, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to determine the size fluently; (3) Stages of quitter’s creative thinking process in solving geometry problems are: (a) In the preparation stage, quitter <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to understand the given problem, but student relatively needs more time than students camper and climber, when student passed the information from the problem, quitter still speaks with a language problem, (b) In the incubation stage, quitter was doing reflection activities, but in hindsight was not too mean, (c) In the Illumination stage, quitter decide the ideas will be realized from prior knowledge, there are no new ideas, (d) In the verification stage, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to determine the size by finding the factors of a given volume, the scheme used during the test of problem solving, <b>student</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to determine the size fluently.
