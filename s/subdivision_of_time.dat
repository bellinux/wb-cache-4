40|$|Summary This paper {{constructs}} {{an adaptive}} algorithm for ordi-nary differential equations and analyzes its asymptotic behavior as the error tolerance parameter tends to zero. An adaptive algorithm, {{based on the}} error indicators and successive <b>subdivision</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> steps, is proven to stop with the optimal number, N, of steps up to a prob-lem independent factor defined in the algorithm. A version of the algorithm with decreasing tolerance also stops with the total num-ber of steps, including all refinement levels, bounded by O(N). The alternative version with constant tolerance stops with O(N logN) total steps. The global error is bounded by the tolerance parameter asymptotically as the tolerance tends to zero. For a p-th order accu-rate method the optimal number of adaptive steps {{is proportional to the}} p-th root of the L 1 p+ 1 quasi-norm of the error density, while th...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{assumption}} of independence among successive software failures {{is common to}} the most of software reliability models (see [1] for recent surveys). Its validity can be affected {{by a variety of}} operational conditions, such as whether the input sequences exhibit independence, the extent to which internal state of a software has been affected, whether or not operations undertaken for execution resumption involve state cleaning. Motivated by the fact that independence assumption can be easily violated in many practical applications we have recently developed a modeling framework, based on Markov renewal processes, which accounts for the correlation among successive failures. In this short paper we demonstrate its use for software operational life. The operation of software is divided into a sequence of runs by <b>subdivision</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> associated with some user [...] oriented tasks.

The division of the semibreve into minims was called prolatio, that of the breve into semibreves was called tempus, and that of the longa into breves was known as modus. The division of the maxima into longas was called modus maximarum or modus maior; in the modern literature it is also sometimes called maximodus.

60|$|Now the “forever,” in the conclusion, means, for {{any length}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that can be supposed; but in the premises, “ever” does not mean any length of time; it means any number <b>of</b> <b>subdivisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> It means that we may divide a {{thousand}} feet by ten, and that quotient again by ten, and so on as often as we please; that there never needs be {{an end to the}} <b>subdivisions</b> <b>of</b> the distance, nor consequently to those <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> in which it is performed. But an unlimited number <b>of</b> <b>subdivisions</b> may be made of that which is itself limited. The argument proves no other infinity of duration than may be embraced within five minutes. As long as the five minutes are not expired, what remains of them may be divided by ten, and again by ten, as often as we like, which is perfectly compatible with their being only five minutes altogether. It proves, in short, that to pass through this finite space requires a time which is infinitely divisible, but not an infinite time; the confounding of which distinction Hobbes had already seen to be the gist of the fallacy.|$|R

There is evidence that catastrophic meteorite impacts played a role in demarcating the differences between the eras.|$|R
50|$|This period {{consists}} of the Paleocene, Eocene, and Oligocene epochs. The end of the Paleocene (55.5/54.8 Mya) was marked by the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, {{one of the most}} significant periods of global change during the Cenozoic, which upset oceanic and atmospheric circulation and led to the extinction of numerous deep-sea benthic foraminifera and on land, a major turnover in mammals. The terms 'Paleogene System' (formal) and 'lower Tertiary System' (informal) are applied to the rocks deposited during the 'Paleogene Period'. The somewhat confusing terminology seems to be due to attempts to deal with the comparatively fine <b>subdivisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> possible in the relatively recent geologic past, for which more details are preserved. By dividing the Tertiary Period into two periods instead of directly into five epochs, the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of 'periods' of the preceding Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras.|$|R

As a first result, we prove that, as the sampling periods tend to zero, the optimal sampled-data controls converge pointwise to the optimal permanent control. Then, we extend the classical Riccati theory to the sampled-data control framework, by developing two different approaches: the first one uses a recently established version of the Pontryagin maximum principle for optimal sampled-data control problems, and the second one uses an adequate version of the dynamic programming principle. In turn, we obtain a closed-loop expression for optimal sampled-data controls of linear-quadratic problems...|$|R

40|$|Rhythmic {{music has}} been {{hypothesized}} {{to be involved in}} the genesis of human nature. On one side, rhythmic music seems to support the perception <b>of</b> <b>time</b> through the <b>subdivision</b> <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> continuum by the musical beat or pulse (Merker, 2000). On the other, this kind of music makes the next beat in a sequence perfectly predictable and that allows two or more individuals to synchronize their movements and their voices: in this way rhythmic music is the basis for synchronous chorusing and dancing. The human behavior characterized by chorusing and dancing with fast and rhythmic music was always associated to tribal rituals in different periods of human history. A mysterious linkage connects synchronized chorusing in lower animals (frogs, cricket, cicada, birds) with synchronized chorusing in humans, the only species among mammals that maintained this ancestral behavior. The use of rhythmic and fast music before hunting, fighting and during religious rituals could have represented the way to obtain changes in awareness and mental status, emotional processing and pain threshold.

40|$|In high latitudes, recent {{research}} has demonstrated that both thermo-erosion and temperature dependence influence sediment release into fluvial systems. An analysis of proglacial suspended sediment concentration (SSC) dynamics is presented for three glacierized basins: cold-based Austre Br?ggerbreen (Svalbard), polythermal Midre Lov?nbreen (Svalbard) and polythermal Glacier B 28 (Bylot Island). The temporal variation in processes dominating SSC patterns is assessed using stepwise multivariate regression following the <b>subdivision</b> <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> series. Partitioning <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> series is achieved through principal components and change point analyses. The regression models use discharge and surrogate predictor variables to model SSC, while improvements are made by using air temperature and radiation terms as independent variables. Comparisons are drawn between two sets of models with contrasting subseasonal division. By interpretation of the regression model characteristics, temporal changes in physical processes are implied over the course <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> periods. Numerical analyses suggest there is a trend for changes between fluvial, glacial and periglacial factors forcing responses in SSC. Therefore, it is conjectured that glaciofluvial sediment transfer at high latitudes is influenced by periglacial processes and conditions. This has implications for the predictions of fluvial sediment loads in a changing environment, and the use of sedimentary records for environmental reconstruction. Peer reviewe...|$|R
