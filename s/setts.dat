5|$|In Manhattan, a {{monument}} honoring him was installed on Raoul Wallenberg Walk, named in his honor, {{across from the}} headquarters of the United Nations. The Swedish consulate commissioned the piece, created by Swedish sculptor Gustav Kraitz. The sculpture, Hope, is a replica of Wallenberg’s briefcase, a sphere, five pillars of black granite, and paving stones (<b>setts)</b> which were formerly used {{on the streets of the}} Budapest ghetto. There is also Wallenberg Forest in Riverdale, Bronx, established in 1990 and named Wallenberg Forest in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The Paris–Roubaix {{is famous}} for rough terrain and cobblestones, or pavé (<b>setts),</b> being, with the Tour of Flanders, E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem, one of the cobbled classics. It {{has been called the}} Hell of the North, a Sunday in Hell (also the title of a film about the 1976 race), the Queen of the Classics or la Pascale: the Easter race. Since 1977, the winner of Paris–Roubaix has {{received}} a sett (cobble stone) as part of his prize.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on cobbles (<b>setts).</b> He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E
25|$|Drummond Street is {{a street}} just outside Edinburgh's Old Town, near the famous Royal Mile and Holyrood. The street connects the South Bridge (A7), {{where it is}} {{opposite}} the Old College, and the Pleasance. The street is paved with granite <b>setts.</b> It is in an area with several University properties and is home to many {{students as well as}} pubs and restaurants.|$|E
25|$|Grey granite was quarried at Rubislaw quarry {{for more}} than 300 years, and used for paving <b>setts,</b> kerb and {{building}} stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the Houses of Parliament and Waterloo Bridge in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971. The current owners have begun pumping 40 years of rain water from the quarry {{with the aim of}} developing a heritage centre on the site.|$|E
25|$|A {{road surface}} or {{pavement}} is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, {{such as a}} road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite <b>setts</b> were extensively used, but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic. Today, permeable paving methods are beginning {{to be used for}} low-impact roadways and walkways.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suggested}} that one method to avoid endangering {{the public would}} be for shooters to stand over <b>setts</b> and shoot badgers near the entrances. However, a report to Defra by The Game Conservancy Trust (2006) indicated that a major problem with shooting near the sett is that wounded badgers are very likely to bolt underground, preventing a second shot to ensure the animal is killed. Under these conditions the first shot must cause the badger to collapse on the spot, limiting the choice of target sites to the spine, neck or head.|$|E
25|$|The bandstand's {{maintenance}} {{had been}} neglected by Lambeth Council for thirty years, and by 2001 {{it was thought}} to be in danger of collapse and had to be shored up with scaffolding for five years. In 2005–2006, a full restoration of the bandstand and surrounding landscape took place, partly funded by an £895,000 lottery grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund matched by £300,000 from Lambeth Council and a further £100,000 from local fundraising efforts and the proceeds of the Ben and Jerry's Summer Sundae event held on the Common. The drainage bund around the bandstand was restored with granite <b>setts</b> during the summer of 2011 at a cost of £12,000 to resolve design faults in the earlier works.|$|E
25|$|A trial trip to Mapperley {{was made}} on 1 May on car 57. Apparently {{it was a very}} hot day and the driver of the car said that much sand was needed to {{overcome}} the stickiness of the tar, which had melted and overflowed onto the rails from between the <b>setts.</b> The steepest gradient of the section was 1 in 11. Major Pringle, the Board of Trade inspector, duly inspected the approved route on 6 May and public service commenced a week later, on 13 May. This service operated via the Market Place to Trent Bridge every 12 minutes, alternating with a short working between Alexandra Park and Trent Bridge every 12 minutes. The fare between the Market Place and Mapperley was 2d., with intermediate 1d. stages. At first there was a stop on the outward journey at Cranmer Street, but this was discontinued early in 1903 because of the difficulty of restarting the cars, the hill being at its steepest at this point.|$|E
500|$|There {{is also a}} {{possible}} ecological association between the P.impudicus and badger (Meles meles) <b>setts.</b> Fruiting bodies are commonly clustered in a zone [...] from the entrances; the <b>setts</b> typically harbor a regularly-available supply of badger cadavers [...] the mortality rate of cubs is high, and death {{is more likely to}} occur within the sett. The fruiting of large numbers of stinkhorns attracts a high population of blowflies (Calliphora and Lucilla breed on carrion); this ensures the rapid elimination of badger carcasses, removing a potential source of disease to the badger colony. The laxative effect of the gleba reduces the distance from the fruiting body to where the spores are deposited, ensuring the continued production of high densities of stinkhorns.|$|E
500|$|The Close {{is about}} [...] long, and paved with <b>setts.</b> Its width is tapered by [...] {{to make it}} look longer when viewed from the main {{entrance}} nearest the cathedral. When viewed from the other end it looks shorter. By the nineteenth century the buildings were reported to be in a poor state of repair, and part of the hall was being used as a malt house. Repairs have since been carried out including the construction of Shrewsbury House to replace buildings damaged in a fire.|$|E

Can lay the pieces or blanks upon the die quite true and without care or practice and as fast as wanted. [...] Can work night and day without fatigue by two <b>setts</b> of boys. [...] The machine keeps {{an account of the}} number of pieces struck which cannot be altered from the truth by any of the persons employed. [...] The apparatus strikes an inscription upon the edge with the same blow that strikes the two faces. [...] It strikes the ground of the pieces brighter than any other coining press can do. [...] It strikes the pieces perfectly round, all of equal diameter, and exactly concentric with the edge, which cannot be done by any other machinery now in use.|$|E

2500|$|The {{central area}} was paved with stone <b>setts,</b> {{covering}} a reservoir in the centre that supplied {{water to the}} houses. In 1800 the Circus residents enclosed {{the central part of}} the open space as a garden. [...] Now, the central area is grassed over and is home to a group of old plane trees.|$|E
2500|$|Hockenhull Platts {{consists}} of three humpback bridges which are approached and connected by causeways. [...] The bridges are constructed from tooled blocks of red sandstone. The parapets are plain and are surmounted by chamfered coping stones which are joined by iron ties. [...] The carriageway is formed from a mixture of stone <b>setts</b> and cobbles.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{an animal}} has {{contracted}} bTB, the disease can be {{spread through the}} sett via the exhalations or excretions of infected individuals. Modern cattle housing, which has good ventilation, makes this process relatively less effective, but in older-style cattle housing or in badger <b>setts,</b> the disease can spread more rapidly. Badgers range widely at night, potentially spreading bTB over long distances. [...] Badgers mark their territory with urine, which can contain {{a high proportion of}} bTB bacteria. According to the RSPCA, the infection rate among badgers is 4-6%.|$|E
2500|$|GE also {{analyzed}} [...] "throttle profiles" [...] {{and found}} that pilots were changing throttle settings far more often than engineers previously expected; putting undue stress on the engines. GE also sought with the F404 a design that would avoid compressor stalls and other engine failures, and would respond quickly to control inputs; a common complaint of pilots converting from propeller planes to jets were that early turbojets were not responsive to changes in thrust input. GE executives Frederick A. Larson and Paul <b>Setts</b> also set the goal that the new engine would be smaller than the F-4's GE J79, but provide {{at least as much}} thrust, and cost half as much as the P F100 engine for the F-16.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{received}} {{information from}} a local taxi driver that the driver of a green car (either a Peugeot 405 or Vauxhall Vectra) was seen struggling with two children and driving [...] "erratically" [...] south of Soham and onto the Studlands Park housing estate in Newmarket on the evening the girls went missing. This sighting was made public on 13 August. That evening, a dog walker alerted police to two mounds of earth at Warren Hill, just outside Newmarket. The suggestion was that these might be the graves of the two missing girls. However, an overnight examination revealed that the mounds of earth were badger <b>setts,</b> and no trace of either girl was found.|$|E
2500|$|As in the 2013/14 cull, {{hundreds}} of protesters entered the culling areas {{to disrupt the}} badgers causing them to remain down their <b>setts</b> and avoiding being trapped and/or shot, or to look for injured badgers. On 9 September 2014, two saboteurs in Gloucestershire found a badger trapped in a cage with cullers nearby. The police were called and the saboteurs pointed out that under government guidelines, trapped badgers should be released {{if there was a}} risk of interference from a third party. The sabateur organisation, [...] "Stop the Cull" [...] said police [...] "did the right thing" [...] and freed the badger. Gloucestershire police confirmed the standoff, which it said was resolved peacefully – adding the decision to release the badger was made by a contractor working for the cull operator.|$|E
2500|$|The s-passive of {{the perfect}} participle is regular in Swedish both in the real passive and in other functions, e.g. vårt företag har funnits sedan 1955 [...] "our company has existed since 1955", bilen har <b>setts</b> ute på Stockholms gator [...] "the car has {{been seen in the}} streets of S." [...] In Danish, the real passive has only periphrastic forms in the perfect: bilen er blevet set ude på Stockholms gader. In the lexicalised and {{reciprocal}} passives, on the other hand, we find a combination of the verb have and the s-passive preterite: e.g. mødtes [...] "have met", har fandtes [...] "have existed" [...] etc. (but strangely enough, the irregular har set(e)s [...] "have seen each other" [...] is much more common than har sås, which is considered substandard).|$|E
2500|$|The {{organism}} {{that causes}} bTB, Mycobacterium bovis, {{was discovered in}} 1882, but it took until 1950 for compulsory tests for the disease to be brought in. A programme of test-and-slaughter began and seemed successful. [...] Until the 1980s, badger culling in the UK was undertaken {{in the form of}} gassing. By 1960 it was thought that bTB might have been eradicated in the UK, until 1971 when a new population of tuberculous badgers was located in [...] Gloucestershire. Subsequent experiments showed that bTB can be spread from badgers to cattle, and some farmers tried to cull badgers on their land. [...] Wildlife protection groups lobbied Parliament which responded by passing the Badgers Act 1973, making it an offence to attempt to kill, take, injure badgers or interfere with their <b>setts</b> without a licence. These laws are now contained in the Protection of Badgers Act 1992.|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st century Guildford {{still has}} a High Street paved with granite <b>setts</b> often {{referred}} to as cobbles, {{and is one of the}} most expensive places to buy property in the UK outside London. The town has a general street market held on Fridays and Saturdays. A farmers' market is usually held on the first Tuesday of each month. There is a Tourist Information Office, Guided Walks and various hotels including the historic Angel Hotel which long served as a coaching stop on the main London to Portsmouth stagecoach route. [...] Guildford was voted the 9th best place to live in Britain in 2006 but slipped to 12th position in 2007, [...] "largely due to the pollution produced by the numerous cars found on the roads". Guildford is the most attractive and safe shopping destination in the UK, according to the Eve Prime Retail Survey 2004 and ranked 27th in the country overall.|$|E
2500|$|The {{branch is}} {{essentially}} intact but the track was lifted {{in the mid}} 1960s. The original purpose of the reinstatement {{was to provide a}} carriage shed to house the restored carriages of Railway Vehicle Preservations Ltd and shelter them from the elements. In 2006 they applied for planning permission for the shed; this was rejected due to badger <b>setts</b> discovered on site. The reinstatement of the line is going ahead with ballast being donated from the quarry it served. The total length being reinstated is [...] It is intended a halt will be built at the quarry end, offering train rides up the line to add an extra attraction to the Great Central Railway, with services either run by a DMU or else a push-pull fitted steam/diesel locomotive. The line is now fully ballasted for half of its length with tracklaying well underway. Tracklaying has recently passed through the Wood Lane bridge and officially entered Mountsorrel Parish.|$|E
2500|$|The {{neighborhood}} is distinguished by streets that are [...] "off the grid", being set {{at an angle}} to the other streets in Manhattan. These roads were laid out in an 18th-century grid plan, approximately parallel or perpendicular to the Hudson, long before the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 which created the main street grid plan for later parts of the city. Even streets that were given numbers in the 19th century to make them nominally part of the grid can be idiosyncratic, at best. West 4th Street, formerly Asylum Street, crosses West 10th, 11th and 12th Streets, ending at an intersection with West 13th Street. Heading north on Greenwich Street, West 12th Street is separated by three blocks from Little West 12th Street, which in turn is one block south of West 13th Street. Further, some of the smaller east-west residential streets are paved with <b>setts</b> (often confused with cobblestones), particularly in Far West Village and the Meatpacking District.|$|E

60|$|The voice made Lilly peer {{between the}} people. And {{sitting on the}} granite <b>setts,</b> being hauled up by a burly policeman, he saw our {{acquaintance}} Aaron, very pale {{in the face and}} a little dishevelled.|$|E
60|$|From a {{criminal}} point of view, Ajmir {{is not a}} pleasant place. The Native States lie all round and about it, and portions of the district are ten miles off, Native State-locked on every side. Thus the criminal, who may be a burglarious Meena lusting for the money bags of the <b>Setts,</b> or a Peshawari down south on a cold weather tour, has his plan of campaign much simplified.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} {{he was a little}} worse, if anything. The doctor knew {{there was nothing to be}} done. At evening he gave the patient a calomel pill. It was rather strong, and Aaron had a bad time. His burning, parched, {{poisoned}} inside was twisted and torn. Meanwhile carts banged, porters shouted, all the hell of the market went on outside, away down on the cobble <b>setts.</b> But this time the two men did not hear.|$|E

60|$|And then, one cold grey {{afternoon}} in early April, {{a man in}} a black overcoat and a bowler hat, walking uncertainly. Lilly had risen and was just retiring out of the chill, damp air. For some reason he lingered to watch the figure. The man was walking east. He stepped rather insecurely off the pavement, and wavered across the <b>setts</b> between the wheels of the standing vans. And suddenly he went down. Lilly could not see him on the ground, but he saw some van-men go forward, and he saw one of them pick up the man's hat.|$|E
60|$|The {{two couples}} went asunder, Ursula {{clinging}} to Birkin's arm. When {{they had gone}} some distance, she glanced back and saw the young man going beside the full, easy young woman. His trousers sank over his heels, he moved {{with a sort of}} slinking evasion, more crushed with odd self-consciousness now he had the slim old arm-chair to carry, his arm over the back, the four fine, square tapering legs swaying perilously near the granite <b>setts</b> of the pavement. And yet he was somewhere indomitable and separate, like a quick, vital rat. He had a queer, subterranean beauty, repulsive too.|$|E
60|$|The old market-square was {{not very}} large, a mere bare patch of granite <b>setts,</b> usually with a few fruit-stalls under a wall. It was in a poor quarter of the town. Meagre houses stood down one side, there was a hosiery factory, a great blank with myriad oblong windows, at the end, a street of little shops with {{flagstone}} pavement down the other side, and, for a crowning monument, the public baths, of new red brick, with a clock-tower. The people who moved about seemed stumpy and sordid, the air seemed to smell rather dirty, {{there was a sense}} of many mean streets ramifying off into warrens of meanness. Now and again a great chocolate-and-yellow tramcar ground round a difficult bend under the hosiery factory.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't. I shall {{catch the}} seven o'clock back, I should think. Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion he'll make!

I {{wonder why they}} can't mend them, the state they're in, an' all the men as go across in that ambulance. You'd think they'd have a {{hospital}} here. The men bought the ground, and, my sirs, there'd be accidents enough to keep it going. But no, they must trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham. It's a crying shame! Oh, and the fuss he'll make! I know he will! I wonder who's with him. Barker, I s'd think. Poor beggar, he'll wish himself anywhere rather. But he'll look after him, I know. Now there's no telling how long he'll be stuck in that hospital--and WON'T he hate it! But if it's only his leg it's not so bad." ...|$|E
60|$|But the {{officials}} of Marwar {{do not call}} their country a desert. On the contrary, they administer it very scientifically and raise, as has been said, about thirty-eight lakhs from it. To {{come back from the}} influence and the possible use of the desert to more prosaic facts. Read quickly a rough record of things in modern Marwar. The old is drawn in Tod, who speaks the truth. The Maharaja's right hand {{in the work of the}} State is Maharaj Sir Pertab Singh, Prime Minister A.--D.--C. to the Prince of Wales, capable of managing the Marwari who intrigues like a--Marwari, equally capable, as has been seen, of moving in London Society, and Colonel of a newly raised crack cavalry corps. The Englishman would have liked to have seen him, but he was away in the desert somewhere, either marking a boundary or looking after a succession case. Not very long ago, as the <b>Setts</b> of Ajmir knew well, there was a State debt of fifty lakhs. This has now been changed into a surplus of three lakhs, and the revenue is growing. Also, the simple Dacoit who used to enjoy himself very pleasantly, has been put into a department, and the Thug with him.|$|E
