5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>wonder.</b> Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to {{creating}} artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, {{it was meant to}} be realistic and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>wonder</b> and familiarity for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, as opposed to the single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' movements were primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles.|$|E
25|$|Jules Verne {{remains to}} this day the most {{translated}} science fiction author {{in the world as}} well {{as one of the most}} continually reprinted and widely read French authors. Though often scientifically outdated, his Voyages still retain their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>wonder</b> that appealed to readers of his time, and still provoke an interest in the sciences among the young.|$|E
40|$|Chinese {{logic and}} Aristotelian logic are very different. The {{communication}} {{between these two}} language games is generally difficult. But, the attempt to understand the unfamiliar and the novel are commonalities of human beings. To understand different ways of thinking, effort must be made from both sides. The evidence that strongly supports this argument is the discourse between Jesuit and Chinese mathematicians in 17 th century China. They applied a common rule, Pointing Out, which make it possible, while doing geometry, for Aristotelian logic to be understood gradually by the Chinese. This dialogue {{is an excellent example}} of keeping space open for the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>wonders.</b> This is the hope for human knowledge...|$|R

25|$|Space opera is {{adventure}} {{science fiction}} set mainly or entirely {{in outer space}} or on sometimes distant planets. The conflict is heroic, and typically on a large scale. It is also used nostalgically, and modern space opera may {{be an attempt to}} recapture the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>wonder</b> of the golden age of science fiction. A pioneer of this subgenre is generally recognized to be Edward E. (Doc) Smith, with his Skylark and Lensman series. Isaac Asimov built his Foundation series along these lines. George Lucas's Star Wars series is among the most popular and famous franchises in cinematic space opera. Alastair Reynolds's Revelation Space series, Peter F. Hamilton's Void, Night's Dawn, Pandora's Star series, Stephen Hunt's Sliding Void series, Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep, A Deepness in the Sky are newer examples.|$|E

60|$|LITERARY CHARACTERISTICS.

500|$|Science fiction critic John Clute {{wrote that}} the novel [...] "generates a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>wonder</b> that is {{positively}} joyous", saying it was [...] "a romance of science".

[...] He found the writing of the human cast dull, but appreciated Forward's ability to share his fascination with the cheela and to create communications between races that lived at vastly different speeds.|$|E
500|$|A <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wonder,</b> Morrison's 1985 album, pulled {{together}} the spiritual themes contained {{in his last}} four albums, which were defined in a Rolling Stone review as: [...] "rebirth (Into the Music), deep contemplation and meditation (Common One); ecstasy and humility (Beautiful Vision); and blissful, mantra like languor (Inarticulate Speech of the Heart)." [...] The single, [...] "Tore Down a la Rimbaud" [...] was a reference to Rimbaud and an earlier bout of writer's block that Morrison had encountered in 1974. In 1985, Morrison also wrote the musical score for the movie, Lamb starring Liam Neeson.|$|E

The developers were influenced by other coming-of-age stories like Stand By Me when developing the characters and story; Krankel cited the character of Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks as the biggest outside influence on the character of Alex.|$|E

500|$|Terrance Dicks {{has felt}} that Moonbase 3 was {{ultimately}} a failure: [...] "The trouble was {{we built a}} too restrictive format for ourselves" [...] and that the series [...] "lacked a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>wonder</b> and outrageousness". [...] Academic Peter Wright has said about Moonbase 3 that its [...] "appeal to realism resulted in a disquieting sense of claustrophobia and isolation that undermined the optimism of its premise and captured the general mood of insularity felt (and often desired) in Britain in the early 1970s". [...] Moonbase 3, although not directly influential, {{can be seen as}} an antecedent of similar realistic, near-future, British space series such as Star Cops and Space Island One.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{designed the}} game like a [...] "Japanese garden", where {{they attempted to}} remove all of the game elements that did not fit with the others, so the emotions they wanted the game to evoke would come through. This minimalism is intended to make the game feel intuitive to the player, so they can explore and feel a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>wonder</b> without direct instructions. The story arc {{of the game is}} designed to explicitly follow Joseph Campbell's monomyth theory of narrative, or hero's journey, as well as to represent the stages of life, so as to enhance the emotional connection of the players as they journey together. In his D.I.C.E. speech, Chen noted that three of their 25 testers had cried upon completing the game.|$|E

[...] The song was featured on USA Todays top ten [...] "pick of the week" [...] playlist in the beginning of March 2009; the magazine's editor and music critic Brian Mansfield said, [...] "Grammy and Dove Award nominations are attracting a second look for Heath's song about seeing life's big picture."

60|$|Certainly {{the real}} secret of Wordsworth {{has never been}} better expressed. After having read and reread Mr. Pater's essay--for it {{requires}} re-reading--one returns to the poet's work with a new <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> joy and <b>wonder,</b> and with something of eager and impassioned expectation. And perhaps this might be roughly taken as the test or touchstone of the finest criticism.|$|R
2500|$|Rudolf Otto (1869–1937) was a German Protestant theologian and {{scholar of}} {{comparative}} religion. Otto's most famous work, The Idea of the Holy (published first in 1917 as Das Heilige), defines {{the concept of}} the holy as that which is numinous. Otto explained the numinous as a [...] "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self." [...] It is a mystery (Latin: mysterium tremendum) that is both fascinating (fascinans) and terrifying at the same time; A mystery that causes trembling and fascination, attempting to explain that inexpressible and perhaps supernatural emotional reaction <b>of</b> <b>wonder</b> drawing us to seemingly ordinary and/or religious experiences <b>of</b> grace. This <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> emotional <b>wonder</b> appears evident at the root of all religious experiences. Through this emotional wonder, we suspend our rational mind for non-rational possibilities.|$|R
