5|$|Lord Ashley's mother {{decided to}} move back to her native France with the children. In August 1947, she {{remarried}} ColFrançois Goussault and the newly formed family settled in Paris. The children spent the next few years <b>shuttling</b> across the English Channel to their boarding schools, Eton for Lord Ashley and Heathfield School in Ascot for his sister, Frances. Holidays were alternately spent in France or with their grandparents at the Manor House in Wimborne St Giles. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Armoured Corps, where he did his national service, on 29 June 1957. On 29 October 1958, he was placed in the emergency reserve of the 10th Royal Hussars. Lord Ashley was 22 years old when he succeeded his grandfather.|$|E
5|$|The Kongō-class battleships {{were the}} most active capital ships of the Japanese Navy during World War II, {{participating}} in most major engagements of the war. Hiei and Kirishima acted as escorts during the attack on Pearl Harbor, while Kongō and Haruna supported the invasion of Singapore. All four participated in the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal. Hiei and Kirishima were both lost during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, while Haruna and Kongō jointly bombarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The two remaining Kongō-class battleships spent most of 1943 <b>shuttling</b> between Japanese naval bases before participating in the major naval campaigns of 1944. Haruna and Kongō engaged American surface vessels during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Kongō was torpedoed by USS Sealion in November 1944, while Haruna was sunk at her moorings by air attack in Kure Naval Base in late July 1945 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E

30|$|We {{assign the}} indices 0, 1,…, 7 to the eight <b>shuttles</b> in the {{following}} way: the <b>shuttles</b> that are above the board are labelled 0, 1, 2, 3 in the clockwise order starting with the front-left <b>shuttle</b> and the <b>shuttles</b> below are labelled 4, 5, 6, 7 in a similar way. Hence <b>Shuttle</b> 0 is the front-left <b>shuttle</b> that is above the board, <b>Shuttle</b> 1 is the back-left <b>shuttle</b> above the board, <b>Shuttle</b> 2 the back-right <b>shuttle</b> above the board, and so on. The dimensions of each <b>shuttle</b> are 195 mm (in the horizontal direction) and 160 mm (in the vertical direction). The dimensions of the board are 1050 mm (in the horizontal direction) and 850 mm (in the vertical direction). We will use these constants in the model but obviously they can be replaced by other constants if the covering problem must be solved for another system. Each <b>shuttle</b> has a preferred corner, corresponding {{to the point where}} its power chain is attached to the board. For instance, the preferred corner of the front-left <b>shuttle</b> that is above (resp. below) the board is the front-left corner of this <b>shuttle.</b>|$|R
