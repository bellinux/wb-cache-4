25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} a woman may {{attribute}} a bloodstain to any external cause to which she can possibly attribute it and thus regard herself as clean.

25|$|The games' sponsor (Latin editor) usually <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> {{the images}} of {{attending}} gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (pulvinar) but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the Republican era) the dictator Manius Valerius Maximus and his descendants were granted rights to a curule chair at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing. In the 190sBC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.|$|E

25|$|Randall and Boot {{began to}} {{consider}} solutions with multiple resonators, but {{this resulted in}} very long and entirely impractical tubes. One then recalled that loops of wire with a gap in them would also resonate in the same fashion, an effect first noticed in the very earliest experiments by Heinrich Hertz. Using such loops, one could make a resonator that <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> the electron stream, instead of being wrapped around it. If the electron beam was then modified to travel in a circle instead of a straight line, it could pass {{by a series of}} such loops repeatedly. This would cause much more energy to be deposited in the cavities, while still being relatively compact.|$|E

Santiago met his future wife, Linda Mallari, when he <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> her after a 1987 Pixies show at The Rat. Mallari noted their shared Filipino ancestry and suggested they write music together. She then offered {{to join the}} Pixies, but Santiago replied, [...] "We already have a chick in the band." [...] Throughout Santiago's time with the Pixies, the two often met up to write songs and drink martinis, {{but they did not}} release any material. According to Santiago, they [...] "broke up a couple of times" [...] early in their relationship.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{was also}} fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom she cared {{for when he}} was wounded in 1915 and again in 1916, {{according}} to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a nurse who worked with Tatiana during the war. Chebotareva described how Tatiana sometimes <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> [...] "Volodia" [...] at the piano as he played a tune with one finger and talked {{to her in a}} low voice, wearing a mysterious expression on his face. Chebotareva also described how Tatiana and her sister Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia. Chebotareva felt the flirtations between the grand duchesses and the wounded officers could cause gossip and damage the girls' reputations.|$|E

500|$|At the Hoofers Club, rookie and veteran, mostly lack male tap dancers {{assembled}} to share with, steal from, and challenge each other; there, new standards were set for competition. These were {{nothing like the}} formalized buck-dancing competitions of Tammany Hall, where judges <b>sat</b> <b>beside,</b> before, and beneath the stage to evaluate the [...] clarity, speed, and presentation. The Hoofers Club comprised a more informal panel of peers, whose judgments could be cruel and mocking and were driven by an insistence on innovation. [...] "Survive or die" [...] was the credo. In an eccentric fusion of imitation and innovation, young dancers were forced to find their style and rhythmic voice. It was said that {{on the wall of}} the Hoofers Club was written: [...] "Thou shalt not copy each other's steps — Exactly." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, some {{misunderstanding}} {{brought an}} end to his formerly close friendship with the King. Seydlitz's health had been declining for years and he suffered from recurrent bouts of syphilis; in 1772, after an attack of apoplexy, he completed a couple of stays at the spa at Carlsbad to take the mineral waters. While these helped somewhat, his other activities continued without moderation, and to his detriment. A subordinate brought him two healthy Circassian beauties, whose company he enjoyed but who undoubtedly stressed his tenuous health. In August 1773, in his last illness, Frederick and Seydlitz met again at Seydlitz's home at Minkovsky near Ohlau (now Oława, Poland). The King <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> his sickbed, horrified at Seydlitz's condition, and even persuaded him to take some of his medications, but Seydlitz would not look at him; the illness had already deformed his face. [...] Eventually paralyzed, whether from another stroke or the underlying tertiary syphilis, Seydlitz died at Ohlau in Silesia in November 1773.|$|E
500|$|Khâm Đức was {{situated}} in the northern section of Quảng Tín Province, South Vietnam, in I Corps Tactical Zone. It <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> National Highway 14, which paralleled the international border with Laos, and it was surrounded by high mountains on all sides. The Special Forces Camp was named after the main village which was located about [...] to the northeast, and was constructed about mid-way along a 6,000-foot asphalt runway. Before his assassination, President Ngô Đình Diệm had used Khâm Đức as a hunting lodge, so an airfield was constructed there for Diệm's use. The Khâm Đức Special Forces Camp was under the responsibility of Detachment A-105, United States Army 5th Special Forces Group; the camp functioned as a training centre for CIDG personnel, reconnaissance of enemy movements, and combat operations. The village had 272 inhabitants, {{most of whom were}} dependents of the South Vietnamese and Montagnard CIDG soldiers. Ngok Tavak, located about [...] southwest of Khâm Đức, was an observation outpost for Detachment A-105. Following the loss of Lang Vei, Khâm Đức was the last remaining Special Forces camp adjacent to the Ho Chi Minh Trail in I Corps. In May 1968, both Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức were overrun by PAVN forces and American, Australian and South Vietnamese forces had to retreat after being defeated.|$|E

500|$|Swift was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, [...] "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'" [...] Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.|$|E

If the President, who normally kept to a tight schedule, was a few minutes late, he would literally bound into the room, pause long enough to acknowledge our presence, and herd us into the family dining room, overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue. Seating followed protocol, with the secretary of state (Dean Rusk) at the President's right, and the secretary of defense (Robert McNamara, later Clark Clifford) at his left. General Bus Wheeler (the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> the secretary of defense. I <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> Dean Rusk.

The host commented on how Hogan, who stood 6ft 7 in (201cm) and weighed 295 pounds with 24 inch biceps, actually dwarfed [...] "The Hulk". Watching the show backstage, Mary Jarrett noticed that Hogan was actually bigger than Ferrigno, who was well known at the time for having large muscles. As a result, Bollea began performing as Terry [...] "The Hulk" [...] Boulder and sometimes wrestled as Sterling Golden.|$|E
2500|$|In the Senate, Hansen <b>sat</b> <b>beside</b> his friend, Barry M. Goldwater, the Arizona Republican {{who lost}} the 1964 presidential {{election}} to Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas. He had been among those Republican senators who urged Goldwater {{to meet with}} President Nixon to inform him that there were far insufficient votes in the Senate to avoid conviction of a pending impeachment. In a 2006 interview, Hansen fondly recalled one of Goldwater's jokes: [...] Goldwater goes into a California country club that excludes Jews. The man in charge tells him that he is sorry but Jews cannot play in the club. Goldwater says, [...] "I'm only half Jewish. Can I still play nine holes?" ...|$|E

Jonathan interpreted this verse in six ways. The first refers it to David.... The fifth interpretation makes it refer to the Messiah. Come hither: approach to royal state. And eat of the bread refers to the bread of royalty; And dip thy morsel in the vinegar refers to his sufferings, as it is said, But he was wounded because of our transgressions (Isa. LIII, 5).|$|E
