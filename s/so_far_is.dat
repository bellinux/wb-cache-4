5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>is</b> that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam.

5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} {{not much more than}} a hole in the ground.
