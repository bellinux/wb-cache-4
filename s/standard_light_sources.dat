5|$|The {{energy flux}} from Vega has been {{precisely}} measured against <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> At 5480Å, the flux is 3,650Jy with an error margin of 2%. The visual spectrum of Vega {{is dominated by}} absorption lines of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen Balmer series with the electron at the n=2 principal quantum number. The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized magnesium, iron, and chromium. The X-ray emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the corona for this star must be very weak or non-existent. However, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar coronal hole may be present, confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any coronal X-rays would not be emitted {{along the line of}} sight.|$|E
5000|$|The beam in {{the cavity}} and the output beam of the laser, when {{traveling}} in free space (or a homogeneous medium) rather than waveguides (as in an optical fiber laser), can be approximated as a Gaussian beam in most lasers; such beams exhibit the minimum divergence {{for a given}} diameter. However some high power lasers may be multimode, with the transverse modes often approximated using Hermite-Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian functions. It {{has been shown that}} unstable laser resonators (not used in most lasers) produce fractal shaped beams. Near the beam [...] "waist" [...] (or focal region) it is highly collimated: the wavefronts are planar, normal to the direction of propagation, with no beam divergence at that point. However, due to diffraction, that can only remain true well within the Rayleigh range. The beam of a single transverse mode (gaussian beam) laser eventually diverges at an angle which varies inversely with the beam diameter, as required by diffraction theory. Thus, the [...] "pencil beam" [...] directly generated by a common helium-neon laser would spread out to a size of perhaps 500 kilometers when shone on the Moon (from the distance of the earth). On the other hand, the light from a semiconductor laser typically exits the tiny crystal with a large divergence: up to 50°. However even such a divergent beam can be transformed into a similarly collimated beam by means of a lens system, as is always included, for instance, in a laser pointer whose light originates from a laser diode. That is possible due to the light being of a single spatial mode. This unique property of laser light, spatial coherence, cannot be replicated using <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> (except by discarding most of the light) as can be appreciated by comparing the beam from a flashlight (torch) or spotlight to that of almost any laser.|$|E
30|$|The color green has {{the highest}} {{resolution}} to the human eye, so the change of lighting condition has obvious influence on the appearance of it. Thus, first of all, it should {{take into account the}} influencing factors of lighting source while quality evaluation is carried on the color green of jadeite jade, and then the difference in color between the simulated daylight and the various <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> with fluorescence were also addressed [18], to evaluate light sources that are suitable for color comparison, i.e., quality evaluation.|$|E
30|$|The green {{color of}} jadeite-jade has medium to high {{lightness}} and high chroma; the color appearance {{is sensitive to}} changes in external factors such as <b>lighting</b> <b>source</b> and illuminance color temperature [25]. For example, the color green of jadeite-jade under the different <b>standard</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>sources</b> D 65 and A will show the obvious color difference spectrum phenomenon, which termed as metamerism, while under the lighting of a business window or office room, jadeite-jade green will also be affected by environmental fluorescence, {{and all of these}} are very unfavorable to jadeite-jade identification and color green evaluation. As a result, the International Lighting Committee recommended the <b>standard</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>sources</b> D 65 (6504 K), A (2856 K), and CWF (4150 K) to simulate daylight, flame light (incandescent light), and cold white fluorescence (American business show) in turn, in order to explore the characteristics and changes of jadeite-jade color appearance under different <b>standard</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>sources,</b> as shown in Fig.  1.|$|R
30|$|The {{parameters}} which affect jadeite-jade green color {{were studied}} by using three <b>standard</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>sources,</b> the results indicates the following: (1) the jadeite-jade green lightness L* under the three <b>lighting</b> <b>sources</b> {{is similar in}} general, while that of the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> D 65 is slightly higher; (2) chromaticity a* and chroma C* show the highest under <b>light</b> <b>source</b> D 65 with the pure green of color appearance and <b>light</b> <b>source</b> CWF casts slight yellow tone on the stones; therefore, it is not suitable for light yellow tone or blue tone jadeite-jade green, and some partial turquoise samples under <b>light</b> <b>source</b> A crisper slightly higher than the D 65 <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> the chroma of partial blue-green samples under <b>light</b> <b>source</b> A is slightly {{higher than that of}} <b>light</b> <b>source</b> D 65.

50|$|Using {{materials}} that are metameric color matches rather than spectral color matches is a significant problem in industries where color matching or color tolerances are important.

Similar problems can occur in apparel manufactured from different types of dye or using different types of fabric, or in quality color printing using different types of inks. Papers manufactured with optical brighteners are especially susceptible to color changes when lights differ in their short wavelength radiation, which can cause some papers to fluoresce.|$|R
40|$|Lighting {{conditions}} {{can make the}} difference between success or failure of an architectural space. The vision of space-light co-design is that architects can control the impression of an illuminated space already at an early design stage, instead of first designing spaces and then searching for a good lighting setup. As a first step towards this vision we propose a novel method to calculate potential light source positions from a given user defined target illumination. The method is independent of the tessellation of the scene and assumes a homogeneous diffuse Lambertian material. This allows using a voting system that determines potential positions for <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> with chosen size and brightness. Votes are cast from an illuminated surface point to all potential positions of a light source that would yield this illumination.

In the course of the project detailed maps, based on satellite data, have been made of the galactic and zodiacal light background at a number of wavelengths, and a substantial source of contaminating emission has been discovered in the satellite data; the contamination appears to result from interaction of the spacecraft and the atmosphere at altitudes below 170 km...|$|E

Color measurements of the disinfecting solutions were performed at 2 -minute intervals for over 2 hours using a Photo-Research PR- 704 spectroradiometer with horizontal optical axis.

40|$|Computer vision {{techniques}} using colour {{images are}} becoming popular {{in food and}} agriculture sector. Need of a standard illumination source is an important criterion in this approach to determine various attributes based on RGB values of the objects. In general, under laboratory conditions with standard lighting, an imaging system performs with high consistency in digitizing colour. However, in field conditions where {{the availability of a}} standard light source cannot be guaranteed, the colour interpretations may not yield accurate results. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a simple algorithm to compensate for the variations in RGB values due to varying light conditions. It is intended to be useful in situations where taking digital images of objects without <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> is essential for a particular purpose. A set of quadratic transformation algorithms were developed to transform the RGB values of the images acquired under five different lighting conditions. The mean variance in RGB values of the image of a colour palette (with 6 different colours) taken under five lighting conditions were in the range of 277 – 548. After implementing the developed algorithm, this was reduced to 34 – 142. Similarly, this variance was reduced from 180 – 294 to 63 – 128 in the test conducted with a plant material.

Training for lighting conditions in space has long depended on physical models and simulations to emulate the effect of lighting, but such tests are expensive and time-consuming. To evaluate lighting conditions not easily simulated on Earth, personnel at NASA Johnson Space Center's (JSC) Graphics Research and Analysis Facility (GRAF) have been developing computerized simulations of various illumination conditions using the ray-tracing program, Radiance, developed by Greg Ward at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Because these computer simulations are only as accurate as the data used, accurate information about the reflectance properties of materials and light distributions is needed. JSC's Lighting Environment Test Facility (LETF) personnel gathered material reflectance properties for a large number of paints, metals, and cloths used in the Space Shuttle and Space Station programs, and processed these data into reflectance parameters needed for the computer simulations. They also gathered lamp distribution data for most of the light sources used, and validated the ability to accurately simulate lighting levels by comparing predictions with measurements for several ground-based tests. The result of this study is a database of material reflectance properties {{for a wide variety of}} materials, and lighting information for most of the <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> used in the Shuttle/Station programs.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} random dot printing and conventional halftone printing with respect to color characteristics. Random dot printing is similar to continuous tone printing or very high frequency screen ruling and is capable of overcoming the limitatio of halftone printing. The randomly selected dots are achieved by the grain structure of the pre- sensitized printing plates. The advantages and the disadvantages of this process over conventional halftone printing process are discussed. The images and the test targets of both the processes were exposed to, and printed from a single plate for each process color so as to eliminate the ink and press variables. The experimental steps and the criteria for the plate exposure and processing have been discussed. The design of the flat {{and a copy of}} the reproduction are also included. For the purpose of objective evaluation of the color characteristics tone reproduction of both the processes and of each process color were studied. The hue error introduced by two different processes were measured. The proportionality of unwanted densities with the wanted density for each process color were derived and curves were plotted. Further, the attributes of colors, such as lightness or brightness, saturation and dominant wavelength (hue) were compared by plotting the chromaticity diagram (eIE 1931). The chromaticity diagrams were plotted for two different <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> and the results were discussed.

In that work, we measured first relative cross section curves, and then changed them to absolute ones by referring to the absolute emission cross section of 1 N (0, 0) band reported by Borst and Zipf [2] {{as well as that}} by Shemansky et al. [3]. In spite of geophysical importance, agreement among electron impact emission cross sections for N 2 reported by different authors are not always satisfactory [4]. For example, the cross sections for N 2 1 P (3, 1) band reported by different authors differ by a factor of about 2. These disagreements are ascribed mainly to the experimental difficulties. In the UV region, the cross-section values determined by Borst and Zipf for 1 N (0, 0) band (391. 4 nm) have been often referred to as a calibration standard. Although their value was measured very carefully with estimated error of ± 10 %, it would be significant to measure absolute values of selected N 2 emission bands with recent improved <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> and other related equipments.

30|$|Through the {{calculation}} of gemological chromaticity, the green characters and range of chromaticity of 728 cabochon jadeite jade were determined, and then it studies and compares with GemDialogue color card images for jadeite-jade green quality evaluation. It is testified that the method is proved to be effective {{and the construction of}} emerald green quality grading system based on it is proved. First of all, with reference to China national standard GB/T 23885 - 2009 “Jadeite-jade Grading,” the color appearance of jadeite-jade color green was analyzed contrastively with the help of three pieces of GemDialogue color chip images G, Y 2 G, and B 2 G where CIE recommended <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> D 65, A, and CWF, and then it is proposed that the best light source of jadeite-jade color green measuring and evaluating is standard D 65 based on quantitative analysis of samples’ lightness L*, chroma C*, hue h 0. Secondly, according to samples color green and five pieces of GemDialogue color chip images G 2 Y, Y 2 G, G, B 2 G, and G 2 B, jadeite-jade color was graded in seven levels from the best end “Fancy Vivid” to the last end “Very Light” with the contribution of five different overlap modes of three color masks: black/gray transparent, brown transparent, and black/white opaque. Furthermore, the high accuracy of the method is verified by clustering analysis and Fisher’s discrimination reversely. It draws conclusions that there are two evaluation methods of jadeite-jade color green; the first is the colorimetric way of GemDialogue color chip images, and the complementary is the way of Fisher functional method which sample parameters could be back substituted, and all these two methods could be extended to other green gem quality evaluation.|$|E
40|$|Very often, {{different}} results are obtained when colored originals and/or reproductions under different so-called <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> are evaluated. A {{possible explanation for}} the {{different results}} is that not all admissible standard sources have the same spectral power distribution, either due to differences in manufacturing or due to aging. A possible solution to the problem would be to determine how the spectral power distribution of a given illuminant differs from the standard (D 5000) distribution by visually comparing suitable metameric grays with a stable non-selective gray under the illuminant in question. This comparison would serve as a quick and inexpensive way of testing the light source. Two major questions are involved in this investigation: (1) Are the color differences obtainable with metamers large enough to be useful? (2) What part does the variation of color response of individual observers play in this system? The first question was investigated using two sets of metameric grays data: initially Wyszecki 2 ̆ 7 s metamers and systematic changes in the D 5000 power distribution; and then MacAdam 2 ̆ 7 s metameric grays based on real pigments from spectrophotometric data. The results for Wyszecki 2 ̆ 7 s metamers indicated that reasonable color differences occurred between non-selective gray and metameric grays with systematic changes in the spectral power distribution of the illuminant. Similar results were obtained for MacAdam 2 ̆ 7 s metamers but with less sensitivity, that is, there were smaller differences between the non-selective gray and the metameric grays. It was found that deviations from the D 5000 spectral composition can indeed be picked up and the method is sufficiently sensitive for the Standard Observer. The second question, the variation of individual observers, was investigated using information based on the measurements by Stiles and Burch, and also the Standard Deviate Observer determined by Eugene Allen. The investigation was done by obtaining the color differences relating to the individual observers, and comparing them to the Standard Observer when comparing the selective and non-selective grays to the standard D 5000 sources. The result of this investigation indicated that the color differences due to the variations between observers were larger than the color differences between the non- selective gray and the metameric grays due to the changes in the power distribution of the source. The conclusion is that this system of determining the changes in the spectral power distribution of the light source by the color differences between non-selective and selective metameric grays is inadequate because of the variances in individual observers...|$|E
40|$|STARS AND GAS IN MASSIVE STAR FORMING REGIONS In the {{scenario}} of the “evolution of a galaxy”, star formation drama features several actors that play important scenic roles in its different acts. Stars (of different masses) and gas (with different physical conditions) mutually interact {{to produce an}} almost ecological relation, where each part is somehow dependent on the other. Astronomy has had a fast development {{in recent years as}} a result of technological advances in telescopes, detectors, and satellites. Paramount questions are currently being successfully addressed both observationally and theoretically. Observations at different frequencies, from the ultraviolet to radio waves, have enabled a great advance in our knowledge on formation of massive stars and on the gaseous environment where this formation takes place. Although population of massive stars in a galaxy is very small in comparison to total star population, these massive stars (with masses over 8 times the Sun’s mass) are extremely important as they are the main engines propelling several galaxies. Massive stars have a disproportionate effect over their environment. They are the most important energy source in galactic atmospheres (the interstellar environment). By means of their stellar winds and supernova explosions, they quickly inject heavy elements borne inside them into the surrounding environment, thus chemically enriching their surroundings and provoking turbulent, violent movements in gas. This way, massive stars dramatically change the galactic “weather pattern” and play a fundamental role in regulating star formation at a galactic scale. Massive stars provide most of the galaxies’ UV radiation and help boosting emission in the infrared, so heating the galactic dust. Massive stars are objects so luminous that can be detected for studies in distant galaxies. These stars are used as <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> to measure distances in the Local Universe, especially when they turn into supernovas and make it possible to investigate the deepest regions of the Universe. For three years this research project, executed in the Universidad de La Serena, collected observational evidence to help achieve better understanding on physical properties of massive stars. These properties include massive stars’ early stages, their chaotic gaseous environment, and characteristics of the surrounding population of stars, many of which are in early evolutional stages and may have been born from energetic action of their older sisters. A significant part of observations used in this project were obtained with several of the best telescopes available for astrophysical research (Hubble Space Telescope, VI-T, Gemini, Magellan, etc.). Our research has allowed detecting new evidence on massive stars formation processes in some sectors of the Magellanic Clouds (Milky Way satellites); galaxies in which first studies are being conducted in order to understand how are stars formed in environments that are chemically different to those surrounding our Sun. In our galaxy, properties of a cluster of stars in formation have been characterized in the “Hourglass” ebula in Messier 8, an ionized gas region very similar to Orion Nebula, and distribution of gas and dust has been carefully studied. A high-impact result was the discovering of numerous Herbig-Haro objects in M 8 : gas streams emanated by stars in formation during their gas accumulation stage. Study of the relation between massive stars and ionized gas has been extended to other regions in our galaxy (NGC 6357, NGC 2467, RCW 108). On the other hand, a research has been initiated on the content of stars in the giant NGC 604 ionized region, in the Messier 33 neighbouring galaxy, using original images from the Hubble Telescope. Early results were surprising. Evidence has been found on a heterogeneous variety of objects in that association's star population, both for evolved massive stars (red supergiants) and massive stars in early formation stages. As another part of this project, an observation programme has been initiated to determine multiplicity of all spectral or bright massive stars visible in the sky. For this purpose, a consortium has been created with researchers from both hemispheres. In this first stage, radial velocity studies are being used to detect binary or multiple massive stars based on keplerian orbital movements. Through this method, it has been possible to “weigh” several binary massive stars. Two of these stars belong to the Wolf-Rayet WR 25 and WR 2 a types, which {{are some of the most}} massive stars known with masses around 80 to 100 times bigger than the Sun.

As a portable color card system, it can provide more than 60, 000 color samples, and GemDialogue consists of 21 transparent color chips and 3 color masks that cover the major colors of colored gems; each color chip has 10 color bands from high to low; the color values correspond to the number 100, 90, 80, …… 10, respectively; and there are 10 bands on each of all 3 masks which is a transparent black/gray, a transparent brown, and an opaque black/white, also according to the grayscale or color from high to low, which correspond to the number 100, 90, 80, …… 10, respectively, and {{used to describe the}} intensity of black/gray or brown that is hidden in color [19].|$|R
40|$|In the era {{of cloud}} computing, with {{services}} such as video streaming, social networking, and online storage and file sharing, the demand for online data processing and storage capacity is growing rapidly. These services are hosted in huge data centers that need not only fast servers but also fast communication between servers. Because copper cables have high attenuation at high frequencies, the most promising solution is to use fiber optical links (called optical interconnects) to connect {{different parts of the}} data center. Today, gallium arsenide-based vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) emitting at 850 nm are the <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> in transmitters used in commercially available optical interconnects, operating at up to 14 Gbit/s with a link length of up to 300 m. These lasers have the advantages of low power consumption, fast direct modulation at low currents, and low-cost manufacturing. To keep up with the demand of increasing optical interconnect capacity, the Photonics Laboratory at Chalmers university of Technology is conducting research into improving the speed, reach and capacity of VCSELs for optical interconnects...|$|R
40|$|The Imager of Sprites and Upper Atmospheric Lightning (ISUAL) {{has been}} {{operated}} {{for more than}} ten years. The onboard spectrophotometer channel- 1 (SP 1) was designed to detect the far-ultraviolet (FUV) emissions (N 2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band) from space. It was found that most of the transient luminous events (TLEs), such as sprites, halos, elves, and gigantic jets, are usually accompanied by FUV emissions. The FUV emission could be utilized as an indicator for searching TLEs because the FUV emission of lightning is severely attenuated in the atmosphere during propagation, although the TLE FUV emissions are still detectable. Furthermore, the elves FUV emission photon flux {{can also be used to}} estimate the parent lightning peak current. Therefore, SP 1 sensitivity degradation assessment, which affects the observed intensity of FUV emissions, is important. Although ISUAL has a light-emitting diode (LED) which is preset as a <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> the emission wavelength range of the LED does not cover the FUV band. We established a method in this study to determine the ISUAL Imager and SP 1 sensitivity degradation. We found that the annual degradation rates of the ISUAL Imager and the SP 1 are 8. 4 and 9. 7 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The GaAs-based vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) is the <b>standard</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> in today's optical interconnects, due to {{its energy}} efficiency, low cost, and high speed already at low drive currents. The latest {{commercial}} VCSELs operate at data rates of up to 28 Gb/s, but {{it is expected that}} higher speeds will be required in the near future. One important parameter for the speed is the damping of the relaxation oscillations. A higher damping is affordable at low data rates to reduce signal degradation due to overshoot and jitter, while lower damping is required to reach higher data rates. A VCSEL with the damping optimized for high data rates enabled error-free transmission at record-high data rates of 57 Gb/s over 1 m optical fiber, 55 Gb/s over 50 m optical fiber, and 43 Gb/s over 100 m optical fiber. For future interconnect links it is of interest with tighter integration between the optics and the silicon-based electronics. Employing heterogeneous integration techniques to integrate GaAs-based VCSELs on silicon could potentially enable integrated multi-wavelength VCSEL arrays, thus increasing the data rate through parallelization. Heterogeneous integration of GaAs-based VCSELs would also benefit applications that need short-wavelength <b>light</b> <b>sources,</b> such as photonic integrated circuits for life sciences and biophotonics. By employing ultra-thin divinylsiloxane-bis-benzocyclobutene (DVS-BCB) bonding we have demonstrated silicon-integrated short-wavelength hybrid-cavity VCSELs with up to 1. 6 mW optical output power, with modulation bandwidth of 11 GHz and capable of data transmission at data rates up to 20 Gb/s...|$|R
