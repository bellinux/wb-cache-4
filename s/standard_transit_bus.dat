50|$|The vehicle can be {{something}} as simple as a merely refitted school bus (which sometimes already contains overhead storage racks) or a minibus. Often a suburban coach may be used, which is a <b>standard</b> <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> modified to have some of the functionality of an interstate coach. An example would be the Suburban line employed by TransLink (Vancouver), typically going from the downtown core of Vancouver to suburban cities such as Delta and White Rock. In such case, the vehicles are modified <b>standard</b> <b>transit</b> <b>bus,</b> but with only one door and air conditioning. The vehicles provide accommodation for the disabled (through a lift or ramp at the front), and thus has a few high-back seats, usually in the front, that can be folded up for wheelchairs. The rest of the seats are reclining upholstered seats and have individual lights and overhead storage bins. Because it is a commuter bus, it has some (but not much) standing room, stop-request devices, and a farebox. This model also has a bike rack at the front to accommodate two bicycles.|$|E

The new company {{is developing a}} prototype of the GTB-40, a hybrid-electric 40' transit bus developed by Autokinetics of Rochester Hills, Michigan, that uses Nitronic, a stainless steel alloy developed by AK Steel that allows the bus to be half the nominal weight of a <b>standard</b> <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> and achieve twice the fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|The Gillig Low Floor is {{produced}} in three body lengths in its <b>standard</b> <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> configuration, with 29 ft, 35 ft, and 40 ft lengths available. Maximum seating capacity is 28 for the 29-foot bus (with seats over the front axle), 32 for the 35-foot bus, and 40 for the 40-foot bus. The turning radius of the Gillig Low Floor is 29 ft (29 foot body), 36 ft (35 foot body), and 43 ft (40 foot body).|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} {{area of a}} <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> may also {{be defined as a}} geographic metropolitan area, with the buses used outside of this area being more varied with buses purchased with other factors in mind. Some regional-size operators for capital cost reasons may use transit buses interchangeably on short urban routes as well as longer rural routes, sometimes up to 2 or 3 hours. Often <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> operators have a selection of 'dual-purpose' fitted buses, that is <b>standard</b> <b>transit</b> buses fitted with coach-type seating, for longer-distance routes.|$|R

5000|$|The suffix E2 {{denotes the}} {{production}} {{series of the}} export model, which incorporated several changes adopted after testing of the three prototypes, in particular relocation of the wheelchair lift from the rear door {{to the front door}} and, necessitated by that change, widening of the body. [...] The single-pane windshield was replaced by a two-piece one, and the rear window was made smaller. The length of the 57 ETI vehicles, both models, is 37 ft—slightly shorter than the 40 ft standard length for U.S. transit buses. The width was 98.4 in for the three prototypes, but was increased to 102 in (the <b>standard</b> <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> width in the U.S.) for the 54 production-series units.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Securement of wheelchairs and {{occupant}} restraint for wheelchair riders on buses {{is one of}} the most difficult prob-lems facing transit providers. The primary findings of this litera-ture review show that (1) very little information has been published regarding <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> safety and crash environment; (2) the focus of most reported wheelchair incidents involved noncollision events, in which inappropriate wheelchair secure-ment or rider restraint resulted in minor injuries; and (3) studies spanning 30 years indicate that the large <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> is an exceed-ingly safe form of transportation, so that wheelchair riders do not face undo risk of injury in this transportation environment. Further study is required to characterize the rare-occurring severe <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> crashes. The resulting information is needed to establish an appropriate level of crash protection so that the next generation of U. S. wheelchair securement and {{occupant restraint}} systems not only are reasonably safe but also are easy to use and acceptable to wheelchair riders and <b>transit</b> <b>bus</b> operators. Key words: <b>transit</b> <b>bus,</b> transport safety, wheelchair rider, wheelchair tie-downs...|$|R
