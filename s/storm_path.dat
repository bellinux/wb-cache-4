Only 576shelters, with a collective capacity of 90,000people, were listed for all of southern Haiti. Despite pleas from officials, many residents refused to leave their homes. A total of 1,300shelters were readied with a total capacity of 390,000people, insufficient for the population threatened in the <b>storm</b> <b>path.</b> Citing this problem and civic responsibility, officials asked residents in secure homes to welcome vulnerable neighbors. The Haitian government sent funds to 145municipalities, after mayors complained that they had insufficient supplies. Government offices remained open during the storm, while schools were closed from October3–10 to serve as shelters, causing the school calendar to be adjusted. By the day before the storm made landfall, 340,000people had evacuated to these shelters. At least 500people evacuated from Jérémie, and patients at the Les Cayes hospital were evacuated. In Ouest, which contains the capital Port-au-Prince, about 55,000people evacuated ahead of the storm. Although civil protection officials took to the streets to warn people, many residents were unaware that Matthew was even approaching the country a day before its expected landfall. Evacuations continued through the hurricane's landfall with the total number of people in shelters reaching 9,280 by 2:00a.m. local time on October4. Hundreds of prisoners were also evacuated to safer areas during the storm passage.|$|E

Examples include <b>storm</b> <b>path</b> trajectories, longitudinal data such as drug therapy response, functional expression data in computational biology, and movements of objects or individuals in video sequences. Our clustering algorithm is based on a principled method for probabilistic modelling of a set of trajectories as individual sequences of points generated from a finite mixture model consisting of regression model components. Unsupervised learning is carried out using maximum likelihood principles. Specifically, the EM algorithm is used to cope with the hidden data problem (i. e., the cluster memberships). We also develop generalizations of the method to handle non-parametric (kernel) regression components as well as multi-dimensional outputs.
