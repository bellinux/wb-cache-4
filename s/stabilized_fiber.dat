40|$|Timing and {{synchronization}} in the LCLS is a three tier process: At level 1 {{an event}} generator broadcasts timing fiducials to event receivers over a fiber network. Hardware and software triggers are {{created in the}} event receiver according to the digital pattern broadcast at 360 Hz by the event generator. Beam synchronous data acquisition driven by these triggers allows time-stamped acquisition of all diagnostic devices simultaneously on every pulse. Timing fiducials are phase synchronized to the low level RF reference system with 10 ps precision. Level 2 synchronization ensures that individual klystrons powering gun and accelerating sections remain within a few tenths of a degree S-band to the phase reference distribution scheme.

40|$|This master thesis {{presents}} an experimental {{design of a}} laser gyroscope based on a <b>stabilized</b> <b>fiber</b> optical parametric oscillator frequency comb {{and the results of}} testing of the proposed design. Before going into the experimental details, a background for different types of gyroscopes is discussed. This new laser gyroscope design is made up of only polarization maintaining (PM) fiber and PM fiber components. By using only fiber and fiber components, we were able to minimize size, weight, and alignment issues that are typical in bulk optical designs for OPO's and gyroscopes. The fiber-based OPO produces counter propagating ultrafast pulses that overlap only twice in the cavity, resulting in a beatnote signal when combined outside of the laser cavity. A mode-locked laser is used as a pump source so the lock-in effect (or deadband region) is avoided for the experiment. The drift of this beatnote signal represents the rotation sensitivity of the experimental setup. Issues seen in past iterations, such as stability of mode-locked pump source and beatnote drift overtime due to environmental variables, have been reduced in this experiment. This has been done by comprising the entire pump source of PM components, and by placing the entire setup in an insulating box to minimize acoustic and temperature fluctuations. By creating a frequency comb and locking the laser gyroscope to an optical clock, this experiment can be used for very precise rotation sensing in comparison to other gyro designs currently available...|$|E
40|$|Carbon fibers {{contain more}} than 90 wt. % carbon. They have low density, high {{specific}} strength and modulus, and good temperature and chemical resistance. Therefore, {{they are important}} candidate as reinforcement materials. Carbon fiber is made by pyrolysing precursor polymers. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) which {{has been used as}} precursor to produce high strength carbon fiber is used as precursor in this study. The theoretical tensile strength of carbon fibers can reach over 100 GPa. Currently, the best commercial carbon fibers reach only 7. 5 GPa. To make good quality carbon fiber and to narrow the gap between theoretical values and currently achieved experimental properties, the entire manufacturing process including fiber spinning, stabilization and carbonization, needs to be improved optimized. In this dissertation, the stabilization processes of gel-spun PAN/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite fibers are studied. PAN/CNT (1 wt. % CNT) composite fibers are spun by dry-jet gel-spinning. Three types of CNTs with different number of walls and varying catalyst content are used as additives. The effect of different types of CNTs on the properties of the stabilized fibers was compared. It is found that the CNTs with the highest surface area shows the best reinforcement efficiency on the tensile modulus, and reduces the formation of β-amino nitrile. The residual catalyst in the range of 1 to 4 wt. % shows little effect on the mechanical properties of the stabilized fibers. Stabilization involves complex chemical reactions, including cyclization, oxidation, dehydration, and cross-linking. These complex reactions are separated by using different gas environments during stabilization. The cross-linking reaction has the highest activation energy among all stabilization reactions, and requires a temperature higher than 300 DegC to be completed. The effect of applied tension on the <b>stabilized</b> <b>fiber</b> properties are investigated, and it is found that higher tension leads to better properties for the <b>stabilized</b> <b>fiber,</b> including higher Young's modulus, higher orientation, less formation of β-amino nitrile, and less shrinkage. The relationship between stabilization conditions and the mechanical properties of the carbonized fiber is investigated, and the methods to identify optimum stabilization conditions are proposed. It is observed that the highest tension should be applied during both stabilization and carbonization, and the mechanical properties of the resulting carbon fibers are increased if fibers are further stabilized at a temperature of ~ 320 DegC to improve the cross-linking degree as compared with the fibers only stabilized at 255 DegC. The optimum stabilization time depends on both the stabilization temperature and on the applied tension. A new characterization method by monitoring the dynamic mechanical properties, while stabilization is in progress is used to narrow down the range of the optimum stabilization time. Also, the effect of carbonization temperature on the ultimate carbon fiber properties is studied in the batch process carbonization. Preliminary studies are carried out to find the relationship between the structure and properties of precursor fibers and the tensile strength of carbon fibers, including mechanical properties and co-monomers of precursor fibers.

Subfemtosecond (1 h) 3 -mrad level phase stability of a 10. 225 GHz microwave signal extracted from a mode-locked laser is demonstrated. The third topic is timing <b>stabilized</b> <b>fiber</b> links for large-scale timing distribution. Precise optical timing distribution to remote locations {{can result in}} synchronization over long distances. In doing so, acoustic noise and thermal drifts introduced to the fiber links must be canceled by a length-correction feedback loop. A single type-II phase-matched PPKTP crystal is used to construct a compact and self-aligned balanced optical cross-correlator for precise timing detection. (cont.) Using this correlator, a 310 m long fiber link is stabilized with long-term sub- 10 fs accuracy. The final topic is photonic analog-to-digital conversion of high-frequency microwave signals. Sampling of high-frequency (> 10 GHz) microwave signals is challenging due to the required aperture jitter below 100 fs. An optical subsampling down- converter for analog-to-digital conversion of narrowband high-frequency microwave signals is studied. The measured signal to noise-and-distortion ratio of 1 -Mbps signals at 9. 5 GHz carrier frequency is 22 dB over 2 MHz bandwidth.

The round-trip <b>stabilized</b> <b>fiber</b> optic distribution system has been previously described in this memo series [1 - 3, 13]. In August of 2003, a first generation version of the line length correction system was tested on a prototype ALMA antenna.

During these measurements we noticed an undesirable and unexpected phase fluctuation which was correlated with the antenna azimuth and elevation position. Those tests are described in an internal test report [4]. Further tests and meetings took place {{in an effort to}} resolve this issue [5 - 8]. In addition, an ALMA memo was written describing a theoretical treatment of the measured phase fluctuation [9], supporting the measurement results which showed that the phase fluctuation was due to the absolute polarization change (caused by the fiber movement) of the two lightwaves, and that the phase fluctuation magnitude was inversely proportional to the degree of polarization alignment of the two lightwaves. To put it another way, if the state-of-polarizations (SOPs) of the two lightwaves were different at the receiver end, then any movement of the fiber would cause a phase change.

Polysaccharides are polyhydroxylic polymers that can be functionalized by a wide selection of chemical reactions, and modifications of these biopolymers are applicable in the development of new materials. Such materials, originating from a renewable source are, in principle, in agreement with a sustainable development and are of interest in many different areas of industrial application. The work presented in this thesis is divided into two parts. The first part considers chemical crosslinking of softwood kraft pulp. Fibers were crosslinked with different diepoxides to stabilize the fiber walls and decrease the wet fiber flexibility. The results strongly indicated successful crosslinking reactions. The modified pulps consistently proved to have decreased water retention values and fiber networks formed by the modified fibers possessed an improved ability to resist pressure in the wet state, i. e. a higher wet bulk. These results point to <b>stabilized</b> <b>fiber</b> walls with more rigid structures and consequently, confirm that wet fiber flexibility influences the bulk of fiber networks. In the second part, cationic modified nanocrystalline cellulose, cotton linters and softwood kraft pulp were prepared and characterized using high resolution solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The cellulosic samples were modified with the cationic epoxide 2, 3 -epoxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride under heterogeneous conditions prior to acid hydrolysis and ion exchange solid phase extraction-column purification. The isolation of the cationic modified monomers opened for NMR characterization also at low degrees of substitution. Information on the substituent pattern could be distinguished from the analyzing method.

Two alleles, R and X, have been discovered at the ACTN 3 locus. An association between ACTN 3 genotype and sprint performance has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Relative to non-athlete and non-elite athlete controls, the homozygous RR genotype, with few exceptions (Lucia et al. 2007; Druzhevskaya et al. 2008), {{is more common in}} elite sprint/power athletes (Yang et al. 2003; MacArthur and North 2004; Niemi and Majamaa 2005) whereas the homozygous XX genotype is associated with elite athlete endurance performance in some populations (Yang et al. 2003; Eynon et al. 2009). A recent meta-analysis demonstrated an association between the presence of the ACTN 3 R allele and performance in sprint/power athletic events (Ma et al. 2013).|$|R
