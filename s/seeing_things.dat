Before the tour, Jaffee announced that he was leaving the Wallflowers. This left Dylan, Greg Richling and Fred Eltringham as the remaining members and a guitar player, Stuart Mathis, as a touring member. In 2008, the Wallflowers toured on-and-off throughout the summer.

25|$|The {{most common}} {{modality}} referred to when people speak of hallucinations include the phenomena of <b>seeing</b> <b>things</b> {{that are not}} present or visual perception, which does not reconcile with the physical, consensus reality. There are many different causes that have been classed as psychophysiologic (a disturbance of brain structure), psychobiochemical (a disturbance of neurotransmitters), psychodynamic (an emergence of the unconscious into consciousness), and psychological (e.g., meaningful experiences consciousness); {{this is also the}} case in Alzheimer's disease. Numerous disorders can involve visual hallucinations, ranging from psychotic disorders to dementia to migraine, but experiencing visual hallucinations does not in itself mean that there is necessarily a disorder. Visual hallucinations are associated with organic disorders of the brain and with drug- and alcohol-related illness, and not typically considered the result of a psychiatric disorder.|$|E

Although describing the [...] "exciting" [...] work as an [...] "interesting exercise in historical biography", he noted that Gasper paints a [...] "hagiographic image" [...] of von Neuhoff, for instance by unconvincingly portraying him as a [...] "military genius" [...] and by falling into [...] "the trap of <b>seeing</b> <b>things</b> {{in black and white}} by frequently presenting Neuhoff and his followers as heroes ﬁghting against villains." ...|$|E

I'm excited again by what I've come up with on guitar and lyrically it's much more political and less personal."

500|$|Christine Love {{describes}} herself as [...] "a writer first, and a game designer second", as writing was her initial goal. She originally pictured her future {{as that of a}} novelist, with a day job as a programmer to support herself. Love describes her games as being about [...] "our relationship with technology, about human relationships in general, and about <b>seeing</b> <b>things</b> from different perspectives," [...] as well as having [...] "a ton of words". She strives for her stories to be true and sincere, but not necessarily realistic. Love is also interested in the portrayal of gender and sexuality in video games; in Digital and Analogue, she was careful to avoid mentioning or assuming the gender of the player or the character they control, though the love interests in the games are female. Privately, however, she thinks of them as female, as her intention was to create games that could be easily appreciated by queer people such as herself, without having to project themselves onto a relationship that did not match up to their perceptions. Love believes that indie games have [...] "more meaningful depictions of queer experiences" [...] than those from larger studios.|$|E
500|$|The 2012 game Dishonored {{tried to}} {{incorporate}} stealth elements that {{were influenced by}} Thief, such as the importance of lighting and shadows. The developers later abandoned that system citing realism as a factor. The game instead relies on a system of [...] "occlusion-based" [...] stealth, using the vision cones of the enemies, obstacles, and special abilities which determines {{whether or not the}} character is visible. Forbes called Dishonored one of the best stealth games of 2012, along with Hitman Absolution and Mark of the Ninja. Mark of the Ninja puts a twist on the stealth genre in that it is a 2D side-scroller. This posed some unique factors, such as the lack of corners for the character to hide behind, and the visibility presented in a side-scroller; the developers overcame this by adding 'fog' that prevents the player from <b>seeing</b> <b>things</b> that the character can not see, visually representing enemy line-of-sight and even visualizing the noise made by the character, including how far that noise travels. After the completion of the game, the player has access to a harder difficulty called [...] "New Game Plus", which further decreases visibility by adding fog behind the player and removes noise visualizations and enemy line of sight indicators.|$|E

500|$|Devil's Due {{released}} three-issue mini-series Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, {{the story}} bridges {{the gap between}} Halloween II and Halloween H20 by focusing on Laurie Strode {{in the aftermath of}} the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is [...] "trying to get better and trying to repair, but where do you even start after going through such horror? How do you even try to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?" [...] Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is <b>seeing</b> <b>things.</b> Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the [...] "bloodline plot of the middle sequels", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that [...] "it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, [...] "it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it’s the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential." ...|$|E
