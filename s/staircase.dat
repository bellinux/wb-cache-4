5|$|Surviving {{interior}} {{features include}} an early 18th-century <b>staircase</b> with carved tread ends decorated with scroll, flower and leaf designs. Each step has three twisted balusters, {{and there is}} a moulded hand rail. The <b>staircase</b> is situated in a hall with an 18th-century ceiling painting of pelicans, trumpets and swags. In the early 21st century it was planned to remove the <b>staircase</b> from the house entirely.|$|E
5|$|There are, however, shared rock units {{between all}} three, {{creating}} a supersequence of formations that geologists call the Grand <b>Staircase.</b> Together {{the formations of}} the Grand <b>Staircase</b> record nearly 2000 million years of the Earth's history. Bryce Canyon's formations are the youngest known units in the Grand <b>Staircase.</b> Younger rock units, if they ever existed, have been removed by erosion.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{staircases}} on {{the first}} three quadrangles are marked with Arabic numerals, the Island site is marked with Roman numerals. Both sites have the numbering running anticlockwise around each quadrangle {{and there are two}} <b>staircase</b> eighteens − Mary Quad's <b>staircase</b> numbering finishes at 18 and O'Brien Quad's <b>staircase</b> numbering begins with XVIII.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor's {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} {{with a set of}} interior <b>staircases</b> and furniture steps related to house interior and its architectural setting. The main goal is to define the requirements for these <b>staircases</b> and furniture steps. In {{the first part of the}} thesis an analysis of contemporary situation in area of interior <b>staircases</b> is summarized, which {{is concerned with}} the relationship between <b>staircases,</b> house interior and the furniture. Then requirements for proportions and qualitative demands for interior <b>staircases</b> and furniture stairs are defined. In the discussion section the conclusions and findings about continuity between <b>staircases,</b> steps and furniture and the meaning of these relationships in practise are set out. An aim is to set requirements for the design of interior <b>staircases</b> and furniture steps in relation to furniture...|$|R
2500|$|Internal <b>staircases</b> {{from the}} ground floor were {{constructed}} of stone. Attic <b>staircases</b> were timber.The <b>staircases</b> were well lit by windows in the rear elevation. Cellars and back rooms had stone flagged floors, other floors were suspended timber ...|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Castellania contains offices, court halls, a chapel and prison cells. A large allegorical statue representing Lady Justice or Astraea wearing a blindfold and holding weighing scales stands at the <b>staircase</b> which lead to the former courtrooms. The statue stands on a pedestal, and its sculptor is unknown. The <b>staircase</b> is grandiose on its own.|$|E
5|$|The kitchen, oratory {{and great}} chamber rose two floors, {{therefore}} only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main <b>staircase</b> {{on the second}} floor. However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a <b>staircase</b> in that room or via the gallery.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pediment depicts {{sculptures of}} plants and geometrical figures. The <b>staircase</b> has nine unusually high steps— high, about {{twice as high as}} the average height of stairs. Tananyan suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending the <b>staircase</b> to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On the both sides of the <b>staircase</b> there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals held up altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E

5|$|A {{counterweight}} hangs {{inside the}} top of the monument to help balance it in windy weather. An internal <b>staircase</b> ascends to a viewing platform, which has three circular windows, one on each face.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the <b>staircase</b> are bronze {{railings}} with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated}} with the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one <b>staircase</b> was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed the <b>staircase</b> on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} end of the station is a power substation, located at West Road and East 6th Road {{adjacent}} to the Rockaway-bound platform. A second exit-only <b>staircase</b> is located here, but is closed.|$|E
50|$|This stylistic {{interest}} in <b>staircases</b> {{is attributed to}} the influence of German Expressionism, which often featured heavily stylized and menacing <b>staircases,</b> for example in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.|$|R
5000|$|The station's main {{entrance}} is a mezzanine above the platforms and tracks {{at the south}} end. It has two <b>staircases</b> to the Manhattan-bound platform and one to the Bay Ridge-bound one at the extreme south end, a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions, turnstile bank, token booth, and two <b>staircases</b> to the northern corners of 45th Street and 4th Avenue. The mezzanine contains some of the original mosaic directional and arrow signs. The one by the <b>staircases</b> to the southbound platform says [...] "Down Town trains" [...] while the one by the Manhattan-bound platform <b>staircases</b> says [...] "Up Town Trains." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{station has}} one {{elevated}} station-house beneath {{the center of}} the platform and tracks. Two <b>staircases</b> from the platform go down to a landing, where a set of doors for each one leads to two more <b>staircases</b> that go down to the mezzanine. The mezzanine has a turnstile bank, exit-only turnstile, token booth, and two <b>staircases</b> going down to either side of West Sixth Street north of Neptune Avenue.|$|R

5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great <b>Staircase</b> (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great <b>Staircase</b> {{to the east of}} the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the <b>staircase</b> in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the <b>staircase</b> served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E
5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central <b>staircase</b> in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of the <b>staircase.</b> Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E
5000|$|Every autumn the South Side Slopes Neighborhood Association (SSSNA) hosts {{its annual}} [...] "StepTrek", where {{participants}} travel over the various public step streets. Pittsburgh, like many {{cities in the}} United States built on hillsides, classifies public <b>staircases</b> as streets. The hills being steep, <b>staircases</b> allowed access to the {{different parts of the}} slopes neighborhood. The SSSNA hopes to maintain the <b>staircases</b> as a legacy of its history as a mining town.|$|R
5000|$|The station's main {{entrance}} has two <b>staircases</b> to each platform {{and one to}} each northern corner of Fourth Avenue and 53rd Street. The mezzanine allows transfer between directions and contains some of the original mosaic directional and arrow signs. The one by the <b>staircases</b> to the southbound platform says [...] "Ft. Hamilton & Coney Island" [...] while the one by the Manhattan-bound platform <b>staircases</b> says [...] "Down Town Trains." ...|$|R
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional <b>staircases</b> by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed <b>staircases</b> at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed <b>staircases.</b> The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for <b>staircases</b> on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four <b>staircases</b> in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five <b>staircases.</b>|$|R
5|$|Privacy--providing {{separate}} sleeping {{quarters for}} parents and children, and among children led to larger apartments over time. Similarly, most buildings had {{a limited number of}} apartments adjoining each <b>staircase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spears {{talked to}} CNN about her {{involvement}} {{during the development}} of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept. Spears worked with fashion designer Gia Ventola to create the costumes for her and the dancers. The proscenium stage was simple and had only one main prop, a <b>staircase</b> in the middle. The band was in both sides of the <b>staircase</b> and consisted of five musicians. There were also six dancers, that took the stage during interludes. The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well-known artists.|$|E
5|$|The Stonyhurst War Records were {{published}} in their honour. A memorial {{at the top of}} the main <b>staircase</b> records the names of the six O.S. killed in the Boer War.|$|E
50|$|Several {{changes were}} made to Silver Street station in the early 1980s. Two wooden covered <b>staircases</b> {{leading up to the}} {{platforms}} were replaced by open-air concrete <b>staircases.</b> The northbound platform roof was removed and replaced with a simple brick shelter.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>staircases</b> {{from each}} {{platform}} {{lead to the}} wooden elevated mezzanine beneath the tracks. The station house has a turnstile bank, token booth, and three street <b>staircases</b> to all four corners of Morrison and Westchester Avenues except for the southeast one.|$|R
50|$|As completed, {{the complex}} had 113,000 square feet (10,500 square metres) of floorspace over 6 floors, 8 {{principal}} <b>staircases</b> and 3 minor <b>staircases.</b> Over {{the intervening years}} many alterations were made, including the addition of new goods lifts, {{the replacement of the}} original boiler chimney, the removal and insertion of <b>staircases,</b> and internal conversions. On St Mary's Gate, the decorative turret and clocktower above the main entrance stairwell was replaced by a lift motor room crudely built in brick.|$|R
5|$|The {{centre of}} the house is {{occupied}} by the hallway and <b>staircase,</b> which show the greatest number of changes since the original design.|$|E
5|$|The room on {{the south}} side (separated by the other rooms due to the hall's height) was {{accessed}} via the main <b>staircase.</b> This room also had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was probably used by guests.|$|E
5|$|The {{rooms on}} {{the north and east}} sides of the third floor were {{accessed}} via the private <b>staircase.</b> The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby {{at the top of the}} private <b>staircase.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{ceiling of}} the {{vestibule}} is decorated with glazed ceramic moldings that are arranged {{in the shape of}} stars. From the vestibule, on the left and right, grand marble <b>staircases</b> ascend from between crowned lamps on columns to bring visitors to the second floor. The balustrades of the <b>staircases,</b> also marble, are supported by unusual transparent yellow glass balusters. The underside of the <b>staircases</b> is covered with tiles that form gleaming canopies {{on either side of the}} vestibule.|$|R
50|$|This {{station has}} one {{elevated}} station house beneath {{the center of}} the platforms and tracks. Two <b>staircases</b> from each platform go down to a crossunder that has a news-stand and small turnstile bank. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two <b>staircases</b> going down to the northwest and southeast corners of 39th Avenue and 31st Street. The lower base of the platform <b>staircases</b> have emergency gates leading directly {{to the top of the}} street stairs.|$|R
5000|$|This {{station has}} a {{full-length}} mezzanine above the platforms and tracks with <b>staircases</b> {{to each side}} at regular intervals that connect the two fare control areas. The full-time one is at the north (geographical east) end. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two <b>staircases</b> {{going up to the}} western corners of Nostrand and Lafayette Avenues. The fare control area at the south (geographical west) end of the mezzanine is unstaffed, containing just full height turnstiles and two <b>staircases</b> to either eastern corners of Bedford and Lafayette Avenues. The two <b>staircases</b> on the western corners are exit-only and signed as [...] "No Entry". They had been previously boarded-up, with a gate sealing off the passageway towards the stairs.|$|R
