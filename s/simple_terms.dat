5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In <b>simple</b> <b>terms,</b> the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E
5|$|The {{advancing}} and retreating {{characteristics of}} the glaciers in the Glacier Bay are explained in <b>simple</b> <b>terms</b> as a steady state of snow getting converted into ice on the hills. Ice, as a lens {{of water on the}} base of bedrock, slides by gravity downwards. The good moraine of rock and rubble insulates it from water erosion. As a result, during freezing temperatures that exists all the year, the glacier advances. When the insulation and erosion effect of the hills gets reduced erosion sets in and along with rising temperatures the glaciers start retreating. Another unpredictable phenomenon that is observed in many glaciers in the Glacier Bay is that of calving. Calving is a process in which blocks of ice get detached or break off from the glacier, irrespective of weather conditions, all the year round, and crash into the sea with thundering noise creating a boiling like turbulence.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In <b>simple</b> <b>terms,</b> physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E

5|$|In January 1821, Iturbide began peace {{negotiations}} with Guerrero, suggesting they unite {{to establish an}} independent New Spain. The <b>simple</b> <b>terms</b> that Iturbide proposed became {{the basis of the}} Plan of Iguala: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its existing privileges; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, Guadalupe Victoria, joined the alliance, and March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief Juan O'Donojú, who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in Veracruz on July 1, 1821; but he found that royalists the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and Acapulco. Since at the time that O'Donojú had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donojú proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting Treaty of Córdoba, which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'Donojú became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of Córdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Itrubide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{and use a}} method for e-mail {{categorization}} based on <b>simple</b> <b>term</b> statistics updated incrementally. We apply <b>simple</b> <b>term</b> statistics to two different tasks. The first task is to predict folders for classification of e-mails when large numbers of messages are required to remain unclassified. The second task is to support users who define rule bases for the same classification task, by suggesting suitable keywords for constructing Ripple Down Rule bases in this scenario. For both tasks, the results are compared {{with a number of}} standard machine learning algorithms. The comparison shows that the <b>simple</b> <b>term</b> statistics method achieves a higher level of accuracy than other machine learning methods when taking computation time into account. ...|$|R

25|$|In very <b>simple</b> <b>terms,</b> {{suppose that}} capital {{currently}} consists of 10 trucks and 5 lasers. Trucks are produced and sold for $50,000 each, while each laser goes for $30,000. Thus, {{the value of}} our capital equals the sum of (price)*(quantity) = 10*$50,000 + 5*$30,000 = $650,000 = K.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other Jewish traditions, which depict God in {{relatively}} <b>simple</b> <b>terms,</b> the Zohar is intentionally obscure. As a work {{it is full}} of neologisms, linguistic borrowings, occasional grammatical mistakes, and inspired wordplay on rabbinic and biblical passages. Its ideas are often inconsistent and conflicting, referring to abstract concepts that are never completely expressed.|$|E

25|$|Helioseismology {{can also}} be used to image the far side of the Sun from the Earth, {{including}} sunspots. In <b>simple</b> <b>terms,</b> sunspots both absorb and deflect helioseismic waves, causing a seismic deficit where next they encounter the photosphere. To facilitate spaceweather forecasting, seismic images of the central portion of the solar far side have been produced nearly continuously since late 2000 by analysing data from the SOHO spacecraft, and since 2001 the entire far side has been imaged with these data.|$|E
25|$|Herbert Hoover {{had already}} {{considered}} a bank holiday {{to prevent further}} bank runs, but rejected the idea because {{he was afraid to}} trip a panic. Roosevelt, however, gave a radio address, held in the atmosphere of a Fireside Chat, and explained to the public in <b>simple</b> <b>terms</b> the causes of the banking crisis, what the government will do and how the population could help. He closed all the banks in the country and kept them all closed until he could pass new legislation.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the debate}} is mathematical, but some major {{elements}} can be explained in <b>simple</b> <b>terms</b> {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'. That is, the critique of neoclassical capital theory might be summed up as saying that it suffers from the fallacy of composition, i.e., that we cannot simply jump from microeconomic conceptions to an understanding of production by society as a whole. The resolution {{of the debate}}, particularly how broad its implications are, has not been agreed upon by economists.|$|E

50|$|In <b>simpler</b> <b>terms,</b> {{osmolality}} is {{an expression}} of solute osmotic concentration per mass of solvent, whereas osmolarity is per volume of solution (thus the conversion by multiplying with the mass density of solvent in solution (kg solvent/kg solution).|$|R
25|$|Fascinated by nuclear {{technology}} {{and eager to}} share his knowledge with the public, Dunning gave numerous public talks on the subject, and made frequent appearances on television and radio. He helped write a Blondie and Dagwood comic that explained nuclear energy in <b>simple</b> <b>terms.</b> In one experiment, he drank irradiated salt water, and used a geiger counter to demonstrate to his audience how his fingers became radioactive as sodium-24, with its half life of 15 hours, circulated through his bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept has}} a long history in {{philosophical}} and ethical thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science, Auguste Comte, and has become a major topic for psychologists (especially evolutionary psychology researchers), evolutionary biologists, and ethologists. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In <b>simple</b> <b>terms,</b> altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} {{of the interaction between}} the gamma ray and the crystal can be determined by processing the voltage signals from the photomultipliers; in <b>simple</b> <b>terms,</b> the location can be found by weighting the position of each photomultiplier tube by the strength of its signal, and then calculating a mean position from the weighted positions. The total sum of the voltages from each photomultiplier, measured by a pulse height analyzer is proportional to the energy of the gamma ray interaction, thus allowing discrimination between different isotopes or between scattered and direct photons.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{the term}} haemosiderosis {{is used to}} {{indicate}} the pathological effect of iron accumulation in any given organ, which mainly occurs {{in the form of}} the iron-storage complex haemosiderin. Sometimes, the <b>simpler</b> <b>term</b> siderosis is used instead.|$|R
