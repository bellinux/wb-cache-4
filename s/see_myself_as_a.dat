500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E

[...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 April 1964 Springfield issued {{her debut}} album A Girl Called Dusty which {{included}} mostly remakes of her favourite songs. Among the tracks were [...] "Mama Said," [...] "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes," [...] "You Don't Own Me," [...] and [...] "Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa." [...] The album reached No.6 in the UK in May 1964. The chart hits [...] "Stay Awhile," [...] "All Cried Out," [...] and [...] "Losing You" [...] {{followed the same}} year. The B-side of [...] "Stay Awhile" [...] featured another self-penned track, [...] "Somethin' Special," [...] which AllMusic's Richie Unterberger described as [...] "a first-rate Springfield original". However, Springfield declared: [...] "I don't really <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> songwriter. I don't really like writing... I just don't get any good ideas and the ones I do get are pinched from other records. The only reason I write is for the money – oh mercenary creature!" [...] In 1964, Springfield recorded two Burt Bacharach songs: [...] "Wishin' and Hopin'" [...] – a US Top10 hit – and the emotional [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself," [...] which reached No.3 on the UK chart. The latter song {{set the standard for}} much of her later material. In December 1964, Springfield's tour of South Africa with her group The Echoes was controversially terminated, and she was deported, after they performed for an integrated audience at a theatre near Cape Town, which was against the then government's segregation policy. Her contract specifically excluded segregated performances, making her one of the first British artists to do so. In the same year, she was voted the Top Female British Artist {{of the year in the}} New Musical Express poll, topping Lulu, Sandie Shaw, and Cilla Black. Springfield received the award again for the next three years. During 1965, Springfield released three more UK Top40 hits: [...] "Your Hurtin' Kinda Love," [...] "In the Middle of Nowhere," [...] and the Carole King-penned [...] "Some of Your Lovin'." [...] However, these were not included on her next UK album recorded with The Echoes, Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty, which was released in October 1965 and featured songs by Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley, Rod Argent, and Randy Newman, and a cover of the traditional Mexican song, [...] "La Bamba."

I have been practicing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> physician assistant for over six years and still learn new things each day; about medicine, those I take care of, and myself.

Perhaps this is not dissimilar to an adventurer or explorer on a journey fraught with dangers and inherent risks forging a path through unexplored territory. This chapter shares with you my journey <b>as</b> <b>an</b> early career researcher through a critical juncture of research that until recently predominantly favored a scientific model that viewed the problem of paediatric inactivity from the outside in (not dissimilar to that of spending millions discovering another star in a far away galaxy). I share my journey thus far through the troubling terrain of exploring the relatively uncharted territory of adopting a humanistic approach to exploring this phenomenon (sitting {{on top of another}} undiscovered world beneath our feet). Often a solo researcher, I <b>see</b> <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> 'active agent' on this journey with many parallels to that of an explorer. My intentional use of 'active exploration metaphors' should both exhaust the reader and help to create a feeling of troubling, not unlike the road I have traversed thus far. In sharing this journey with the reader, I hope that they may also identify or see themselves in some of my adventures and may relate to similar experiences or feelings. The chapter concludes with the sharing of my current position on this journey - that of traversing the terrain with more conviction in my step and strength in my position. I present an alternative approach to exploring this phenomenon <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> range of counternarratives. This journey has enabled me to move towards a stronger, more empowering position where the dominant discourse can be challenged and where there is the potential to transform and thereby create new and more enabling research terrain to help understand the problem of paediatric inactivity...|$|R
