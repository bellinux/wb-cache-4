Urban planners are now promoting a sustainable city model, which consists of cities that designed with consideration of environmental impacts, such as minimising the uses of energy, water, and the outputs of waste and pollution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Around the world, {{particularly}} in North America and Australia, urban sprawl combined with low density suburban development has caused serious accessibility and mobility problems, {{especially for those}} who do not own a motor vehicle or have access to public transportation services. <b>Sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> and transportation <b>development</b> is seen crucial in solving transportation disadvantage problems in urban settlements. However, current urban and transportation models have not been adequately addressed unsustainable urban transportation problems that transportation disadvantaged groups overwhelmingly encounter, and the negative impacts on the disadvantaged have not been effectively considered. Transportation disadvantaged is a multi-dimensional problem that combines demographic, spatial and transportation service dimensions. Nevertheless, most transportation models focusing on transportation disadvantage only employ demographic and transportation service dimensions and do not take spatial dimension into account. This paper aims to investigate the link between <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> and transportation <b>development</b> and spatial dimension of the transportation disadvantage problem. The paper, for that purpose, provides a thorough review of the literature and identifies a set of <b>urban,</b> <b>development</b> and policy characteristics to define spatial dimension of the transportation disadvantage problem. This paper presents an overview of these <b>urban,</b> <b>development</b> and policy characteristics that have significant relationships with <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> and transportation <b>development</b> and travel inability, which are also useful in determining transportation disadvantaged populations...|$|R

This study examines the following questions through an explanatory study. (i) What problems do public toilets pose?

(iii) How do demands, needs, and expectations around public toilets change depending on gender, age, and ability?

40|$|Cities {{are complex}} {{ecosystems}} affected by social, economic, environmental, and cultural factors. The problem of attaining <b>urban</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> is thus an important challenge. The development of evaluation indicators and {{a method for}} assessing the status of <b>urban</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> {{will be required to}} support urban ecological planning, construction, and management. By using Jining City in China&# 39;s Shandong Province as a case study. the authors developed a system of 52 indicators of <b>urban</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> that address economic growth and efficiency, ecological and infrastructural construction, environmental protection, social and welfare progress. The authors developed a Full Permutation Polygon Synthetic Indicator method to evaluate the capacity for <b>urban</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> at different times during the next two decades. The results of our research indicate that the value of a synthetic indicator for sustainable development of Jining City was 0. 24 in 2004, which indicates a low level of sustainable development. According to the ecological planning of Jining City (2004 - 2020), the indicator will improve to 0. 45 in 2007 and 0. 62 in 2010. indicating significant improvements in sustainable development, and will reach 0. 90 in 2020, indicating excellent potential for sustainable development. The Full Permutation Polygon Synthetic Indicator method provides a comprehensive, intuitive approach that reflects the system integration principle that the whole can be {{more than the sum of}} its parts. The approach thus provides a promising basis for decision-making to support <b>urban</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>development</b> and monitoring of the effectiveness of these decisions.

30|$|The Macao utopian future, as {{suggested}} in this paper, {{may be a}} chimera, {{like most of the}} claimed <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> <b>developments</b> on the Mainland (Chang and Sheppard, 2013). The appearance of utopia in a moment of suspended disbelief, underwritten by the massive profits of gambling, serves Macao’s present and future as a playground for Mainlanders. A plantation forest of high-rise housing (islands 1, 2, 3 in Figure  1) bears little relation with the region’s rich architectural legacy, but serves a marketing strategy aimed perhaps at local investment opportunities, perhaps at Mainlanders if the present acquisition rules are relaxed. The islands promise a green paradise for recreation, but are largely isolated and inaccessible to Macao’s present population. But, as the planning documents emphasise, {{it may be that the}} realisation of such a utopian vision may spur on a genuine project for a sustainable and livable Macao.|$|R
