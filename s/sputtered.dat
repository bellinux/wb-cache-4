5|$|Because they {{deferred}} their {{selection to}} the second half during the opening coin toss, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the half. The Hokies continued to rotate between quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor during the possession, and picked up two first downs, one {{through the air and}} the other on the ground. After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive <b>sputtered</b> and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and <b>sputtered</b> off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the game, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen by as much as 18 points. In the second quarter the teams {{combined}} to score 63 points, setting records for most points scored in a quarter and a half. The Midshipmen rallied around a strong rushing offense to take the lead at the beginning of the third quarter, and the Mean Green's offensive momentum <b>sputtered</b> during the second half. Navy held the lead for the remainder of the game.|$|E
40|$|Improved {{process for}} {{fabrication}} of integrated circuits developed. Technique utilizes simultaneous ion-beam <b>sputter</b> etching and carbon <b>sputter</b> deposition {{in conjunction with}} carbon <b>sputter</b> mask or organic mask decomposed to produce carbon-rich sputter-mask surface. <b>Sputter</b> etching process replenishes <b>sputter</b> mask with carbon to prevent premature mask loss...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sputtering</b> {{observed}} to occur below the threshold energy of physical <b>sputtering</b> is also often called chemical <b>sputtering.</b> The mechanisms behind such <b>sputtering</b> {{are not always}} well understood, and {{may be hard to}} distinguish from chemical etching. At elevated temperatures, chemical <b>sputtering</b> of carbon can be understood to be due to the incoming ions weakening bonds in the sample, which then desorb by thermal activation. The hydrogen-induced <b>sputtering</b> of carbon-based materials observed at low temperatures has been explained by H ions entering between C-C bonds and thus breaking them, a mechanism dubbed swift chemical <b>sputtering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term {{electronic}} <b>sputtering</b> {{can mean}} either <b>sputtering</b> induced by energetic electrons (for example in a transmission electron microscope), or <b>sputtering</b> due to very high-energy or highly charged heavy ions that lose {{energy to the}} solid, mostly by electronic stopping power, where the electronic excitations cause <b>sputtering.</b> Electronic <b>sputtering</b> produces high <b>sputtering</b> yields from insulators, as the electronic excitations that cause <b>sputtering</b> are not immediately quenched, as {{they would be in}} a conductor. One example of this is Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa, where a MeV sulfur ion from Jupiter's magnetosphere can eject up to 10,000 H2O molecules.|$|R
5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a prelude to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive <b>sputtered</b> out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|The Bearcats' second {{possession}} {{of the second half}} was more successful than their first. On the first play of the drive, running back Jacob Ramsey broke free of the Tech defense for a 25-yard run, the longest run of any Cincinnati player in the game. He followed that first-down run by gaining eight more yards on consecutive runs. Pike then ran three yards for a first down at the Tech 44-yard line. There, however, Cincinnati's offense <b>sputtered</b> and could not gain another first down. The Bearcats' punted, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Tech 14-yard line with six seconds remaining in the quarter. The Hokies had time for one play, a 21-yard run by Evans to the Tech 35-yard line. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech had a 13–7 lead over Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|The Overland Campaign was {{a series}} of battles fought in Virginia during May and June 1864. Sigel's and Butler's efforts <b>sputtered,</b> and Grant was left alone to fight Lee. Grant crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, attacking Lee in the Battle of the Wilderness, a three-day battle with many casualties. Rather than retreat as his {{predecessors}} had done, Grant flanked Lee's army to the southeast and attempted to wedge his forces between Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House. Lee's army got to Spotsylvania first and a costly battle ensued, lasting thirteen days. Grant attempted to break through Lee's defenses, resulting in one of the bloodiest assaults of the Civil War, known as the Battle of the Bloody Angle. Unable to break Lee's lines, Grant again flanked the rebels to the southeast, meeting at North Anna, where a battle lasted three days.|$|E
40|$|In {{conjunction}} with our experimental work on saddle field ion <b>sputtering,</b> we {{have attempted to}} apply the Monte Carlo program TRIM (Transport of Ions in Matter) to calculate the <b>sputter</b> yields {{for a variety of}} noble gas <b>sputtering</b> applications. Comparison with experiments are shown. Information extracted from these analyses have proved useful in optimizing the experimental <b>sputtering</b> parameters. Calculated <b>sputter</b> yields obtained utilizing TRIM are presented for noble gas <b>sputtering</b> of a variety of materials common to nuclear target production...|$|R
40|$|Surface <b>sputtering</b> is {{explained}} theoretically {{by means of}} a 3 -body <b>sputtering</b> mechanism involving the ion and two surface atoms of the solid. By means of quantum-statistical mechanics, a formula for the <b>sputtering</b> ratio S(E) is derived from first principles. The theoretical <b>sputtering</b> rate S(E) was found experimentally to be proportional to the square of the difference between incident ion energy and the threshold energy for <b>sputtering</b> of surface atoms at low ion energies. Extrapolation of the theoretical <b>sputtering</b> formula to larger ion energies indicates that S(E) reaches a saturation value and finally decreases at high ion energies. The theoretical <b>sputtering</b> ratios S(E) for wolfram, tantalum, and molybdenum are compared with the corresponding experimental <b>sputtering</b> curves in the low energy region from threshold <b>sputtering</b> energy to 120 eV above the respective threshold energy. Theory and experiment are shown to be in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Potential <b>sputtering</b> erosion {{caused by}} the {{interactions}} between spacecraft and plasma plume of Hall thrusters is a concern for electric propulsion. In this study, calculation model of Hall thruster’s plume and <b>sputtering</b> erosion is presented. The model is based on three dimensional hybrid particle-in-cell and direct simulation Monte Carlo method (PIC/DSMC method) which is integrated with plume-wall <b>sputtering</b> yield model. For low-energy heavy-ion <b>sputtering</b> in Hall thruster plume, the Matsunami formula for the normal incidence <b>sputtering</b> yield and the Yamamura angular dependence of <b>sputtering</b> yield are used. The validation of the simulation model is realized through comparing plume results with the measured data. Then, SPT- 70 ’s <b>sputtering</b> erosion on satellite surfaces is assessed and effect of mass flow rate on <b>sputtering</b> erosion is analyzed...|$|R
25|$|Virginia {{dominated}} {{the first quarter}} jumping out to a 27–0 lead. Pittsburgh's offense <b>sputtered</b> throughout the contest allowing the Cavaliers {{to take advantage of}} excellent field position. Jameel Sewell went 16 of 31 for 169yards and three touchdowns while Cedric Peerman continued excelling on the ground with 87yards on 24 carries.|$|E
25|$|With Tony Romo on {{the sidelines}} with a broken finger, former Buccaneer Brad Johnson started at quarterback for the Cowboys. Dallas' first three drives went 3-and-out, and Johnson's passing game <b>sputtered.</b> Meanwhile, Jeff Garcia twice drove the Buccaneers into the red zone, and two Matt Bryant field goals put Tampa Bay ahead 6–0.|$|E
25|$|NIF is also {{exploring}} {{new types}} of targets. Previous experiments generally used plastic ablators, typically polystyrene (CH). NIF's targets also are constructed by coating a plastic form {{with a layer of}} <b>sputtered</b> beryllium or beryllium-copper alloys, and then oxidizing the plastic out of the center. In comparison to traditional plastic targets, beryllium targets offer higher overall implosion efficiencies for the indirect-drive mode where the incoming energy {{is in the form of}} x-rays.|$|E
40|$|Silicon nitride {{films were}} {{deposited}} by RF <b>sputtering</b> on {{304 stainless steel}} substrates in a planar RF <b>sputtering</b> apparatus. The <b>sputtering</b> was performed from a Si 3 N 4 target in a <b>sputtering</b> atmosphere of argon and nitrogen. The rate of deposition, {{the composition of the}} coatings, the surface microhardness and the adhesion of the coatings to the substrates were investigated {{as a function of the}} process parameters, such as: substrate target distance, fraction nitrogen in the <b>sputtering</b> atmosphere and <b>sputtering</b> pressure. Silicon rich coating was obtained for fraction nitrogen below 0. 2. The rate of deposition decreases continuously with increasing fraction nitrogen and decreasing <b>sputtering</b> pressure. It was found that the adherence of the coatings improves with decreasing <b>sputtering</b> pressure, almost independently of their composition...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} formula is {{developed for the}} evolution of angular dependence of <b>sputtering</b> yields by extending the theory of <b>sputtering</b> yield proposed by Sigmund. We demonstrate that the peak of <b>sputtering</b> yield at oblique incidence can be attributed to a balance between the increased energy deposited on the surface by incident ion which enhances the <b>sputtering</b> yield and the decreased depth travelled by recoil atom which reduces the <b>sputtering</b> yield. The predicted dependence of <b>sputtering</b> yield on the incident angle is in good agreement with experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|At {{energies}} of approximately 1 keV/amu, solar-wind protons and heavy ions {{interact with the}} lunar surface materials via a number of microscopic interactions that include <b>sputtering.</b> Solar-wind induced <b>sputtering</b> is a main mechanism by which {{the composition of the}} topmost layers of the lunar surface can change, dynamically and preferentially. This work concentrates on <b>sputtering</b> induced by solar-wind heavy ions. <b>Sputtering</b> associated with slow (speeds the electrons speed in its first Bohr orbit) and highly charged ions are known to include both kinetic and potential <b>sputtering.</b> Potential <b>sputtering</b> enjoys some unique characteristics that makes it of special interest to lunar science and exploration. Unlike the yield from kinetic <b>sputtering</b> where simulation and approximation schemes exist, the yield from potential <b>sputtering</b> is not as easy to estimate. This work will present a preliminary numerical scheme designed to estimate potential <b>sputtering</b> yields from reactions relevant to this aspect of solar-wind lunar-surface coupling...|$|R
25|$|Jon Gruden's era in Tampa Bay {{began at}} home against new {{division}} rival, the New Orleans Saints, a team they'd soundly beaten the year before. Though heralded for his offensive expertise, the Buccaneers offense <b>sputtered</b> and was anemic {{for the first three}} quarters. The Saints held a 20–10 lead late in the fourth quarter, while Tampa Bay's offense had only 161 yards through three periods, and quarterback Brad Johnson was sacked three times, on a hot, humid 90° afternoon.|$|E
25|$|PCBs {{intended}} for extreme environments {{often have a}} conformal coating, which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were wax; modern conformal coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be <b>sputtered</b> onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber. The chief disadvantage of conformal coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.|$|E
25|$|Buell, {{several miles}} behind the action, was unaware {{that a major}} battle was taking place and did not send any {{reserves}} to the front {{until late in the}} afternoon. The Union troops on the left flank, reinforced by two brigades, stabilized their line, and the Confederate attack <b>sputtered</b> to a halt. Later, three Confederate regiments assaulted the Union division on the Springfield Pike but were repulsed and fell back into Perryville. Union troops pursued, and skirmishing occurred in the streets until dark. By that time, Union reinforcements were threatening the Confederate left flank. Bragg, short of men and supplies, withdrew during the night, and continued the Confederate retreat by way of Cumberland Gap into East Tennessee.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} two <b>sputter</b> sources, i. e. an ANIS and an {{inverted}} <b>sputter</b> source are described. The ANIS {{has been changed}} into a SNICS-like configuration and measurements of the output current for different <b>sputter</b> target geometries are presented. In the inverted <b>sputter</b> source an immersion lens was placed between the ionizer and the <b>sputter</b> target. This source is provided with a modified revolving target head with eight targets...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{variation}} of <b>sputtering</b> yields with surface morphologies {{under the assumption}} of a specially prescribed surface shape. Compared with a flat surface, we show that surface morphology can cause {{a decrease in the}} <b>sputtering</b> yield and an increase in the incident angle where <b>sputtering</b> yield is maximum. Based on Sigmund’s theory, an analytical formula for the morphology dependent <b>sputtering</b> yield is developed by averaging the curvature dependent <b>sputtering</b> yield. The predicted dependence of <b>sputtering</b> yield on surface morphology is in good agreement with experimental observations.

25|$|The {{third stage}} is {{important}} to determine {{the quality of the}} deposited films. The high energetic species ablated from the target are bombarding the substrate surface and may cause damage to the surface by sputtering off atoms from the surface but also by causing defect formation in the deposited film. The <b>sputtered</b> species from the substrate and the particles emitted from the target form a collision region, which serves as a source for condensation of particles. When the condensation rate is high enough, a thermal equilibrium can be reached and the film grows on the substrate surface {{at the expense of the}} direct flow of ablation particles and the thermal equilibrium obtained.|$|E
25|$|In the race, Harvard {{took the}} early lead {{out of the}} gate with Yale second. Both of the leaders’ strokes were long and slow while Cornell stuck to its stroke. At the half mile mark, Yale edged in front of Harvard but could not hold the lead form a surging Cornell who took a half boat lead {{by the end of the}} first mile. The Courtney-coached crew {{continued}} to build on their lead while Harvard <b>sputtered</b> and fell well behind Yale. Throughout the race, Cornell’s coxswain, Freddie Colson, motivated his teammates by reminding them of what their critic had said about them before the race. About a half mile from the finish, Yale tried to make a move but it was too lateCornell won by 3 lengths.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their thermionic emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no thermionic emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the <b>sputtered</b> material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
40|$|New {{simulation}} {{results for the}} <b>sputtering</b> of lunar soil surface by solar-wind protons and heavy ions will be presented. Previous {{simulation results}} showed that the <b>sputtering</b> process has significant effects and {{plays an important role in}} changing the surface chemical composition, setting the erosion rate and the <b>sputtering</b> process timescale. In this new work and in light of recent data, we briefly present some theoretical models which have been developed to describe the <b>sputtering</b> process and compare their results with recent calculation to investigate and differentiate the roles and the contributions of potential (or electrodynamic) <b>sputtering</b> from the standard (or kinetic) <b>sputtering...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this article, inert-gas {{condensation}} {{was used}} to synthesize Co-W clusters. The formation, structure, and magnetic properties of the clusters were investigated. Sub- 10 -nm clusters were obtained, and the structures and average sizes were strongly dependent on <b>sputtering</b> power. At low <b>sputtering</b> powers, the clusters were predominantly amorphous, while, at high <b>sputtering</b> power, the clusters were crystalline. X ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy revealed clusters with hcp structure at high <b>sputtering</b> power.

40|$|Results of {{experiments}} to study ion beam <b>sputter</b> polishing {{in conjunction with}} simultaneous deposition as a mean of polishing copper surfaces are presented. Two types of simultaneous ion <b>sputter</b> polishing and deposition were used in these experiments. The first type utilized <b>sputter</b> polishing simultaneous with vapor deposition, and the second type utilized <b>sputter</b> polishing simultaneous with <b>sputter</b> deposition. The etch and deposition rates of both techniques were studied, {{as well as the}} surface morphology and surface roughness...|$|R
25|$|If {{graphite}} is used, {{the gross}} erosion rates due to {{physical and chemical}} sputtering would be many meters per year, so one must rely on redeposition of the <b>sputtered</b> material. The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with {{the location of the}} sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary plasma-facing material (PFM) in a commercial reactor.|$|E
25|$|The score {{remained}} unchanged {{through the second}} period, although Detroit had numerous scoring chances. The Penguins' Fleury stopped 16 Detroit shots in the frame, and caught a break as Mikael Samuelsson hit the post on a breakaway. The Penguins came out with strong defence in the third period, and the Detroit offence <b>sputtered,</b> at one point going over ten minutes without a shot. Midway through the third period, the Penguins earned a power play opportunity after Jonathan Ericsson was called for interference. At 10:29, Sergei Gonchar drilled a slapshot from near the blue line, which sailed through traffic and beat a screened Chris Osgood to give the Penguins the lead. Detroit could not mount a late surge with the extra attacker on the ice, and Talbot added an empty net goal at 19:03 for his second of the game to seal the victory.|$|E
25|$|Back home in Nashville on December 13, the Predators {{fell into}} a three-goal hole {{by the start of}} the second period against St. Louis thanks to Brad Hunt, Ryan Reaves and Kevin Shattenkirk. The Predators – with goals by Fisher (who scored two goals), Forsberg, Johansen, Neal and Ribeiro – rallied with six {{unanswered}} goals to defeat the Blues 6–3 on December 13. Two nights later, Nashville, with goals from Ellis and Fisher, held Minnesota to a one-goal lead through the third period. As the Wild's offense <b>sputtered</b> through the final two periods, however, former Predators goalie Devan Dubnyk picked up the slack with 34 saves and the Wild, thanks to two empty net goals, beat the Predators 5–2. Capping the week on December 17 against the New York Rangers, the Predators tied the score with a second period goal by team captain Fisher, but their miserable run in overtime continued as former Predator Jimmy Vesey scored the first goal in the shootout, and the Rangers won 2–1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sputtering</b> {{can also}} play a role in reactive-ion etching (RIE), a plasma process carried out with {{chemically}} active ions and radicals, for which the <b>sputtering</b> yield may be enhanced significantly compared to pure physical <b>sputtering.</b> Reactive ions are frequently used in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) equipment to enhance the <b>sputter</b> rates. The mechanisms causing the <b>sputtering</b> enhancement are not always well understood, although the case of fluorine etching of Si has been modeled well theoretically.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Sputtering</b> rate Sr was {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} parameter instead of <b>sputtering</b> yield Y to calibrate the <b>sputtering</b> ability of the target, defined as the mass loss of the target per unit time and <b>sputtering</b> current. The approach is more reliable for glow discharge processes since the intense backscattering effect was taken into consideration. The effects of processing parameters on Sr were investigated through orthogonal test, {{the results indicated that}} target temperature affects Sr obviously, and among the discharge parameters, the target voltage and discharge pressure were the governing factors. Through regression analysis, the <b>sputtering</b> rate Sr was expressed as a function of <b>sputtering</b> voltage and discharge pressure which could be used to evaluate or predict the real output of the <b>sputtering</b> target...|$|R
