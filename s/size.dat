5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species {{can be divided into}} two distinct <b>size</b> classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger <b>size</b> class. The <b>size</b> of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger <b>size</b> class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct <b>size</b> classes, small and large, with the large <b>size</b> class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both <b>size</b> classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger <b>size</b> class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller <b>size</b> class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for the {{automatic}} <b>sizing</b> of ana-log integrated circuits is presented. Basic <b>sizing</b> rules, re-presenting circuit knowledge, are set up before the <b>sizing</b> and are introduced as structural constraints into the <b>sizing</b> process. Systematic consideration of these structural con-straints during the automatic <b>sizing</b> prevents pathologically <b>sized</b> circuits and speeds up the automatic <b>sizing.</b> The siz-ing is done with a sensitivity-based, iterative trust region method. ...|$|R
5|$|Generally the whorls of {{the shell}} {{increase}} rather regularly in <b>size,</b> however, species which are probably closely related, such as A. sinistralis (Reeve) and A. heccarii Tapparone-Canefri, can have quite different degrees of whorl increment. No attempt {{has been made to}} express these differences meristically, since most of the available material was inadequate for statistical treatment. Actual dimensions {{of the shell}} vary greatly both within and between species. The minimum adult <b>size</b> is about 21mm high, the observed maximum about 75mm. There is not much variation in adult <b>size</b> within species: only a few species, notably A. maculiferus, A. sinensis and A. entobaptus, have a variation in adult <b>size</b> that is greater than seven or eight millimeters in total.|$|E
5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ trees for all on-disk structures including metadata and file data. Metadata and file data are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. The file <b>size,</b> number of files in a folder, total volume <b>size</b> and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file <b>size</b> of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 × 1018 folders and a maximum volume <b>size</b> of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder <b>size</b> (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names and file paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode text string.|$|E

40|$|Using {{orthogonal}} array {{method and}} analysis of variance, the <b>sizing</b> process for Water-jet Looms is fully investigated {{and the effects of}} four main factors and their interactions on the properties of <b>sized</b> filaments in wet are also analyzed. Among mechanical parameters, the abrasion-proof decreases very much, and the strength goes down slightly, but the elongation hardly changes in wet condition comparing with that in dry one. The type of <b>sizing</b> agents affects the properties of <b>sized</b> filaments most significantly. The properties of filaments <b>sized</b> by various <b>sizing</b> agents are quite different. <b>Sizing</b> agent No. 1 is the best one. The interactions between factors in <b>sizing</b> process also affected the properties of <b>sized</b> filaments. However, changing the single factor hardly causes the influence for the properties of <b>sized</b> filaments significantly. The optimum <b>sizing</b> conditions are suggested. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|R

5|$|Note {{that the}} overall <b>size</b> and crest <b>size</b> also {{corresponds}} to age. Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>sizing</b> constituent distribution on {{the properties of}} <b>sized</b> glass fibres (GFs) and corresponding polypropylene (PP) composites was studied by two-stage <b>sizing</b> application, i. e. applying silane coupling agent and polymeric film former at separate stages and with different sequences, in comparison with one-stage <b>sizing</b> application usually used. Surface properties of <b>sized</b> GFs and transverse tensile strength of unidirectional GF reinforced composites were studied using various surface and interface analysis methods and tensile testing, respectively. Two-stage technology achieved <b>sized</b> GFs with lower loss-on-ignition (LOI) and resulted in poor fibre-matrix adhesion strength. However, applying silane coupling agent at the first <b>sizing</b> stage with an increased roller speed achieved <b>sized</b> GFs with lower LOI but composites with mechanical properties quite close to those of composites based on one-stage technology. Moreover, the difference in surface properties of <b>sized</b> GFs is {{discussed in terms of}} the wetting ability difference of <b>sizing</b> constituents and the interactions between <b>sizing</b> components...|$|R

5|$|The {{computational}} {{difficulty of}} the clique problem has led it {{to be used to}} prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given <b>size</b> is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique <b>size.</b> However, the <b>size</b> of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique <b>size,</b> exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the clique <b>size.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an algorithm, {{based on the}} fixed point iteration, to solve for <b>sizes</b> and biases using transistor compact models such as BSIM 3 v 3, BSIM 4, PSP and EKV.

They allow to compute transistors <b>sizes</b> and biases based on transistor compact models while respecting designer’s hypothe- ses. Computed <b>sizes</b> and biases are accurate, and guarantee the correct electrical behavior as expected by the designer. <b>Sizing</b> and biasing operators interface with a Spice-like simulator, allowing possible use of all available compact models for circuit <b>sizing</b> and biasing over different technologies.
