50|$|The {{combined}} area of {{the phase}} plug slots is typically about one-eighth to one-tenth of the {{area of the}} diaphragm. This gives a pressure-to-volume velocity change ratio in the range of 8:1 to 10:1, which serves to match the impedance of the diaphragm to the horn throat. A larger <b>slot</b> <b>area</b> admits more sound wave energy but also reflects more energy backward onto the diaphragm. A smaller <b>slot</b> <b>area</b> traps more wave energy between the phase plug and the diaphragm. In researching the diaphragm/phase plug interface, David Gunness found that only half the wave energy, at best, travels directly from the diaphragm through the phase plug slots and out to the listener. The other half (or more) causes cancellations within the space between the diaphragm and the phase plug, or causes temporal anomalies (time smear) upon leaving the phase plug later than the direct sound. To minimize the problem, Gunness modeled the behavior mathematically and used digital signal processing to apply a polarity-reversed version of the undesired wave behavior to the original audio signal.|$|E

A single-feed configuration based asymmetric-circular shaped slotted square microstrip patches are adopted to realize the compact circularly polarized microstrip antenna. The CP radiation {{can be achieved by}} slightly asymmetric patch along the diagonal directions by <b>slot</b> <b>areas.</b> Four symmetric-slits are also embedded symmetrically along the orthogonal directions of the asymmetric-circular shaped slotted patch to further reduce antenna size. The operating frequency of the antenna can be tuned by varying the slit length while keeping the CP radiation unchanged.

HEFSMs are those that consists all the excitation flux sources at their stator with robust rotor structure.

This design gives the clear advantage of shorter end winding compared to the toothed rotor as there is no overlap winding between field excitation coil (FEC) and armature coil.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} microstrip circuits {{and components}} with a <b>slotted</b> <b>area</b> {{on the ground}} plane. In recent years, various slot geometries have {{been placed on the}} ground plane with the purpose of reducing harmonics, producing frequency pass/stop-bands, and enhancing coupling effects. Among several ground slot geometries, a dumbbell shaped slot (DSS) is attractive because of its simple structure and easy analysis. The DSS and its applications to RF/microwave filters are studied and discussed. A lumped equivalent circuit model of the dumbbell shaped ground slot is introduced by utilizing resonator and filter theories. The accuracy of the equivalent circuit model is demonstrated through the comparison of circuit simulations and measurements. A lowpass filter (LPF) using slotted ground structure (SGS) with dumbbell shape is designed and measured to validate its theories. By using SGS techniques presented in this thesis, some other RF/microwave components such as a periodic structure, ultra-wideband bandpass filter (UWB-BPF), and rectenna with SGS-LPF are designed and tested...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the German research project AGTurbo the influence of slot flows associated with cooling configurations were investigated experimentally. One interesting result of this work was the severe enhancement of the horse shoe vortex by the coolant dependent on the slot’s position and the ejected mass. Based on these results, further promising film cooling configurations with slot ejection were investigated numerically. Setting up the numerical studies was a challenging task since a very detailed model of the slot, the supply cavity, and the supply tubes had to be generated. Tests proved that smallest deviations against the experiment resulted in completely different flow structures. Nevertheless, the secondary flow structure as well as the aerodynamic parameters could be modeled excellently. According to the velocity field in front of a plane turbine cascade, higher wall pressure arises upstream of the leading edge region of the blades while the pressure drops to a minimum {{in the center of the}} passage. To avoid excessive ejection of coolant in the low pressure region the reduction of the local <b>slot</b> <b>area</b> is an appropriate method to decrease the slot mass flow in this particular area. An iterative method is introduced considering the desired mass flow rate and the prevailing total pressure in order to calculate the <b>slot</b> <b>area</b> and to avoid reverse flow.
