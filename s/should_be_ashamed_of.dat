500|$|According to US Attorney Donald Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{investigators}} {{found that the}} hanging of the nooses [...] "had all the markings of a hate crime". But, {{it could not be}} prosecuted as such since juveniles are rarely prosecuted in the federal system, and this offense did not meet departmental standards for charges to be brought. La Salle Parish District Attorney J. Reed Walters stated that Washington had found no federal statute under which the teens could be prosecuted, just as he had found no applicable state statute. Walters opined: [...] "The people that [...] <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> what they unleashed on this town." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Daniels, {{who wrote}} the script, {{received}} a nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards. Steve Carell had also submitted this episode for consideration for his nomination for Outstanding Lead in a Comedy Series. Daniels eventually lost to Jeffrey Richman and Steven Levitan of Modern Family for the episode [...] "Caught in the Act", while Carell lost to Jim Parsons of The Big Bang Theory. Office star Rainn Wilson expressed anger on Twitter at the Academy for these decisions, saying [...] "The world of TV <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> itself that Steve Carell never won an Emmy for Michael Gary Scott. Goodnight." [...] Former Office writer Michael Schur and director Paul Feig also criticized this choice with Schur calling it a [...] "goddamn fucking embarrassment". Daniels had also received a nomination for the , but once again lost to Richman and Levitan.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Beatty {{convinced}} cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki {{and film}} critic Leonard Maltin to make The Dick Tracy TV Special for Turner Classic Movies, which featured Beatty as Tracy having a retrospective interview with Maltin. Maltin explicitly asks the fictional Tracy if Warren Beatty is planning on making {{a sequel to}} the 1990 film and he responds that he's heard about that but Maltin needs to ask Beatty himself. By March 2009, Tribune was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and lawyers for the company began to declare their ownership of television and film rights to Dick Tracy. [...] "Mr. Beatty's conduct and wrongful claims have effectively locked away certain motion picture and television rights to the Dick Tracy property," [...] lawyers for Tribune wrote in a filing. Fields responded that it was [...] "a nuisance lawsuit by a bankrupt company and they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|True to his word, Buckner {{never again}} met Bradley {{in a joint}} debate. Rumors began to {{circulate}} that Buckner was afraid to meet Bradley in debate again, and Bradley did little to dispel these rumors. The Democrats were not completely united throughout the campaign, with prominent members of the party, including Milton J. Durham and State Senator Albert Seaton Berry, criticizing the Democratic record in the state. The Democratic Henderson Gleaner was also critical, opining [...] "We <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> ourselves." [...] Throughout the state, Bradley hammered {{the issue of the}} blind trust afforded the perennial Democratic officeholders, specifically calling for an examination of the treasury. Though Bradley lost the election by more than 16,000 votes, he made the best showing of any Republican gubernatorial candidate to that time and garnered strong support from the state's black voters. His concerns about the state treasury proved valid: When Buckner ordered an audit of the treasurer's books in 1888, Treasurer James [...] "Honest Dick" [...] Tate fled with $250,000 from the state treasury. He was never found.|$|E
500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

500|$|Several NBA {{players and}} coaches said the brawl was the worst fight they had ever seen. Pacers fans began {{to refer to the}} team as [...] "the Thugs". Pistons CEO Tom Wilson later stated that Artest's action took away {{physical}} barriers, such as tables and benches, that normally separate fans and players, and Indianapolis Star reporter Mark Montieth claimed [...] that [...] "in a way, [...] provoked [...] passively by lying down". In the post-game commentary on ESPN's NBA Shootaround, ESPN's studio analysts laid the blame on the Pistons' fans instead of on the players. John Saunders of ESPN referred to the fans as [...] "a bunch of punks". [...] Tim Legler said that [...] "the fans crossed the line". Stephen A. Smith stated that [...] "They <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> themselves and some of them (the fans) should be arrested as far as I'm concerned". Their commentary prompted ESPN vice president Mark Shapiro to place calls to host Saunders, as well as analysts Legler, Smith, and Greg Anthony. Shapiro felt their commentary was biased. The following Tuesday, Shapiro stated, [...] "I wish the studio hadn't laid the blame solely {{on the backs of the}} fans Friday night." ...|$|E
2500|$|Krugman {{wrote in}} March 2013 that by {{neglecting}} public investment {{and failing to}} create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: [...] "Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> what we're doing to the next generation's economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much." [...] Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could {{affect the quality of}} education and competitiveness of younger Americans.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 September 1877 in Benalla, Kelly, while drunk, {{was arrested}} for riding over a {{footpath}} and locked-up for the night. The next day, while he was escorted by four policemen, he absconded and ran, taking refuge in a shoemaker's shop. The police and the shop owner tried to handcuff him but failed. During the struggle Kelly's trousers were ripped off. Trying to get Kelly to submit and taking advantage of his torn trousers, the Irish-born Constable Thomas Lonigan, whom Kelly later murdered at Stringybark Creek, [...] "black-balled" [...] him (grabbed and squeezed his testicles). During the struggle, a miller walked in, and on seeing the behaviour of the police said [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> yourselves." [...] He then tried to pacify the situation and induced Kelly {{to put on the}} handcuffs. Kelly was charged with being drunk and assaulting police, and fined ₤3 1s, which included damage to the uniforms.|$|E

"I <b>should</b> have <b>been</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> myself," [...] said Miss Dawkins, bristling up, and {{throwing}} back {{her head as}} she stood, [...] "if I had allowed any consideration to have prevented my visiting such a spot.

2500|$|On February 10, 1969, New York City was pummeled with [...] of snow. On {{the first}} day alone, 14 people died and 68 were injured. Within a day, the mayor was criticized for giving favored {{treatment}} to Manhattan {{at the expense of}} the other boroughs. Charges were made that a city worker elicited a bribe to clean streets in Queens. Over a week later, streets in eastern Queens still had remained unplowed by the city, enraging the borough's residents, many who felt that the city's other boroughs always took a back seat to Manhattan. Lindsay traveled to Queens, but his visit was not well received. His car could not make its way through Rego Park, and even in a four-wheel-drive truck, he had trouble getting around. In Kew Gardens Hills, the mayor was booed; one woman screamed, [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> yourself." [...] In Fresh Meadows, a woman told the mayor: [...] "Get away, you bum." [...] Later during his walk through Fresh Meadows, another woman called him 'a wonderful man", prompting the mayor to respond: [...] "And you’re a wonderful woman, not like those fat Jewish broads up there," [...] pointing to women in a nearby building who had criticized him. The blizzard, dubbed the [...] "Lindsay Snowstorm", prompted a political crisis that became [...] "legendary in the annals of municipal politics" [...] as the scenes conveyed a message that the mayor of New York City was indifferent to the middle class and poor citizens of the city.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the film}} was predominantly negative, with both Variety and People panning the film.

6000|$|But by {{this time}} Everard had the book in his hand. [...] "Lucretius?"
