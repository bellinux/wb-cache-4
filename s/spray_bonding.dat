40|$|Abstract: In Cold <b>Spray,</b> <b>bonding</b> {{is formed}} between {{substrate}} and the particles and between particles by impact which causes material deformation and temperature rise. During impact process, plastic deformation and frictional interaction of materials generate heat and strains/stresses. In this paper, a numerical study on multiple particles deposition process {{show that the}} plastic equivalent strain (von misses stress) and the temperature values, compare to a single particle impact under same conditions, are higher in multiple particles compared to a single particle impact. Based on this observation, {{there is a possibility}} of the bonding mechanism for the whole film coating better explained using the multiple particles modeling than is predicted using single particle analysis However the actual impacting mechanism in the multiple particle interaction is not yet fully understood and still requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Series Editor’s Note: This {{series of}} {{articles}} is dedicated to Prof. Peter K. Stein, {{in honor of his}} distinguished 40 -year career as the leading educator in the engineering of measurement systems for test and evaluation. The authors are privileged to be students of Prof. Stein more years and more data channels ago than they care to remember! The basic assumption for this series is that thereader has at least a cursory familiarity with mea-surement systems for strain, under laboratory con-ditions, with both foil and wire bonded resistance strain gages. This basic familiarity includes adhesive, ce-ramic and flame <b>spray</b> <b>bonding</b> techniques; standard wiring methods; and standard signal conditioning approaches. Fur-ther, the authors assume some familiarity with system fre-quency responses. We focus, here, on foil and wire strain gages for the measurement of dynamic strain and the real problems associated with the generation of demonstrably valid dynamic strain data. Piezoresistive and semiconductor strain gages are not discussed here due to their properly infrequent use in structural dynamics testing. Any mention of commercial products in this series implies neither an endorsement nor recommendation by the authors. Products are mentioned to support explanation of funda-mental measurement principles that must be understood if valid dynamic strain data is to be acquired...|$|E

A change in either nozzle diameter or primary gas ﬂow rate brought about a change in the particle momentum and subsequently, a change in splat shape.

40|$|A novel {{mechanistic}} {{approach is}} {{proposed for the}} prediction {{of the life of}} thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems. The life prediction methodology is based on a criterion linked directly to the dominant failure mechanism. It relies on a statistical treatment of the TBC's morphological characteristics, non-destructive stress measurements and on a continuum mechanics framework to quantify the stresses that promote the nucleation and growth of microcracks within the TBC. The last of these accounts for the effects of TBC constituents' elasto-visco-plastic properties, the stiffening of the ceramic due to sintering and the oxidation at the interface between the thermally insulating yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer and the metallic bond coat. The mechanistic approach is used to investigate the effects on TBC life of the properties and morphology of the top YSZ coating, metallic low-pressure plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>bond</b> coat and the thermally grown oxide. Its calibration is based on TBC damage inferred from non-destructive fluorescence measurements using piezo-spectroscopy and on the numerically predicted local TBC stresses responsible for the initiation of such damage.

40|$|NiCoCrAlTaY {{bond coat}} was {{deposited}} by cold spraying to assemble thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). The microstructure of the cold-sprayed bond coat was examined using scanning electron microscopy. TBCs consisting of cold-sprayed bond coat and plasma-sprayed YSZ were pretreated at different con-ditions to form different thermally grown oxides (TGOs) before thermal cycling test. The {{influence of the}} TGO composition on the thermal cyclic lifetime was quantitatively examined through the measurement of the coverage ratio of the mixed oxides on the bond coat surface. The {{results showed that the}} bond coat exhibited a dense oxidation-free microstructure, and TGOs in different morphologies and constituents were present after thermal cyclic test. The formation of TGOs was significantly influenced by pre-treatment conditions. Two kinds of TGO were detected on the surface of bond coat after the spallation of YSZ coatings. One is the a-Al 2 O 3 -based TGO and the other is the mixed oxide. It was found that the thermal cyclic lifetime is inversely proportional to the coverage ratio of the mixed oxides formed at the bond coat/YSZ interface. The high coverage ratio of the mixed oxide on the interface leads to the early spalling of YSZ coating.

40|$|Low Pressure Cold Gas Dynamic Spray (LPCGDS) is a {{coating process}} that utilises kinetic energy instead of thermal energy to deposit powder {{particles}} (1 - 50 μm) to substrates at low temperatures (< 400 oC) {{without going through}} melting. The deposited coatings provide improved wear and corrosion protection to underlying surfaces while maintaining the original phase structure of the particles and minimising oxide formation and residual stresses associated with conventional thermal spray processes such as flame, arc and plasma <b>spraying.</b> <b>Bonding</b> occurs when particles impact velocities on the substrates exceed a certain critical velocity. This critical velocity depends on the propellant gas and particles characteristics, and the spray system components (gas supply, gas heater, powder feeder and the supersonic nozzle) design.

In this paper the high temperature oxidation behaviour of NiCoCrAlTaY coatings modified by a PVD surface treatment was evaluated: the coatings, produced by HVOF technique, were protected by an Al 2 O 3 -PVD sputtered overlay prior to top coating with YSZ ceramic layer, and were exposed in air at 1100 °C up to 400 hours. The oxidation kinetics were evaluated by measuring the thickness of TGO (Thermally Grown Oxide) scale at the several exposure times and the microstructural evolution induced by the heat treatments was invetigated. The effect of the presence of the Al 2 O 3 -PVD overlay, in terms of oxidation resistance and microstructural evolution, was assessed by comparing the performance of modified TBCs with unprotected NiCoCrAlTaY systems. The kinetics data showed that the Al 2 O 3 -PVD overlay enhances the oxidation resistance of NiCoCrAlTaY coatings and promotes the adhesion between bond and top coat. A thermo-mechanical finite element model of the modified TBC system was also developed: the growth of the oxide scale was modelled and the previously assessed oxidation kinetics were implemented. The finite element analysis allowed to estimate the effects of the PVD film on the mechanical stress field of the TBC system: results showed that the decrease of oxidation rate induced by the PVD oxide film reduces the stress state in the ceramic top coat and at the TGO-YSZ interface, thus potentially improving the durability of the thermal barrier...|$|R

In addition, the <b>bond</b> coat was <b>sprayed</b> on either by a high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) or a low pressure plasma spray (LPPS). The residual adhesion strength of the TBC top coat was evaluated {{as a function of the}} number of thermal cycles by the modified 4 -point bending test. In addition, SEM observations of thermal fatigue cracking morphologies and measurements of the residual stress in the ceramic top coat were carried out. The experimental results indicated that, after thermal cycle fatigue, microcracks were generated in the ceramic top coat; however, they were moderated in a rough interface TBC compared to a smooth interface TBC. In addition, the <b>bond</b> coat <b>sprayed</b> by the HVOF method showed a higher resistance to microcracking than the coat sprayed using the LPPS. Residual stress in the ceramic top coat is almost zero at 0 thermal cycles. After thermal cycle fatigue, it becomes compression; however, it is independent of the bond coat. There was little difference in the adhesion strength by bond coat in as-sprayed conditions. On the other hand, the specimen with a rough interface exhibited higher residual adhesion strength after thermal cycle fatigue compared with the specimens with a relatively smooth interface. In addition, if the <b>bond</b> coat is <b>sprayed</b> by HVOF, the residual adhesion strength increases.

The TBC preparation in Japan was based on our technical requirement by plasma <b>spray.</b> <b>Bond</b> coat CoNiCrAlY and the YSZ was produced by low-pressure plasma spray and air plasma spray respectively. Hot corrosion tests were carried out on the TBC with and without Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } coating in molten salts mixtures (Na{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } + 5 %V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 }) at 950 C for 10 h. The microstructures of TBC and overlay before and after exposure were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It has been found that TBC reacted with V{sub 2 }O{sub 5 } to form YVO{sub 4 }. A substantial amount of M-phase was formed due to the leaching of Y{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } from YSZ. Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay coating sprayed by HVOF was dense, continues and adherent to the TBC even after exposure to the molten salts. As a result, overlay Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } coating can prevent the YSZ from the attack by molten salts containing vanadium and arrest the penetration of salts into the YSZ along porous and cracks in the YSZ TBC. Accordingly, the amount of M-phase formed in TBC with Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } overlay was significantly lower than that in conventional YSZ TBC system.
