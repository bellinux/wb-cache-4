5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, <b>sweet</b> <b>corn,</b> and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E

25|$|A {{corn sheller}} or maize sheller, is a machine used to shell or shuck ears of <b>sweet</b> <b>corn</b> of their silk. By feeding ears of <b>sweet</b> <b>corn</b> into a {{concentric}} cylindrical rest, they are {{parallel to the}} axis of the shelling cylinder in a hopper fixed {{on one side of}} the machine. As the cylindrical rest revolves, an ear falls into each space between staves, and is kept in contact with the shelling cylinder by the pressure of the segment concave. The grain shelled falls beneath the machine and the ear of <b>sweet</b> <b>corn</b> is delivered at the side opposite to the hopper, after having been in contact with the cylinder during approximately four or five revolutions. The corn sheller was invented by Lester E. Denison of Sayville, Connecticut who received a patent on August 12, 1839.|$|E

25|$|Nicotinamide may be {{obtained}} from the diet where it is present primarily as NAD+ and NADP+. These are hydrolysed in the intestine and the resulting nicotinamide is absorbed either as such, or following its hydrolysis to nicotinic acid. Nicotinamide is present in nature in only small amounts. In unprepared foods, niacin is present mainly {{in the form of the}} cellular pyridine nucleotides NAD and NADP. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the co-enzymes can occur during the course of food preparation. Boiling releases most of the total niacin present in <b>sweet</b> <b>corn</b> as nicotinamide (up to 55mg/kg).|$|E
25|$|Maize {{spread to}} the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates. It was {{cultivated}} in Spain just a few decades after Columbus's voyages and then spread to Italy, West Africa and elsewhere.

25|$|Maryland has {{large areas}} of fertile {{agricultural}} land in its coastal and Piedmont zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as cucumbers, watermelons, <b>sweet</b> <b>corn,</b> tomatoes, muskmelons, squash, and peas (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). In addition, the southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone, which has existed since early Colonial times but declined greatly after a state government buyout in the 1990s. There is also a large automated chicken-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of the farm land is set aside for student plots. Part of practical agriculture lessons involves students growing and maintaining their own crops, and a practical mark worth 10% of their yearly mark is awarded {{at the end of}} term. Mature crops in the students' assigned plots of land are then the students' to take home. In addition to its use for educational purposes, the farm also supplies a wide variety of agricultural produce including: Cattle - Angus stud, paraded annually at the Castle Hill Show by the Cattle Group, and sold at Camden Sales yard; Sheep - First-cross Ewes & Prime Lambs; Eggs - Free-range eggs; Poultry Meat - Broilers raised and sold onsite, Oranges - Washington Navel; Peaches - Flordagold and Sherman's Red varieties; <b>Sweet</b> <b>Corn</b> - Shimmer variety; James Ruse Gold Rose - A privately crossbred rose variety the rights were donated to the school in 1999 in celebration of its 40 years of teaching; Apiary - Honey sold on-site in jars; and Macadamia Nuts. Various groups of students have been set up to look after these, such as the Poultry Squad and a Weather Watcher group to maintain farm records. In the past, the farm also housed Merino and Border Leicester sheep, named the Sharlea Sheep. It was replaced by the Aquaculture venture, silver perch and a crayfish growing system. Now some students also participate in making peach jam and sorbet after the peach harvest.|$|E

30|$|Eight trained panelists {{participated in}} this study. Rice samples were {{prepared}} by placing rice flour (1  g) in screw capped vials and heating in a water bath at 80 °C for 10  min. Rice was presented in this way to replicate the way the sample and its volatile compounds were later presented for headspace analysis by gas chromatography. Samples were presented to panelists unidentified and in randomised order. Panelists opened {{the lid of the}} vial carefully and smelt the aroma of the heated rices. Panelists then scored the intensity or absence of eight flavour notes on a 3 -point intensity scale. The flavour notes considered were: <b>sweet</b> taste, <b>corn,</b> <b>sweet</b> aromatic, astringent, water-like metallic, sewer/animal, sour/silage and hay-like/musty (Champagne et al. 2010). Panelists were free to record additional aromas they detected.|$|R
