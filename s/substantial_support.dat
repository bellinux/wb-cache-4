Despite its slow start, {{with the first}} Master of Science programs in the 1920s and the first Doctorate in 1946, the program became firmly established. In 1952 alone, around 80students earned graduate degrees while working at EES.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} declaration, {{there was still}} <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> for James in Scotland. Viscount Dundee raised an army in the Scottish Highlands and won a convincing victory at Killiecrankie on 27 July. The huge losses {{suffered}} by Dundee's troops, however, coupled with his fatal wounding {{at the start of}} the battle, served to remove the only effective resistance to William and the uprising was quickly crushed, suffering a resounding defeat the next month at the Battle of Dunkeld.|$|E
5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> from NGOs in the region.|$|E

25|$|John Kelly (June 6, 1901 - December 9, 1947) was an American actor {{whose career}} spanned {{the very end}} of the silent film era through the 1940s.

5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched {{south along}} the Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening her grip on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians were afforded <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> by the French Army. The French 1st Army {{included}} General René Prioux's Cavalry Corps. The Corps {{was given}} the 2nd Light Mechanized Division (2e Division Légère Mécanique, or 2e DLM) and the 3rd Light Mechanized Division (3e DLM), which were allocated to defend the Gembloux gap. The armoured forces consisted of 176 of the formidable SOMUA S35s and 239 Hotchkiss H35 light tanks. Both of these types, in armour and firepower, were superior to most German types. The 3e DLM contained 90 S35s and some 140 H35s alone.|$|E
5|$|The young King {{inherited}} a difficult situation, with {{over half of}} England occupied by the rebels {{and most of his}} father's continental possessions still in French hands. He had <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> from Guala who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels. Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, where Henry gave homage to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord. Pope Honorius declared that Henry was the Pope's vassal and ward, and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom. As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a crusader and so entitled to special protection from Rome.|$|E

5|$|The young King {{inherited}} a difficult situation, with {{over half of}} England occupied by the rebels. He had <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> though from Guala, who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels. Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, during which Henry gave homage to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord. Pope Honorius III declared that Henry was the Pope's vassal and ward, and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom. As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a crusader and thereby entitled to special protection from Rome.|$|E
5|$|During a {{thorough}} study, the national BSA staff interviewed participants, parents, and leaders. They distributed questionnaires to program participants, reviewed the White Stag literature, and observed {{the program in}} action. They also conducted a statistical analysis of troops taking part in White Stag and compared them to non-participating units. In December 1965, Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton received the White Stag Report. It stated that offering leadership development to youth was a unique opportunity for Scouting to provide a practical benefit to youth and would add <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> to Scouting's character development goals. It recommended that Wood Badge {{should be used to}} experiment with the leadership development principles of White Stag. The program had until this time taught the adults the same Scoutcraft skills a boy was required to learn to become a First Class Scout along with concepts of the patrol method.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{a popular}} revolt {{following}} the unrest {{created by the}} Great Depression, wealthy Guatemalan landowners lent their support to Jorge Ubico, who won an uncontested election in 1931. Ubico's regime {{became one of the}} most repressive in the region. He abolished debt peonage, replacing it with a vagrancy law which stipulated that all landless men of working age needed to perform a minimum of 100 days of forced labor annually. He authorized landowners to take any actions they wished against their workers, including executions. Ubico was an admirer of European fascist leaders such as Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, but had to ally with the U.S. for geopolitical reasons, and received <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> from this country throughout his reign. A staunch anti-communist, Ubico reacted to several peasant rebellions with incarcerations and massacres.|$|E
50|$|Toxicodendron radicans rarely grows at altitudes above 1500 m, {{although}} the altitude limit varies in different locations. The plants can grow as a shrub {{up to about}} 1.2 m tall, as a groundcover 10 - 25 cm high, or as a climbing vine on various supports. Older vines on <b>substantial</b> <b>supports</b> send out lateral branches that may be mistaken for tree limbs at first glance.|$|R

5|$|This period {{also saw}} a {{significant}} expansion in Georgia Tech's postgraduate education programs, driven largely by the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik; this effort received <b>substantial</b> <b>support</b> from the EES. Despite its slow start, with the first Master of Science programs in the 1920s and the first Doctorate in 1946, the program became firmly established. In 1952 alone, around 80 students earned graduate degrees while working at EES. Herschel H. Cudd, EES director from 1952 to 1954, created a new promotion system for researchers that is still in use. Many EES researchers held the title of professor despite lacking a doctorate (or a comparable qualification for promotion {{as determined by the}} Georgia Board of Regents), something that irritated members of the teaching faculty. The new system, approved in spring 1953, used the Board of Regents' qualifications for promotion and mirrored the academic tenure track.|$|E

25|$|As the {{election}} of 1920 approached, Wilson momentarily imagined that a deadlocked Democratic convention might nominate him for a third term with a campaign focused on the League of Nations. No one around the President adequately clarified for {{him that he was}} too incapacitated, had insufficient support, and that the League defeat was irreversible. In retirement, Wilson harbored hopes for a White House run in 1924 despite the absence of <b>substantial</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
