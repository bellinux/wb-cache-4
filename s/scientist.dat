40|$|Do {{lay people}} and <b>scientists</b> {{themselves}} recognize that <b>scientists</b> are human and therefore prone to human fallibilities such as error, bias, and even dishonesty? In {{a series of}} three experimental studies and one correlational study (total N = 3, 278) we found that the 'storybook image of the scientist' is pervasive: American lay people and <b>scientists</b> from over 60 countries attributed considerably more objectivity, rationality, open-mindedness, intelligence, integrity, and communality to <b>scientists</b> than other highly-educated people. Moreover, <b>scientists</b> perceived even larger differences than lay people did. Some groups of <b>scientists</b> also differentiated between different categories of scientists: established <b>scientists</b> attributed higher levels of the scientific traits to established <b>scientists</b> than to early-career <b>scientists</b> and PhD students, and higher levels to PhD students than to early-career <b>scientists.</b> Female <b>scientists</b> attributed considerably higher levels of the scientific traits to female <b>scientists</b> than to male <b>scientists.</b> A strong belief in the storybook image and the (human) tendency to attribute higher levels of desirable traits to people in one's own group than to people in other groups may decrease scientists' willingness to adopt recently proposed practices to reduce error, bias and dishonesty in science...|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} of the education, training, and age distribution of experienced <b>scientists,</b> engineers, energy-related <b>scientists,</b> and energy-related engineers uses the 1976 National Science Foundation National Sample data on 50, 000 <b>scientists</b> and engineers {{who were in the}} labor force {{at the time of the}} 1970 Census. The energy-related <b>scientists</b> and engineers have characteristics quite similar to those of all <b>scientists</b> and engineers. However, energy-related <b>scientists</b> and engineers report slightly higher educational attainment as well as a higher incidence of supplemental training. Energy-related engineers generally are not much older than their counterparts who did not report energy-related work. Energy-related <b>scientists,</b> however, are older than their counterparts and can be expected to experience losses from death and retirement at a rate about 12 percent higher than the rate for all <b>scientists</b> over the next decade...|$|R
40|$|For this {{research}} project, both natural <b>scientists</b> (33 each from the United States and Canada) and social <b>scientists</b> (32 from the United States and 31 from Canada) were {{interviewed by the}} author from March through November, 1997. (f. 28) The natural-social science dichotomy was used because previous {{research has suggested that}} differences exist between how natural <b>scientists</b> and social <b>scientists</b> perceive the science-policy linkage. (f. 29) For instance, in their work at The Udall Center at the University of Arizona, Helen Ingram et al. point out that in dealing with the formation of environmental policy, natural <b>scientists</b> often portray themselves as outside the political process and as poorly understood by politicians, while social <b>scientists</b> believe that natural <b>scientists</b> wield a great deal more influence than they admit to having. (f. 30) Other scholars have noted differences in training and expertise between natural and social scientists(f. 31) and have argued that a gap 2 ̆ 2 often divides the social sciences and humanities from the physical and biological sciences 2 ̆ 2 (f. 32) such that social <b>scientists</b> are not accorded the same status as natural <b>scientists.</b> (f. 33) It {{is important to note that}} United States natural <b>scientists</b> do not share the majority view that science has had a large influence on our present-day environmental policies. In fact, there is a statistically significant difference between United States natural and United States social <b>scientists</b> and also between United States natural <b>scientists</b> and Canadian natural <b>scientists,</b> with a much smaller percentage of United States natural <b>scientists</b> (48. 5...|$|R

40|$|Highly visible <b>scientists</b> are {{increasingly}} recognised as influential leaders {{with a special}} {{role to play in}} making science part of mainstream society. Through consultation with a panel of 45 experts working at the science–media interface, we sought to identify the most visible <b>scientists</b> currently living and working in South Africa. In total, 211 <b>scientists</b> – less than 1 % of the scientific workforce of the country – were identified as visible in the public sphere. The demographic profile and institutional spread of South Africa’s visible <b>scientists</b> suggest that more should be done to increase the diversity of <b>scientists</b> who are publicly visible. Although only 8 % of South Africans are white, 78 % of the group of visible <b>scientists</b> were white, and 63 % of the visible <b>scientists</b> were men. Only 17 black women were identified as publicly visible <b>scientists.</b> While visible <b>scientists</b> were identified at 42 different research institutions, {{more than half of the}} visible <b>scientists</b> were associated with just four universities. Recent controversies surrounding the two most visible South African <b>scientists</b> identified via this study, and the potential implications for fellow scientists’ involvement in public engagement, are briefly discussed. Significance: This is the first study to identify highly visible <b>scientists</b> in South Africa. The study has meaningful policy implications for mobilising <b>scientists</b> towards public science engagement. It is an important contribution towards the new public engagement framework of the Department of Science and Technology...|$|R
