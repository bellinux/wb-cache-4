40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} an infrared spectroscopic evaluation method <b>of</b> brewed <b>coffee,</b> whose quality and taste highly {{depend on the}} chemical contents, the interactions between the components, the pH value and the temperature, using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory. The objective {{of this study is}} to understand the influences of the pH values and temperature on the spectral features <b>of</b> brewed <b>coffee</b> and the main components, since the component balances of the organic acids originating from coffee beans and being produced during processes such as roasting and extraction could closely relate to the brewed coffee characteristics. The absorption peak <b>sifts</b> <b>of</b> the ATR spectra <b>of</b> brewed <b>coffee</b> were observed as the influences of the pH and temperatures. Therefore, by analyzing the spectra <b>of</b> the <b>coffee</b> components under the various pH and temperature conditions based on the ionic dissociation equilibrium theory, the spectral behavior <b>of</b> the brewed <b>coffee</b> model due to the pH and temperature changes could mainly result from those of the organic acids as the main components. Consequently, the infrared spectral information analysis would be acceptable as a new method to evaluate a profile <b>of</b> brewed <b>coffee</b> for the quality evaluation relating to the taste and the non-intensive on-line monitoring <b>of</b> the <b>coffee</b> process...|$|R

40|$|The {{extraction}} <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> solubles from roasted {{and ground}} coffee {{is a complex}} operation, the understanding of which {{is key to the}} brewing <b>of</b> high quality <b>coffee.</b> This complexity {{stems from the fact that}} brewing <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> is achieved through a wide variety of techniques each of which depends on a large number of process variables. In this paper, we consider a recent, experimentally validated model <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> extraction, which describes extraction from a coffee bed using a double porosity model. The model incorporates dissolution and transport <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> in the coffee bed. The model was shown to accurately describe extraction <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> solubles from grains in two situations: extraction from a dilute suspension <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> grains and extraction from a packed coffee bed. The full model equations can only be solved numerically. In this work we consider asymptotic solutions, based on the dominant mechanisms, in the case <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> extraction from a dilute suspension <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> grains. Extraction in this well mixed system, can be described by a set of ordinary differential equations. This allows analysis of the extraction kinetics from the <b>coffee</b> grains independent <b>of</b> transport processes associated with flow through packed coffee beds. Coffee extraction for an individual grain is controlled by two processes: a rapid dissolution <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> from the grain surfaces in conjunction with a much slower diffusion <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> through the tortuous intragranular pore network to the grain surfaces. Utilising a small parameter resulting from the ratio of these two timescales, we construct asymptotic solutions using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The asymptotic solutions are compared with numerical solutions and data from coffee extraction experiments. The asymptotic solutions depend on a small number of dimensionless parameters, so the solutions facilitate quick investigation of the influence of various process parameters on the coffee extraction curves.
