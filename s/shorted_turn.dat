50|$|The cooking vessel {{typically}} {{needs to}} be made of a suitable stainless steel or iron. The increased magnetic permeability of the material decreases the skin depth, concentrating the current near the surface of the metal, and so the electrical resistance will be further increased. Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil. To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil, it is made from litz wire, which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single <b>shorted</b> <b>turn.</b> This forms a transformer that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. The resistance of the pot, as viewed from the primary coil, appears larger. In turn, most of the energy becomes heat in the high-resistance steel, while the driving coil stays cool.|$|E
50|$|During activation, whilst {{the bulb}} {{is still on}} the pump, an R.F. {{induction}} heating coil connected to a powerful R.F. oscillator operating in the 27 MHz or 40.68 MHz ISM band is positioned around the bulb in the plane of the ring. The coil acts as the primary of a transformer and the ring as a single <b>shorted</b> <b>turn.</b> Large R. F. currents flow in the ring, heating it. The coil is moved along the axis of the bulb so as not to overheat and melt the ring. Once the ring is heated the barium azide decomposes into barium vapor and nitrogen. The nitrogen is pumped out and the barium condenses on the bulb above the plane of the ring forming a mirror like deposit with a large surface area. The powdered glass in the ring melts and entraps any particles which could otherwise escape loose inside the bulb causing later problems. The barium combines with any free gas when activated and continues to act after the bulb is sealed off from the pump. During use, the internal electrodes {{and other parts of the}} tube get hot. This can cause adsorbed gases to be released from metallic parts, such as anodes (plates), grids or non metallic—but porous—parts, such as sintered ceramic parts. The gas is trapped on the large area of reactive barium on the bulb wall and removed from the tube.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Electromagnetic coils {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{engineering}} applications. The magnitude of current (and hence magnetic field strength) is inherently frequency-dependent; above the coil’s breakpoint frequency current reduces in proportion to frequency. This effect often limits the high-frequency performance of devices. A magnetically-coupled conducting loop (“shorted-turn”) may produce beneficial effects of reducing the primary coil’s electrical impedance at high frequencies. This <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> effect was modelled using linear transfer function analysis and shown to have close agreement to experimental frequency-response measurements. Parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the effect of individual shorted-turn variables on the frequency response of a primary coil. Experimental variation of shorted-turn parameters confirmed the theoretical analysis, with thicker-walled, lower-resistance loops providing a more pronounced modification of primary coil response. These results and analysis provide a framework to design shorted-turns within electrical devices to optimise high-frequency behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Induction motors are {{reliable}} and {{widely used in}} industrialised nations. However induction motors, like any other machine, will eventually fail. If the failure is not anticipated, it {{can result in a}} significant revenue loss. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop an efficient maintenance program. The most cost-effective solution is condition-based maintenance. An effective condition-based maintenance program requires an on-line condition monitoring system that can diagnose the condition of an induction motor {{in order to determine the}} types of faults and their severity while the motor is under a normal operating condition. The work in this thesis investigates the detection of stator and rotor faults (i. e. <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> faults, eccentricity faults, and broken rotor bar faults) using three types of sensor signals (i. e. current, leakage flux, and vibration) under different loading conditions. The work is based on an extensive series of sensor measurements taken using a number of nominally identical healthy machines (2. 2 kW) and custom-modified machines (2. 2 kW) with configurable stator and rotor fault settings. The thesis starts by investigating the estimation of rotor speed and rotor slot number. These two parameters are important in determining the fault frequency components that are used for detecting the stator and rotor faults. The rotor speed investigation compares four different estimation methods from the three different sensor signal types. It is found that the speed estimation techniques based on the eccentricity harmonics and the rotor frequency in the stator current, the axial leakage flux, and the motor vibration sensor signals can detect the rotor speed very accurately even when the load is as low as 2 %. Similarly, this thesis proposes three different rotor slot number estimation techniques from the three different types of sensors and demonstrates that all three techniques can estimate the rotor slot number accurately. In addition, it is shown that the reliability of the estimation techniques can be increased significantly when the three techniques are combined. The <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> investigation in this thesis examines and compares potential <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> features in the three sensor signal types under five different fault severities and ten different loading conditions. The useful <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> features are identified in the thesis, and then examined against variations between the healthy machines in order to determine the loads and the fault severities in which the feature can reliably detect the faults. The results show that the feature based on the EPVA (extended Park’s vector approach) is the best method. This feature can detect turn to turn faults with a severity of 3. 5 % or greater at loads greater than 20 % and phase to phase turn faults with a severity of 1. 7 % or greater under all loading conditions. However, estimating the fault severity is generally found to be difficult. The thesis also examines the feasibility of detecting static eccentricity faults using the different types of sensor signals under ten different loading conditions. The thesis compares potential eccentricity features under nine different fault severities. The useful features are identified and then combined through weighted linear combination (WLC) in order to produce a better eccentricity fault indicator. The indicator begins to show significant magnitude variation when the fault severity is greater than or equal to 25 % and the load is greater than or equal to 25 %. The experimental results show that detecting the static eccentricity faults is possible but estimating the fault severity may be difficult. Furthermore, the effects of misalignment faults on the useful eccentricity features are investigated. In this thesis, the analysis of broken rotor bar faults is performed under motor starting and rundown operation. The starting analysis introduces a new approach to detect broken rotor bar faults that utilises the wavelet transform of the envelope of the starting current waveform. The results of the wavelet transform are then processed in order to develop a normalised parameter, called the wavelet indicator. It is found that the wavelet indicator can detect a single broken bar under all loading conditions during motor starting operation. The indicator also increases its magnitude as the severity of the fault increases. On the other hand, the rundown analysis proposes several broken rotor bar fault detection techniques which utilise the induced voltage in the stator windings and the stator magnetic flux linkage after supply disconnection. The experimental results show that detecting the faults during rundown is generally difficult. However, the wavelet approach, which is based on monitoring changes in the motor torque for a given slip, seems to give the best result. Thesis (Ph. D.)

EFFECTS OF SHORTED TURNS IN ROTOR WINDINGS The impact of operating a round rotor generator with rotor winding shorted turns depends upon many factors 1. If the percentage of total turns shorted out is small, the generator may be able to run at rated load for years without further problems. However, larger <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> percentages can cause operating conditions that may limit unit loads. If the problems become severe, forced outages may occur.

40|$|In Permanent Magnet (PM) machines, a turn-turn Short-Circuit (SC) {{fault is}} the most {{critical}} fault to eradicate. The fault introduces high SC current in the <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> which may consequently lead to secondary faults unless the fault is appropriately controlled. This paper proposes feasible conductors’ placement in a slot of PM machine to minimize such turn-turn fault current. In order to minimize the fault current, the conductor arrangement in a slot is optimized using multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) incorporating with both analytical and Finite Element (FE) numerical tool. The possible combinations of conductors’ placement are set as variables and optimized for a given machine which is designed for safety critical applications. It is shown that the fault current associated to a single turn fault can be significant for the random winding placement even though the remedial strategies are put in place. It is also shown that the fault current can be limited significantly by rearranging the winding placement {{in a way to}} share slot-leakage fluxes. This is confirmed via experiment on E-core. Influences of the winding arrangement on both frequency dependent resistances and windings capacitances are experimented. It is demonstrated that adopting the winding arrangement that shares the slot-leakage flux effectively benefits to minimize the AC losses in addition to improved fault tolerance. But it increases the turn-turn capacitances whose effect however can be neglected as the resonance frequency occurs beyond the operational frequency range of the machines of interes...|$|E

When the final version is published, the copy of record will be available at IET Digital LibraryWind turbine manufacturers have introduced to the market a variety of innovative concepts and configurations for generators to maximize energy capture, reduce costs and improve reliability of wind energy. For the purpose of improving reliability and availability, a number of diagnostic methods have been developed. Stator current signature analysis (SCSA) is potentially an effective technique to diagnose faults in electrical machines, and could be used to detect and diagnose faults in wind turbines. In this study, an investigation was conducted into the application of SCSA to detect stator inter-turn faults in an excited synchronous generator and a permanent magnet synchronous generator. It was found from simulation results that, owing to disruption of magnetic field symmetry and imbalance between the current flowing in the <b>shorted</b> <b>turn</b> and the corresponding diametrically opposite turn in the winding, certain harmonic components in the stator current clearly increased as the number of shorted turns increased. The findings are helpful to detect faults involving only a few turns without ambiguity, in spite of the difference in the configuration of the generators. As expected, because of the different type, configuration and operational condition of the two generators studied, detecting faults through the generator current signature requires a particular approach for each generator type...|$|E
