30|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} of indium nanowires by galvanic displacement on a <b>zinc</b> <b>sheet</b> after being treated in concentrated sulphuric acid. The galvanic displacement is usually performed on a plain substrate, in this letter, we found that only nanoparticles grew on the untreated <b>zinc</b> <b>sheets.</b> However, indium nanowires can grow on the <b>zinc</b> <b>sheet</b> after being oxidized in concentrated sulphuric acid. The small holes in the porous ZnO oxide film formed on a treated <b>zinc</b> <b>sheet</b> play a confinement effect or act as a “template” in indium nanowires growth. This illustrates a simple way for the large-scale fabrication of indium nanowires with high purity at a mild condition. Furthermore, the structural characterization and UV properties of the as-prepared indium nanowires are also studied.|$|R

Westmorland slate is of English origin; it has a {{tendency}} to be green in colour, in contrast to the blue-coloured slate from Wales. The slates are doubled-nailed with copper nails. The original 'tile ridging' was replaced in 1941. At the crossing of the roof is a flêche, substantially of pressed zinc on timber framing. This {{is in the form of}} a polygonal shaft with eight trefoil-arched openings, containing louvred vents, surmounted by a tapering conical spire, clad partly with rounded slate, and partly with flat <b>sheet</b> <b>zinc.</b> The flêche is further embellished with a row of projecting decorative elements at the base of the spire, and a Latin cross, once gilded, at the apex.|$|E

With this pile he decomposed sulfate of magnesia (first letter to Abbott, 12 July 1812).In 1821, soon after the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetism, Davy and British scientist William Hyde Wollaston tried, but failed, to design an electric motor. Faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called [...] "electromagnetic rotation". One of these, now known as the homopolar motor, caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy. The resulting controversy within the Royal Society strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday's assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{assessed}} the occupational health and food safety {{risks associated with}} the traditional slaughter of goats and the consumption of such meat in Tshwane, South Africa. Methods: A convenience sample of 105 respondents agreed to be interviewed using structured questionnaires. Results: A high proportion (62. 64 %) of practitioners admitted to not wearing protective clothing during slaughter. Slaughtering was mainly carried out by males (99 %) with experience (62. 2 %). Forty-four percent of practitioners only changed the clothes they wore while slaughtering when they got home. During the actual slaughter, up to seven people may be involved. The majority (58. 9 %) of slaughters occurred {{early in the morning}} and none of the goats were stunned first. In 77. 5 % of cases, the health status of the persons who performed the slaughtering was not known. The majority (57. 3 %) of the slaughters were performed on a corrugated iron roof <b>sheet</b> (<b>zinc</b> plate). In 83. 3 % of the cases, the carcass was hung up to facilitate bleeding, flaying, and evisceration. Meat inspection was not practiced by any of the respondents. Throughout the slaughter process, the majority used the same knife (84. 3) and 84. 7 % only cleaned the knife when it became soiled. A total of 52. 0 % of the respondents processed the carcass and cooked the meat immediately. The majority (80. 0 %) consumed the meat within 30 min of cooking. Conclusions: Men are at a higher risk of occupational health hazards associated with traditional slaughter, which can be transferred to their households. Unhygienic methods of processing and the lack of any form of post-mortem examination increase the risk of food-borne illness following the consumption of such meat.

40|$|It is {{appropriate}} to note that 1988 marks the 100 th anniversary {{of the birth of}} the reflector antenna. It was in 1888 that Heinrich Hertz constructed the first one, a parabolic cylinder made of <b>sheet</b> <b>zinc</b> bent to shape and supported by a wooden frame. Hertz demonstrated the existence of the electromagnetic waves that had been predicted theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell some 22 years earlier. In the 100 years since Hertz's pioneering work the field of electromagnetics has grown explosively: one of the technologies is that of remote sensing of planet Earth by means of electromagnetic waves, using both passive and active sensors located on an Earth Science Geostationary Platform (ESEP). For these purposes some exquisitely sensitive instruments were developed, capable of reaching to the fringes of the known universe, and relying on large reflector antennas to collect the minute signals and direct them to appropriate receiving devices. These antennas are electrically large, with diameters of 3000 to 10, 000 wavelengths and with gains approaching 80 to 90 dB. Some of the reflector antennas proposed for ESGP are also electrically large. For example, at 220 GHz a 4 -meter reflector is nearly 3000 wavelengths in diameter, and is electrically quite comparable with a number of the millimeter wave radiotelescopes that are being built around the world. Its surface must meet stringent requirements on rms smoothness, and ability to resist deformation. Here, however, the environmental forces at work are different. There are no varying forces due to wind and gravity, but inertial forces due to mechanical scanning must be reckoned with. With this form of beam scanning, minimizing momentum transfer to the space platform is a problem that demands an answer. Finally, reflector surface distortion due to thermal gradients caused by the solar flux probably represents the most challenging problem to be solved if these Large Space Antennas are to achieve the gain and resolution required of them...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSheet metal {{formability}} {{has been}} studied for a half century. The sheet formability is mostly described by the Forming Limit Diagram (FLD). A prediction of this FLD {{is a source of}} interest for industrial companies. Indeed knowing the FLD of a material allows optimization of the production processes which leads to money saving. Nevertheless, the formability tests (tensile, bulge and Nakazima tests) which give the experimental FLD do not really represent the process that the sheet will undergo in industrial conditions. The paper therefore focuses on a cross stamping test. The material of interest is a <b>Zinc</b> <b>sheet.</b> FLD prediction is reported {{for a wide variety of}} metals [1] but literature about Zinc is nearly non existent. The studied <b>Zinc</b> <b>sheets</b> exhibit a highly anisotropic mechanical behaviour due to the hcp lattice structure and the inherited rolling texture. This anisotropic behaviour results in an anisotropic formability. The <b>Zinc</b> <b>sheet</b> FLD is influenced by the orientation of the rolling direction during the process. Experimental cross stamping of this material allows describing the studied material behaviour in a large range of mechanical solicitations from tensile to biaxial tension. The experimental results are compared with the finite element simulation and permit to understand where and why failures appear, which leads to a better understanding of Zinc anisotropic formability...|$|R
