30|$|Channels {{of social}} {{interaction}} form another crucial component of aNobii. The social network is composed by two different kinds of mutually-exclusive ties, namely the friendship and the neighborhood relations. Even if {{it is up to}} the users to choose one or another, the aNobii website suggests to establish a friendship tie with people that you already know in real life, while neighborhood should be used for people that you do not know, but whose library you consider interesting. Except for this usage recommendation, the two types of link have the same characteristics. They are directed, they can be established even without the approval of the linked user, and they enable the notification of the linked library updates. Social aggregation can be achieved also through the affiliation to groups. Thematic groups can be created by any user and the membership is open to anyone. The last channel of interaction is the message wall (also called ‘shoutbox’). Users can write messages on the walls of any other individual, independently of the existence of a relationship in the social network. <b>Self-posting</b> is also allowed. Message exchange defines a different social network that we call communication graph, and whose properties are discussed in detail in Section  4.3. <b>Self-posting</b> is also allowed, yielding self-loops in the communication graph.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the fracture strength of endodontically treated teeth with reduced coronal structure reinforced with glass-fiber posts and cast posts and core (nickel-chromium alloy) with different thickness. Materials and Methods: Forty maxillary central incisors were sectioned at 1 mm of the cementoenamel junction and endodontically treated. The teeth {{were divided into}} four groups (n = 10) and restored with cast post and core and glass-fiber posts with diameters of 1. 5 mm and 1. 1 mm. The fracture strength was evaluated using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 1144) at 45 ° of angulation. The results were submitted to analysis of variance two-way and Tukey′s test (P < 0. 05). The failure mode was also evaluated. Results: Cast post and core were statistically superior to the glass-fiber posts with the <b>self-post</b> diameter (P = 0. 001). When the <b>self-post</b> material was considered, no significant difference was observed between the two post-diameters (P = 0. 749). The glass-fiber post-groups presented more fractures in the cervical third than the cast post and core groups. Conclusion: Teeth restored with cast post and cores present higher fracture strength than those reinforced with glass-fiber posts. An increased post-thickness does not increase the fracture strength. Glass-fiber posts lead to less severe fractures...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{publishing}} opportunities, manifested {{today in}} a variety of electronic journals and Web-based compendia, have captured the imagination of many scholars. These opportunities have also destabilized norms about the character of legitimate scholarly publishing in some fields. Unfortunately, much of the literature about scholarly e-publishing homogenizes the character of publishing. This article provides an analytical approach for evaluating disciplinary conventions and for proposing policies about scholarly e-publishing. We characterize three dimensions of scholarly publishing as a communicative practice [...] publicity, access, and trustworthiness, and examine several forms of paper and electronic publications in this framework. This analysis shows how the common claim that e-publishing "substantially expands access" is over-simplified. It also indicates how peer-reviewing (whether in paper or electronically) provides valuable functions for scholarly communication that are not effectively replaced by <b>self-posting</b> articles in electronic media.

40|$|Grey {{literature}} is now universally {{recognized as an}} impor-tant information resource. For industrial and business orga-nizations, it contains much knowledge and know-how that are vital business assets. Grey literature in an R&D environ-ment can represent {{the cutting edge of}} this knowledge, so its efficient management is essential. The increasing possibili-ties brought about by electronic scholarly publishing, in the context of scholarly information communication, together with the developments of the World Wide Web, are the dri-ving forces behind the implementation of projects for archiv-ing, preservation and provision of access to electronic scientific grey literature collections. This paper discusses the significance of grey literature in an environment where the function of the scientific journal, as the privileged media for efficient dissemination of R&D results, has been under some criticism by researchers and scholars. A literature survey on digital grey literature access and preservation projects is summarized. The last part of the paper briefly outlines the main results of a survey on the attitudes and expectancies of researchers and academics in the Mathematics and Agricultural Sciences in Portugal, regarding the creation of a scientific grey literature archive by the National Library of Portugal – the LIZA initiative – allowing <b>self-posting</b> of arti-cles in electronic media by the Portuguese academic and R&D communities. 1...|$|E

Using an Ask Me Anything (AMA) format, the President garnered 3.8 million page views {{on the first page}} of his <b>self-post.</b> Users left 22,000 comments and questions for the President, 10 of which he answered. The answered questions' topics included more serious topics, from the most difficult decision made during his first term to a plan to end the corruption of money in politics. Some included a more lighthearted focus, like the recipe for the White House beer.|$|R

40|$|This was {{a two-part}} study, {{employing}} {{the self and}} informant, pre and post treatment, forms of the Personal Adjustment and Role Skills Scale, the PARS Scale. In this study seven of the PARS Scale factors were employed: Interpersonal Involvement, Agitation-Depression, Attention-Confusion, Alcohol-Drug, Outside Social, Household Management (females), and Anxiety (males). This study was conducted at Delaunay Institute for Mental Health, an outpatient community mental health clinic in a low socioeconomic catchment area. Part One of the study employed {{a random sample of}} seventy applicants, male and female, ages sixteen to sixty-four, who applied to Delaunay for treatment services between November of 1972 and July of 1973 and who completed, at least, the self-pretreatment PARS Scale. This sample was administered the self and informant pre PARS Scale at initial interview. In October of 1973, the number of treatment sessions in the three months following initial interview was secured from billing cards. At this same time, therapists at Delaunay were requested to assess the sample on their progress in therapy at that time or at termination. Four categories were possible: great, moderate, slight, and no progress. They were also requested to identify the certainty with which they made the assessment according to: great, moderate, or slight certainty. Following this, the self-pretreatment PARS Scale scores were correlated with number of treatment sessions. No relationship appeared for females between number of treatment sessions and self pre PARS Scale scores. For males, a non-significant trend was noted on most factors, indicating that a high self pre PARS score was indicative of fewer treatment sessions. A significant and inverse relationship between the self pre PARS Scale score on Alcohol-Drug and number of treatment sessions occurred for males, indicating that a high score on this factor was suggestive of fewer treatment sessions. The self-pretreatment PARS Scale scores were correlated with therapist assessment of progress in therapy. No relationship appeared for females. For males, no significant relationship appeared but a non-significant trend was indicated, suggesting that a high self pre PARS Scale score was indicative of a favorable therapist assessment on progress in therapy. Part Two of the study employed a non-random sample of fifteen females who had provided self and informant, pre and post treatment, PARS Scale scores. Post treatment, informant data was notably deficient {{in this part of the}} study and prevented the employment of males in the sample. Descriptive data on income, education, marital status, and presenting problem were provided for this sample. The sample was administered the self and informant, pretreatment, PARS Scale at initial interview. Three months after initial interview they were administered the self and informant, post treatment, PARS Scale if they remained in treatment for at least three months. As in Part One of this study, number of treatment sessions for the three months following initial interview were secured from the billing cards. In October of 1973, therapists were requested to provide a therapist behavioral assessment with four possible categories: improved, maintained, regressed (therapeutic), regressed (non-therapeutic). This assessment was to be made from recall and/or records at the time the self and informant, post treatment, PARS Scale was administered. Again, therapists were requested to indicate the degree of certainty involved in their assessment. The relationship between number of treatment sessions and the available self and informant, pre and post treatment, PARS Scale scores was explored. It was found that the self pre PARS score on Interpersonal Involvement, the <b>self-post</b> PARS score on Alcohol-Drug, and the informant post PARS score on Alcohol-Drug were significantly and inversely related to the number of treatment sessions. High scores on these factors indicated fewer treatment sessions. The relationship between therapist behavioral assessment and available self and informant, pre and post treatment, PARS Scale scores was explored. Results showed a significant and direct relationship between the <b>self-post</b> PARS score on Outside Social, the informant post PARS score on Alcohol-Drug and therapist behavioral assessment. High scores on these factors indicated a favorable therapist behavioral assessment. Evaluation of treatment services with the PARS Scale in Part Two of this study found the self, pre and post treatment, PARS Scale scores on Attention-Confusion to be the only PARS scores showing significant differences after three months of treatment. None of the remaining self-PARS scores and none of three informant PARS scores indicated any significant differences. It was recommended that the predictive capacity of the PARS Scale not be explored further. Further exploration of the use of the PARS Scale for evaluative purposes was suggested due to the limitations of the research design with regard to specificity and sampling. Finally, exploration of specific and individualized treatment evaluation, suggested by recent psychotherapy research, was encouraged...|$|R
