5|$|Arbroath has one museum, {{the former}} Bell Rock Lighthouse <b>Signal</b> <b>Tower.</b> In 1807 Arbroath became {{the base of}} {{operations}} for the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. The shore station for the lighthouse – the Bell Rock <b>Signal</b> <b>Tower</b> – was completed in 1813 and acted as a lifeline for the keepers offshore. <b>Signal</b> <b>Tower</b> Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) {{built the}} Connecting Railway in 1867 to connect its main {{line to the}} Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad. By the early 1870s, New York Junction station was {{established}} where the Connecting Railway crossed over the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad mainline in North Philadelphia. A <b>signal</b> <b>tower,</b> still extant, was constructed around this time.|$|E
5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead {{an assault on the}} breastworks outside the city, however the night before the assault he noticed the city aflame from a <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> and informed General Weitzel. The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit as he would have received had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E

50|$|The antique <b>signaling</b> <b>tower</b> Turan, {{also called}} Ivanac and St. Giovanni in Besca, was {{demolished}} in 1992 by the cement factory's progress in mining the quarry. There were {{many of these}} <b>signaling</b> <b>towers</b> on the Istria coast. These antique <b>signaling</b> <b>towers</b> were constructed under the Roman Empire and also used under the Venice Republic all along the coast and on high hills inland. At night a fire was lit and by day smoke was used to <b>signal</b> the other <b>towers</b> within view. At night these towers on the coast also were used to signal vessels coming to the area. These towers were {{set up in a}} net pattern so that each would be able see and to communicate with a few others which were visible to them.|$|R
5000|$|Berserk and Ulf {{both had}} <b>signal</b> <b>towers,</b> presumably gained {{when the two}} were {{refitted}} in 1897-1898.|$|R
5|$|The {{sides of}} the conning tower were 11inches thick {{and it had a}} 3-inch roof of KNC. It had a {{communications}} tube with 8inch walls of mild steel down to the Transmitting Station on the middle deck. The walls of the <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> were 8inches thick while it had a roof of 3inches of KNC armour. 2inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms of 'A', 'X' and 'Y' turrets, but this increased to 4inches abreast 'P' and 'Q' turrets to compensate for their outboard location.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{similarity}} between Skerryvore and Dubh Artach 20miles (32kilometres) {{to the south}} east, led to the NLB painting a distinctive red band round the middle section of the latter in 1890. The Hynish Shore Station {{had the advantage of}} proximity to the site during the construction period. However, the small harbour offered little shelter for shipping. The keepers operated from here until 1892 when operations were transferred to Erraid adjacent to the Isle of Mull. Other than the <b>signal</b> <b>tower,</b> the land and buildings on Tiree were sold to George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll who had witnessed the laying of the first stone on Skerryvore fifty-two years previously. A paddle steamer, Signal, built by Laird of Greenock in 1883 was based at Erraid for relief operations. The shore station was moved to Oban in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the Culver Ramp, also {{referred}} to as the Culver Line Connection, between the Church Avenue and Ditmas Avenue stations began in June 1941, and was expected to be completed {{by the end of the}} year. The ramp was expected to cost $2 million, and along with new signals, and rehabilitation of the Culver elevated and lengthening of its stations to IND standards, the total cost of the project was estimated at over $11 million. 170 subway cars were purchased for $8,500,000 for the extension of IND service. Two substations, a <b>signal</b> <b>tower,</b> a fourth track at Ditmas Avenue, and an additional stairway at Ditmas Avenue were all completed as part of the project. McDonald Avenue was also widened between Avenue C and Cortelyou Road to facilitate the ramp. Though the ramp was nearly complete, including rails and signal work, construction was halted later that year because of America's entrance into World War II. When the project was restarted in 1946, completion was delayed further due to continued material shortages and a lack of rolling stock to facilitate the new service. On October 30, 1954, the connection between the IND Brooklyn Line at Church Avenue and the BMT Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue opened. This allowed IND trains to operate all the way to the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue terminal.|$|E

50|$|A <b>signalling</b> <b>tower</b> {{was built}} on Pike Hill during the Stanegate phase of fortifying the {{northern}} frontier of the Roman province of Britannia. <b>Signalling</b> <b>towers</b> {{and a number of}} forts were built along the line of the Roman road that connected significant military forts at Corbridge and Carlisle. This followed the withdrawal of the Roman army from Scotland around 100 and was prior to the construction of Hadrian's Wall which started in 125. The station at Pike Hill signalled to two nearby stations, Gillalees Beacon and Barrock Fell.|$|R
50|$|A {{volunteer}} force {{called the}} Sea Fencibles had been formed in 1793; they manned small armed boats, watch and <b>signal</b> <b>towers,</b> and fixed and floating batteries along the coasts.|$|R
25|$|At {{the south}} end the {{platforms}} are open and lit by modern double lampposts. Just south of the island platform's end is a pyramid-roofed original <b>signal</b> <b>tower.</b> There are other signal towers and service rooms, faced in corrugated metal, south of the other platforms. A flagman's structure is beneath {{the north end of}} the island platform canopy.|$|E
25|$|Four {{semaphore}} signal towers, {{which include}} kerosene lanterns with coloured lenses, are located south-east {{of the station}} platform, including one at the south-east elevation of the goods shed and a three arm tower near the trolley shed. There is another <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> outside the station towards Cairns. There are also two semaphore towers north-west of the station, including a second three arm tower.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{built a new}} <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> for the Manhattan-bound platform. The agency also {{upgraded}} {{the station}} to compliance with the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act; the upgrade included passenger elevators to serve the street level, mezzanine and platforms. This project, after a three-month delay, was completed by March 2014. A ribbon-cutting for the new elevators, however, wasn't held until May 2014.|$|E

25|$|They are {{controlled}} by human operators in a <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> near the switches, not by the trains themselves. A train operator must use a punch box, which is located besides the cab window in the station closest to the interlocking, to notify the switch operator of which track the train needs to go. The operator has a switchboard in their tower {{that allows them to}} change the switches.|$|E
25|$|To {{accommodate}} ever-growing {{rail traffic}} into the restricted Midtown area, Wilgus {{took advantage of}} the recent electrification technology to propose a novel scheme: a bi-level station below ground. Arriving trains would go underground under Park Avenue, and proceed to an upper-level incoming station if they were mainline trains, or to a lower-level platform if they were suburban trains. In addition, turning loops within the station itself obviated complicated switching moves to bring back the trains to the coach yards for servicing. Departing mainline trains reversed into upper-level platforms in the conventional way. New track infrastructure allowed maximum train speeds of , as well as a massive four-floor, 400-lever <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> to control the suburban trains.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, archaeologists {{discovered}} {{evidence of}} a port complex between Ratcliff and Shadwell, that was used throughout Roman occupation of Britain, and being most active in the 3rd century AD. The port seems to have initially been used for seagoing ships into the City of London, which {{is believed to have}} stopped between 250 and 270AD. A water level drop meant that the port was used primarily for the public bath house near St George in the East, which existed from the first to fourth centuries. Archaeologists also found {{evidence of a}} late third-century <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> in Shadwell. A Roman cemetery containing two coffins was also discovered in Shadwell in around 1615.|$|E

50|$|In the 1930s, more {{improvements}} {{were made}} to the railways. Modern <b>signal</b> <b>towers</b> were built for the Zittau-Oybin-Jonsdorf railway and the Weißeritztalbahn. The Kipsdorf and Oberwiesenthal stations were rebuilt and extended; the Weißeritztalbahn and the Fichtelberg Railway could now accommodate over-length trains with up to 56 axles.|$|R

500|$|Indefatigable {{was unique}} among British battlecruisers in having an {{armoured}} spotting and <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> behind the conning tower, protected by [...] of armour. However, the spotting tower was of limited use, as its view was {{obscured by the}} conning tower {{in front of it}} and the legs of the foremast and superstructure behind it. During a pre-war refit, a [...] rangefinder was added {{to the rear of the}} 'A' turret roof, and this turret was equipped to control the entire main armament as an emergency backup for the normal fire-control positions.|$|E
500|$|The solar-paneled {{roof was}} {{designed}} by Kiss and Cathcart Architects and the new station's structural engineering {{was designed by}} Jacobs Engineering Group. Both the roof and the station itself were built by {{a joint venture between}} Granite Halmar Construction and Schiavone Construction. The new station recycled 85% of the materials from the old station, and [...] of steel was salvaged from the old station for use in the new terminal. However, the station was almost completely rebuilt, and a brick <b>signal</b> <b>tower</b> is all that remains of the old station. The station has train crew facilities at its north end.|$|E
500|$|Dreadnought {{was one of}} {{the first}} vessels of the Royal Navy to be fitted with {{instruments}} for electrically transmitting range, order and deflection information to the turrets. The control positions for the main armament were located in the spotting top at the head of the foremast and on a platform on the roof of the <b>signal</b> <b>tower.</b> Data from a [...] Barr and Stroud FQ-2 rangefinder located at each control position was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the Transmitting Station located beneath each position on the main deck, where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. Voice pipes were retained for use between the Transmitting Station and the control positions. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The turrets, Transmitting Stations, and control positions could be connected in almost any combination.|$|E
5000|$|The police {{team also}} {{monitored}} all telephone {{calls in the}} closest mobile <b>signal</b> <b>towers</b> {{at the location of}} the crime during the midnight hours of the incident. It was a big task monitoring more than two million calls. The help of various mobile service providers and IT professionals was also enlisted for the probe.|$|R
50|$|The {{peak of the}} mountain, at 633 m {{above sea}} level, is also {{the site of the}} {{television}} and FM radio <b>signal</b> <b>towers</b> for the greater Melbourne area, which range in height from 72 m to 180 m. These towers are visible from quite a distance and distinguish Mount Dandenong from others in the Dandenong Ranges.|$|R
50|$|Some {{features}} of the first version are missing in this sequel, {{such as the ability}} to build tunnels and <b>signal</b> <b>towers,</b> but many new possibilities were added, such as the ability to have unlimited money, trains, and train routes, much better control of routes, dozens of new maps, and the ability to create and modify scenarios and maps.|$|R
