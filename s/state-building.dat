His gains in the southeast were challenged by the Tatars. He broke peace with the Livonian Order in 1261, possibly renouncing Christianity, and was assassinated in 1263 by his nephew Treniota and another rival, Duke Daumantas. His three immediate successors were assassinated as well. The disorder was not resolved until Traidenis gained the title of Grand Duke c. 1270.|$|E

25|$|The Rose Revolution raised many expectations, both {{domestically}} and abroad. The new government {{was expected to}} bring democracy, ending a period of widespread corruption and government inefficiency; and to complete <b>state-building</b> by re-asserting sovereignty over the whole Georgian territory. Both aims were very ambitious; the new ruling elite initiated a process of concentration {{of power in the}} hands of the executive, in order to use the revolutionary mandate to change the country. In fact, the Saakashvili government initially achieved impressive results in strengthening the capacity of the state and toppling corruption. Georgia's ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International improved dramatically from rank 133 in 2004 to 67 in 2008 and to 51 in 2012, surpassing several EU countries. But such achievements could only result from the use of unilateral executive powers, failing to achieve consent and initiating a trade-off between democracy-building and <b>state-building.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{the start}} of the civil war in Somalia in 1991, Egypt {{maintained}} diplomatic relations with the Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government, and supported their <b>state-building</b> initiatives.

25|$|Herbst {{argues that}} the European <b>state-building</b> {{experience}} was highly idiosyncratic because it occurred under systemic geographic pressures that favored wars of conquest – namely, passable terrain, land scarcity, and high-population densities. Faced with the constant threat of war, political elites sent administrators and armed forces from the urban centers into rural hinterlands to raise taxes, recruit soldiers, and fortify buffer zones. European states consequently developed strong institutions and capital-periphery linkages.|$|E

Moreover, from 1502 to 1503, he witnessed the brutal reality of the <b>state-building</b> methods of Cesare Borgia (1475–1507) and his father, Pope Alexander VI, who were then engaged in the process of trying to bring a large part of Central Italy under their possession. The pretext of defending Church interests was used as a partial justification by the Borgias. Other excursions to the court of Louis XII and the Spanish court influenced his writings such as The Prince.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of intervention is widely debated, {{in part because}} the data suffers from selection bias; as Fortna has argued, peacekeepers select themselves into difficult cases. When controlling for this effect, Forta holds that peacekeeping is resoundingly successful in shortening wars. However, other scholars disagree. Knaus and Stewart are extremely skeptical as to the {{effectiveness of}} interventions, holding that they can only work when they are performed with extreme caution and sensitivity to context, a strategy they label 'principled incrementalism'. Few interventions, for them, have demonstrated such an approach. Other scholars offer more specific criticisms; Dube and Naidu, for instance, show that US military aid, a less conventional form of intervention, seems to be siphoned off to paramilitaries thus exacerbating violence. Weinstein holds more generally that interventions might disrupt processes of 'autonomous recovery' whereby civil war contributes to <b>state-building.</b>|$|E
500|$|Nurhaci's son and {{successor}} Hong Taiji (1592–1643) {{continued his}} father's <b>state-building</b> efforts: he concentrated power {{into his own}} hands, modeled the Later Jin's government institutions on Chinese ones, and integrated Mongol allies and surrendered Chinese troops into the Eight Banners. In 1629 he led an incursion {{to the outskirts of}} Beijing, during which he captured Chinese craftsmen who knew how to cast Portuguese cannon. In 1635 Hong Taiji renamed the Jurchens the [...] "Manchus", and in 1636 changed the name of his polity from [...] "Later Jin" [...] to [...] "Qing". After capturing the last remaining Ming cities in Liaodong, by 1643 the Qing were preparing to attack the struggling Ming dynasty, which was crumbling under the combined weight of financial bankruptcy, devastating epidemics, and large-scale bandit uprisings fed by widespread starvation.|$|E
500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Soviet {{leadership}} headed by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and the Politburo, were {{not eager to}} send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB Chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, {{the head of the}} International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, [...] "Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now our mission is to determine our further actions, so as to preserve our position in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there." [...] Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and <b>state-building</b> policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about [...] "the undesirable turn of events" [...] taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{acknowledging}} {{a number}} of practical and moral reasons for peacekeeping operations, James Fearon and David Laitin assert {{that they have a}} tendency under some circumstances to become tangled with <b>state-building</b> efforts. [...] In weak states facing successful guerrilla campaigns, peacekeepers face pressures to build state institutional and administrative capacity in order to achieve lasting peace. [...] These pressures can lead to mission creep beyond the original purview of the peacekeeping operation; without engaging in <b>state-building,</b> the peacekeepers risk allowing the peacekept country to revert to violence following their exit. [...] Thus, Fearon and Laitin advocate for the greater integration of <b>state-building</b> in peacekeeping efforts through a new framework of [...] "neotrusteeship," [...] which would see foreign powers exercising a great deal of control over a weak state's domestic affairs in order to ensure the prevention of future violence.|$|E

2500|$|European {{colonialism}} and colonization was the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country, occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically. Research suggests, the current conditions of postcolonial societies have roots in colonial actions and policies. For example, colonial policies, {{such as the}} type of rule implemented, the nature of investments, [...] and identity of the colonizers, are cited as impacting postcolonial states. Examination of the <b>state-building</b> process, economic development, and cultural norms and mores shows the direct and indirect consequences of colonialism on the postcolonial states.|$|E
2500|$|Environmental {{determinism}} (also {{known as}} climatic determinism or geographical determinism) {{is the study}} of how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular development trajectories. Nineteenth century approaches held that climate and terrain largely determined human activity and psychology, and it was associated with institutionalized racism and eugenics. Many scholars underscore that this approach supported colonialism and eurocentrism, and devalued human agency in non-Western societies. Jared Diamond, Jeffrey Herbst, and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth century. This [...] "neo-environmental determinism" [...] school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence <b>state-building,</b> economic development, and institutions.|$|E
2500|$|According to Alastair Crooke, {{the then}} British Prime Minister Tony Blair decided in 2003 to tie UK and EU {{security}} {{policy in the}} West Bank and Gaza to a US-led counter-insurgency against Hamas. This led to an internal policy contradiction that pre-empted the EU from mounting any effective foreign policy on the [...] "peace process" [...] alternative {{to that of the}} US. At a political level, the EU [...] "talked the talk" [...] of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, Palestinian <b>state-building</b> and democracy. At the practical level, the EU [...] "walked the walk" [...] of disruption, detention, seizing finances, and destroying the capabilities of one [...] of the two factions and prevented the parliament from exercising any function.|$|E
2500|$|In 1921, former revolutionary {{general and}} newly elected {{president}} of Mexico Alvaro Obregón mounted a massive centenary celebration for Mexican independence, even larger {{than the one that}} Porfirio Díaz had staged in 1910, and {{the first time since the}} mid nineteenth century that the date was commemorated. The 1921 commemoration was an opportunity for Obregón to assert his own <b>state-building</b> vision by appropriating a piece of Mexico's history. By overseeing the ceremonies, Obregón could shape and consolidate his own position in power, which at the time was relatively weak. [...] The Mexican Army benefited from the celebrations with new uniforms and equipment, and there was even a re-enactment of Iturbide's triumphal entry into Mexico City.|$|E
2500|$|The widely {{distributed}} and influential work of Sir Robert Thompson, counter-insurgency expert of the Malayan Emergency, offers several such guidelines. Thompson's underlying {{assumption was that}} the counter-insurgent was committed to improving {{the rule of law}} and bettering local governance. Some governments, however, give such considerations short shrift. These governments are not interested in <b>state-building</b> and in extreme cases they have carried out counter-insurgency operations by using mass murder, genocide, terror, torture and execution. Historian Timothy Snyder has written, [...] "In the guise of anti-partisan actions, the Germans killed perhaps three quarters of a million people, about 350,000 in Belarus alone, and lower but comparable numbers in Poland and Yugoslavia. The Germans killed more than a hundred thousand Poles when suppressing the Warsaw Uprising of 1944." ...|$|E

2500|$|Political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists began {{studying}} the state formation processes in Europe {{and elsewhere in}} the 17th century—beginning significantly with Max Weber. However, state formation became a primary interest in the 1970s. The question was often framed as a contest between state forces and society forces and the study of how the state became prominent over particular societies. A number of theories developed regarding state development in Europe. Other theories focused on the creation of states in late colonial and post-colonial societies. [...] The lessons from these studies of the formation of states in the modern period are often used in theories about <b>State-building.</b> Other theories contend that the state in Europe was constructed in connection with peoples from outside Europe and that focusing on state formation in Europe as a foundation for study silences the diverse history of state formation.|$|E
2500|$|In Capital, Volume I, Marx {{analyzed}} the direct production process of capital: the activities which create new commodities sold for profit. But when he analyzes the circulation and reproduction of {{capital in the}} second volume, he begins to develop the category of society's total capital. In the third volume, {{the concept of the}} total capital of society is developed further, as it becomes apparent that there exist all kinds of capital funds and assets in society which are not directly related to production. Marx never completed his story with an analysis of the credit system as a whole, the housing market, international trade and public finance; his work was very much unfinished. Yet in a mature, developed capitalist society, such as it exists {{a century and a half}} after Marx's studies, it is typical that more capital assets exist outside private capitalist production than are invested inside it (excluding [...] "human capital", a concept which Marx rejected). That is the end result of centuries of capital accumulation, mechanization, <b>state-building,</b> and restructuring business operations.|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael Witzel's {{analysis}} of the Kuru Kingdom, it {{can be characterized as}} the earliest Vedic [...] "state", during the Middle Vedic Period. However, Robert Bellah observes {{that it is difficult to}} [...] "pin down" [...] whether the Kurus were a true [...] "state" [...] or a complex chiefdom, as the Kuru kings notably never adopted royal titles higher than [...] "rājan," [...] which means [...] "chief" [...] rather than [...] "king" [...] in the Vedic context. The Middle Vedic Period is also characterized by a lack of cities; Bellah compares this to early state formation in ancient Hawai'i and [...] "very early Egypt," [...] which were [...] "territorial states" [...] rather than [...] "city-states," [...] and thus [...] "it was the court, not the city, that provided the center, and the court was often peripatetic." [...] Romila Thapar characterizes Vedic-era state formation as being in a condition of [...] "arrested development," [...] because local chiefs were relatively autonomous, and because surplus wealth that could have been directed towards <b>state-building</b> was instead used for the increasingly grandiose rituals that also served to structure social relations. The period of the Upanishads, the final phase of the Vedic era, was approximately contemporaneous with a new wave of state formations, linked to the beginning of urbanization in the Ganges Valley: along with the growth of population and trade networks, these social and economic changes put pressure on older ways of life, setting the stage for the Upanishads and the subsequent sramana movements, and the end of the Vedic Period, which was followed by the Mahajanapada period.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{there has}} been some {{confusion}} between {{the use of the term}} nation-building and that of <b>state-building</b> (the terms are sometimes used interchangeably in North America). Both have fairly narrow and different definitions in political science, the former referring to national identity, the latter to infrastructure and the institutions of the state. The debate has been clouded further by the existence of two very different schools of thought on <b>state-building.</b> The first (prevalent in the media) portrays <b>state-building</b> as an interventionist action by foreign countries. The second (more academic in origin and increasingly accepted by international institutions) sees <b>state-building</b> as an indigenous process.
