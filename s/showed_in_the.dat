5|$|On 3 March 2010, {{elections}} for the local councils were held in the municipalities of The Netherlands. The PVV only contested these local elections in the Dutch towns The Hague and Almere, because of a shortage of good candidates. The big gains that were scored indicated that the party and Wilders might dominate the political scene {{in the run-up to}} the parliamentary elections scheduled on 9 June 2010. The PVV won in Almere and came second to the Dutch Labour party in The Hague. In Almere, the PVV won 21 percent of the vote to Labour's 18 percent, preliminary results <b>showed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Hague, the PVV had 8 seats—second to Labour with 10 seats.|$|E
5|$|Since David {{wrote about}} Mediterranean food in 1950, and indeed since dietary {{researchers}} <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s that {{people around the}} Mediterranean had less coronary heart disease than the peoples of northern Europe, the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed. Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables: their diet is becoming more northern European, with more convenience foods and with less of a preventative effect on cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's {{coat of arms}} {{was unusually}} complex for the period, with seven {{different}} quarterings. The first quarter consists of {{the arms of his}} father-in-law, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who bore his arms with an escutcheon of De Clare quartering Despenser (the arms of his wife Isabel le Despenser), which Warwick <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth quarter. The second quarter showed the arms of the Montacutes (quartered with the Monthermer arms). The third quarter showed the arms of Neville differenced by a label for Lancaster to signify descent from Warwick's father, the Earl of Salisbury, who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster.|$|E

5|$|The {{benefits}} {{gained by}} Maunsell's modifications <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> improved {{performance of the}} first batch of Maunsell S15s over their Urie-built predecessors. A third batch was ordered in 1931, coinciding with a downturn in the volume of freight due to the economic depression. This meant that {{the last of the}} S15 class was not completed until 1936, although weight-saving modifications were undertaken to this batch. A final modification was also applied to the class at this time, when all locomotives were equipped with smoke deflectors to improve visibility from the footplate when travelling at speed. This modification was a feature that became common to most Maunsell-influenced designs.|$|E
5|$|During King Richard's reign, the Crown's {{expenditure}} on castles {{declined from}} the levels spent by Henry II, Richard's father, although {{this has been}} attributed to a concentration of resources on Richard's war with the king of France. However, the work at Château Gaillard cost an estimated £12,000 between 1196 and 1198. Richard only spent an estimated £7,000 on castles in England during his reign, similar as his father Henry II. The Pipe rolls for the construction of Château Gaillard contain the earliest details of how work was organised in castle building and what activities were involved. Amongst those workmen mentioned in the rolls are miners, stone cutters, quarrymen, masons, lime-workers, carpenters, smiths, hodmen, water carriers, soldiers to guard the workers, diggers who cut the ditch surrounding the castle, and carters who transported the raw materials to the castle. A master-mason is omitted, and military historian Allen Brown has suggested that it may be because Richard himself was the overall architect; this is supported by the interest Richard <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work through his frequent presence.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E

25|$|The {{pandemic}} killed 40–50 {{million people}} {{in less than a}} year, but the proof that it was caused by a virus was not obtained until 1933. Haemophilus influenzae is an opportunistic bacterium which commonly follows influenza infections; this led the eminent German bacteriologist Richard Pfeiffer (1858–1945) to incorrectly conclude that this bacterium was the cause of influenza. A major breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Hirst identified an enzymic activity associated with the virus particle, later characterised as the neuraminidase, the first demonstration that viruses could contain enzymes. Frank Macfarlane Burnet <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1950s that the virus recombines at high frequencies, and Hirst later deduced that it has a segmented genome.|$|E

25|$|Two {{cancelled}} {{series in}} Sri Lanka, one {{due to the}} withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup due to security concerns and the replacement three-match ODI bilateral series against Sri Lanka washed due to rain, was India's prelude to another disappointing tournament – DLF Cup 2006-07. Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. India's lack of preparation <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006 ICC Champions Trophy as they lost to West Indies and Australia, though Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies. The story of the ODI series in South Africa was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and India lost the series 4–0. From {{the start of the}} West Indies ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique from former wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani.|$|E
25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E
25|$|W. T. Glover & Co. of Salford were {{important}} electricity cable manufacturers throughout the early 20th century. BAE Systems Wind Tunnel Department at Warton—one its four wind tunnels—the High Speed Wind Tunnel—can test speeds intermittently up to Mach 3.8 (trisonic)—the second fastest in the UK, to the University of Manchester's Aero-Physics Laboratory {{which has a}} hypersonic wind tunnel up to Mach 6. Prof Osborne Reynolds of Owens College (which became the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904), known worldwide for his Reynolds number (introduced elsewhere by the mathematician George Gabriel Stokes), <b>showed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1880s that wind tunnels (invented by Francis Herbert Wenham in 1871) could model large-scale objects accurately. BAE Systems Regional Aircraft assembled Britain's last airliner, the British Aerospace 146 (Avro RJX), at Woodford in November 2001. The Merlin-powered Avro Tudor G-AGPF, which took off from what is now Manchester Airport on 14 June 1945, was Britain's first pressurised civilian aircraft; only 38 were built and it was designed for the North Atlantic route. On 13 May 1949, VN799 the English Electric Canberra first flew from Warton: Warton {{at the time was}} a former USAAF wartime maintenance base; the German Arado Ar 234 was technically the world's first jet bomber; the Canberra would be the first jet aircraft to make a non-stop crossing of the Atlantic on 21 February 1951.|$|E
