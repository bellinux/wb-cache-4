5|$|During the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, {{six weeks}} before the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, six <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese. Police later {{discovered}} that the <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced {{to five years in}} prison and released after three. The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.|$|E
5|$|After August, pick-ups were {{conducted}} as Raimi sought to film more action scenes. The film then wrapped in October, although additional special effects <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> taken to finalize the production a month later. In early 2007, there were further pick-up shots regarding {{the resolution of}} Sandman's story, amounting to four different versions.|$|E
5|$|After {{production}} finished on The Terminator, some post-production <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> needed. These included scenes {{showing the}} Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of an actor's head <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> identification. Therefore, the most {{important}} feature of an actor's head <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> that it represents the subject. Theatrical head <b>shots</b> <b>are</b> usually very [...] "neutral" [...] looking shots of the actor clearly showing their facial features.|$|R

5|$|At about 23:00 on August 26, {{the first}} <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> {{fired in the}} Battle of Long Island, near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th Street and 4th Avenue). American pickets from Samuel John Atlee's Pennsylvania {{regiment}} fired upon two British soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near the inn.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the United States of America entered the war in 1917—three {{years after the first}} <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired—several Americans had already gone to fight as pilots by joining the Royal Flying Corps. These pilots {{reported}} to Canada, and after flight training were sent to fight as officers in the British military.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 1–2 February, Mubarak {{supporters}} and protesters clashed in Alexandria, where <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> reportedly fired into the air. Government forces and the police also fired into the crowd {{in an attempt to}} disperse the protesters. In Cairo, many protesters from the previous day had remained in Tahrir Square overnight.|$|E
50|$|Round <b>shot</b> <b>were</b> undeniably inaccurate. This was because, {{despite their}} name, round <b>shot</b> <b>were</b> never {{perfectly}} spherical, {{nor did they}} fit their gun barrels exactly. Air acted on the irregular surface of the projectile. These irregularities invariably threw them off target to some degree. It is often also a matter of confusion as to why a 12pdr <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> so much more effective than a 6pdr <b>shot.</b> This <b>is</b> because {{the impact of a}} <b>shot</b> <b>was</b> not only related to its weight but also to its velocity, which, with a heavier projectile, was much greater {{at the end of the}} trajectory.|$|R

5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{analysis}} of an audio tape {{recording of the}} shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible. The presence of more than eight shots on the tape was corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> recorded on the audio tape.|$|E
5|$|Smoke screens have {{continued}} {{to be used by}} attackers and defenders as a means of sowing confusion and hiding movements. During naval battles in the 18–19th centuries, <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> sometimes fired early so a defensive screen was erected before the ships converged, to spoil the aim of the enemy.|$|E

5000|$|Martini <b>Shot</b> <b>is</b> a Hollywood {{term that}} {{describes}} the final shot set-up of the day. According to Dave Knox, author of the film industry slang guide Strike the Baby and Kill the Blonde, the Martini <b>Shot</b> <b>was</b> so named because [...] "the next <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> out of a glass", referring to a post-wrap drink. Also {{referred to as the}} Window Shot.|$|R

5|$|The {{show was}} {{primarily}} filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment {{was needed for}} some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; wide-angle <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.|$|E
5|$|These {{advances}} {{took place}} under Swedish artillery fire. From 21 March until 29 March (when, according to Aleksander Myshlayevsky, the Russians began firing their artillery), 66 bombs and 1,200 round <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> released by Swedish artillery. Also, the Swedes attempted a ground assault, but were driven {{back into the}} fort.|$|E
5000|$|Lead <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> {{also often}} used as ballast in various situations, {{especially}} where a dense, pourable weight is required. Generally, small <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> best for these applications, {{as it can be}} poured more like a liquid. Completely round <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> not required. When used as a pourable/mouldable weight, the <b>shot</b> may <b>be</b> left loose, or mixed with a bonding agent such as epoxy to contain and stabilize the pellets after they are poured.

5000|$|The trunk <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> a {{cinematic}} camera angle which captures {{film from}} inside {{the trunk of a}} car. Though the trunk <b>shot</b> can <b>be</b> produced by placing the camera inside the trunk, the considerable bulk of a conventional movie camera and camera operator makes this difficult. Therefore, the <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> usually [...] "cheated" [...] by having the art department place a trunk door and some of the trunk frame close enough to the camera to make it appear to <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> from within a car. The trunk <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> a specialized type of low-angle shot.|$|R
5|$|Though the {{exterior}} <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior <b>shots</b> <b>were,</b> until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live studio audience at BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series {{to do away with the}} live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is {{almost exactly the same}} as the original, with the only difference being that some early <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> Spears dances in front of the multicolored background are replaced by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress and in front of a black background with flashing lights.|$|E
5000|$|A useful {{method for}} remembering the {{diameter}} of numbered <b>shot</b> in inches <b>is</b> simply to subtract the shot size from 17. The resulting answer is {{the diameter of}} the shot in hundredths of an inch. For example, #2 shot gives 17-2 = 15, meaning that the diameter of #2 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 15/100 or 0.15". B <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> [...]170 inches, and sizes go up in [...]01 increments for BB and BBB sizes. In metric measurement, it is easy to remember that #5 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 3 mm; each number up or down represents a 0.25 mm change in diameter, so e.g. #7 <b>shot</b> <b>is</b> 2.5 mm.|$|R

5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the <b>shots</b> <b>were</b> fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
