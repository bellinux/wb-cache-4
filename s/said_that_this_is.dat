25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written by Saddam {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr and he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam ate his last meal of chicken and rice with a cup of hot water and honey.|$|E
25|$|Healthy narcissism {{might exist}} in all individuals. Freud <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an {{original}} state {{from which the}} individual develops the love object. He argued that healthy narcissism {{is an essential part}} of normal development. According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and their attitude toward their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism. The child has an omnipotence of thought; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see the things that they have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities of their child. When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met. Freud contrasts the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson refers to as echoism, in the latter.|$|E

500|$|When the {{president}} vetoes the bill, it is <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Bartlet's first veto. In a previous episode, [...] "In This White House" [...] as Sam debates Ainsley Hayes {{for the first}} time, it is made clear that {{the president}} has in fact previously vetoed a bill. It has been suggested, however, that what was discussed on that occasion was a pocket veto.|$|E
500|$|... "Sussudio" [...] {{is one of}} Collins' {{most famous}} songs and is {{referenced}} in many different media, including books, stand-up comedy acts and television shows. He has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the song people most often sing to him when they spot him on the street. In the book and film adaptation of American Psycho, the main character (Patrick Bateman) briefly discusses it, amongst other work by Collins. The synthesizer riff was heavily criticised for sounding too much like Prince's 1982 song [...] "1999", a similarity that Collins does not deny, citing {{that he is a}} big fan of Prince's work.|$|E

500|$|A 2015 study coauthored {{by staff}} at SeaWorld and the Minnesota Zoo {{indicates}} {{that there is no}} significant difference in survivor-ship between free-ranging and captive killer whales. The authors speculate about the future utility of studying captive populations for the purposes of understanding orca biology and the implications of such research of captive animals in the overall health of both wild and marine park populations. [...] The study has been criticized by Dr Trevor Willis, senior lecture in marine biology at the University of Portsmouth, who stated that the study is misleading, [...] "clearly wrong" [...] and indicative of [...] "poor practice". He <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the case because it compares swimming pools to the wild ocean and extrapolates the survival rates of calves to life expectancy in adulthood.|$|E
500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets". Friend and former A rep named Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather thought the album {{would let the}} public know Usher personally. Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E
500|$|Bound {{was praised}} for being {{perhaps the first}} {{mainstream}} film to have a lesbian relationship at its heart without homosexuality being central to the plot. Despite the presence of [...] "unapologetically gay" [...] lead character Corky, it is not commonly considered a [...] "lesbian movie". Emanuel Levy <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a weakness, that mainstream films with broadening storylines [...] "do not necessarily represent a positive development {{in the making of}} gay and lesbian films" [...] and that Bound has [...] "little, if anything, to do with lesbian cinema". Jonathan Rosenbaum for the Chicago Reader called it a [...] "welcome change" [...] to have a lesbian couple as the main characters in a mainstream film. Sarah Warn for AfterEllen.com called Corky [...] "the closest thing to a realistic and sympathetic butch lesbian we've seen in a mainstream movie". Barry Walters for the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film for showing gay characters that have an active sex life. The sex scenes, described as explicit and steamy, were admired for being tasteful, discreet and realistic. Warn called them [...] "some of the best lesbian sex scenes to date in a mainstream movie".|$|E

500|$|The {{frontman}} {{was more}} involved in the composition of Born Villain than he was for preceding records. Manson has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a result of him beginning the project with a different mindset from that of his chief collaborator, Twiggy. He said he developed a [...] "clear idea" [...] of the album's direction early in its writing stages, which he was reluctant to share {{with other members of the}} band. He worked on the album in a minimally decorated apartment located above a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles, which was once owned by actor Billy Zane and was the site where Manson created his first painting in 1996. The album contains seven songs which feature the vocalist as a composer, including three where he is listed as the sole writer. At the time of the album's release, Manson distanced himself from the approach he took when creating previous albums, explaining: [...] "On the last two records I made, I was trying to make people feel what I was feeling—which wasn't a good idea, because I was feeling like shit. Check mark number one: don't make records that make people feel bad." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E
500|$|Reception of [...] "Not Afraid" [...] {{was mixed}} to positive. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone praised the song's tone: [...] "Over a dark, operatic beat. Eminem {{delivers}} rhymes that are typically acrobatic—and typically heavy-handed. But the anger has a gathering quality." [...] Dolan also praised the song's inspirational theme. Henry Adaso of About.com gave a positive review on the song, noting [...] "Boi-1da's bouncy charm" [...] and [...] "heartwrenching lyrics from a master poet" [...] as good {{aspects of the}} song and noted no negative aspects. In Adaso's guide review, he praised Boi-1da's production and Eminem's affecting lyrics; he considered the former's work [...] "shimmering" [...] and Eminem's [...] "sensitive lyrics entwine on this knocker"; overall, he gave the song {{four and a half}} stars out of a possible five. After the song's release, AllHipHop called it [...] "an anthem in nature and rebellious to the core." [...] In her review of the Recovery, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone noted that even if Eminem—reaching his late 30s—is becoming [...] "a grumpy middle-aged man, at least he's owning it". Winston Robbins of music website Consequence of Sound called [...] "Not Afraid" [...] one of the songs on Recovery [...] "with catchy hooks, choruses, and beats multiplied by the endless pool of wit and anger that Eminem possesses". In his album review, Thomas Nassiff wrote on behalf of AbsolutePunk; he noted the song for being radio-friendly and that it [...] "doesn't sacrifice anything to be friendly to the masses." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> where [...] "the only completely commendable sentiment on the entire album comes" [...] and called it a [...] "proud rehab anthem". In his review for Recovery, Benjamin Meadows-Ingram of Spin magazine called [...] "Not Afraid" [...] a [...] "stadium-ready lead single"; he went on to say, [...] "Finally, Eminem addresses his personal and professional failings head-on, rather than hiding behind a joke or inside a nightmare. It's a necessary first step in moving on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Huawei classifies {{itself as}} a [...] "collective" [...] and does not refer to {{itself as a}} private company.

[...] McGregor argued that [...] "Huawei's status as a genuine collective is doubtful." ...|$|E
