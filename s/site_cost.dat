2500|$|Originally, the {{reconstruction}} {{was to be}} funded by the Federal Transit Administration, which gave approximately $1.9 billion to the project. The costs of the hub were still expensive, but {{it was to be}} finished at budget in 2009. In 2014 dollars, the cost of the hub and the adjacent Fulton Center, combined, was $5.1 billion. The hub cost twice as much in 2014 as it should have originally cost in 2004. A single hallway in the elegantly constructed hub cost $225 million and was billed as the [...] "world's most expensive hallway", while construction, maintenance, and management alone cost $635 million; the Port Authority awarded several subcontracts, most of them costly. The fees of the main construction team took up almost a billion dollars, and utility installation around the entire World Trade Center <b>site</b> <b>cost</b> another $400 million. Over $500 million in cost savings was overlooked.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first major}} work was {{the west side}} of , {{completed}} in 1855. In the same year, Roman coins were found on this site by Howell's workmen. The Music Hall or Central Assembly Room between Robertson Street and Havelock Road, renamed as the Public Hall in 1883, was begun in July 1858 and built speedily; the opening on 12 January 1859 featured Handel's Messiah. It was an Italianate building with its main entrance in Robertson Street. The main hall on the first floor measured 75 feet by 45 feet and 30 feet high, and its staircases gave access to Havelock Road and Robertson Street. The ground floor had a large room for the Hastings Mechanics' Institution at the west end, and shops at the east end, with a shopping arcade running north-south in the centre. There was an arched cellar in the basement. From the 1920s to the 1970s it was a cinema; today it faces Cambridge Road and the ground floor is occupied by public houses, with music in the cellar. Howell built Holy Trinity Church, Robertson Street, in 1860 for architect Samuel Sanders Teulon; the <b>site</b> <b>cost</b> £2,300. The nave was opened on 29 September 1858 and the chancel on 10 August 1862, but it was consecrated as late as 13 April 1882 due to debt. In July of that year there was strike action by the masons when their employer Howell Senior refused to dismiss a non-union man. Holy Trinity is now a listed building. He engineered the basement of the [...] in 1862; it exists today in the town conservation area without its cupolas and forecourt, and has been converted into flats.|$|E

25|$|One large undeveloped {{resource}} of wind in Ohio is Lake Erie. Its shallow depth and shelter from hurricanes provide advantages {{in terms of}} both ease of construction as well as safety of investment.

50|$|Traditional hydrogeological {{methods for}} characterizing the {{subsurface}} usually involved drilling and taking soil {{samples from the}} site, which can disturb the study <b>site,</b> <b>cost</b> too much time or money, or expose researchers and people to harmful chemicals and contaminants.

50|$|It is {{the site}} of the Ċirkewwa Ferry Terminal, where regular car ferries operate to the port of Mġarr on Gozo. In the summer, boat trips to Comino also operate, as well as {{organised}} diving excursions. As Ċirkewwa is a point on the northernmost end of the island, and not a town, there is no infrastructure besides the terminal. Construction of a new terminal at the <b>site,</b> <b>costing</b> around €12 million, was announced in May 2010.|$|R

50|$|Refractory {{installation}} contractors {{have begun}} to consider precast refractory shapes much like they do any other pre-manufactured item such as block insulation, ceramic fiber blanket, anchors, etc. These items can be bought and then re-sold {{as a component of}} their installation projects. Whenever any portion of refractory repair work can be completed prior to crews being on <b>site,</b> <b>costs</b> are automatically reduced. Installation contractors have also found that the use of precast shapes can often give them a substantial advantage in competitive bid situations.|$|R
50|$|The {{replacement}} {{hospital had}} been built on a mostly green field site in the south-east of the city, with the contract signed in August 1998. The new building was designed by Keppie Design and constructed under a PFI contract by Balfour Beatty. The development of the new <b>site</b> <b>cost</b> £184 million, £34 million more than originally budgeted. The building was built without air conditioning, and portable units are required for the summer months. Jim and Margaret Cuthbert unveiled evidence outlining why the PFI scheme was a poor use of public funds whilst resulting in huge profits for private investors.|$|E
50|$|Dysart F.C {{was formed}} in June 1971, at a meeting held in Joe Moore's (now Thomas Street Stores), Dysart. Upon the {{foundation}} of the club, a team was formed along with a committee. In 1972 Dysart F.C purchased its present property. The <b>site</b> <b>cost</b> £1400 to buy and the money was borrowed from the people of the parish on an interest-free loan, and all that money has been paid back since. The first match played was a challenge Dysart v Four Roads, 8-a-side, which ended 2 all. A Parish League (7-a-side) was played in 1971 with 3 teams: Dysart (village), Ballintleva and Feevagh. Feevagh came out on top with 3 wins and 1 draw. Dysart have a good winning history in the Roscommon.|$|E

Despite networks' efforts to stop it, publishers are suspicious of the motives of the advertising networks, because the advertising network receives money for each click, even if it is fraudulent.|$|R
40|$|An {{economic}} cost analysis of 258 Forest Service developed recreation sites in Region One examined eleven different site types, including campgrounds, picnic grounds, boating and swimming sites, interpretive sites, and information <b>sites.</b> <b>Costs</b> were estimated for planning, facilities, and operation and maintenance. Averaging costs by category showed that, in general, family campgrounds were {{less expensive than}} other site types per annum or per unit of capacity or use. Cost functions, estimated to predict the effect of size and use, should aid budgetary decisions and help planners better predict <b>costs</b> of existing <b>sites</b> and new developments...|$|R
