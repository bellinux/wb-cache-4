50|$|At the interface, a {{very large}} force (>6-5 nN) is needed to pull the protein {{molecules}} away from the aragonite mineral in nacre, {{despite the fact that}} the molecular interactions are non-bonded. Some studies perform a finite element model analysis to investigate the behaviour of the interface. A model has shown that during tension, the back stress that is induced during the plastic stretch of the material plays a big role in the hardening of the mineralized tissue. As well, the nanoscale asperities that is on the tablet surfaces provide resistance to interlamellar sliding and so strengthen the material. A <b>surface</b> <b>topology</b> study has shown that progressive tablet locking and hardening, which are needed for spreading large deformations over large volumes, occurred because of the waviness of the tablets.|$|E

5000|$|In both {{collinear}} and transverse PDS, {{the surface}} is heated using a periodically modulated light source, such as an optical beam passing through a mechanical chopper or regulated with a function generator. A lock-in amplifier is then used to measure deflections found at the modulation frequency. Another scheme uses a pulsed laser as the excitation source. In that case, a boxcar average {{can be used to}} measure the temporal deflection of the probe beam to the excitation radiation. The signal falls off exponentially as a function of frequency, so frequencies around 1-10 hertz are frequently used. A full theoretical analysis of the PDS system was published by Jackson, Amer, et al. in 1981. The same paper also discussed the use of PDS as a form of microscopy, called [...] "Photothermal Deflection Microscopy", which can yield information about impurities and the <b>surface</b> <b>topology</b> of materials.|$|E
5000|$|Parametric {{equations}} of {{surfaces are}} often irregular at some points. For example, {{all but two}} points of the unit sphere, are the image, by the above parametrization, of exactly one pair of Euler angles (modulo [...] ). For the remaining two points (the north and south poles), one has , and the longitude [...] may take any values. Also, there are surfaces for which there cannot exist a single parametrization that covers the whole surface. Therefore, one often considers surfaces which are parametrized by several parametric equations, whose images covers the surface. This is formalized by the concept of manifold: {{in the context of}} manifolds, typically in topology and differential geometry, a surface is a manifold of dimension two; this means that a surface is a topological space such that every point has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to an open subset of the Euclidean plane (see <b>Surface</b> (<b>topology)</b> and Surface (differential geometry)). This allows defining surfaces in spaces of dimension higher than three, and even abstract surfaces, which are not contained in any other space. On the other hand, this excludes surfaces that have singularities, such as the vertex of a conical surface or points where a surface crosses itself.|$|E
50|$|For {{the next}} 50 {{or so years}} the {{farmhouse}} became {{the home of the}} Allen Clark Research Centre for the now defunct company which later became part of the British GEC in 1989. The centre was officially opened under Clark's name (Clark had died in 1962) by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 20 March 1964 where the Duke unveiled a plaque by Scottish sculptor David McFall. Research was carried out there for a number of areas in which Plessey was involved including semiconductors, LED's, other solid-state devices and integrated circuits (ICs) and was the birthplace of self scanned C-MOS light sensor arrays (PJW Noble) for their company Plessey Semiconductors (also known for a time as Plessey Microelectronics) based at Cheney Manor, Swindon. The site also had a scanning electron microscope useful for checking the <b>surface</b> <b>topology</b> of ICs under static and charged conditions. At peak, the centre employed several hundred people. After the GEC/Siemens takeover of Plessey, the Caswell site was taken over by GEC and subsequently GEC Marconi. Marconi problems later led to the sale of the site to Bookham Technology in 2002. A talented German engineer, William Oscar Heyne was employed by the company. Heyne later became the managing director and Chairman of Plessey {{and was one of the}} key figures in the development of Plessey during the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{the other}} microreplication processes, in microthermoforming, {{modifications}} of the film to be formed remain preserved beyond the forming step due to the already mentioned material coherence during this secondary forming process. This enables surface and bulk modification and functionalisation of the three-dimensionally formed films or membranes, namely as highly resolved micro- and nanopatterns, and all side, i.e. on hardly accessible side walls and even behind undercuts.

40|$|The idea of characterising the {{different}} forms of natural topographic surfaces by a topological model based on their fundamental surface features has attracted many proposals. In this paper, a detailed discussion and new proposals on various {{issues related to the}} concept, generation, and visualisation of two graph theoretic based <b>surface</b> <b>topology</b> data structures [...] Weighted Surface Networks and their improved version, Metric Surface Networks - are presented.
