40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the topic of rescue from free <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> from <b>height.</b> The aim of the thesis is to {{determine}} the level of special training of medical rescue workers who operate in the South Bohemian region in the field of rescue from free <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> from <b>height.</b> The first, theoretical part of the thesis covers the topic of rope techniques and rescue from free <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> from <b>height.</b> First, I defined basic material used in rope techniques and during rescue work from <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> from <b>height,</b> then also knot and knot techniques and finally I outline basic skills and methods used during rescue work from free <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> from <b>height.</b> The second, practical part of the thesis presents results of quantitative research. The hypothesis stated assumes that emergency service workers lack professional training in the field of rescue of individuals from free <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> from <b>height.</b> The research sample comprised randomly selected paramedics who work in Emergency Medical Service in South Bohemia in Tábor, České Budějovice, Český Krumlov, Prachatice, Strakonice and Písek. To obtain necessary data, the method of quantitative research, interview technique through a questionnaire was used. Collected data were evaluated and compared to stated hypothesis using contingency tables and graphs. The questionnaire consisted of 24 closed questions. The first half of the questionnaire covered identification questions. The second half of the questionnaire comprised questions to test special knowledge of material and work techniques in the field of rescue from free <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> from <b>height</b> <b>and</b> was designed to determine the level of expertise and preparedness to use rope techniques. The results of the research show that paramedics who work in Emergency medical services in South Bohemia have relatively sufficient professional training in the field of rescue from free <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> <b>height.</b> The hypothesis was not confirmed...|$|R

50|$|The {{height of}} a vertex in a rooted tree is {{the length of the}} longest {{downward}} path to a leaf from that vertex. The height of the tree is the height of the root. The depth of a vertex is the length of the path to its root (root path). This is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, AVL trees in particular. The root has depth zero, leaves have <b>height</b> zero, <b>and</b> a tree with only a single vertex (hence both a root <b>and</b> leaf) has <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> <b>height</b> zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no vertices, if such are allowed) has <b>depth</b> <b>and</b> <b>height</b> −1.|$|R

40|$|Amphicoma (Glaphyridae) beetles are {{important}} pollinators of red bowl-shaped {{flowers in the}} Mediterranean. The role of color and shape in flower choice is well studied but the roles of inclination, <b>depth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>height</b> have seldom been investigated. Under field conditions, models were used to experimentally manipulate these three characters and visitation rates of beetles were recorded. Models with red horizontal surfaces were visited significantly more often than models with red vertical surfaces. Shallow flower models were visited significantly more than deeper equivalents. Models below or {{at the height of}} natural flower populations elicited significantly more landings than models above the height of flowers.

Numerous further alterations have been undertaken since, including the addition of two storeys to either side of the main entrance in the early 1950s, and the replacement of the large fountain in the forecourt by a smaller one in 1968. In 1998 the building was listed Grade II and its future has therefore been protected.|$|R
