5|$|<b>Static</b> <b>balance</b> is {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E

[...] One recent research report demonstrated a gain of 2 SARA points (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) from physical therapy. In general, physical therapy emphasises postural balance and gait training for ataxia patients. General conditioning such as range-of-motion exercises and muscle strengthening would also be included in therapeutic exercise programmes. [...] Research showed that spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) patients [...] with a mild stage of the disease gained significant improvement in <b>static</b> <b>balance</b> and neurological indices {{after six months of}} a physical therapy exercise training program. Occupational therapists may assist patients with incoordination or ataxia issues through the use of adaptive devices. Such devices may include a cane, crutches, walker, or wheelchair for those with impaired gait. Other devices are available to assist with writing, feeding, and self care if hand and arm coordination are impaired. A randomised clinical trial revealed that an intensive rehabilitation program with physical and occupational therapies for patients with degenerative cerebellar diseases can significantly improve functional gains in ataxia, gait, and activities of daily living. Some level of improvement was shown to be maintained 24 weeks post-treatment. Speech language pathologists may use both behavioral intervention strategies as well as augmentative and alternative communication devices to help patients with impaired speech.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{click-clack}} tin-lid {{mechanism is}} analyzed here. This mechanism {{has the feature}} to be switched between its two stable states by applying forces along different lines of action at two different points, called ports here. The 3 D click-clack tin-lid mechanism is modified to design a planar fully-compliant two-port bistable mechanism. By using the theory presented in this paper, a bistable mechanism can be designed to have a mechanical advantage. An analytical kinetoelastic model is used to explain the energy behavior of the mechanism and gain insights into applying it in practice. To account for varying loads experienced by the mechanism during switching, bistability is combined with <b>static</b> <b>balancing.</b> Such a mechanism is amenable {{to the design of}} an easy-chair to ease the suffering of arthritic and elderly users. Thus, a sit-to-stand easy-chair is designed where a small force applied on the armrest can gently propel and ease rising from it. <b>Static</b> <b>balancing</b> is implemented to partially compensate for the weight of the patient and to reduce the jerky motion arising from bistability. Furthermore, tuning parameters in <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> enable adjustment for weights of different users of the chair. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|At {{this moment}} {{there are more}} than 150 {{different}} designs of CMMA in existence. To aid the designer to develop a new or improved CMMA or choose what the design to use, a classification system is developed during the literature research. It is based on the geometrical advantage (GA) of the CMMA, and on the input and output port motion paths. Their properties resulted in 5 different classes, with a total of 50 + CMMA designs. The mechanical efficientcy (ME) of CMMA or compliant mechanisms in general can be non- optimal because of the elastic energy storage during motion. A technique called <b>static</b> <b>balancing,</b> can be applied to improve the efficiency of the device. A new way to apply the <b>static</b> <b>balancing,</b> without manual preloading, is developed for a straight-line micro mechanism.

In this contribution, the influence of mass-balancing on the elastodynamic performance of a four-bar linkage, intended as the simplest example of closed-loop mechanism, is experimentally investigated. The design of the experimental apparatus is discussed and the results of tests on both an unbalanced linkage and its balanced variant are presented. Base-transmitted forces and vibrations are monitored for constant-speed operations and for velocity ramp tests in order to characterize the elastodynamic behaviour of the linkages. The analysis is supported by implementing a flexible multibody model of the experimental apparatus that enhances the interpretation of the experimental data...|$|R

40|$|<b>Static</b> <b>balancing</b> is {{a useful}} concept to reduce {{operating}} effort in mechanisms. A statically balanced system {{which is designed to}} counterbalance a mass, is referred to as a gravity equilibrator. The potential energy in a gravity equilibrator is constant, which in most of the times is achieved by mechanical springs. Often helical springs are used, although these springs take a lot of space within the workspace of the mechanism. This paper presents the design of an adjustable gravity equilibrator using torsion bars, which saves space in the working area. <b>Static</b> <b>balancing</b> is achieved with a non-constant transmission (NCT). A new NCT design, and a general method to calculate the design parameters are presented. The stiffness of the torsion bars can be adapted by changing the active length. In this way it is possible to balance different masses with the same system. BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

On the <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> ground, a new mechanism is proposed, with the balancing of the folded suspension, a traditional mechanism of precision engineering. Numerical analysis suggests that high quality balancing is achieved for a large amplitude of motion. A preliminary study is also executed, introducing bond graph modeling to the field of energy harvesting. Bond graphs are a natural representation for the cross-domain nature of energy harvesters, allowing an integrative view.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> of {{the weight}} forces is {{necessary}} to any mechanical system which is not working in horizontal plane. The effect is the decrease (until to vanishing) of the acting power. From practical point of view two main ways of <b>static</b> <b>balancing</b> could be taken into consideration: by mass redistribution of components or/and by adding counterweights, and by elastic forces of the springs or of the gases. The first solution is not always possible due to the dimensions of mechanical systems and due to increasing of the dynamic stresses of components. Second solution {{is more and more}} used to various mechanical systems. The complexity of balancing systems with springs comes from the need of using zero-free length springs. In any case the mathematical model has not a unique solution. Present paper is an extension of a paper of first author [1] and is presenting a method to find the optimum solution of the simplest elastic system which is using a real helical extension spring with finite-free length. Design variables are the position of spring’s joints, as well as the constructional parameters of a extension spring. Finally some examples are presented...|$|R
