50|$|A <b>stockless</b> <b>anchor</b> or {{a patent}} anchor {{is a type}} of anchor. The device, for which a patent was filed and {{approved}} in 1821, was popular because it was easy to handle and stow. The crown, arms, and flukes are not welded together because the whole device is cast as a solid object.|$|E

50|$|While {{there are}} {{numerous}} variations, <b>stockless</b> <b>anchors</b> consist {{of a set of}} heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball and socket joint to a shank. Cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms, projections that drag on the bottom, forcing the main flukes to dig in.|$|R
50|$|The <b>stockless</b> <b>anchor,</b> {{patented}} in England in 1821, {{represented the}} first significant departure in anchor design in centuries. Though their holding-power-to-weight ratio is significantly lower than admiralty pattern anchors, their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption. In contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors, stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the hawsepipes, and the flukes against the hull (or inside a recess in the hull).|$|E
50|$|Crest: The <b>stockless</b> <b>anchor</b> {{is one of}} the {{distinguishing}} features of the Navy’s Medal of Honor and is also an ancient symbol of the sea. The fire-bomb with three flames denotes the three times Lieutenant Gary braved fire and exploding bombs to lead several hundred men to safety. The arrowheads are a traditional warrior symbol indicative of the warship Gary. The setting sun is symbolic of the location of the battle off the coast of Kure, Japan in which Lieutenant Gary performed his heroic actions. The palm fronds are an age-old symbol of honor and also represent his service in the south Pacific theater.|$|E
5000|$|Stockless anchors {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{used in the}} British mercantile marine and in some other navies. In 1903 they were adopted generally for the British Navy, after extensive anchor trials, begun in 1885. Their advantages are: handiness combined with a saving of time and labor; absence of davits, anchor-beds, and other gear, with a resulting reduction in weight; and a clear forecastyle for [...] "right ahead" [...] gun fire or for working ship. On the other hand a larger hawsepipe is required, and {{there appears to be}} a consensus that a <b>stockless</b> <b>anchor,</b> when [...] "let go" [...] does not hold so quickly as a stocked one, is more uncertain in its action over uneven ground, and is more liable to [...] "come home" [...] (drag).|$|E
50|$|George Washington (commonly {{known as}} GW) is 1,092 ft (333 m) long, 257 ft (78 m) wide and 244 feet (74 m) high. The super carrier can {{accommodate}} approximately 90 aircraft {{and has a}} flight deck 4.5 acres (18,000 m²) in size, using four elevators that are 3,880 ft² (360 m²) each to move planes between the flight deck and the hangar bay. With a combat load, GW displaces almost 97000 LT and can accommodate 6,250 crewmembers. Her four distilling units can make 400,000 U.S. gallons (1,500,000 L) of potable water a day; the food service divisions serve 18,000 meals per day. There are over 2,500 compartments on board requiring 2,520 refrigeration tons (8.6 MW) of air conditioning capacity (enough to cool over 2,000 homes). The warship uses two Mark II <b>stockless</b> <b>anchors</b> that weigh 30 tons each, with each link of the anchor chain weighing 360 pounds (160 kg). It is currently equipped with two 20 mm Phalanx CIWS mounts and two Sea Sparrow SAM launchers.

50|$|Lightship 1 {{was built}} in 1855 at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for $48,000.00. Lightship 1 was built of white oak and live oak and {{equipped}} with two lanterns and a hand operated bell fog signal. Each of the lanterns contained eight oil lamps with reflectors. Lightship 1 was rebuilt in 1860 and the main anchor was replaced with a mushroom in 1881 and then a <b>stockless</b> mushroom <b>anchor</b> in 1886. Lightship 1 was transferred to Martins Industry, South Carolina in 1892.|$|R
50|$|The ship {{consisted}} of a steel hull with high bulwarks and a double cellular bottom four feet deep and used 1,000 tons of water ballast. She measured 5,218 gross register tons, could carry nearly 11,000 tons of coal, and was operated by a crew of 16 to 18 including captain, engineer, two helmsmen, and two stewards. Due to the shallow depth of the eastern ports except Newport News, VA, she could not enter them with her maximum load. As a result, she carried a reduced capacity of 7,400 tons {{in order to reduce}} her working draft. She had two continuous decks, poop and forecastle decks, a large superstructure on the poop deck including the captains rooms with fine furniture and leather seats, the officers mess and rooms, card room, and a separate rudder house. On the main deck were two deckhouses around mast no. 5 and behind mast no. 6, as well as six main hatches to access the holds between the masts. Two huge steam winches were built in under the forecastle and behind mast no. 6. on the main deck. Smaller electrically driven winches were installed beside each mast. The exhaust for the donkey engine boiler was horizontally installed. All seven lower steel masts were secured by five (foremast: six) shrouds per side, the wooden topmasts with four shrouds per side to the crosstrees. The two ships <b>stockless</b> <b>anchors</b> weighed five tons each.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} dynamic {{responses of}} rock-berm structural system under anchor dragging and accordingly provides {{the characteristics of}} the stresses and displacements obtained. For the purpose, first, a rock-berm was modeled by the SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) method and piecewise Drucker-Prager material model by facilitating the associated software package—ANSYS-AUTODYN. Second, 2 -ton <b>stockless</b> <b>anchor</b> was modeled as a rigid body and eventually dragging external force was obtained. Then, the dragging velocity (1 and 2 [*]m/s) was considered as a parameter to investigate the effect of its variation on the responses. Finally, the dragging tensile forces of the anchor cable were obtained and compared according to the dragging velocities. It is shown that the four-layer rock-berm gives the safety margin to the submarine power cable according to the unaffected gauge points near the cable. This safety is accomplished by the four layers (related to rock-berm height) and the number of rock particles at each layer (related to rock-berm widths) ...|$|E

This thesis examines the history and development of the English Admiralty pattern anchor, from ca. 1550 to 1850. The anchor is not necessarily the most essential piece of equipment onboard a vessel, but it is certainly a standard implement of extreme importance. Mariners take the anchor for granted, landlubbers seldom give it a thought, and yet the anchor has become the very symbol of the sea. Before the beginning of the 16 th century, the basic design of the anchor had been fully developed. Little or no gross modification was attained during the following two hundred years, apart from the general increase in anchor size and some minor manufacturing techniques. In the middle of the 19 th century, with the increases in the knowledge of iron technology, there were radical changes in the design of anchors. These anchors were different in their design, being <b>stockless</b> <b>anchors</b> made of cast iron, instead of the earlier wrought iron anchors. This thesis examines the small changes that the anchor underwent, in an attempt to help other researchers date and identify a specific anchor's heritage. The parts of the anchor are described, as well as the terminology involved in anchoring a vessel. The number, weight, and size of anchors for the various sizes of vessels are listed for the time periods...|$|R
50|$|The ship's <b>stockless</b> bower <b>anchors</b> weighed 10 tons, {{attached}} to 125 ton, 330 fathom chains all manufactured by N. Hingley & Sons Ltd. The steam capstans {{to raise them}} were constructed by Napier Brothers Ltd, of Glasgow. The turbines were 25 ft long with 12 ft diameter rotors, the large diameter necessary because of the relatively low speeds at which they operated. The rotors were constructed on site, while the casings and shafting was constructed in John Brown's Atlas works in Sheffield. The machinery to drive the 56 ton rudder was constructed by Brown Brothers of Edinburgh. A main steering engine drove the rudder through worm gear and clutch operating on a toothed quadrant rack, with a reserve engine operating separately on the rack via a chain drive for emergency use. The 17 ft three bladed propellers were fitted and then cased in wood to protect them during the launch.|$|R
