5|$|Helmuth Raithel (9 April 190712 September 1990) was a German {{officer who}} held the rank of SS-Standartenführer (colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. While still at school, Raithel was <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{excitement}} of the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 led by Adolf Hitler, and was subsequently awarded the coveted Blood Order, {{even though he was}} {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. He joined the Reichswehr (interwar German Army) in 1926. After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941, then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1943.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} the last of a {{collaboration}} between director Curtiz and actor Errol Flynn which began in 1935 and spanned 12 films. The cast also includes Fred MacMurray, on loan from Paramount Studios and Alexis Smith in her first credited screen performance. Flynn portrays a Harvard-educated doctor who is involved in heroic medical research on pilots, with MacMurray as the skeptical veteran aviator who gets <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project. The plot is not historically accurate but, depicted in a near-documentary style, the film contains elements of true events that were involved in period aeromedical research, as well as real contemporary medical equipment.|$|E
60|$|The engine puffed {{smoke and}} bumped the cars ahead, {{little by little}} as the track advanced; men on the train carried ties and rails forward, filling the front cars {{as fast as they}} were emptied; long lines of laborers on the ground passed to and fro, {{burdened}} going forward, returning empty-handed; the rails and the shovels and the hammers and the picks all caught the hot gleam from the sun; <b>the</b> dust <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> sheets; <b>the</b> ring, the crash, the thump, the scrape of iron and wood and earth <b>in</b> collision filled <b>the</b> air with a sound rising harshly above the song and laugh and curse of men.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{critical}} reviews were negative. For example, Gabe Toro of Indiewire wrote: [...] "The ideas {{behind the}} film are laughably primitive, and it's startling {{to see an}} actor of McDowell's caliber <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> them. At <b>the</b> point where Satan begins taking credit for gangsta rap, it's clear that the ignorance that powers this film is borderline dangerous... In short, it's embarrassing on almost every level, poorly written, shot, scored and edited and bereft of a single idea, interesting or otherwise." [...] Mr Toro gave it a letter grade of F.|$|R
50|$|Nordhorn's {{landscape}} was shaped {{millions of years}} ago by climate changes, especially the ice ages. The oldest sediments from a depth of about two thousand metres come from the Carboniferous. With the onset of the Cretaceous and Tertiary, the Earth's crust here formed itself into drape folds. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-Tertiary, subtropical temperatures held sway on Nordhorn's plains. Thereafter began the gradual cooling, which reached its high point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ice ages. After the last ice had melted, lowlands developed. Strong winds <b>swept</b> dunes <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lifeless surface. Even today, the remains of such dune complexes {{can be found at the}} nearby Tillenberge (mountains). Archaeological finds from the Old Stone Age and the Bronze Age that followed bear witness to human settlement on Nordhorn's sand plains more than 6,000 years ago.|$|R
25|$|Robert Southey (1774–1843) was a {{prolific}} author of poetry, essays, histories, biographies, and translations, and Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom from 1813 to 1843. Hazlitt first met Southey in London in 1799. The two, along with Coleridge and Wordsworth, {{whom he had}} met not long before, were <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movement supporting {{the rights of the}} common man that inspired much of the educated English population {{in the wake of the}} French Revolution. During his brief career as a painter, until about 1803, Hazlitt spent time in the Lake District with Southey and the others, where they debated the future improvement of society as they rambled over the countryside.|$|E
25|$|A huge torchlight march {{took place}} the next night, {{attended}} by an estimated 15,000 Chicagoans. This rally marked {{the eve of}} the escalation of the strike, as on July 23 striking workers on the Michigan Central Railroad marched to the shops of the B & O and the Illinois Central to call out those workers to join the strike for higher wages. Machine shops, factories, and mills were <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strike wave. Employers and law enforcement authorities launched an offensive of their own, bringing about the firing of Workingmen's Party leader Albert Parsons from his job as a printer, and breaking up a WP meeting attended by 5,000 striking workers, family members and sympathizers through the copious use of nightsticks.|$|E
25|$|Set in France {{during the}} early 19th century, the film {{tells the story of}} Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who, {{inspired}} by a kindly bishop, decides to turn his life around. He eventually becomes mayor of a local town and owner of its factory. He is always alert to the risk of being captured again by police inspector Javert, who is ruthless in hunting down law-breakers, believing they cannot change for the better. One of Valjean's factory workers, Fantine, blames him for her being cast into a life of prostitution. When she dies, he feels responsible and agrees {{to take care of her}} illegitimate daughter Cosette—though he must first escape Javert. Later, when Cosette is grown, they are <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> political turmoil in Paris, which culminates in the Paris Uprising of 1832.|$|E

Sandro reluctantly decides to accompany Reno and the two spend two weeks with Sandro's family in their villa in Lake Como before the promotional tour is due to begin. However plans for the tour are put on hold when {{the star of the}} promotional tour, a professional racer, is kidnapped. Reno also finds Sandro kissing his cousin, Talia, and runs away to Rome with the Valera family mechanic, Gianni, who introduces her to a group of young radicals.

5000|$|Ada Loven - an ex-colleague of Brabbit. She {{was one of}} {{the very}} few to go to Paraworld with Brabbit and has been alive for at least a hundred years. At first she went along with Brabbit's plans, but began to think what she was doing and then started to betray him. At the start of the game she helps Brabbit dispose of the 3 heroes by sending them into Paraworld, but {{eventually}} helps them out by defeating a small band of barbarians. She then helps the 3 heroes get away but they are <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a storm. <b>The</b> 3 heroes think she has drowned, but she has survived and once she gets back to our world Brabbit accuses her of being a traitor. She angrily walks out of Brabbit's Office, and is not seen again until Chapter 14: The Prisoners as one of the prisoners, most likely because she was branded a traitor and she has been locked up.|$|R
25|$|Nathaniel Wollf was a 25-year-old from Buffalo, New York, {{just days}} away from graduating, when he volunteered to Dean Greenough that he had {{information}} about the suicide of Cyril Wilcox and was quickly <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Court's investigation. When interviewed he described several homosexual experiences but asserted {{he had made a}} clean break. The Court expelled him and refused his requests for re-admittance though it had initially offered hope that he might return. Wollf's application for admittance to McGill University was also denied because of Harvard's report of the reason for his expulsion. Wollf earned a medical degree at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City. After studying psychiatry for three more years, he spent ten years pursuing painting and academic interests. He traveled widely and briefly converted to Islam. He opened a nightclub in Barcelona in 1935. During World War II, he returned to the United States and he served as a psychiatrist for returning soldiers. He then practiced medicine in Mexico. He never married and died in London in 1959.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{preceding}} the race London experienced {{a series of}} riots; several football matches were called off, but the London–Surrey Cycle Classic was allowed to proceed. On race day British riders Liam Holohan, Kristian House and Tom Murray and Brazil's Cleberson Weber opened up a 6-minute gap in the breakaway before the peloton started to pull them back on the final Box Hill climb. 2009 British road race champion House won the King of the Mountains award. The lead quartet were <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final 9kilometres as Great Britain and England controlled the pace. Kurt Asle Arvesen then made a bid for the win before being brought back. With 12kilometres to go, Tyler Farrar suffered a puncture. After chasing furiously he reached the peloton with 2kilometres to go, only to see his chance of the win wiped out as a crash occurred; according to Heinrich Haussler it was caused by two riders fighting. The crash split the peloton and {{in a group of}} just 20 riders Mark Cavendish beat Sacha Modolo of Italy and France's Samuel Dumoulin in a sprint finish on the Mall.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, RCR ran the 33 in {{the first}} two races of the season with Scott and his family's Whitetail Club. Scott {{finished}} fifth in his Daytona Duel to earn a spot in the Daytona 500, then finished 25th in the race after several accidents. Scott ran the next race at Phoenix, starting and finishing 32nd. Scott was involved in a controversy in the fifth race of the season at Fontana, when he spun out Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Series regular Aric Almirola, who expressed displeasure at Scott's driving and source of sponsorship after getting out of the car. Scott would finish 35th in that race. Brian then won the pole at the spring Talladega race, his first career Cup pole. Scott would not lead any laps, however, and finished 42nd after crashing out. 2000 Cup Champion Bobby Labonte, who was doing test driving for RCR, drove the same car at the summer Daytona race, under the Circle Sport banner. The car again had speed in qualifying, timing in 4th. Labonte would contend for the lead for much of the race but finish 26th after being <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Big One. Richard Childress' younger grandson Ty Dillon drove at Atlanta and Phoenix in the fall, with sponsorship from Rheem, Realtree and Charter Communications.|$|E
40|$|We present non-adiabatic {{hydrodynamic}} {{simulations of}} a supersonic light jet propagating into a fully ionized medium of uniform density {{on a scale}} representative of the narrow line region (NLR) in Seyfert galaxies with associated radio jets. <b>In</b> this regime <b>the</b> cooling distance of <b>the</b> <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bowshock of the jet is of the same order as the transverse extent of the jet bowshock, {{as opposed to the}} more extreme regimes found for more powerful adiabatic large scale jets or the slow galactic jets which have been simulated previously. We calculate the emissivity for the H_alpha line and radio synchrotron emission. We find that the structure of the line emitting cold envelope of the jet cocoon is strongly dependent on the non-stationary dynamics of the jet head as it propagates through the ambient medium. We observe the formation of cloud-like high density regions which we associate with NLR clouds and filaments. We find that some of these clouds might be partially neutral and represent sites of jet induced star formation. The calculated H_alpha flux and the spectral line width are consistent with NLR observations. The simulation of the radio-optical emission with radiative cooling confirms the basic result of the geometric bowshock model developed by Taylor et al. (1989) that the start of noticeable optical line emission can be significantly offset from the hotspot of the radio emission. However, the time-dependent nature of the jet dynamics implies significant differences from their geometric bowshock model. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic plateau rocks, island arc {{fragments}} and tonalitic batholiths are juxtaposed {{on the southern}} Caribbean margin, and appear to be both spatially and temporally related. It is widely accepted that <b>the</b> plateau originated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific realm, and {{although there is no}} consensus as to which hotspot it was derived from, Galapagos is frequently cited. A previous study concluded that one of the tonalitic batholiths, the 85 Ma Aruba batholith was generated from the first stages of subduction beneath the 90 Ma plateau, following a subduction polarity reversal.;Until this study, little was known about the genesis of the arc sequences associated with the plateau, and their tectonic significance. This work focuses on the volcanic sequence exposed on Bonaire, and uses field, geochemical, isotopic and geochronological constraints to confirm that it is an arc sequence, and to reveal that the arc sequence is genetically unrelated to the plateau and the batholith. It formed as part of an oceanic arc at 95 +/- 2 Ma, prior to plateau formation.;In addition, Hf-Nd isotopes are used to fingerprint both the Caribbean plateau and the Galapagos plume, and support a genetic link between the two. The arc most likely originated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, along with the Caribbean plateau, and was later <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> eastwards moving plateau, and eventually accreted onto the Southern Caribbean margin...|$|R

Similar to the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo of Spain, non-anarchist members of the Confederación Nacional Obrera Cubana (National Cuban Workers Confederation), eventually formed the Communist Party of Cuba in August 1925. By this time, many anarchists (including Alfredo López and Carlos Baliño) had become <b>swept</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> excitement about the Russian Revolution, and had become party to more authoritarian forms of organizing. Many strikes occurred in the fall of 1925, and the government, once again under the leadership of Machado, was quick to suppress the labor movement.
