5|$|The Bayshore Freeway {{begins at}} the Blossom Hill Road {{interchange}} on US 101, where SR 82 begins its northwesterly path along Monterey Highway to San Jose. The freeway curves north and northwest, bypassing downtown San Jose to the east, and then curves west-northwest, crossing I-880 and SR 87, the latter {{just north of the}} San Jose International Airport. The portion of the highway from San Jose to South San Francisco is relatively straight and flat, running near the west edge of the San Francisco Bay. Junctions here include SR 237 in Sunnyvale, SR 85 in Mountain View, SR 84 in Menlo Park and Redwood City, SR 92 in San Mateo, and the San Francisco International Airport and I-380 in <b>San</b> <b>Bruno.</b> In South San Francisco, the freeway curves northeast around <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> Mountain, crossing its east edge at Sierra Point, and then heads north on a causeway across the former Candlestick Cove to the San Francisco city line.|$|E

The app {{is designed to}} provide an experience optimized for children, and features a simplified user interface, curated selections of channels featuring age-approriate content (including existing channels and entertainment brands), and parental control features. Later on August 26, 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video gaming-oriented sub-site and app that is intended to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.tv. 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium YouTube service titled YouTube Red, which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features. On August 10, 2015, Google announced that it was creating a new company, Alphabet, to act as the holding company for Google, with the change in financial reporting to begin {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2015. YouTube remains as a subsidiary of Google. In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> by purchasing an office park for $215million.

Angus Avenue. Additional classrooms were added in 1946. New offices, a cafeteria (with a stage), and a kindergarten building (now the media center) were built in 1956.|$|R
5|$|Sea otters {{were once}} {{numerous}} in San Francisco Bay. Historical records revealed the Russian-American Company sneaked Aleuts into San Francisco Bay multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of San Jose, San Mateo, <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> and around Angel Island. The founder of Fort Ross, Ivan Kuskov, finding otters scarce {{on his second}} voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to San Francisco Bay, where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters in three months. By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the Rancho Punta de Quentin was granted to Captain John B. R. Cooper, a sea captain from Boston, by Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado along with a license to hunt sea otters, reportedly then prevalent {{at the mouth of}} Corte Madera Creek.|$|E
5|$|Segments {{are further}} divided into work areas, {{indicated}} by brackets {{in the list}} above. Work {{is scheduled to begin}} in Segments 2 and 4 and proceed from north to south within each segment before moving on to Segments 1 and 3. The first work area will be in the cities of South San Francisco and <b>San</b> <b>Bruno.</b> Within each work area, the first activity will be tree pruning and removal (scheduled duration, two months) followed by construction of the foundations for the overhead contact system poles (scheduled duration, three to five months). Once the foundations are complete, construction of the traction power substation (estimated at twelve months in duration) and pole and wire installation (estimated at three months) will work in parallel. Schedules have been announced for Segment 2, Work Areas 5 (South City/San Bruno), 4 (Millbrae/Burlingame), and 3 (San Mateo). Traction power substations have been confirmed for South San Francisco and Burlingame, with another traction power substation in the city of San Mateo at a site yet to be named.|$|E
5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E
5000|$|Edgemont Elementary School, {{a two-story}} {{structure}} {{was built on}} a large lot bounded by Elm, Acacia, and Jenevein avenues. The building also housed the district offices. With the completion of this building, in November 1910, the [...] "Old Tin School House" [...] served as a municipal building, known as Green Hall, and eventually became <b>San</b> <b>Bruno's</b> first city hall in 1914, when the city was incorporated.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, the {{combined}} circulation {{of the three}} newspapers was 50,000. [...] The Herald eventually added a small Saturday edition. The longtime news editor was Jack Bik (1922-1984), who wrote most of the editorials and numerous feature stories. Its sports editor and principal photographer was Warren Wynkoop (1930-1976), who also hosted a program on KCSM (FM) in San Mateo. Wynkoop regularly covered the career of MLB pitcher Wally Bunker, who graduated from <b>San</b> <b>Bruno's</b> Capuchino High School in June 1963. The women's editor was Jane Dryden.|$|R
50|$|In late 1957, {{following}} {{damage to}} Edgemont Elementary School by the 1957 San Francisco earthquake on March 22, {{the school board}} decided to close the building, demolish it, {{and replace it with}} new classrooms and offices. With the completion of the new facility, New Edgemont Elementary School was renamed Decima Allen Elementary School, to honor a beloved librarian. Decima M. Allen was <b>San</b> <b>Bruno's</b> librarian from 1937 to 1955, overseeing the construction of the present main library next to the city hall in 1954; she also served on the school board for 25 years and was president of the Edgemont PTA.|$|R
5|$|The state {{legislature}} extended the highway in 1925, defining it {{to run from}} near the intersection of Army Street (Cesar Chavez Street) and <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> Avenue in San Francisco to a point in San Jose. The governor approved the bill with the stipulation that only the portion between the city limits of San Francisco and San Jose would be a state highway. Construction between South San Francisco and Burlingame had begun by 1924, funded by a $500,000 contribution from San Francisco, and was completed in 1928. A disconnected segment north of San Mateo was built by the state at the same time. It was not until February 1929 that the road was fully paved between San Francisco and Burlingame, and on October 20, 1929 the new highway was officially dedicated to San Mateo, several months after the connecting San Mateo-Hayward Bridge opened (at what is now Third Avenue). Even then, motorists {{had to wait until}} May 7, 1931 to reach Jefferson Avenue in Redwood City (near the west end of the four-year-old Dumbarton Bridge). The roadway was extended to Oregon Avenue in Palo Alto in mid-1932, Lawrence Station Road in mid-1933, and to Lafayette Street near Santa Clara, across the Guadalupe River from San Jose, by 1934. The final piece to Oakland Road (13th Street) in San Jose, which was then the main road - Legislative Route 5 and Sign Route 17 - between San Jose and Oakland, was dedicated on June 12, 1937, over ten years after the Dumbarton Bridge opened in January 1927.|$|E

2500|$|Real {{growth and}} {{development}} began after the 1906 earthquake and fire. The city's first public school was completed in late 1906. With the construction of Edgemont Elementary School in 1910, all classes were moved there and the original school building became a public facility named Green Hall. Another school, North Brae Elementary School, opened in 1912; among its earliest students was future actor Eddie [...] "Rochester" [...] Anderson. Paving of California's first state highway, El Camino Real, began in 1912 in front of <b>San</b> <b>Bruno's</b> Uncle Tom's Cabin; the highway is now designated as State Route 82. The adjoining San Francisco International Airport opened in early 1927 and included a Weather Bureau station, now operated by the National Weather Service. Charles Lindbergh was an early visitor to the airport, during his national tour following his successful transatlantic flight; unfortunately, his airplane (Spirit of St. Louis) became stuck in the mud.|$|R
25|$|<b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> {{considered}} new annexations in {{the mid-1950s}} that would have extended the city limits to the Pacific Ocean. The unincorporated communities west of <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> were against annexation, and collectively incorporated as the city of Pacifica in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Parkside Intermediate School {{was opened}} in 1954, {{followed}} by additional elementary schools: Rollingwood, Crestmoor, John Muir, and Carl Sandburg.

5000|$|During {{the dot-com}} {{boom of the}} 1990s [...] Bruno worked as {{a real estate agent}} for Sotheby’s {{real-estate}} division in <b>San</b> Francisco. [...] <b>Bruno</b> says he was inspired to get his real estate license at age 19 after reading Napoleon Hill’s 1937 self-improvement book “Think and Grow Rich”. In 2001, after moving to Paris, France, Bruno created 1stdibs.com, an online luxury marketplace for antiques, jewelry, and fine art that grew to include thousands of dealers around the world. He said the idea for the company came to him while visiting the famous Clignancourt flea market in Paris. Since the company’s founding, it has expanded into 17 markets around the world, including the United States, several European countries, and Australia. In 2011, Bruno accepted a $60 million investment from venture capital firm, Benchmark, and stepped down from his role as CEO of 1stdibs but stayed on as chief creative officer. [...] In late 2012, 1stdibs received an additional $42 million in Series B funding from Index Ventures and Spark Capital. In January 2014, Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba Group invested $15 million in 1stdibs to help the company expand its business in Asia.

25|$|<b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> was the {{location}} of the Ohlone village Urebure. It was explored in November 1769 by a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà.

This creek apparently later gave its name to the community.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{campaign}} {{by the local}} newspaper, the <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> Herald, the community was incorporated in 1914, mainly so the streets could be paved. Green Hall became the first city hall. <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> grew rapidly, passing 1,500 residents by 1920 and 3,610 residents in 1930.

25|$|The <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), {{the first}} of its kind in the United States, was adopted in 1983. Currently, it is the only HCP that {{potentially}} addresses the Bay checkerspot. The plan covers some 3,400acres(14km2) in northern San Mateo County and identifies seven animal species and 44 plant species to be conserved. Among them, the federally endangered Mission blue and the Bay checkerspot butterfly, the Bay checkerspot was not federally listed when the plan was adopted. Thus, this HCP's primary focus is on the two species of butterfly that were federally listed when it was adopted in 1983, the Mission blue butterfly and <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> elfin butterfly. The permit for the plan expires on March 31, 2013, and there are currently no provisions in the HCP for incidental take of Bay checkerspots. The Bay checkerspot was lost on <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> Mountain around 1986. The impetuses included fires, non-native plant species and natural fluctuations. The reintroduction of the Bay checkerspot is one of the goals of the <b>San</b> <b>Bruno</b> HCP.|$|E
