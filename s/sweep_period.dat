40|$|In Electronic Support, it is {{well known}} that {{periodic}} search strategies for swept-frequency superheterodyne receivers (SHRs) can cause synchronisation with the radar it seeks to detect. Synchronisation occurs when the periods governing the search strategies of the SHR and radar are commensurate. The result may be that the radar is never detected. This paper considers the synchronisation problem in depth. We find that there are usually a finite number of synchronisation ratios between the radar’s scan period and the SHR’s <b>sweep</b> <b>period.</b> We develop three geometric constructions by which these ratios can be found and we relate them to the Farey series. The ratios may be used to determine the intercept time for any combination of scan and <b>sweep</b> <b>period.</b> This theory can assist the operator of an SHR in selecting a <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> that minimises the intercept time against a number of radars in a threat emitter list...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 44) The goal of {{this study}} was to analyze news content in five Chicago television stations' news programs during a sweep ratings period and a non-sweep ratings period. The hypotheses were: (I) The quantity of hard news will change significantly from a <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> to a non-sweep period. (II) The ratings positions of each station and the share (of audience) will change significantly from a <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> to a non-sweep period. (Ill) The quantity of soft news will change significantly from a <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> to a non-sweep period. Two weeks of the year were selected by simple random sampling, one week within the sweep periods and one week within the non-sweep ratings periods. The last nightly television news program was videotaped, Monday through Friday, from CBS/WBBM, NBC/WMAQ, ABC-Cap Cities/WLS, Tribune/WGN and Fox/WFLD. After all newscasts were videotaped, their contents were coded by two individuals. Each item was measured in terms of the total seconds used. Another individual reviewed the coded material to establish coding reliability. The data were tested by the statistical t-test for independent means and z-test for differences in percentages. Generally, support was found for all three hypotheses. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{provide a}} sweep {{coverage}} algorithm for routing mobile sensors that communicate {{with a central}} data sink. This algorithm improves on its predecessors by {{reducing the number of}} unnecessary scans when different points of interest (POIs) have different requirements for the time interval within which they must be scanned (<b>sweep</b> <b>period).</b> Most sweep coverage algorithms seek to minimize the number of sensors required to cover a given collection of POIs. When POIs have different <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> requirements, existing algorithms will produce solutions in which sensors visit some POIs much more frequently than is necessary. We define this as the POI Over-Coverage problem. In order to address this problem we develop a Periodic Sweep Coverage (PSC) scheme based on a well-known solution to the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP). Our algorithm seeks a route for the mobile sensors that minimizes the number of unnecessary visits to each POI. To verify and test the proposed scheme we implemented a C++ simulation and ran scenarios with a variety of POI topologies (number and distribution of the POIs) and the speed at which sensors could travel. The simulation results show that the PSC algorithm outperforms other sweep coverage algorithms such as CSweep and Vehicle Routing Problem Sweep Coverage (VRPSC) on both the average number of sensors in a solution and in the computational time required to find a solution. Our results also demonstrate that the PSC scheme is more suitable for the sweep coverage scenarios in which higher speed mobile sensors are used...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{ultrasonic}} micro-devices, {{contrast agent}} micro-bubbles {{are known to}} initiate cavitation and streaming local to cells, potentially compromising cell viability. Here we investigate the effects of US alone by omitting contrast agent and monitoring cell viability under moderate-to-extreme ultrasound-related stimuli. Results: Suspended H 9 c 2 cardiac myoblasts were exposed to ultrasonic fields within a glass micro-capillary and their viability monitored under different US-related stimuli. An optimal injection flow rate of 2. 6 mL/h was identified in which, high viability was maintained (~ 95 %) and no mechanical stress towards cells was evident. This flow rate also allowed sufficient exposure of cells to US in order to induce bioeffects (~ 5 sec), whilst providing economical sample collection and processing times. Although the transducer temperature increased from ambient 23 [degree sign]C to 54 [degree sign]C at the maximum experimental voltage (29 Vpp), computational fluid dynamic simulations and controls (absence of US) revealed that the cell medium temperature did not exceed 34 [degree sign]C in the pressure nodal plane. Cells exposed to US amplitudes ranging from 0 [...] 29 Vpp, at a fixed frequency <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> (tsw = 0. 05 sec), revealed that viability was minimally affected up to ~ 15 Vpp. There was a ~ 17 % reduction in viability at 21 Vpp, corresponding to the onset of Rayleigh-like streaming and a ~ 60 % reduction at 29 Vpp, corresponding to increased streaming velocity or the potential onset of cavitation. At a fixed amplitude (29 Vpp) but with varying frequency <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> (tsw = 0. 02 - 0. 50 sec), cell viability remained relatively constant at tsw >= 0. 08 sec, whilst viability reduced at tsw < 0. 08 sec and minimum viability recorded at tsw = 0. 05 sec. Conclusion: The absence of CA has enabled us to investigate the effect of US alone on cell viability. Moderate-to-extreme US-related stimuli of cells have allowed us to discriminate between stimuli that maintain high viability and stimuli that significantly reduce cell viability. Results from this study may be of potential interest to researchers {{in the field of}} US-induced intracellular drug delivery and ultrasonic manipulation of biological cells. <br/...|$|E
30|$|The sweep {{coverage}} {{problem is}} motivated by the applications without continuous coverage requirement. In such cases, mobile sensors are often used. There are some existing works about sweep coverage [1, 2]. The main goal of those works is to minimize the number of mobile sensors so as {{to cover all the}} POIs in the region without violating the given time. Li et al. proposed a centralized algorithm CSWEEP [1]. Firstly, the authors take all POIs as input and employ a PTAS algorithm [31] of TSP and get an approximate TSP ring. Secondly, every mobile sensor is scheduled to move along the TSP ring segments back and forth under the requirement of <b>sweep</b> <b>period.</b> Du et al. [2] proposed two algorithms for different situations. In the first algorithm, they gradually deploy mobile sensors and schedule the mobile sensors to move on the same trajectory in each period. In the second algorithm, named OSWEEP algorithm, the mobile sensors are not required to follow the same trajectory in each period, all the mobile sensors are scheduled to move along the TSP ring which consists of POIs towards the same direction. The OSWEEP algorithm has better performance than CSWEEP.|$|E

40|$|Many {{efforts have}} been made for {{addressing}} coverage problems in sensor networks. They fall into two categories, full coverage and barrier coverage, featured as static coverage. In this work, we study a new coverage scenario, sweep coverage, which differs with the previous static coverage. In sweep coverage, we only need to monitor certain points of interest (POIs) periodically so the coverage at each POI is time-variant, and thus {{we are able to}} utilize a small number of mobile sensors to achieve sweep coverage among a much larger number of POIs. We investigate the definitions and model for sweep coverage. Given a set of POIs and their <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> requirements, we prove that determining the minimum number of required sensors (min-sensor sweep-coverage problem) is NP-hard, and it cannot be approximated within a factor of 2. We propose a centralized algorithm with constant approximation ratio 2 + ∈ for the simplified problem where all sweep periods are identical. We further characterize the non-locality of the problem and design a distributed sweep algorithm, DSWEEP, cooperat-ing sensors to provide required sweep requirements with the best effort. We conduct extensive simulations to study the performance of the proposed algorithms. Our simulations show that DSWEEP outperforms the randomized scheme in both effectiveness and efficiency. © 2008 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of an}} {{experimental}} investigation designed to analyze the interaction between near wall coherent structures (or burst) and bedload transport in an open channel flow. Laser doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements of the instantaneous velocity near the wall were coupled with real time measurements of sand particle trajectories on the bottom of an hydraulic plume. We will first give a description of the bursting phenomenon and we will present the experimental design. Then, we will give some details about the specific signal processing techniques we used in this work to detect coherent structures on the velocity signal. The third part of this paper will present our results. We will show that the period between two consecutive displacements of a solid particle can be compared to the mean period between two consecutive ejections. This would suggest that these structures are involved in bedload transport. For small displacements, the time distribution between two consecutive movements shows two modes. One would be associated to particles whose mean deposit time corresponds to the ejection period, the second would be associated to particles whose mean deposit time is close to the <b>sweep</b> <b>period.</b> We made the assumption that there exist two transport modes at the wall: the dominant one was transport by ejections, but sweeps can be involved in the removal of particles whose friction coecient with the wall is high...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{separation}} of micron-sized particles from {{a steady flow}} of water through the use of ultrasonic standing waves is discussed. An ultrasonic resonator has been designed with a flow inlet and outlet for the water stream. The resonator is typically about 0. 15 m long with a cross-section of 0. 0254  m× 0. 0254  m. The flow inlet and outlet ports have been designed to ensure laminar flow conditions {{into and out of the}} resonator. A PZT- 4, 2 -MHz, transducer is used to generate ultrasonic standing waves in the resonator. At fixed frequency excitation, particles are concentrated at the stable locations of the acoustic radiation force. Particle translation is achieved by a periodic sweeping of the frequency of excitation, which generates a slowly moving standing wave. The effect of the <b>sweep</b> <b>period</b> and the sweep frequency range on particle translation speed has been investigated for the {{separation of}} 6 micron polystyrene beads. A numerical model has been developed to compute the trajectories of particles subjected to the acoustic radiation force, fluid drag force, and buoyancy force. The acoustic radiation force is determined from a one-dimensional acoustic field model. A CFD model is used to calculate the mean fluid flow into and out of the resonator and is used to calculate the fluid drag force. The equations of motion are then integrated to yield the particle trajectories. Typical particle translation speeds are on the order of 5 mm/s. Successful separation of 6 micron polystyrene beads from a water inlet flow, with typical volume flow rates of 150 ml/min, has been achieved...|$|E
