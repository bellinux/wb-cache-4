40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} tilt table incline and knee flexion angle {{on the degree of}} weight bearing and forces exerted across the <b>supporting</b> <b>straps.</b> DESIGN: A quantitative and exploratory study to {{investigate the}} effects of a mechanical procedure. SETTING: Physiotherapy gymnasium. SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy subjects (9 female, 3 male) aged 22 - 45 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects stood on a tilt table, on two occasions, with simulated contractures of 10 degrees and 40 degrees knee flexion. Nine tilt angles, between 10 degrees and 90 degrees, were maintained for 1 minute each in random order. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Force was recorded from single-point load cells placed under the feet, and at knee and chest straps. RESULTS: The degree of simulated knee contracture (10 degrees or 40 degrees) influenced the distribution of forces at different recording sites. Weight bearing increased with table incline and was significantly less with the 40 degrees than the 10 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 001). Conversely, forces across the knee straps were systemically higher with the 40 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 0001). The effects were accentuated by greater body weight. Forces across the chest strap also increased with tilt and were significantly larger with the 40 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between table incline, angle of knee flexion and distribution of forces generated during tilt table standing have been quantified and described. Standing with flexed knees involved less weight bearing under the feet and greater force exerted across the <b>supporting</b> <b>straps.</b> These effects were more pronounced at the higher knee angle and with greater body weight, and could be modified by reducing table inclin...|$|R
2500|$|Spermatogenesis {{takes place}} within several {{structures}} of the male reproductive system. The initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the epididymis where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation. The seminiferous tubules of the testes are {{the starting point for}} the process, where spermatogonial stem cells adjacent to the inner tubule wall divide in a centripetal directionbeginning at the walls and proceeding into the innermost part, or lumento produce immature sperm. Maturation occurs in the epididymis.

40|$|An {{effort was}} made to {{increase}} the predicted lifetime of the SIRTF dewar by lowering the exterior shell temperature, increasing the radiated energy from the vapor cooled shields and reconfiguring the vapor cooled shields. The lifetime increases can be used to increase the scientific return from the mission and as a trade-off against mass and cost. This paper describes the configurations studied, the steady state thermal model used, the analytical methods and the results of the analysis. Much of the heat input to the outside dewar shell is radiative heat transfer from the solar panel. To lower the shell temperature, radiative cooled shields were placed between the solar panel and the dewar shell and between the bus and the dewar shell. Analysis showed that placing a radiator on the outer vapor cooled shield had a significant effect on lifetime. Lengthening the distance between the outer shell and the point where the vapor cooled shields are attached to the <b>support</b> <b>straps</b> also improved lifetime...|$|R

40|$|The orbital {{cryogenic}} {{lifetime of}} dewars {{is driven by}} the internal heat load. The heat load on the cryogen tank of a cryostat is given by two major effects: radiation and conduction. Radiation is minimized by using vapour cooled radiation shields with multilayer insulation on them {{as well as on the}} cryogen tank. Conduction is coming from all parts which have direct connection between the warm and cold ends. There are three basic conduction contributors: harness, piping, and tank support structure. The design of all these elements is usually optimized in order to fulfill their specific tasks with minimum heat transfer. The biggest conduction contributor of these three elements in a cryostat with a conventional <b>strap</b> type tank <b>support</b> is actually the tank support which must be designed to withstand the high dynamic loads during launch and, in some specific cases, also during landing. Even if the tank <b>support</b> <b>straps</b> are optimized to the lowest possible heat conduction by minimizing the cross sectional area and by a proper selection of low conductive materials their thermal conduction contribution to the cryogen heat load is still the biggest. It is therefore worthwhile to undertake technical efforts to reduce the cryogen tank support heat conduction as far as possible. The ultimate goal would be to eliminate their conduction completely on orbit where, due to zero-g conditions, in many applications no real tank support is required. (orig.)

Optimum designs are obtained via the CONMIN program for a support system consisting of simple tension <b>straps</b> and <b>support</b> systems with passive thermal disconnect features by means of which the thermal conductance is greatly reduced during the transition from the launch condition to the orbital condition.

Currently, six experiments have been selected for flight definition studies. More will be selected in a two-year cycle, through NASA Research Announcement.

The facility is being designed to launch and returned to earth {{on a variety of}} vehicles including the HII-A and the space shuttle. On orbit, the facility will be connected to the Exposed Facility on the Japanese Experiment Module, Kibo. Features of the facility include a cryostat capable of maintaining super-fluid helium at a temperature of 1. 4 K for 5 months, resistance thermometer bridges, multi-stage thermal isolation system, thermometers capable of pico-Kelvin resolution, DC SQUID magnetometers, passive vibration isolation, and magnetic shields with a shielding factor of 80 dB. The electronics and software architecture incorporates two VME buses run using the VxWorks operating system. Technically challenging areas in the design effort include the following: 1) A long cryogen life that survives several launch and test cycles without the need to replace <b>support</b> <b>straps</b> for the helium tank. 2) The minimization of heat generation in the sample stage caused by launch vibration 3) The design of compact and lightweight DC SQUID electronics. 4) The minimization of RF interference for the measurement of heat at pico-Watt level. 5) Light weighting of the magnetic shields. 6) Implementation of a modular and flexible electronics and software architecture.
