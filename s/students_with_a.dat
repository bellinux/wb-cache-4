5|$|For the 2016-17 {{academic}} year, {{the university}} has {{a higher proportion of}} female than male <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> male to female ratio of 45:55 in the population. The undergraduate student body is composed of 73% from the UK, 11% from the EU and 16% from outside of the EU.|$|E
5|$|Between 1954 and 1960, {{the student}} body at New England more than doubled to over 500 <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{corresponding}} increase in staff and faculty, forcing the school to erect temporary, weatherboard huts to accommodate its expanded facilities and classrooms. In 1958, the university received £900,000 in government grants for facilities improvements and Madgwick presided over the planning and construction of over ten permanent buildings on the main campus, {{some of which were}} completed after Madgwick retired in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Parents of Amador Valley {{students}} {{became involved}} with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program to provide <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> better environment for learning. Parents donated pots and pans, and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project {{led to the formation}} of a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.|$|E
40|$|Quality support {{services}} {{play a significant}} role in the overall development of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability. This qualitative study sought to examine to what extent the {{support services}} provided in South Australian schools for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability influenced these students’ problem-solving skills, family, social and academic lives. Interviews were conducted <b>with</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability, their parents and their teachers. These data reflected a range of viewpoints from which to examine the problem under investigation. <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability and their parents found that the support services had no real influence on students’ abilities to solve problems, or on their social and family lives. Teachers, on the contrary, considered that students’ problem-solving skills had been helped by the support given, their social lives to a more limited extent and their family lives were not influenced by the support. According to <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability and their teachers, the support influenced the academic lives of students positively; however, parents considered a limited influence of the support on this aspect as well. The interviews were particularly useful in evaluating the support services that <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability received...|$|R

5|$|Basic Guides were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource Guides, {{remained the same}} from year to year. The Art Basic Guide focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics Basic Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The Language and Literature Basic Guide provides <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math Basic Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music Basic Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of Western music. However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the Basic Guides were incorporated into the year's Resource Guides.|$|E
5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E

In 1979, the Georgetown administration {{decided that the}} station did not fit with the public image they desired for the university, and sold the station to the University of the District of Columbia for US$1. UDC took ownership officially on March 12, 1980, and WGTB became WDCU, with a jazz format. During a budgetary crisis in mid-1997, the school sold WDCU for $13 million to C-SPAN, a non-profit funded by the cable television industry. UDC had planned to sell the station to Christian radio conglomerate Salem Communications; however this deal was unsuccessful, leading to C-SPAN’s accepted purchase of WDCU. Once the station was purchased, broadcasting of C-SPAN Radio on WCSP-FM began on October 9, 1997.|$|E
