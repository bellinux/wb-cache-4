The Passive Dog training was implemented in 1993, and is now the Agency's preference.|$|E
25|$|Springfield {{is called}} the Crossroads of New England {{because it is the}} major {{shipping}} nexus from New York City, Boston, Montreal and the Great Lakes (via Albany, New York). Much of the cargo heading from one of these places to another crosses through the City of Springfield.

500|$|In 1972, Lennon and Ono {{released}} an 81-minute film {{to accompany the}} Imagine album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their Berkshire property at Tittenhurst Park {{as well as in}} New York City. A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song [...] "Imagine" [...] begins. Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: [...] "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression. At the song's conclusion, Ono <b>sits</b> <b>beside</b> Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.|$|E
500|$|The clips {{differ from}} one another in terms of Lennon's attire {{and the nature of}} Ono's role as, in author Robert Rodriguez's description, [...] "an onstage focal point around which all {{activity}} was staged"; in addition, Lennon's vocal was treated with echo for the 19 February broadcast. In the [...] "knitting" [...] clip, Lennon is wearing a black polo-neck jumper as Ono <b>sits</b> <b>beside</b> his piano, blindfolded, and knitting throughout. In [...] "cue card", Lennon wears a flower-pattern shirt under a denim jacket, while Ono holds up a series of cryptically worded cue cards, the messages on which include [...] "Smile", [...] "Hope" [...] and [...] "Peace", as she speaks into a microphone. Although Ono appears to have a more active role, she is again blindfolded and the words she speaks cannot be heard. Rodriguez describes both clips as [...] "terrifically engaging, providing suitably dynamic visuals to a powerful song", yet he considers that the [...] "cue card" [...] performance [...] "captures much more of the ambience, with frequent shots of White's stellar work and the studio dancers".|$|E

In a parallel with the island timeline, Boone tells Locke if they crashed, he would follow him. Once the plane lands, Boone shakes Locke's hand and exits the plane. Boone reappears in the final episode of Lost. In [...] "The End", we see Hurley and Sayid talking in a car on a dark street, and they witness a thug beating up a guy (Boone) outside of a bar. Shannon shouts [...] "Leave my brother alone," [...] and Sayid {{gets out of the}} car to intervene. His and Shannon's memories are restored the moment they touch. Boone, having conspired with Hurley to bring Shannon and Sayid together, wanders over to the car. He jokes with Hurley about how he had to take a beating and [...] "thanks for taking your time." [...] He also comments how difficult it was to get Shannon to return from Australia with him, but he and Hurley agree the effort was worth it for this moment to have her and Sayid's memories restored. Boone is one of the first people Jack greets in the church where everyone reunites to move on to the afterlife together.|$|E

[...] She becomes depressed and <b>sits</b> <b>beside</b> the water with her new baby, contemplating how a woman could be driven crazy. [...] Cisneros develops this tale, which has also been found slightly modified in Aztec, Greek, and Spanish cultures, from the legend of La Llorona (Spanish for [...] "weeping woman"), a ghost story found in Mexico and Texas. In the myth, [...] "a beautiful young woman named Maria falls in love and marries a handsome, rich boy, and their union is blessed with two sons and a daughter". Soon after, the man loses his affection for his wife. Maria, knowing that her husband no longer loves her, drowns their three children in the river and then herself. Upon reaching heaven, Maria is told that she cannot enter until she has found her children. She is sent back to Earth, where she wails sorrowfully for her children. According to legend, any child that happens upon her ghost is pulled into the river and drowned. [...] The real Woman Hollering Creek, a body of water just off Interstate 10 in Texas, is the river which Cisneros mentions in her story. [...] The protagonist in [...] "Woman Hollering Creek" [...] is rescued from her abusive husband by two strangers before she goes mad.|$|E
