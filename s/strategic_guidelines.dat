Therefore, Innovation methods are the backbone of PSS. Since PSS highly emphasizes the customers' needs and co-creation with them, user-innovation methods are required in order to boost PSS Innovation. Among user-innovation methods, Crowdsourcing seems to be valid option which would enable us to attract a large, undefined network of people to the innovation process. In this research, a success model for crowdsourcing practice is proposed and validated by literature and expert interviews. As a follow-up, based on the success model, a <b>strategic</b> <b>guideline</b> for innovation using open modes of collaboration is proposed. Moreover, we discuss the implication of PSS and sustainability and how these concepts can be empowered by crowdsourcing...|$|R

However, the main challenge in product development is associated with the uncertaincy risks that may appeared during the design process. Such risks may affect the success rate of the product development and may contribute either to a small or a huge loss, in which the sustainability of the company can also be affected. To mitigate the risks in product development, risk management is critical. CV. XYZ is a company producing dairy-based products such as mozzarella cheese and yogurt.
