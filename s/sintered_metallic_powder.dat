In the weak-coupling limit ρ(ω) possesses a pronounced low-frequency peak leading to an enhanced heat transfer coefficient at low temperatures.

In our study, three <b>metallic</b> <b>powders</b> with different compositions, particle shapes and particle sizes have been selected as the test materials to produce micro-structured parts using injection moulding process. The combination of three binders (polypropylene, paraffin waxes and stearic acid) with a constant and adapted formulation has been chosen as a binder system. The mixtures obtained by mixing the <b>metallic</b> <b>powders</b> and the binder system with solid loadings ranging from 56 to 64 vol. % have been used as the feedstocks for the next injection moulding. The viscosity of mixture increased with increasing solid loading. These feedstocks were injected using the same injection moulding conditions in the metallic mould structured with pyramidal shape manufactured using electro-erosion machining. The debinding and sintering process have been carried out at different temperatures to eliminate the binders in the injected replica and obtain the final metallic die mould. To analyse the physical properties evolution of the die mould manufactured by PIM and the influence factors (powder nuance, solid loading and sintering conditions), the shrinkage rate, density, roughness of surface, Vickers hardness and mass losses in metallic mould cavities were investigated.

The main phenomena involved resulted to be the electromagnetic field concentration in the regions among the conductive particles, as well as direct microwave absorption within the skin depth of the metal particles. This local concentration of the electric field, occurring exactly in the regions of necks formation, can have intensity higher than the dielectric strength of the medium, thus favouring breakdown phenomena, leading to arcing and local plasma formation, which trigger more efficient mass transport mechanisms during sintering. Three different cases has been numerically simulated and experimentally tested, in order to study the effects of particles dimension and shape: sintering of micrometric steel and brass spheres, sintering of millimetric pure metals and brass spheres, sintering of glass matrix composites reinforced with metal fibres...|$|R

MLSS is a rapid tooling system using a fine <b>metallic</b> <b>powder</b> {{integrated with}} machining process whereby it can do laser <b>sintering</b> of fine <b>metallic</b> <b>powder</b> and also high-speed milling. This paper deals with the investigation of sintered material machinability by measuring its specific cutting energy and tool flank temperature.

The effects of cutting conditions, laser consolidation energy density, powder consolidation mechanisms and unsintered powder on its machinability are measured. It is demonstrated that tool flank temperatures for all sintered materials are higher than JIS S 55 C. Low energy density for consolidation of metal powder increases the machinability of sintered materials. Cutting at the partially molten powder decreases the machinability of sintered material.

Our study has proven that only a few minutes of induction heating, of Ti and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (wt %) powder compacts, increases their density dramatically and causes a significant sintering effect, as evidenced by the formation of interparticle diffusion bonding and reflected by the tensile properties of the induction sintered powder compacts. This paper presents and discusses the results of a study on the tensile properties and fracture behaviour of the Ti and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder compacts sintered under a variety of induction heating conditions.

40|$|The mass {{production}} of components with dimensions in the micron and sub-micron range is anticipated {{to be one}} of the leading technology areas for the present century and to be of high market potential. Micro metal injection molding (μMIM) has the potential to be an important contributor to this industry as it can produce precise metallic microstructures in large quantities at a relatively low production cost. The μMIM process is a miniaturization of metal injection molding (MIM) methods. The process comprises of four main steps: mixing, injection molding, debinding and <b>sintering.</b> A <b>metallic</b> <b>powder</b> is mixed with a binder system to form the feedstock. The feedstock is then injection molded into the required shape and the binder removed via thermal or other means.
