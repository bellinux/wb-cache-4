40|$|Abstract: A {{performance}} capability measure is proposed that {{is useful in}} a wide class of production processes. Traditional quality improvement methodologies concentrate on getting the process right {{in order to meet}} the capability requirements of the product immediately after production, as measured for a key quality characteristic by one of the popular capability indexes. This is not the best strategy when the characteristic degrades over time in use. The implications of this type of degradation on targeting the production process are investigated and illustrated for five typical degradation models. A method is given which enables the optimum settings for the target values of the process mean and standard deviation to be chosen, given a particular model for product degradation. Commonly used philosophies which advocate targeting at the centre of the <b>specification</b> <b>range</b> are shown to be sub-optimal. A useful consequence of better targeting practice is that warranty periods can be extended without increasing the costs associated with supporting warranty claims...|$|E

Quality of life (QOL) has been conceptualized and studied in children for several decades, but with disparate approaches that have rarely been discussed jointly with application to children in general. Here we describe and critically examine the three main approaches to children's QOL: health-related QOL (HRQOL), social indicators, and subjective well-being (SWB).

In humans, various methods of patient heating have been demonstrated to be useful, but less evaluation has been performed in techniques to prevent hypothermia perioperatively in pigs. Methods: We compared body temperature regulation during surgery before and after modification of the ambient temperature of the operating laboratories. Three different methods of heating were then compared; a standard circulating water mattress, a resistive fabric blanket, and a forced hot air system. The primary measure was percentage of temperature readings outside a <b>specification</b> <b>range</b> of 36. 7 – 40. 0 °C. Results: Tighter control of the ambient temperature while using a circulating water mattress reduced the occurrence of out-of-specification body temperature readings from 20. 8 % to 5. 0 %, with most of these the result of hypothermia. Use of a resistive fabric blanket further reduced out-of-specification readings to 1. 5 %, with a slight increase in the occurrence of hyperthermia. Use of a forced air system reduced out-of-specification readings to less 0. 1 %. Conclusions: Maintenance of normothermia perioperatively in pig can be improved by tightly controlling ambient temperatures. Use of a resistive blanket or a forced air system can lead to better control than a circulating water mattress, with the forced air system providing a faster response to temperature variations and less chance of hyperthermia...|$|E

In this work, the effect of biomass feedstocks (i. e. beef fat, chicken fat, pork fat, and jatropha oil) on the production of hydrogenated biodiesel over Pd/TiO 2 has been studied. Biomass feedstocks were analyzed by ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry) to identify the content of impurities (i. e. P, K, Ca, Na, and Mg). The deoxygenation catalyst, Pd/TiO 2, was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and tested in a continuous flow packed-bed reactor at 500 psig, 325 °C, H 2 /feed molar ratio of 30, and LHSV of 4 h- 1 for its catalytic activity and selectivity in hydrodeoxygenation. All feedstocks gave high selectivity in diesel <b>specification</b> <b>range</b> hydrocarbons and the main hydrocarbons were n-pentadecane (n-C 15) and n-heptadecane (n-C 17), resulting from the decarbonylation/decarboxylation reaction.
