40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} modelling-based design, {{operation}} {{and control of}} solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and gas turbine (GT) hybrid systems. Fuel cells are a promising approach to high-efficiency power generation, as they directly convert chemical energy to electric work. High-temperature fuel cells such as the SOFC can be integrated in gas turbine processes, which further increases the electrical efficiency to values up to 70 %. However, {{there are a number}} of obstacles for safe operation of such a system, such as fuel cell damage through thermal loads or undesired chemical reactions, or gas turbine problems related to high thermal capacity and volume of the pressurised components. Development of suitable plant design as well as operation and control strategies is hence a key task for realisation of the mentioned systems. The first part of the thesis describes the utilised models. All component models that have been developed and applied for the work are mathematically defined based on a fixed pattern. The thermodynamically most relevant components are tubular SOFC, indirect internal reformer and heat exchangers, and spatially discretised models are used for these. For the turbomachinery, map-based steady-state behaviour is modelled. Gas residence times and pressure drops are accounted for in all components they are relevant. Based on the component models, three different hybrid cycles are examined. In the first cycle, the SOFC replaces the combustion chamber of a recuperated <b>single-shaft</b> <b>turbine.</b> The SOFC is pressurised and the cycle is called “directly integrated SOFC cycle” (DIC). Further cycle options are a DIC with a two-shaft gas turbine (DIC- 2 T) and an indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC). In the latter, the compressed gas is heated recuperatively with the exhaust gas and the SOFC is operated at ambient pressure by connecting its air inlet to the turbine exhaust. All cycles incorporate the SOFC system design proposed by Siemens-Westinghouse, including indirect internal reforming, a tubular SOFC bundle and anode recirculation by an ejector. The first cycle (DIC) is regarded as standard cycle. Objectives for highly efficient, safe system design are formulated and design parameters are associated. A design calculation determines the design parameters for the standard cycle, based on a nominal power output of 220 kW. The design LHVbased electric efficiency is app. 63 %. Related to the design point, steady-state part-load ability of the system is analysed and displayed in two-dimensional performance maps where each axis represents one degree of freedom. Degrees of freedom considered are fuel and air flow; fuel utilisation is assumed constant. A result is that a strategy with constant mean fuel cell temperature is most advantageous in terms of safe and gentle operation. Further advantages of this strategy are the ability for low part-load and high efficiency at part-load operation. A control strategy is derived for dynamical implementation of the found part-load strategy. The system power output is primarily controlled by the SOFC power. The fuel utilisation is kept within certain bounds and the fuel flow is manipulated to control it to its design value. The fuel cell temperature is controlled by the air flow, which again is controlled by manipulating the GT shaft speed through the generator power. To determine the required air flow, a mixed feedforward and feedback strategy is used, where the feedforward part calculates a prediction based on the net power output and the feedback part provides correction based on the measurement of the SOFC fuel outlet temperature. Additional constraints to the control system are the supervision of the shaft speed and the valid operation regime of the anode recirculation ejector. The proposed control strategy provides robust control. The mean SOFC temperature, however, shows large transient deviation upon large load steps. The time to reach the setpoint power for large load steps is up to 70 s, while small load steps are followed in typically 1 - 2 s. A conclusion is that the system is suitable for load following operation as long as small load steps occur, as for example in distributed power generation for residential applications. Shutdown and startup strategies are introduced where the gas turbine provides air for cooling/heating throughout the procedures. Additional equipment and piping such as an auxiliary burner, a turbine exhaust throttle, a bypass around the recuperative heat exchanger as well as nitrogen and hydrogen supply and mixing units are required. Therewith, smooth cooling/heating of the cell can be accomplished without external electric power, but with a considerable amount of fuel and flushing nitrogen required. A further analysis investigates fuel flexibility of a system designed for methane: Hydrogen can be utilised without larger system modifications; only the control system characteristics must be adapted. Because no endothermic steam reforming takes place, the power output is, however, reduced to 70 % of the original value, and efficiency is reduced to 55 %. Applying the additional equipment required for shutdown/startup, the power can be increased to 94 % of the original value, although at a further efficiency decrease. In order to use ethanol as fuel in the ejector-driven anode, a recuperative vaporiser must be applied in the fuel channel. Supposed that reliable reforming catalysts for ethanol can be provided, 88 % of the original power output can be achieved at a high efficiency of 62 %. The investigation of the other cycle options reveals that a two turbine cycle where the power turbine is rotating at constant speed, mostly differs in terms of controllability. For controlling the air flow, another handle such as variable inlet guide vanes or air bypass around the SOFC system is required. The indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC) has a significantly lower efficiency of only 56 %, assuming the SOFC at the same temperature level than in the DIC.

40|$|Artificial Neural Network–Based System Identification for a <b>Single-Shaft</b> Gas <b>Turbine</b> During recent decades, {{artificial}} intelligence has been {{employed as a}} powerful tool for identification of complex industrial systems with nonlinear dynamics, such as gas turbines (GT). In this study, a methodology based on artificial neural network (ANN) tech-niques was developed for offline system identification of a low-power gas turbine. The processed data was obtained from a SIMULINK model of a gas turbine in MATLAB environ-ment. A comprehensive computer program code was generated and run in MATLAB for cre-ating and training different ANN models with feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure. The code consisted of various training functions, different number of neurons as well as a variety of transfer (activation) functions for hidden and output layers of the network. It was shown that the optimal model for a two-layer network with MLP structure consisted of 20 neurons in its hidden layer and used trainlm as its training function, as well as tansig and logsid as its transfer functions for the hidden and output layers. It was also observed that trainlm has a superior performance in terms of minimum mean squared error (MSE) compared with each of the other training functions. The resulting model could predict performance of the system with high accuracy.

This paper presents a new control system that uses steam injection as an auxiliary input to improve the transient performance of the gas turbine during frequency drops. Steam injection is beneficial because it reduces the peak temperature in the combustion chamber and augments the output power by increasing the mass flow through the turbine. The use of this auxiliary input {{is based on the}} event-based control approach. It means that during the frequency drop, the controller exploits the steam injection to help the main control loop recover the frequency and when the frequency reaches its predefined value, the system will return to its normal operation. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is investigated under different scenarios and the results show that the application of steam injection improves the performance of the regular control algorithm significantly, especially near full load condition...|$|R

For residual generation a bank of Multi-Layer perceptron (MLP) models, is used, Moreover, in fault detection phase, a passive approach based on Modellling Error Model (MEM) is employed to achieve robustness and threshold adaptation, and toward this purpose, Local Linear Neuro-Fuzzy (LLNF) model is exploited to construct error model to generate uncertainty interval upon the system output {{in order to make}} decision whether or not a fault occurred. This model is trained using the Locally Linear Model Tree (LOLIMOT) algorithm which is an incremental tree-structure algorithm, In order to show the effectiveness of proposed RFD method, it was tested on a <b>single-shaft</b> industrial gas <b>turbine</b> prototype model and has been evaluated using non-linear simulations, based on the gas turbine data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhile current {{commercial}} Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants utilize Rankine steam cycles in {{the power}} block, there is a goal to develop higher-efficiency plants based on Brayton cycles or on combined cycles. In this paper, we present an assessment of a gas turbine-driven CSP plant using small particle solar receivers. In particular, a recuperated, <b>single-shaft</b> gas <b>turbine</b> engine and a Small Particle Heat Exchange Receiver –a high temperature receiver for solar tower power plants developed {{in the framework of}} the U. S. DOE's SunShot Program– are the technologies employed for the gas turbine and the receiver, respectively. The curves of the solar receiver and the gas turbine engine were first obtained using in-house codes, and then coupled together. A backup combustor fueled with natural is used to compensate the variable nature of the solar resource. For a more flexible and optimum operation, the guide vane angle of the compressor is allowed to vary, and so is the position of the valves of the receiver and combustor bypasses. Two different operational strategies were analyzed: maximizing the overall efficiency of the plant and maximizing the net output power. Hence, the overall efficiency of a gas turbine-driven CSP plant based on a Small Particle Heat Exchange Receiver is estimated, and the potential to generate electricity is assessed. This analysis reveals the strengths of small particle receivers with respect to molten salt tubular receivers due to the much higher temperatures that can be achieved while maintaining (or even increasing) the receiver efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the development of}} a modular code for the dynamic simulation of a <b>single-shaft</b> gas <b>turbine</b> and an application to a 50 kW machine. The simulation package, CAMEL (R), is a modular object-oriented process simulator for energy conversion systems, conceived and developed in the last decade by the Authors' group at the Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering Department of the University of Roma 1 "La Sapienza", the advantages of an object-oriented approach being the flexibility and the user-friendly interface. The component library of the original (steady-state) code has been augmented by implementing the dynamic models of all of the gas-turbine components: the method is still based on a classical black-box modelling and each component can be assembled as in an engineering process scheme in which the connections between two elements represent either a mechanical power coupling or a working fluid stream. In order to obtain an accurate description of the gas-turbine phenomenology, each component is described by a non/linear set of both algebraic and first-order differential-equations. The global non-linear system is advanced in time by means of a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The paper provides a description of the mathematical model adopted for the simulation. A complete dynamic simulation of a 50 kW gas-turbine plant is performed, starting from steady-state operation. Both variable and fixed rotational velocity are considered. The program has been tested both in a steady-state off-design simulation and in a fully dynamic simulation. In all tests the code performed properly, reproducing with good accuracy the behaviour of the real gas turbine. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
