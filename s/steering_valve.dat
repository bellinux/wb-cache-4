5000|$|TWR {{modified}} XJ40s {{resulting in}} the XJR. Jaguarsport was also formed as a partnership between TWR and Jaguar. The first XJR, the XJR 3.6L, had extensive appearance changes coupled with stiffer suspension, anti-roll bar/links, power <b>steering</b> <b>valve</b> that reduced efficiency by 40% and an LSD but no performance enhancements. Interior-wise it included special stitching, [...] "sport" [...] or [...] "XJR" [...] embossed front headrests, and Jaguarsport speedometer labels and tread-plates.|$|E
50|$|The XJR, {{introduced}} in 1988, was a high-performance model that was finished by the Oxfordshire-based JaguarSport company, a dual venture by Jaguar and race team TWR, at TWRs Kidlington-based factory alongside the XJ220. Based upon a Sovereign model, it was fitted with uprated suspension with unique Bilstein dampers, a revised power <b>steering</b> <b>valve</b> {{to increase the}} steering weight by 40% and special exterior paint and exterior styling touches. Early examples were fitted with a 3.6 L AJ6 engine in standard tune but later models had a TWR tuned version of the 4.0 AJ6, with new inlet manifolds, uprated cams and a tweaked ECU. Some examples are also fitted with a larger bore JaguarSport exhaust system.|$|E
50|$|The whole high {{pressure}} {{part of the system}} is manufactured from steel tubing of small diameter, connected to valve control units by Lockheed type pipe unions with special seals made from desmopan rubber, a type of rubber compatible with the LHM fluid. The moving parts of the system (e.g., suspension strut or steering ram) are sealed by contact seals between the cylinder and piston for tightness under pressure. The other plastic/rubber parts are return tubes from valves such as the brake control or height corrector valves, also catching seeping fluid around the suspension push-rods. Height corrector, brake master valve and <b>steering</b> <b>valve</b> spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1-3 micrometres) with their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate. The metal and alloy parts of the system rarely fail even after excessively high mileages but the rubber components (especially those exposed to the air) can harden and leak, typical failure points for the system.|$|E
40|$|A {{disposable}} bioreactor {{is designed}} consisting out two identical shells that are fabricated via a two component, hard and soft, injection molding technique. In the bioreactor an autologous-cell-seeded scaffold {{can be placed}} for culturing (growing and conditioning) and testing tissue-engineered heart valves. The soft polymer is used for membranes, that drive the fluid flow, and for the <b>steering</b> <b>valves</b> and the sealings. The hard polymer comprises the casing parts that hold the soft parts in place. The <b>steering</b> <b>valves</b> are used for directing the fluid flow and controlling the closing pressure exerted on the growing heart valve. Air pressure actuation is used because of its flexibility, simplicity and reliability. Different spherical membrane geometries are evaluated in their performance to realize a reproducible deformation. Relaxation of flow-induced orientation inside the membrane results in buckling and tilting, which makes ultrasonic position measuring troublesome. The problem is solved by developing a membrane geometry that allows high volume displacements combined with relaxation to a neutral geometry as it is initially molded. The bioreactor is successfully tested, imitating the cardiac pressures and cardiac flows needed during the culturing and testing of tissue-engineered heart valves...|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic power {{steering}} systems work {{by using a}} hydraulic system to multiply force applied to the steering wheel inputs to the vehicle's steered (usually front) road wheels. The hydraulic pressure typically comes from a gerotor or rotary vane pump driven by the vehicle's engine. A double-acting hydraulic cylinder applies a force to the steering gear, which in turn steers the roadwheels. The <b>steering</b> wheel operates <b>valves</b> to control flow to the cylinder. The more torque the driver applies to {{the steering wheel and}} column, the more fluid the valves allow through to the cylinder, and so the more force is applied to steer the wheels.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} its simulation results of an agricultural vehicle electrohydraulic (E/H) steering system. The dynamic characteristics of an E/H steering system {{plays an important role}} in realizing accurate steering control for an automatically guided agricultural vehicle. E/H steering systems are typically nonlinear with large deadband, asymmetric flow gain, time delay, hysteresis, and saturation, which result in difficulties in the system analysis, design, and control. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed for an E/H steering system. This model has taken the main components of the E/H steering system, including a PWM driver, an E/H proportional directional control <b>valve,</b> <b>steering</b> actuating cylinders, steering linkage, and wheel-ground interactions, into consideration. It was then linearized with assumptions of incompressible fluid, the zero lapped valve, and frictionless. This model has been validated via vehicle steering tests. A third order liner model with considering the deadband, saturation, and time delay could well approximate the dynamic response within the steering angle range of 15 to 15 degrees. The validated model was used to estimate the dynamic behaviors of E/H steering systems in steering controller design. Those parameters are critical for designing high performance steering controller...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Pazooki Alireza, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2012 Articulated frame steer {{vehicles}} (ASVs), widely {{employed in}} different off-road sectors, are generally unsuspended vehicles. Owning to their complex operating environment, high mass center, relatively soft and large diameter tires, wide load variations and load distribution, and kineto-dynamics {{of the frame}} steering mechanism, these vehicles transmit higher magnitudes of low frequency whole-body vibration (WBV) to the operators and also exhibit lower roll and directional stability limits. While the superior performance potentials of axle suspension in limiting the WBV exposure have been clearly demonstrated, the implementations in ASVs have been limited due to the complex design challenges associated with conflicting requirements posed by the ride and roll/directional stability requirements. Growing concerns on human driver comfort and safety, and increasing demands for higher speed ASVs such as articulated dump trucks, however, call for alternate suspension designs for realizing an improved compromise between the ride and stability performance. This dissertation research is aimed at analysis of a torsio-elastic axle suspension concept for achieving improve ride, while preserving the directional stability limits of the ASV. For this purpose a comprehensive three-dimensional model of the articulated frame steer vehicles is developed for design {{and analysis of the}} proposed axle suspension concept. The model is formulated considering a three-dimensional tire model, tire lag, coherent right- and left-terrain track roughness, and kinematics and dynamics of the steering struts. Field measurements were performed to characterize the ride properties of a conventional forestry skidder and that of a skidder retrofitted with the rear-axle torsio-elastic suspension under different load conditions. The measured data were analyzed to assess the ride performance potential of the suspension and to examine validity of the simulation model. Both the field measured and simulation results revealed that the proposed suspension could yield significant reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the operator location, irrespective of the load and speed conditions. A simple yaw-plane model of the vehicle is also formulated to study the role of steering system design including the <b>steering</b> <b>valve</b> flows, kineto-dynamics of the steering struts and leakage flows on the snaking stability limits of the ASV. The results showed that the critical speeds are strongly dependent upon the kineto-dynamics of the articulated steering system. The comprehensive three-dimensional model subsequently used for analysis of integrated ride and roll/directional stability limits of the vehicle and the axle suspension designs. The stability performance measures are defined to assess the vehicle stability limits under steady as well as transient directional maneuvers. The results show that the proposed rear-axle suspension deteriorates the stability performance only slightly, irrespective of the load condition. It is concluded that the proposed suspension concept could yield a very good compromise in ride and stability performance. The proposed model could serve as an effective and efficient tool for integrated ride and handling analysis and to seek primary suspension designs for an improved compromise between the ride and stability performance of ASVs. ...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{clear trend}} in the vehicle {{industry}} to implement more safetyrelated functions, where {{the focus is on}} active safety systems and today the steering system is also involved. Steering-related active safety functions can only be realised with a steering system that allows electroniccontrol of either the road wheel angle or the torque required to steer the vehicle, called active steering. The high power requirement of heavy vehicles means they must rely on hydraulic power to assist the driver. Thesystem is a pure hydro-mechanical system with an open-centre circuit activated by the driver’s steering action and suffers from poor energy efficiency. The main task of the hydraulic system is to control the pressure in the assistance cylinder {{in such a way that}} it eases the load on the driver. This work suggests a way to design and evaluate a self-regulating pressure control valve for use as actuator in the <b>steering</b> system. This <b>valve</b> can be made small and fast and is electronically controlled to enable active steering. It is based on a closed-centre circuit and has therefore the potential to improve energy efficiency. The aim of this work has been to investigate the possibility for the valve to perform as the  original open-centre valve. The suggested approach is a model-based design and evaluation process where an optimisation routine is used to design the valve. Together with a validated model of the steering system, the new concept is compared with the original system. A hardware-inthe-loop simulation test rig has also been designed and built with the possibility to test a closed-centre steering system. It has partly been used to support the modelling process and partly to verify that a closedcentre steering system is a feasible solution. The simulation results  have shown that the designed valve can perform sufficiently well compared to the original system...|$|R
