40|$|Positive {{displacement}} {{machines are}} the most suitable devices for small-scale waste heat to power conversion units based on an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) due to their capabilities of handling small mass flow rates and high pressure ratios. Among the technologies, <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> machines provide unique features such as low operating revolution speed, geometrical flexibility and uncomplicated manufacturing.

The experimental performances of the novel pump were compared with the ones of a conventional centrifugal device through a test bench that reproduced the real operating conditions of a passenger car engine cooling circuit.

40|$|Heat {{pumps are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular, but poor electricity generating efficiency limits the potential energy savings of electrically powered units. Thus the work reported in this thesis concerns {{the development of a}} range of gas engine driven heat pumps for industrial and commercial heating applications, which recover heat from the prime mover, normally rejected to waste. Despite the convenience of using proprietary engine heat recovery packages, investigations have highlighted the necessity to ensure the engine and the heat recovery equipment are compatible. A problem common •to all air source heat pumps is the formation of frost on the evaporator, which must be removed periodically, with the expenditure of energy, to ensure the continued operation of the plant. An original fluidised bed defrosting mechanism is proposed, which prevents the build-up of this frost, and also improves system performance. Criticisms have been levelled against the rotary <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> compressor, in particular the effects of lubrication, which is essential.

40|$|In <b>Sliding</b> <b>Vane</b> Rotary Compressors, {{as well as}} in most of {{positive}} displacement machines, the oil is injected to fulfill sealing and lubrication purposes. However, the oil injection could produce an additional effect during the compression phase with a great saving potential from the energetic point of view. Being the air inside the cell at a higher temperature than the oil injected, a cooling effect could be achieved so decreasing the mechanical power required for the compression. At the moment, the oil is introduced inside the compressor vanes through a series of simple holes that are only able to produce solid jets. In this way any effective heat transfer is prevented, as demonstrated by p-V measurements inside the cells during the compression phase. In the current study, a theoretical model of a sprayed oil injection technology was developed and further experimentally validated. The oil was injected along the axial length of the compressor through a number of pressure swirl atomizers which produced a very fine spray. The conservation equations, solved with a Lagrangian approach, allowed to track the droplets evolution from the injection until the impingement onto the metallic surfaces of the vanes. The theoretical approach assessed the cooling effect due to the high surface to volume ratio of the droplets and a reduction of the indicated power was predicted. The model validation was carried out through a test campaign on an mid-size <b>sliding</b> <b>vane</b> compressor equipped with a series of pressure swirl injectors. The reconstruction of the indicator diagram as well as the direct measurements of torque and revolution speed revealed a reduction of the mechanical power absorbed close to 7 % using an injection pressure of 20 bar.

40|$|In the {{compression}} mechanisms of a rotary compressor for air conditioners, a vane and a rolling piston are provided {{to separate the}} suction chamber and {{the compression}} chamber. The rolling piston {{is driven by the}} crank, and revolves on the axis of the shaft eccentrically, and also rotates on its own axis. The vane undergoes reciprocating motion, and its top usually comes into contact with the rolling piston by the spring force and the discharge pressure. The lubricating condition between the vane top and the rolling piston is severe because the contact pressure is high owing to the line contact of the vane top. For the prevention of scuffing, abnormal wear and so on, it is important to clarify the lubricating characteristics between the vane top and the rolling piston. Because the normal force acting on piston at vane contact is greatly influenced by the friction of <b>vane</b> <b>sliding</b> surface between the vane and the vane-slot, a mixed lubrication analysis of the <b>vane</b> <b>sliding</b> surface between the vane and the vane-slot is required to obtain the normal force acting on piston at vane contact accurately.

50|$|An oval gear meter is a {{positive}} displacement meter that uses two or more oblong gears configured to rotate {{at right angles to}} one another, forming a T shape. Such a meter has two sides, which can be called A and B. No fluid passes {{through the center of the}} meter, where the teeth of the two gears always mesh. On one side of the meter (A), the teeth of the gears close off the fluid flow because the elongated gear on side A is protruding into the measurement chamber, while on the other side of the meter (B), a cavity holds a fixed volume of fluid in a measurement chamber. As the fluid pushes the gears, it rotates them, allowing the fluid in the measurement chamber on side B to be released into the outlet port. Meanwhile, fluid entering the inlet port will be driven into the measurement chamber of side A, which is now open. The teeth on side B will now close off the fluid from entering side B. This cycle continues as the gears rotate and fluid is metered through alternating measurement chambers.

50|$|A type of {{pneumatic}} motor, {{known as}} a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft. The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely <b>sliding</b> rectangular <b>vane.</b> The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft. Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and {{the diameter of the}} housing. One application for vane-type air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines. Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor. This causes the rotor to turn at high speed. Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used. Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input. These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter.|$|R
40|$|The {{air supply}} system {{is one of the}} most {{critical}} components in the energy balance of a fuel cell (FC) plant. Particularly, for automotive application the amount of energy required to drive this component can share up to the 25 % of the total electrical energy generated by the stack. Such a high energy level is required to achieve air pressure above 2 bar to meet two automotive application strategic targets: high fuel cell efficiency and high power to weight ratio. These two goals involve trade-offs between plant design, control strategies and costs, and finding a proper solution {{is one of the most}} troublesome problems faced by both FC makers and automotive companies. The aim of the work is modelling the FC compression system to perform a comparative study of different compressors. This study wish also to address some key-features on the suitability of each compressor with respect to the main system design issues (e. g. energy balance, powertrain performance, system control). In the paper a modelling analysis is presented for four different compressor types to analyze their specific capabilities with respect to the whole system performances and to the energy balance of the plant. The models developed are part of a computational library linked to a dynamic model of a hybrid electric vehicle equipped with a PEM FC and a battery pack. According with the technologies actually considered as being able to the meet the requirements of the FC application, reciprocating, <b>sliding</b> <b>vane,</b> twin-screw and centrifugal compressors have been studied. The modelling approach is based on both the thermodynamic description of the plant and the synthesis of experimental efficiency data. Such a hybrid modelling approach leads to the attainment of opposite goals in term of computational sfficiency and accuracy, and has been preferred with respect to a more complete theoretical one that would have been too complex, computationally expensive and somehow incomplete. Because of its low computational burden the whole model allows performing transient analysis within real-time studies aiming at i) plant optimization; ii) control system design and iii) development of on-board model-based control algorithms. Moreover, the modular computational structure conceived has the indirect benefit of being easily generalizable to different devices belonging to one of the four categories analysed. A normalized dataset derived from performance maps provided by manufacturers together with essential geometrical information are the basic information required to perform simulations. The proposed method allows extending the study to different systems and configuration through interpolations on a compressors database with some physical correction factors. Several analyses have been carried out to test the behaviour of each compressor, as part of a hybrid electrical vehicle powertrain, over a set of standard transient manoeuvres (i. e. load ramp and step) and for a 2 hours real driving cycle. Afterward an energy analysis has been conducted to determine the most efficient system with respect to a performance index defined as function of the achieved vehicle performance targets. From these analyses, it emerges that the best system can be selected after a trade-off between compressor technology, energy saving, powertrain performance and global vehicle control strategy...|$|R
40|$|Solar sail can merely {{make use}} of solar {{radiation}} pressure (SRP) force as the thrust for space missions. The attitude dynamics is obtained for the highly flexible solar sail with control <b>vanes,</b> <b>sliding</b> masses, and a gimbaled control boom. The vibration equations are derived considering the geometric nonlinearity of the sail structure subjected to the forces generated by the control vanes, solar radiation pressure (SRP), and sliding masses. Then the dynamic models for attitude/vibration controller design and dynamic simulation are obtained, respectively. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based and optimal proportional-integral (PI) based controllers are designed for the coupled attitude/vibration models with constant disturbance torques caused by the center-of-mass (cm) /center-of-pressure (cp) offset, respectively. It can be concluded from the theoretical analysis and simulation results that the optimal PI based controller performs better than the LQR based controller from the view of eliminating the steady-state errors. The responses with and without the geometrical nonlinearity are performed, and the differences are observed and analyzed. And some suggestions are also presented...|$|R
