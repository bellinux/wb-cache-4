5|$|The <b>sinew,</b> {{soaked in}} animal glue, is then laid in layers {{on the back}} of the bow; the strands of <b>sinew</b> are {{oriented}} along the length of the bow. The <b>sinew</b> is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. <b>Sinew</b> will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E
5|$|When Europeans first {{contacted}} Native Americans, some bows, {{especially in}} the area that became California, already had <b>sinew</b> backing. After the reintroduction of horses, newly mounted groups rapidly developed shorter bows, which were often given <b>sinew</b> backing. The full three-layer composite bow with horn, wood, and <b>sinew</b> {{does not seem to be}} recorded in the Americas, and horn bows with <b>sinew</b> backing are not recorded before European contact.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study on co-digestion of ossein industry waste for methane production <b>Sinews</b> is a pasty proteinaceous by-product discharged from a primary bone clarification tank in the ossein industry, which was mixed with cattle dung in different proportions at ambient temperature. This {{study found that}} a mixture of <b>sinews</b> (40 %) and cattle dung (60 %) was more appropriate for enhanced methane yields with a high efficacy on anaerobic degradation. A maximum cumulative biogas production volume (18 L) with 71 - 77 % methane content was obtained even with more parts of the <b>sinews</b> were used as a substrate. The best biogas production yield was 23. 4 L biogas/Kg TVS added, revealed the suitability of the <b>sinews</b> mixture (40 %) in the biomethanation process. In addition, the pH of each digester was not shifted to alkaline which was constantly maintained within optimal range {{during the course of}} digestion. Perhaps, this alternate strategy will be helpful for managing the odor produced from <b>sinews</b> during bulk storage...|$|R

5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the <b>sinew</b> is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the <b>sinew</b> may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the <b>sinew</b> cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
