5000|$|Gay Lea Foods Co-operative Limited is a dairy {{products}} co-operative in Canada producing butter, sour cream, cottage cheese, {{whipped cream and}} lactose free milk for retail, foodservice, industrial and export markets. Gay Lea also produces a new product called [...] "Spreadables", which is a <b>spreadable</b> <b>butter,</b> made as a canola oil and butter blend, that tastes like butter but is spreadable directly out of the fridge. The company is based in Mississauga, Ontario and {{owned and operated by}} Ontario milk producers, currently representing approximately thirty-five per cent of all Ontario dairy farms.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of grass}} silage and {{concentrates}} to supplement fresh grass intake is commonly practised in dairy systems. However, {{the effects of}} such supplementation within a dietary regime designed to produce a <b>spreadable</b> <b>butter</b> are unknown. Sixteen Holstein Friesian cows were used in an incomplete changeover design to investigate the effect on milk fat of supplementation with grass silage (GS) or standard concentrate (SC) when offering a concentrate based on whole rapeseed at pasture (RC+G). A control diet of fresh grass and standard concentrate (SC+G) was also included. Diet had no effect (P > 0. 05) on milk yield or on the lactose concentration of milk. The iodine value (IV; grams of iodine per 100 g milk fat) of milk fat with the RC+G diet was greater (43. 9, P < 0. 05) than with the SC+G diet (39. 9). The iodine value of milk fat was reduced (P < 0. 05) when RC+G+GS was offered (41. 5 g/ 100 g), but not when RC+G+SC was offered (43. 1 g/ 100 g), compared with when RC+G was offered. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in milk fat was higher (P < 0. 05) when the RC+G diet was offered compared with either RC+G+GS or RC+G+SC. If supplementary feedstuffs are {{to be used in}} combination with a wholerapeseed- based concentrate and pasture, then inclusion of standard concentrate would be preferred over grass silage because the negative impact on the iodine value of milk fat was less. However, further research is required to investigate the effect on IV of milk fat when a standard concentrate supplement is offered at levels that increase milk yield. peer-reviewe...|$|E
50|$|Cookie butter (Danish: TrÃ¸ffel-masse) is a food paste made {{primarily}} from Speculoos cookies crumbs; fat such as vegetable oil, condensed milk or butter; flour and sugar. The ingredients are mixed {{until it becomes}} <b>spreadable</b> like nut <b>butter.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} the manufacturing condition of <b>spreadable</b> modified <b>butter</b> by RSM. Based on the central composite design, the degree of optimization was expressed as a SFC as a dependent variable (Y, %) determined by NMR with 23 experimental groups. Three independent variables were the contents of butter (X 1, 35 - 75 %), the contents of grape seed oil (X 2, 15 - 35 %), and the contents of hydrogenated soybean oil (...|$|R
50|$|A French butter dish is a {{container}} used {{to maintain the}} freshness and <b>spreadable</b> consistency of <b>butter</b> without refrigeration. This late 19th century French-designed pottery crock has two parts: a base that holds water, and a cup to hold the packed butter which {{also serves as a}} lid. The cup containing butter is placed into the base, where water creates an airtight seal that keeps the air (and thus oxygen) away from the butter so that refrigeration is not needed, and the butter can be used in its soft form. This method will keep butter for around a month provided it is kept at temperatures below 80 F and the water is changed regularly.|$|R
