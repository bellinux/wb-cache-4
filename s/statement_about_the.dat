5|$|As a New Year's {{gift that}} year (1611), he also {{composed}} {{for his friend}} and some-time patron, Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels, a short pamphlet entitled Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow). In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical atomistic physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later {{became known as the}} Kepler conjecture, a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> most efficient arrangement for packing spheres.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, President Bartlet {{tries to}} persuade Ellie {{to speak to}} the press to contain the incidence, but Ellie insists she is not as {{comfortable}} with the spotlight as {{the other members of the}} family. She later watches her mother do a light-hearted appearance on Sesame Street, to defend her right to practice medicine even after voluntarily giving up her licence. This inspires her to follow her father's advice, and give a passionate public <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> necessity of a politically independent scientific community.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk War {{has been a}} source of {{discrepancies}} and questioning, with two major battle sites being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the second battle, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help bury the dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> experience that has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E

5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes {{the danger of the}} streets and puts it in a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger of the streets.|$|E
5|$|MLB {{issued a}} {{statement}} that Ramirez had been informed of an issue under the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment program, and chose to retire rather than continue with the appeal process. Ramirez was facing a 100-game suspension, which would still apply if Ramirez {{decided to return to}} MLB in the future. Neither Ramirez nor the MLB Players Association issued a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sudden retirement. Ramirez apparently did not personally inform the Rays about his decision. The team announced that they had been informed of his retirement by the MLB Commissioner's Office.|$|E
5|$|Sivanandam leaves Naidu to {{interrogate}} Hema. She is initially impudent {{and refuses to}} give a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> crime, but she later agrees when Sivanandam threatens to arrest her husband. She reveals Rajan's extramarital affair with a dancer named Ambujam, who is pregnant with his child. As Rajan treated the news with a reckless attitude, Hema suggests that Ambujam could have killed him. When questioned, Ambujam accuses Chinnaiah of murdering Rajan, saying that Chinnaiah was her foster father and wanted her {{to stay away from}} Rajan after the three met during a picnic. As their relationship continued, Chinnaiah became infuriated and wanted to end the affair.|$|E

5|$|The {{facts about}} Abraham Lincoln's service during the Black Hawk War have been disputed. Lincoln was {{associated}} with two major battle sites, including Stillman's Run, {{in the aftermath of}} combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at the grove to help bury the dead. One of these soldiers was Lincoln, who assisted with the burial. His later <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> events has been linked to both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E
5|$|There was an {{important}} link between the Raglan Castle and the surrounding parkland, in particular the Home Park and the Red Deer Park. Historian Robert Liddiard suggests that {{on the basis of}} the views from the castle at this time, the structured nature of the parks would have contrasted with the wilderness of the mountain peaks framing the scene beyond, making {{an important}} <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> refinement and cultured nature of the castle lord. In the 15th century there were also extensive orchards and fish ponds surrounding the castle, favourably commented upon by contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

5|$|Hiroshi tells Hsing {{that he and}} {{a handful}} of allies, who believe that the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, have been keeping news of the {{acceleration}} secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} known about it for a while.|$|E
5|$|Ledonne {{had spent}} many years conceptualizing games, but never created one due to his lack of game design and {{programming}} knowledge. He was inspired to create a video game about Columbine by his own experience being bullied and the effect the shooting had on his life. The game represents a critique of how traditional media sensationalized the shooting (in particular the role of video games), as well as parodying video games themselves. Super Columbine Massacre was created with ASCII's game development program RPG Maker 2000 and took approximately six months to complete. Ledonne initially published the game anonymously, releasing an artist's <b>statement</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> work after his identity was revealed. Super Columbine Massacre was released for free online and attracted little attention until 2006, when widespread media coverage fueled {{hundreds of thousands of}} downloads.|$|E
