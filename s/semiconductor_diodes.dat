25|$|A diode is a two-terminal {{electronic}} component that conducts current primarily {{in one direction}} (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other. A semiconductor diode, {{the most common type}} today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals. A vacuum tube diode has two electrodes, a plate (anode) and a heated cathode. <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>diodes</b> were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. The first <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes,</b> called cat's whisker diodes, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today, most diodes are made of silicon, but other materials such as selenium and germanium are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} voltage {{dependent}} capacitance occurs in semiconductor {{devices such as}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes,</b> where the voltage dependence stems not from a change in dielectric constant but in a voltage dependence of the spacing between the charges on {{the two sides of}} the capacitor.

25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, vacuum tube thermionic diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal rectifier stacks were used. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum tube rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes</b> of various types (junction diodes, Schottky diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|E
25|$|Photodiodes {{are similar}} to regular <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes</b> except {{that they may be}} either exposed (to detect vacuum UV or X-rays) or {{packaged}} with a window or optical fiber connection to allow light to reach the sensitive part of the device. Many diodes designed for use specifically as a photodiode use a PIN junction rather than a p–n junction, to increase the speed of response. A photodiode is designed to operate in reverse bias.|$|E

50|$|The {{ideal diode}} has zero {{resistance}} for the forward bias polarity, and infinite resistance (conducts zero current) for the reverse voltage polarity; if connected in an alternating current circuit, the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diode</b> {{acts as an}} electrical rectifier.|$|R
25|$|A full-wave bridge {{rectifier}} converts {{the whole of}} the input waveform to one of constant polarity (positive or negative) at its output. Mathematically, this corresponds to the absolute value function. Full-wave rectification converts both polarities of the input waveform to pulsating DC (direct current), and yields a higher average output voltage. Two diodes and a center tapped transformer, or four diodes in a bridge configuration and any AC source (including a transformer without center tap), are needed. Single <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes,</b> double diodes with common cathode or common anode, and four-diode bridges, are manufactured as single components.|$|E
25|$|The General Electric Tungar {{rectifier}} was a mercury vapor (ex.:5B24) or argon (ex.:328) gas-filled electron tube {{device with}} a tungsten filament cathode and a carbon button anode. It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the {{gas in the}} tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much lower forward voltage drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for battery chargers and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost metal rectifiers, and later <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes,</b> supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an incandescent lamp with an additional electrode.|$|E
2500|$|Thermionic (vacuum-tube) diodes and {{solid-state}} (<b>semiconductor)</b> <b>diodes</b> {{were developed}} separately, at {{approximately the same}} time, in the early 1900s, as radio receiver detectors. [...] Until the 1950s, vacuum diodes were used more frequently in radios because the early point-contact <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes</b> were less stable. In addition, most receiving sets had vacuum tubes for amplification that could easily have the thermionic diodes included in the tube (for example the 12SQ7 double diode triode), and vacuum-tube rectifiers and gas-filled rectifiers were capable of handling some high-voltage/high-current rectification tasks better than the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes</b> (such as selenium rectifiers) that were available at that time.|$|E
5000|$|From {{equation}} (...) , one {{can observe}} {{that when a}} zero voltage {{is applied to the}} semi-conductor diode, the drift current totally balances the diffusion current. Hence, the net current in a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diode</b> at zero potential is always zero.|$|R

50|$|Differential {{capacitance}} in physics, electronics, and electrochemistry is {{a measure}} of the voltage-dependent capacitance of a nonlinear capacitor, such as an electrical double layer or a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diode.</b> It is defined as the derivative of charge with respect to potential.|$|R
2500|$|However, diodes {{can have}} more {{complicated}} behavior than this simple on–off action, because of their nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. [...] <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>diodes</b> begin conducting electricity only if a certain threshold voltage or cut-in voltage {{is present in the}} forward direction (a state in which the diode is said to be forward-biased). The voltage drop across a forward-biased diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of temperature; this effect {{can be used as a}} temperature sensor or as a voltage reference.|$|E
2500|$|A {{rectifier}} is {{an electrical}} device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows {{in only one}} direction. The process is known as , since it [...] "straightens" [...] the direction of current. Physically, rectifiers take a number of forms, including vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc valves, stacks of copper and selenium oxide plates, <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes,</b> silicon-controlled rectifiers and other silicon-based semiconductor switches. Historically, even synchronous electromechanical switches and motors have been used.

Today they are still used in a few high power applications where their ability to withstand transient voltages and their robustness gives them an advantage over semiconductor devices. The recent (2012) resurgence of interest among audiophiles and recording studios in old valve audio gear such as guitar amplifiers and home audio systems has provided a market for the legacy consumer diode valves.|$|E

2500|$|The crystal {{detector}} demodulates the radio frequency signal, extracting the modulation (the audio signal {{which represents the}} sound waves) from the radio frequency carrier wave. In early receivers, the detector was a cat's whisker detector [...] consisting of a fine metal wire, the [...] "cat's whisker", on an adjustable arm that touched a pea-sized lump of semiconducting mineral. The point of contact between the wire and the crystal produced a diode effect. [...] The cat's whisker detector was a crude Schottky diode that allowed current to flow better in one direction than in the opposite direction. Modern crystal sets use modern <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes.</b> [...] The crystal functions as an envelope detector, rectifying the alternating current radio signal to a pulsing direct current, the peaks of which trace out the audio signal, {{so it can be}} converted to sound by the earphone, which is connected to the detector.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{types of}} BJT {{function}} by letting a small current input {{to the base}} control an amplified output from the collector. The {{result is that the}} transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of transistors are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications. In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN bipolar transistor. In the NPN transistor in what is called active mode, the base–emitter voltage [...] and collector–base voltage [...] are positive, forward biasing the emitter–base junction and reverse-biasing the collector–base junction. In the active mode of operation, electrons are injected from the forward biased n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the reverse-biased n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the reverse-biased collector–base junction.

[...] "Full-wave" [...] versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a full-wave rectifier. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the {{high voltage power supply}} for the cathode ray tube of television receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in X-ray equipment. [...] However, compared to modern <b>semiconductor</b> <b>diodes,</b> vacuum tube rectifiers have high internal resistance due to space charge and therefore high voltage drops, causing high power dissipation and low efficiency. [...] They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250mA owing to the limits of plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications, [...] such as battery chargers. Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|E
