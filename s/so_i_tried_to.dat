500|$|Originally, Madsen {{planned to}} create a docudrama-style film but when he {{discovered}} Ketty was a Russian spy and had {{a love affair with}} Flammen he changed his mind. This finding [...] "forced me to make the film a much more stylish, more noirish piece of work." [...] "Even <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> keep a soft touch style-wise out of respect for the film's subject," [...] said Madsen. He tried to make it feel real by [...] "eliminating the distance to 1944" [...] and directing the film as if it were set in the present.|$|E
500|$|For the Daenerys {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode where the three dragons burn part of the Masters' fleet, Sapochnik credited VFX supervisor Joe Bauer and producer Steve Kullback for post-production work: [...] "For this sequence David and Dan said that what they wanted to see was a 'demonstration' of what's to come. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> approach it in the most elegant, epic, big-movie way I could." [...] The director tried to design the shots with relative realism, inspired by footage of World War II Supermarine Spitfires in action. He based the dragon shots on wildlife footage, allowing them to break the frame: [...] "These things should be so big and fast it's hard to keep up with them." [...] To insert Emilia Clarke (as Daenerys Targaryen) into the scene, she rode a [...] "multi-directional, computer-controlled hydraulic gimbal device shaped like the upper shoulders of the dragon"; Clarke was filmed separately in Belfast, Northern Ireland.|$|E
500|$|As {{a former}} police officer, actor David Zayas was {{immediately}} interested {{in the role of}} Sgt. Angel Batista. After appearing in Oz for a season, Erik King, was looking for a [...] "different" [...] acting chance, he [...] "loved" [...] the character of Sgt. Doakes, after reading the script. South Korean actor C.S. Lee, who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka, was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City, [...] and The Sopranos. Lee accepted the part because of the [...] "fantastic" [...] writing. By September 15, Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan. Carpenter had enough time before her audition to read the Dexter books, but admitted that she [...] "didn’t exactly see myself in the books. I knew {{that it was going to}} be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb. I think that may have helped in the audition and it has certainly helped sustain such a long run with one character." [...] She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television, but found it hard to stop it creeping into her real life. In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt. Matthews. The series stars Lauren Vélez (Maria LaGuerta), David Zayas (Angel Batista) and Erik King (James Doakes), all previously starred in the American HBO television drama series Oz.|$|E

500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make a record where I {{was just kind of}} involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's lyrical {{inspiration}}, Robyn told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul in March 2008: [...] "I {{think the}} biggest lyrical inspiration for this album {{was going back to}} when I was like 15 and on the subway listening to hip hop. Back then—because I didn't know many people in Sweden who knew about rap, it was like my own music world—where the lyrics were very direct. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> return to that age when you're so strong and self-confident, while acknowledging there's also a part of being a teenager when you're sometimes very insecure and feel very fragile." ...|$|E

[...] According to McCloy, Toler and Anderson tried to find a way out. [...] "The heavy smoke and fumes caused them to quickly return. There was just so much gas."

2500|$|On July 31, 2007, Donaire met Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Donaire {{said the}} {{experience}} was, [...] "an overwhelming feeling. It was indescribable. The moment I {{walked up the}} stairs and she was up there and when I looked it was a moment when I couldn't even look at her face. It was a great honor." [...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was. I couldn't move well <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> rely on my upper body movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Russel is {{considered}} {{the architect of the}} Forerunner's design. In an interview, Russel stated that creating the Forerunner's [...] "visual language" [...] was a tough process which only came together [...] "like five months away" [...] from the game's completion; much of the design was finalized on a single level, [...] "The Silent Cartographer", which features both exterior Forerunner structures as well as deep interior chasms. Concept artist Eddie Smith is also credited with helping hone the Forerunner's direction, and said that he started work by reading the game's mission synopsis. [...] "I knew what human and Covenant architecture looked like, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make the Forerunner concepts different," [...] Smith said. The result was a sleek angular design which was distinct from the curves of the Covenant's architecture and the functional human designs. For Halo 2, designers wanted to refine and elaborate on the Forerunner design, without abandoning the style set by Russel; environment artist Frank Capezzuto found that looking at the Forerunner structures as sculptures rather than buildings helped to drive the designs for Halo 2.|$|E

He finds inspiration in the things I don't like, and I get excited by the things he doesn't like. He wants to be more urban and I want to be more international, so we push each other, I try to help Rihanna. She works hard and it's cool to write for someone who is so open-minded." [...] On August 21, American songwriter Claude Kelly revealed {{that he had been}} writing songs for Rihanna while she was performing in London. Kelly spoke on the songs that he had written for Rihanna saying; [...] "Rihanna's a worldwide superstar at this point and she's performing in stadiums and arenas now, so I wanted songs that reflected her audience, when I was in London she was performing at a festival in front of like 30,000 to 40,000 people.

2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Rosenqvist said the result had been awaiting Mahindra {{for a long period}} of time and felt as if his team could win many races over the course of the season and the first Berlin race was an event that saw [...] "all the puzzle pieces came together." [...] He added that despite small errors, he was still able to secure the victory: [...] "We work so hard and you can really see the suffering sometimes but when you have days like this it's all worth it." [...] Di Grassi stated that his car was not satisfactory and that his team started the day [...] "very lost" [...] and made car set-up alterations: [...] "If you look at the pure pace from the morning - this was not the best race for us, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> hang on as much as I could." [...] He revealed he lost regeneration from his overheating battery at the end of his first stint which persisted in his second stint. However di Grassi affirmed his team would improve his car and challenge for the victory in the following day's race. Third-place finisher Heidfeld said Mahindra's achievement of strong finish was [...] "a really outstanding result" [...] and stated he struggled in the first car but could mount a challenge to di Grassi in his second vehicle.|$|E
