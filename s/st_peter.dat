In 1908, a popular priest, Father Sacchi, was sent to Mother of Sorrows Church in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Parishioners formed a committee to go speak to the Bishop on Father Sacchi's behalf. Although Father Sacchi {{was not allowed to}} return to <b>St.</b> <b>Peter,</b> Reverend James Vocca, who had also been at <b>St.</b> <b>Peter</b> prior to his reassignment, was brought back to the church.|$|E
