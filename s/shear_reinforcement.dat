40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) beams can {{be strengthened}} in shear by externally bonded (EB) fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in {{the forms of}} side-bonded FRP strips, FRP U-jackets or FRP wraps. The shear failure of almost all RC beams shear-strengthened with FRP wraps {{and some of the}} beams strengthened with FRP U-jackets, is due to the rupture of FRP. For an FRP wrapped beam with FRP bonded to the beam surface, debonding of EB FRP from concrete substrate usually precedes the ultimate FRP rupture failure, therefore the failure process of the beam is associated with both FRP debonding and rupture failures. Despite extensive research in the past decade, there is still a lack of understanding of how the failure of FRP wraps in such an FRP-strengthened beam progresses and how it affects the shear behaviour of the beam. This paper presents an analytical study on the progressive failure of FRP wraps in such strengthened beams. In this study, the debonding and the subsequent rupture processes are derived and the FRP contribution to the shear capacity of the beam is quantified. The analytical solution is verified by comparing its predictions with the predictions of a finite element model. An additional merit of the analytical solution is that the development of FRP shear contribution {{with the opening of the}} shear crack can be quantitatively determined, providing a useful tool for further investigation on the shear interaction among different components (FRP <b>shear</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> steel <b>shear</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> and concrete) in RC beams shear-strengthened with FRP.

30|$|This {{numerical}} {{study investigated}} the effects of different reinforcing details in beam-column joints on the blast resistance of the joints. Due to increasing manmade and/or natural high rate accidents such as impacts and blasts, the resistance of critical civil and military infrastructure or buildings should be sufficiently obtained under those high rate catastrophic loads. The beam-column joint in buildings is one of critical parts influencing on the resistance of those buildings under extreme events such as earthquakes, impacts and blasts. Thus, the details of reinforcements in the joints should be well designed for enhancing {{the resistance of the}} joints under the events. Parameters numerically investigated in this study include diagonal, flexural, and shear reinforcing steel bars. The failure mechanism of the joints could be controlled by the level of tensile stress of reinforcing steel bars. Among various reinforcing details in the joints, diagonal reinforcement in the joints was found to be most effective for enhancing the resistance under blast loads. In addition, <b>shear</b> <b>reinforcements</b> also produced favourable effects on the blast resistance of beam-column joints.|$|R

The shear resistant strengthening effect of strengthened beams with SWR (steel wire rope) external prestressing is studied under different dead load level and damage degree when strengthening, through the indoor experiment in shear. The results of the experiment shows: the width of diagonal cracks of the beams strengthened with SWR external prestressing become smaller and the yield load of stirrups is delayed, and the shear capacity is improved compared with basic beam. Both dead load level when strengthening and damage degree of original beams are the important factors influencing the <b>shear</b> resistant <b>reinforcement</b> effect, and with increasing of the dead load level and damage degree when strengthening, the improved amplitude of the yield load of stirrups and the shear bearing capacity are getting decreasing.
