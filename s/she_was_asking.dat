500|$|Labor {{had secured}} the {{defection}} of Slipper from the Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP) {{to sit in}} the Speaker's chair a year earlier, but he was forced to stand aside from his main duties in April 2012 pending the conclusion of a criminal investigation. After a week of controversy, Gillard announced that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> Slipper to delay his return to the Chair pending the conclusion of concurrent civil proceedings, in an effort to dispel what she described as a [...] "dark cloud" [...] over her government (a reference also to the ongoing Craig Thomson affair involving a Labor MP linked to corruption allegations).|$|E
2500|$|On 31 January 2017, Soames made 'woofing' noises at Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> {{the foreign}} secretary, Boris Johnson, a {{question}} in the House of Commons. Ahmed-Sheikh called a point of order to bring the speaker's attention to the noises. John Bercow, the speaker, described the noises as [...] "discourteous and that expression should not be used", and Soames was asked to apologise. He did so, saying he was only offering her a [...] "friendly canine salute" [...] in reply to her [...] "snapped" [...] question.|$|E
2500|$|Although Madame Montour {{served as}} an {{interpreter}} through the 1710s, there are few records of her activities at this time. In 1719, she petitioned New York for back pay, although with Governor Hunter's departure in 1720, she may not have received it. According to historian Alison Duncan Hirsch, the wording of an official recommendation about Montour's salary [...] "has been misread to mean that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> to be paid {{the same as a}} man"; rather, she wanted the pay of an interpreter, which was higher than that of a common soldier.|$|E
5000|$|At the end, Deb is {{seen on a}} {{computer}} conversing in a chatroom. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> what <b>she</b> looks like. She types [...] "the truth or a lie?" [...] to which <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to lie. Now, wearing glasses again, she just turns off the computer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked.</b> <b>She</b> has <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> very often, because <b>she</b> <b>is</b> mamma's niece, and did {{live with}} us once for a short time. But she did not come. In fact she won't go anywhere, unless--" ...|$|R

60|$|In a flash {{the memory}} {{returned}} to her; twenty-four hours ago <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> that very question of this unspeakable figure that sat hunched-up before her.|$|E

60|$|Harding felt {{disturbed}} but determined. He was keenly {{anxious to}} please the girl, but to yield in this matter would be to act against his principles. She {{did not know what}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Too {{like a bad}} novel: besides, {{you don't}} look respectable enough for my tutor. And, now I think of it, no doubt <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> Bull {{how he came to}} let such a disreputable old shooting-jacket into his shop.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have you not {{overlooked}} {{one thing}} {{which may be}} the truth,' said Alethea, as if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> for information, 'that duty and love may be identical? Is not St. Paul's description of charity very like the duty to our neighbour?' ...|$|E
50|$|In 2012, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> {{to become}} a member of the Australia America Leadership dialogue.|$|R

6000|$|She {{looked at}} him intently, and an {{observer}} might have said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> herself whether she might not most quickly end their common pain by confessing that she was mocking him. [...] "No; I am not," [...] she presently said.|$|E
6000|$|She {{really needed}} {{something}} to eat and yet she was puzzled {{to know what to}} ask for. At last, in the belief that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> for the simplest possible thing, she smiled sweetly and said, [...] "I should like a glass of milk." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{carefully}} {{considering all}} these points, Mrs. Brent 'phoned her friends, being careful {{to explain that}} Dorothy Franklin had sent her [...] "some fleecy specimens of Colorado society," [...] and that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> a few of [...] "the bold and fearless" [...] among her set to meet them.|$|E

60|$|Her {{mind was}} still {{pursuing}} its own sad course of inquiry; she was wondering in {{what part of}} England Sandyseal might be; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> herself if the Nuns at the old moated house ever opened their doors to women, whose one claim on their common Christianity was the claim to be pitied--when she heard Linley's footsteps approaching the door.|$|E
6000|$|And Emily wrote down, 'Miss Mohun, 5 pounds,' {{and handed}} to the {{bookseller}} {{all that she}} possessed towards paying her just debts to Lilias. While she was writing, Jane had turned towards the window, and suddenly exclaiming, 'There is Ben! Oh! that gunpowder!' darted out of the shop. She had seen the groom on horseback, and the next moment <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> breathlessly, 'Is it Maurice?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Wheelock made {{a sign of}} concurrence. [...] "I guess it's a {{thing you}} ought to do. Got a letter from her yesterday, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> about you. Eleanor's like you. Take after your mother, both of you, and, if anything, the harder grit's in her. You have to remember, Jimmy, you can't afford to show a soft spot when you're {{fighting}} a man like Merril." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do--true's you're alive. There {{was an old}} man at Mrs. Wiley's one {{day last}} fall.

I know, for I've tried them twice.' Now, if he was two thousand years old who was he but your Wandering Jew?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{old lady}} turned towards me sharply. She peered right through me, {{as if she}} were a Röntgen ray. I could see <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> herself whether this was a conspiracy, and whether I had come there on purpose to meet 'Harold.' But I flatter myself I am tolerably {{mistress}} of my own countenance. I did not blench. 'How do you know?' she asked quickly, with an acid intonation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eva, my dear," [...] said Mr Crasweller, [...] "you {{had better}} leave us. The President, I think, wishes {{to speak to}} me on business." [...] Then she came up and looked me in the face, and pressed my hand, and I knew that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>asking</b> for mercy for her father.
