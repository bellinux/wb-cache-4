5|$|Pros had the Buffalo All-Americans {{as their}} next opponent. The All-Americans were tired from their 7 to 3 {{victory against the}} Canton Bulldogs the day before. Before {{the start of the}} game, Nash was sold to the All-Americans for $300 and 5% of the Akron-Buffalo gate, making the first deal in APFA history. The reason for the trade was because rain caused a low number of fans. However, Nash did not appear in the game for either team, and Scotty Bierce {{replaced}} Nash for the Pros. The rain caused sloppy game play as well as a <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of 3,000 people. It resulted in a 0–0 tie.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{have played}} five full {{international}} matches at Easter Road. These have been friendly matches against less attractive opposition where a relatively <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> was expected, {{and it has}} therefore been unnecessary to play the match at Hampden Park. The Scotland under-21 team has also sometimes played matches at Easter Road, such as when Scotland played Iceland in the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs. The most recent full international played at the stadium was a friendly match between Scotland and Qatar in June 2015. One full international was played at Easter Road that did not involve Scotland, a friendly match between South Korea and Ghana that was played {{in advance of the}} 2006 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren {{and friend of}} the Sex Pistols, was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: the Damned and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers. On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in {{what came to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E
5000|$|This game drew one of {{the fewest}} {{attendance}} numbers in the modern history of the Rose Bowl. It {{was the first time}} that the stadium held less than the nominal capacity for the Rose Bowl game since before the 1947 Rose Bowl and the agreement between the PAC-10 and Big Ten conferences. The 1944 Rose Bowl had the third <b>smallest</b> <b>crowd</b> played in the Rose Bowl stadium at 68,000. The 1931 Rose Bowl had the second <b>smallest</b> <b>crowd</b> at 60,000. The <b>smallest</b> <b>crowd</b> at the Rose Bowl stadium was the 1934 Rose Bowl at 35,000.

5|$|Progressive Field {{set a new}} MLB record between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001 {{in selling}} out 455 {{straight}} games. Demand for tickets {{was so great that}} all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate seasons. The Indians retired the number 455 in honor of the sellout record. The Boston Red Sox later surpassed this record when Fenway Park recorded 456 straight sellouts on September 9, 2008. The record for the largest attendance at Progressive Field was set in Game 3 of the 1997 ALDS when 45,274 people attended the game. On Saturday, April 2, 2011, the Indians' lowest attendance record was broken with a very <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of 9,853, and again the following day with an even smaller attendance figure of 8,726.|$|E
5|$|The All-Americans had the Akron Pros {{as their}} next opponent. The All-Americans were tired from their {{victory against the}} Canton Bulldogs the day before. Before {{the start of the}} game, Bob Nash of Akron was sold to the All-Americans for $300 and 5% of the Akron-Buffalo gate, making the first deal in APFA history. The reason for the trade was because rain caused a low amount of fans, and the game would not have been {{profitable}} for the Pros. However, Nash did not appear in the game for either team, and Scotty Bierce replaced Nash for the Pros. The rain caused sloppy game play as well as a <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of 3,000 people. The All-Americans had an opportunity to score in the final minutes of the game. Fritz Pollard fumbled the ball, and Heinie Miller recovered it. Buffalo had the ball on the 12-yard-line, but the officials called the end of the game. It resulted in a 0–0 tie.|$|E

25|$|The fight {{ranks as}} one of the {{shortest}} heavyweight title bouts in history. Many in the <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> had not even settled in their seats when the fight was stopped. The official time of the stoppage was announced as 1:00 into the first round, which was wrong. Liston went down at 1:44, got up at 1:56, and Walcott stopped the fight at 2:12.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday morning, California police, {{who have}} been {{tracking}} Kowalski's movements on an electronic wall-map, set up a roadblock with two bulldozers {{in the small town}} of Cisco, where Kowalski will be passing. A <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> gathers at the roadblock. As Kowalski approaches at high speed, he smiles as he crashes into the bulldozers in a fiery explosion. As firemen work to put out the flames, the crowd slowly disperses.|$|E

Before a relatively <b>small</b> <b>crowd,</b> Alabama defeated the Hurricanes 28–7 and secured Bryant's 150th victory as {{head coach of the}} Crimson Tide. The Crimson Tide opened the game with a pair of eight-yard Richard Todd touchdown passes to George Pugh and Jerry Brown for a 14–0 lead. They then extended their lead to 21–0 at halftime behind a 12-yard Gary Rutledge touchdown run in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January, {{several hundred}} loyalists held a protest outside Belfast City Hall, {{and a number}} of protesters later blocked several roads in East Belfast.

First Minister Peter Robinson attended a meeting with loyalist leaders as well as local church and community representatives at the Skainos Centre in East Belfast. When leaving, he was heckled by a <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> of loyalists and his car was struck by a flag pole.|$|E

50|$|By 1893 the Ayrshire Football League had {{increased}} to 16 clubs. For some {{this was too}} many {{and the likelihood of}} playing to <b>small</b> <b>crowds</b> was irksome. So 7 clubs broke away to form the Ayrshire Football Combination.|$|R
25|$|As a <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> {{gathered}} around Zerai, an Italian military officer tried to interrupt his devotions. Zerai {{pulled out a}} scimitar, struck the officer, and shouted imprecations against Italy and the Duce, while praising the Negus (Ethiopian monarch). During the confrontation, Zerai injured Italian Railways private Vincenzo Veglia, State employee Ferdinando Peraldi, and Infantry Chief Marshal Mario Izzo, who reported very slight wounds that healed within 12 days. According to other reports, some passersby, including a butcher's boy who hurled his bicycle at the Eritrean,) were also injured.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{official}} announcement, crowds gathered spontaneously to celebrate outside the White House, where thousands assembled.

In Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit with a large Muslim and Arab population, a <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> gathered outside the City Hall in celebration, many of them of Middle Eastern descent.

After enticing the <b>small</b> <b>crowd</b> with a few wheelies, he proceeded to jump a twenty-foot-long box of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions. Despite landing short and having his back wheel hit the box containing the rattlesnakes, Knievel managed to land safely.|$|E
