5|$|In {{clinical}} research on schizophrenia, measurements of homovanillic acid in plasma {{have been used}} to estimate levels of dopamine activity in the brain. A difficulty in this approach however, is <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> high level of plasma homovanillic acid contributed by the metabolism of norepinephrine.|$|E

5|$|The north-west ridge {{continues}} from Lower Man over Browncove Crags, becoming almost insignificant {{when it reaches}} the shore of Thirlmere, yet still <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> valley of Helvellyn Gill from the reservoir, before finally rising again to the wooded height of Great How at its terminus.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} near the Vatican Gardens, behind St. Peter's Basilica. Other {{buildings}} near the station are the Governatorate Palace and the Domus Sanctae Marthae.

5|$|A {{ridge of}} low Jurassic hills {{runs through the}} county, <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> basins of the Welland and Nene rivers. The county has good {{communications}} as it is crossed by two main railway lines and the M1 motorway, and it has many small industrial centres rather than large conurbations.

30|$|The EX 1 – 4 {{simulations}} <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> {{effects of}} individual N inputs; EX 5 <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> effect of direct N input to croplands; and EX 6 <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> human impacts on land systems. EX 3 <b>separated</b> <b>the</b> effect of N inputs from atmospheric deposition and indirectly included anthropogenic inputs. EX 6 removed direct impacts of local human manipulations {{and showed the}} effects caused by elevated CO 2 concentration and climate change. EX 7 was conducted to quantify the impact of ignoring manure inputs, which have been inconsistently considered in terrestrial N model studies (discussed later).|$|R
50|$|From an oceanic perspective, the Mornington Peninsula, {{together}} with <b>the</b> Bellarine Peninsula, <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> waters of Port Phillip from Bass Strait, {{except for a}} small gap known as The Rip, which also <b>separates</b> both peninsulas. <b>The</b> peninsula also <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> waters of Port Phillip and Western Port.|$|R
5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> elements {{it was not until the}} late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with County Donegal, Lough Swilly {{separates}} {{one side}} of the Inishowen peninsula. Lough Foyle on the other side, is one of Ireland's larger inlets, situated between County Donegal and County Londonderry. Further round the coast is Belfast Lough, between County Antrim and County Down. Also in County Down is Strangford Lough, actually an inlet partially <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> Ards peninsula from the mainland. Further down the coast, Carlingford Lough is situated between Down and County Louth.|$|E

50|$|The right lobe is {{functionally}} <b>separated</b> from <b>the</b> left lobe by {{the middle}} hepatic vein. A common misconception is that <b>the</b> falciform ligament <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> two lobes.

Cruz and Company and Tully Construction Company for the station's plumbing, electricity, ancillaries, and entrances. In March 2013, the bulkhead <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> new construction from the 1970s-era tunnel at 99th Street was completed.|$|E
5|$|Charles himself took a main column {{along the}} high road, a {{causeway}} that passed by Saulgau, to attack Lefebvre on points between Hoßkirch and Ostrach.

5|$|Fairlight House, {{built in}} 1914, was {{included}} within {{the site and}} later became the residence of the Commander of US Naval Activities, United Kingdom.

5|$|Henry is {{best known}} for his six marriages and, in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, annulled. His {{disagreement}} with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> Church of England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Despite his resulting excommunication, Henry remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, it was {{announced}} that the winning bidder of the auction was Martin Selig Real Estate.

5|$|In late 2008, DiBiase began {{filming the}} movie The Marine 2, {{in which he}} plays the main character, Joe Linwood. The Marine 2 is a direct-to-DVD-and-Blu-ray project, and was {{released}} on December 29, 2009. The film was DiBiase's first acting experience, and he spent six weeks in Thailand for filming. For the movie, DiBiase performed all his own stunts, which resulted in him <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> cartilage between two of his ribs during a fight scene.|$|E

5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. <b>The</b> interatrial septum <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> atria and <b>the</b> interventricular septum <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> stylomandibular {{ligament}} <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> infratemporal region (anterior) {{from the}} parotid region (posterior), and {{runs from the}} styloid process to the angle of <b>the</b> mandible; it <b>separates</b> <b>the</b> parotid and submandibular salivary glands. It also becomes taut when the mandible is protruded.|$|R
5|$|Misdiagnosis is {{frequent}} (occurring {{in about}} 5 to 30% of cases). Different {{studies showed that}} in many cases seizure-like attacks in apparent treatment-resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause. Approximately 20% of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and of those who have PNES about 10% also have epilepsy; <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult.|$|E
5|$|Moorfields {{remained}} largely open until 1812, and the longstanding presence of that open space <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> emerging East End {{from the western}} urban expansion of London must have helped shape the varying economic character of the two parts and perceptions of their distinct identity (see map below).|$|E
5|$|Nairobi National Park is a {{national}} park in Kenya. Established in 1946, the national park was Kenya's first. It is located approximately 7 kilometres (4mi) south of the centre of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, with an electric fence <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> park's wildlife from the metropolis. Nairobi's skyscrapers {{can be seen from}} the park. The proximity of urban and natural environments has caused conflicts between the animals and local people and threatens animals' migration routes.|$|E
