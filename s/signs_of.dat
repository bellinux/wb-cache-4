5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less showed no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Ell is most {{remembered for}} his strong {{interest}} in recreation and conservation. From 1900 onwards, Ell pushed {{for the creation of}} a network of scenic reserves along Christchurch's Port Hills, linked by the Summit Road and with a network of rest-houses to allow travellers and walkers to refresh themselves. Three of these rest-houses, designed by architect Samuel Hurst Seager, were completed during Ell's lifetime: the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Bellbird, <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Kiwi, and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Packhorse. The last, and grandest, the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Takahe, was not completed until long after Ell’s death, in 1949. All four houses were built of local stone, and designed to blend in with the landscape. The <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Kiwi and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Takahe still function as commercial rest stops serving refreshments while the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Bellbird survives only as a shelter, but is still a useful stopping place for a picnic and the starting point for some short walks.
