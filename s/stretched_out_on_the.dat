2500|$|His second cameo {{occurred}} in the early panels of the story Vacances sans histoires (fr: [...] "Quiet Holidays") (later included in the album Le gorille a bonne mine) which was published between November 1957 and January 1958. Gaston appears {{at the start of}} the story when, cycling and lighting a cigarette at the same time, he runs past a red light and very nearly gets hit by Spirou and Fantasio's Turbot I sportscar. Towards the end, he is again cycling, this time down the wrong way of a one-way street, when he actually gets hit by the new Turbot II. More surprised than anything else, <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the car, he simply tells Spirou and Fantasio that they are requested back at the Spirou offices.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than once}} he had a severe {{reaction}} to a drug. In Kessler, he tried a drug named Sygen which was theorized to help reduce damage to the spinal cord. The drug caused him to go into anaphylactic shock, and his heart stopped. He claimed to have had an out-of-body experience and remembered saying, [...] "I'm sorry, but I have to go now", during the event. In his autobiography, he wrote, [...] "and then I left my body. I was up on the ceiling...I {{looked down and saw}} my body <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed, not moving, while everybody—there were 15 or 20 people, the doctors, the EMTs, the nurses—was working on me. The noise and commotion grew quieter as though someone were gradually turning down the volume." [...] After receiving a large dose of epinephrine, he woke up and stabilized later that night.|$|E
2500|$|The circle {{builders}} left no records, {{but their}} works were remarked upon {{and to some}} extent mythologised in historic times by the region's later inhabitants. The 16th century Aberdonian historian Hector Boece wrote that in the times of King Mainus ... huge stones were assembled in a ring and the biggest of them was <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side to serve for an altar ... In proof of the fact to this day there stand these mighty stones gathered together into circles 'the old temples of the gods' they are commonly called – and whoso sees them will assuredly marvel by what mechanical craft or by what bodily strength stones of such bulk have been collected to one spot. The English antiquarian John Aubrey recorded in the 17th century that people believed of the Easter Aquhorthies recumbent stone circle that [...] "Pagan priests of old dwelt in that place" [...] and that the Priests caused earth to be brought from other adjacent places upon peoples backs to Auchinchorthie, for making the Soile thereof deeper, which is given for the reason why this parcell of land (though surrounded by heath and moss on all sides) is better and more fertile than other places thereabout.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic review stated [...] "A 1961 set of {{standards}} heavy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballads, Nice 'n Cool is prime Gene Ammons... Ammons' brilliantly soulful tenor saxophone really <b>stretches</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> familiar melodies... Nice 'n Cool {{is first and foremost}} a mood album, with the unity of sound more important than the individual performances, but Ammons particularly shines".|$|R
5000|$|On railways, steep {{gradients}} on sharp curves have {{an equivalent}} gradient slightly steeper than the stated value. This {{is because of}} extra friction of <b>the</b> wheel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rails, and because wagons <b>stretch</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chord rather than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arc, and may thus cause trains to stall. To compensate, the gradient of ruling grades is slightly reduced from say 1 in 50 to 1 in 53.|$|R
2500|$|Ring 3: Against God, Art, and Nature: The {{third round}} of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand {{scorched}} by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky, an image derived from the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24.) The Blasphemers (the Violent against God) are stretched supine upon the burning sand, the Sodomites (the Violent against Nature) run in circles, while the Usurers (the Violent against Art, which is the Grandchild of God, as explained in Canto XI) crouch huddled and weeping. Ciardi writes, [...] "Blasphemy, sodomy, and usury are all unnatural and sterile actions: thus the unbearing desert is the eternity of these sinners; and thus the rain, which in nature should be fertile and cool, descends as fire". Dante finds Capaneus <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sands; for blasphemy against Jove, he was struck down with a thunderbolt during the Siege of Thebes; he is still scorning Jove in the afterlife. The overflow of Phlegethon, the river of blood from the First Round, flows boiling through the Wood of the Suicides (the second round) and crosses the Burning Plain. Virgil explains {{the origin of the}} rivers of Hell, which includes references to the Old Man of Crete.|$|E

50|$|As of December 2015, a major {{redesign}} of Terminal 1 including a capacity increase and {{an extension of}} the central terminal building to the west for centralised security and shopping facilities was under preparation. In November 2016, a major €400m extension and refurbishment for Terminal 1 has been announced. Terminal areas A and B will be entirely redesigned {{with the addition of a}} 320m long pier <b>stretching</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> apron.

50|$|The 12th-century frescos {{are largely}} original. In 1863 they were rediscovered {{underneath}} {{a layer of}} white plaster that had covered them for several decades. Both the painted upper chapel and the lower chapel are of great art historical significance.

In the upper chapel Arnold and Hadwig of Wied are painted below a Majestas Domini, <b>stretching</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor as a token of humility.|$|R

60|$|How {{bright and}} warm and {{pleasant}} it did look outside!

He could hear Jenny Wren fussing and scolding at someone or something, and he wondered what it could be. He crept just a wee bit nearer. He could hear Bowser's voice, but it was so faint that he had to prick up his sharp little ears and listen with all his might to hear it at all.|$|R

This playing for wind was so apparent that the Michigan players finally burlesqued it. The Ohio men could not stand the gaff, and their doctors and trainer ran more yards than both teams put together." [...] After the game, coach Yost commented on Ohio State's tactic: [...] "Their laying down for time took much of the vim out of our team, and rested their tired out players." ...|$|R
