40|$|This paper {{describes}} the CQuest SAT solver. This solver {{is essentially a}} translation from Java to C++ of the JQuest 2 SAT solver [4]. All of the Quest generation solvers [3, 4] were mainly inspired in Grasp [5] and Chaff [6]. These solvers perform backtrack search enhanced with <b>clause</b> <b>recording.</b> In addition, Chaff’s lazy data structures are implemented in CQuest, {{in order to obtain}} fast unit propagation, namely on (large) <b>recorded</b> <b>clauses.</b> BerkMin [2] also inspired the CQuest SAT solver with respect to the variable branching heuristic. Experimental results have proved that CQuest is a competitive solver, specially when considering industrial benchmarks. ...|$|R

In the CSP literature, on the other hand, nogood recording remains a fairly minor technique for improving backtracking algorithms. In this paper we demonstrate how recent nogood recording techniques from SAT can be generalized to CSPs. The result is a significant enhancement over current nogood recording techniques used in CSPs. We also report on some preliminary empirical results which indicate that generalized nogood recording can have a signficant performance benefit. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1978, Congress {{passed the}} Presidential Records Act, which {{declared}} that all future presidential records were public property and {{were to be}} transferred to the National Archives following the end of an administration. Prior to 1978, presidential records were the personal property of the President. While Presidents had been donating records to the National Archives since the times of Franklin Roosevelt, Presidents were legal owners and creators of these records. Making presidential records public property has created unintended consequences for the processing of presidential records. The PRA was passed with the intention of guaranteeing access to presidential records. However, with each new presidential administration comes a new executive order that strengthens or weakens the PRA. Also, the PRA contains a personal <b>records</b> <b>clause</b> that decrees that Presidents own some records, but not others. This has created a gray area where the President and those in his administration can still maintain control over some of their records. While the PRA is a much-needed piece of legislation, it poses some problems in its implementation that has not secured the access to presidential records. For these issues to be resolved, I suggest that the personal <b>records</b> <b>clause</b> needs stricken from the law and all records need to {{be turned over to the}} National Archives at the end of an administration...|$|R
