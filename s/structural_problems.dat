5|$|Moscow {{had built}} up a {{military}} that consumed as much as 25percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product {{at the expense of}} consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> in the Soviet system, which saw at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.|$|E
5|$|Named {{for energy}} firm BP, which donated $5million toward its construction, {{it is the}} first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction.|$|E

There were also <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> within the project, as the {{two parts of the}} joint team used different methodologies and had slightly different priorities. Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities that had never been implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was commissioned}} in 2003; construction overran {{and the official}} unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered {{the first of three}} visible <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling £1.7 million.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{structural}} optimization, {{the implicit}} {{nature of the}} cost function {{with respect to the}} optimization parameters, i. e. through the solution of the <b>structural</b> <b>problem</b> calculated with fixed values of these parameters, leads to prohibitive computations whatever the adopted formulation. Consequently, it yields limitations in both the number of parameters {{and the size of the}} <b>structural</b> <b>problem.</b> Moreover, some know-how is required to define a relevant <b>structural</b> <b>problem</b> and a well-behaved cost function. Here, we profit from the ability of the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) method to handle large-dimensionality problems to transform the optimization parameters into variables of an augmented-structural problem which is solved prior to optimization. As a consequence, the cost function becomes explicit with respect to the parameters. As the augmented-structural problem is solved a priori, it becomes independent from the a posteriori optimization. Obviously, such approach promises numerous advantages, e. g. the solution of the <b>structural</b> <b>problem</b> can be easily analyzed to provide a guide to define the cost function and advanced optimization schemes become numerically tractable because of the easy evaluation of the cost function and its gradients...|$|R

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present <b>structural</b> <b>problems.</b> Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> at the mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely a year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} {{the fabric of the}} College of Arms. Although it had survived the Blitz, <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> with the roof and brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to cover half the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E

5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
5|$|From 2005 to 2009 a Thomas Heatherwick sculpture, B of the Bang, was {{situated}} {{to the southeast}} of the stadium at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way. Built after the Commonwealth Games to commemorate them, it was the tallest sculpture in the United Kingdom. However, numerous <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> led to the 184ft. sculpture being dismantled in 2009 for safety reasons. In 2014, money recovered by the Manchester City Council {{as a result of}} lengthy legal battles consequent to this debacle was used to fund a new £341,000 public sculpture a few hundred yards further south.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{development of}} an improved domain decomposition method for large scale <b>structural</b> <b>problem</b> that aims to provide high computational efficiency. In the previous researches, we developed the domain decomposition algorithm based on augmented Lagrangian formulation and proved numerical efficiency under both serial and parallel computing environment. In this paper, new computational analysis by the proposed domain decomposition method is performed. For this purpose, reduction in computational time achieved by the proposed algorithm is compared with that obtained by the dual-primal FETI method under serial computing condition. It is found that the proposed methods significantly accelerate the computational speed for a linear <b>structural</b> <b>problem...</b>|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming {{on the heels of the}} 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E

It underwent a partial structural failure on June 23, 2012, when a 12m x 24m (39'-by-79') segment of the rooftop parking deck collapsed into the building, crashing through the upper level lottery kiosk adjacent to the food court and escalators to the ground floor below. More than 20 people received non-life-threatening injuries and two {{people died in the}} collapse. An investigation and class action lawsuits into the collapse are ongoing and the mall has been demolished.|$|E

The square windows of the Comet 1 were replaced by the oval versions used on the Comet 2, which first flew in 1953, and the skin thickness was increased slightly. Remaining Comet 1s and 1As were either scrapped or modified with oval windows and rip-stop doublers.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{invasion}} threat from France passed and a lasting peace {{was made in}} 1558, but the Spanish threat to the south-west of England grew in importance to the government. War broke out in 1569, {{with the threat of}} invasion and the garrison at St Mawes was strengthened: in 1578 it comprised 100 soldiers. An additional battery of guns was built to allow the fort to fire further upriver. Fears of a Spanish attack continued especially after the failed Armada of 1597; two earth and timber bastions were built out from the original stone castle to hold guns, eventually becoming the main batteries for the castle. By 1623 the castle held two brass culverins, six iron culverins, one demi-culverin and one saker, with a small garrison of 14 men, overseen by a captain and a lieutenant. A survey in 1634 indicated <b>structural</b> <b>problems,</b> and suggested that £534 was needed for repairs.|$|E
5|$|Strickland did {{not take}} into account the swampy lowland and high water table that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint {{building}} has encountered numerous <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{opened on}} 10 August 1793 with an {{exhibition}} of 537paintings, {{the majority of the}} works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of <b>structural</b> <b>problems</b> with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum was renamed Musée Napoléon, but after Napoleon's abdication many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic. The collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.|$|E
