5000|$|... ==== Sampling ==== In a {{classroom}} setting or {{in a program}} level assessment, it is often possible to assess {{the entire population of}} interest, referred to as a census. However, it is sometimes impractical or ineffective to assess an entire population, due to the time and effort involved as well as survey fatigue if the same group of students are being asked to take multiple surveys. Therefore, sampling strategies can be used to pick a subset of the population of interest. The goal of sampling is to select a smaller group that represents the population on key characteristics. Multiple sampling approaches are commonly used in higher education assessment, including random and stratified sampling. In a random sample, each individual is equally likely to be selected. In a <b>stratified</b> <b>sample,</b> individuals are grouped based on specific characteristics of interest and then randomly selected from each group to ensure adequate numbers of each group.|$|E
