One way in which to minimize the sonic boom is through shape-tailoring of the aircraft body and of the propulsion system. To this end, a new supersonic engine concept has been proposed, wherein a core turbofan engine, which has a non-axisymmetric external profile due to a protruding gearbox, has been circularized. A new, secondary, bypass with a highly complex internal geometry is created during this process. The high-flow nacelle bypass geometry includes a forward and aft fairing to direct the flow around the gearbox, a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> thin forward <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> thick, strut-like aft <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The aft <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> which also serve structural purposes, are used to direct the flow such that the exhaust is a uniform, nearly-full annular crosssection, and to choke and then accelerate the flow to supersonic freestream conditions upon exit.

40|$|A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> inlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (IGV) {{unsteady}} {{surface pressure}} measurements of a transonic compressor is presented. Using a flexible pressure sensor array, unsteady IGV suction-surface and pressure-surface pressures are acquired for six spanwise by five chordwise locations for various speed lines and throttle settings. Measurements from this sensor array {{are used to}} investigate unsteady vane/blade interaction aeromechanical forcing functions in a modern, highly loaded compressor stage. A significant effect is shown on the unsteady forced response of the IGV with changes in compressor operating point and IGV/rotor axial spacing for various span and chord locations. In particular, variations in the compressor operating point (i. e., mass flow rate and pressure ratio) cause change in both the magnitude and phase of the forced response, with the near-stall operating point producing the highest response. Changes in the axial spacing between the IGV and rotor rows from 12 % to 26 % of the IGV chord resulted in a 50 % reduction in {{the magnitude of the}} forced response. A significant variation in the forced response with span is noted, especially at the 5 % span location where the rotor relative flow is subsonic. In this region, changes in the operating point and axial spacing had a negligible effect on the forced response of the IGV. An innovative data reduction/analysis method is presented to quantify and statistically analyze the degree of blade-to-blade variations in the measured aerodynamic forcing functions obtained by turbomachinery experimentation. This method is used to analyze experimental data of IGV surface unsteady pressure response due to the aerodynamic forcing function produced by the downstream transonic compressor rotor with (1) factory-whole blades and (2) trimmed (blended) blades resulting from the repair of crack damage on two of the rotor blades. Results from the variation metric and l 2 -norm analysis indicate that the scaled metric possesses large magnitude change versus blade index for the trimmed rotor compared to that of the untrimmed rotor, with the largest values occurring near the trimmed blades. Each method is nearly always able to detect the trimmed blades. Using the distance between cluster centroids from the K-means cluster analysis as a metric of variation within each rotor, cluster distances increased by as much as a factor of 4 for the trimmed rotor compared to the untrimmed rotor. Therefore, correctly identifying the trimmed rotor data as having a significantly higher amount of blade-to-blade variability. Finally using the cluster distance as a goodness parameter for variability, the non-trimmed data was investigated for trends with changes in compressor operating conditions. This analysis showed an increase in blade-to-blade variability with increases in the compressor flow rate. Therefore, this data reduction/analysis method {{has the potential to be}} utilized as an indicator of the compressor operating point for control methods...|$|R

The three-dimensional unsteady turbulent flow numerical model is created based on Navier-Stoke solver and standard k-ε turbulent equations. The method of multireference frame (MRF) and SIMPLE algorithm are used to simulate the flow in multistage centrifugal pump based on FLUENT software. The distributions of relative velocity, absolute velocity, static pressure, and total pressure in <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> and impellers under design condition are analyzed. The simulation {{results show that the}} flow in impeller is mostly uniform, without eddy, backflow, and separation flow, and jet-wake phenomenon appears only along individual blades. There is secondary flow at blade end and exit <b>of</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> Due to the different blade numbers <b>of</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and impeller, the total pressure distribution is asymmetric. This paper also simulates the flow under different working conditions to predict the hydraulic performances of centrifugal pump and external characteristics including flow-lift, flow-shaft power, and flow-efficiency are attained. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results, and because of the mechanical losses and volume loss ignored, there is a little difference between them...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{circulation}} {{distribution and}} hence the maximum theoretical thrust obtainable for contra-vanes fitted behind propellers is markedly dependent on the number <b>of</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> The outer portion of the vanes, even if projecting considerably beyond {{the edge of the}} propeller slipstream, still contribute appreciably to this theoretical gain of thrust. But, owing to the always existing friction of the vanes, the limit of the optimum vane length lies at relatively small diameters. A large hub unloads the <b>vanes.</b> Hence, the <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are best attached to suitable parts of the bodies which would, in any case, be subjected to the slipstream...|$|R
40|$|Bureau of Ships Contract NObs- 34208 Task Order 3 A {{search of}} {{existing}} literature revealed several papers dealing with experimental investigations of specific vaned turns and others which approached the problem analytically. None of these, however, outlined general criteria for design and performance <b>of</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> cascades in miter bends {{which would be}} applicable to new installations. Such criteria have been established in this paper. Prepared for the David Taylor Model Basin; Department of the Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of research were {{to understand the}} influence of the installation <b>of</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> on the performance of Savonius wind turbine and to acknowledge the number of rotor blade which produces the most maximum performance. There are three variations for the number of rotor blade, which are 2, 3 and 4 blades on the range of wind speed are 4 - 7 m/s. Result of research indicated that rotor with three blades can give better performance than rotor with two and four blades. Rotor with <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> has produced better performance in power coefficient rate for 0, 3638 at wind speed 5 m/s, while rotor without <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> can only provide power coefficient for 0, 2595 at similar wind speed 5 m/s...|$|R
