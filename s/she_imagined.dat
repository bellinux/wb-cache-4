Charles comforted her by telling her she had indeed given birth to two sons and a daughter. Her position was a difficult one, and though Charles continued to have children by his many mistresses, he insisted she be treated with respect, and sided with her against his mistresses when he felt she was not receiving the respect she was due.|$|E

In {{exchange}} for that wish, however, that girl must become a magical girl who must fight against witches, creatures born from despair {{that are responsible for}} accidents, disease, and suicide.

500|$|One of {{the props}} {{developed}} for the video {{was a pair of}} sunglasses made of wire.

500|$|Valérie's {{line about}} Delilah being [...] "la passion qui ruine tout" [...] ("passion which ruins everything") is symbolic, coming {{as it does}} from a woman whose passion accelerates the ruin of most people around her– {{including}} herself. Baron Hulot, meanwhile, is desire incarnate; his wandering libido bypasses concern for his wife, brother, children, finances, and even his own health. Bette is living vengeance, and Adeline desperately yearns for the happy home <b>she</b> <b>imagined</b> {{in the early years}} of marriage. Each character is driven by a fiery passion, which in most cases consumes the individual. As Balzac puts it: [...] "La passion est un martyre." [...] ("Passion is martyrdom.") ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Vindicator, Eric Mink {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "intense, unsettling, {{sometimes}} gross, and suspenseful {{to the point of}} nerve-racking [...] ", feeling that its plot would [...] "resonate instantly and ominously with viewers". Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that, while the episode did unfortunately reduce Scully down to a traditional idea of feminine identity for part of its run, it was [...] "one of the most emotional Scully-centric episodes the show has ever given us." [...] Furthermore, Deans reasoned that the episode was an example of [...] "what The X-Files would have been, had Scully been the believer: a woman being told that she is hysterical, a woman being told that <b>she</b> <b>imagined</b> it all [...] a woman being told that the evidence of her own body is invalid", a direction that would have been [...] "startling [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Scholars such as Claudia Tate suggest {{there is}} a theme of jealousy {{throughout}} the novel. Irene displays it here when deciding whether to expose Clare or not [...] "She was caught between two allegiances, different, yet the same. Herself. Her race. Race! The thing that bound and suffocated her. Whatever steps she took, or if she took none at all, something would be crushed. A person or the race. Clare, herself, or the race. Or, it might be, all three. Nothing, <b>she</b> <b>imagined,</b> was ever more completely sardonic.” Larsen uses jealousy as {{the main source of}} conflict in the novel, and uses race solely as a vehicle for Irene to potentially rid herself of Clare. At this point in the story Irene realizes she can expose Clare’s true racial identity to remove Clare from her life, and regain that security she desires more than anything.|$|E
500|$|In a 1926 paper {{published}} on the British typography journal The Fleuron, Beatrice Warde revealed her discovery that the Imprimerie nationale type had been created by Jean Jannon, something she had discovered by examining printing credited to him in London and Paris and through reading the work of Paillard, and perhaps with advice from French bibliographer Marius Audin. (Warde's article was originally published pseudonymously {{as the work of}} 'Paul Beaujon', a persona Warde later said <b>she</b> <b>imagined</b> to have [...] " [...] long grey beard, four grandchildren, a great interest in antique furniture and a rather vague address in Montparesse." [...] Typifying her sense of humour, she reported her conclusions to Morison, a convert to Catholicism, with a telegram beginning [...] "JANNON SPECIMEN SIMPLY GORGEOUS SHOWS ALL SIZES HIS TYPES WERE APPROPRIATED BY RAPACIOUS PAPIST GOVERNMENT..." [...] She also noted in later life that some of her readers were surprised to see an article supposedly by a Frenchman quoting The Hunting of the Snark.) ...|$|E

500|$|... "Tik Tok" [...] (stylized as [...] "TiK ToK") is {{the debut}} single by American {{recording}} artist Kesha. The song {{was produced by}} Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco and co-written by Kesha, Dr. Luke and Blanco. It was released on August 7, 2009, as the lead single from Kesha's debut studio album, Animal. The opening line of the song came from an experience where Kesha woke up surrounded by beautiful women, to which <b>she</b> <b>imagined</b> Diddy being in a similar scenario. The experience triggered {{the writing of the}} song which she later brought to her producer, Dr. Luke, who was then contacted by Diddy in hopes of a collaboration; he came to the studio the same day and recorded his lines and the song was completed. According to Kesha, the song's lyrics are representative of her and based on her life; the song has a carefree message and talks about not letting anything bring you down.|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939 {{saw some of the}} Fraternity's members enlist in the armed forces, putting a stop to many of the group's activities. From October 1939 through to October 1942, Fortune organised group meditations every Sunday with the intent of focusing Fraternity members towards the cause of peace. In February 1940, she undertook a visualisation in which <b>she</b> <b>imagined</b> angelic forces patrolling Britain's coast, believing that in doing so she was helping to make these forces a reality. She urged Fraternity members to repeat a mantra every time the German Luftwaffe began bombing Britain, through which she hoped to call upon [...] "Invisible Helpers" [...] from the [...] "Inner Planes" [...] to aid the people affected. The Fraternity's London headquarters were damaged during the Blitz, although roofing repairs were made and the group were able to move back into the building after a week. In August 1940, the group had to suspend publication of Inner Light as a result of paper shortages in Britain.|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as <b>she</b> <b>imagined</b> her to look.|$|E
