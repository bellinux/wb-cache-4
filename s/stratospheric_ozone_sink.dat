In this study, we examine the implications of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> recovery for the tropospheric chemistry and ozone air quality with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). With a full recovery of the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> the projected increases in ozone column range from 1 % over the low latitudes to more than 10 % over the polar regions. The sensitivity factor of troposphere ozone photolysis rate, defined as the percentage changes in surface ozone photolysis rate for 1 % increase in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> column, shows significant seasonal variation but is always negative with absolute value larger than one. The expected <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> recovery is found to affect the tropospheric ozone destruction rates much more than the ozone production rates. Significant decreases in surface ozone photolysis rates due to <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> recovery are simulated. The global average tropospheric OH decreases by 1. 7 %, and the global average lifetime of tropospheric ozone increases by 1. 5 %. The perturbations to tropospheric ozone and surface ozone show large seasonal and spatial variations. General increases in surface ozone are calculated for each season, with increases by up to 0. 8 ppbv in the remote areas. Increases in ozone lifetime by up to 13 % are found in the troposphere. The increased lifetimes of tropospheric ozone in response to <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> recovery enhance the intercontinental transport of ozone and global pollution, in particular for the summertime.

40|$|Abstract. In {{a recent}} paper Hu et al. (2011) {{suggest that the}} {{recovery}} of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> {{during the first half}} of this century will significantly enhance free tropospheric and surface warming caused by the anthropogenic increase of greenhouse gases, with the effects being most pronounced in Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. These sur-prising results are based on a multi-model analysis of CMIP 3 model simulations with and without prescribed <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> recovery. Hu et al. suggest that in order to properly quantify the tropospheric and surface temperature response to <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> recovery, it is necessary to run coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models with <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> chemistry. The results of such an experiment are presented here, using a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model cou-pled to a three-dimensional ocean model. In contrast to Hu et al., we find a much smaller Northern Hemisphere tropo-spheric temperature response to ozone recovery, which is of opposite sign. We suggest that their result is an artifact of the incomplete removal of the large effect of greenhouse gas warming between the two different sets of models. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prospective}} future {{adoption of}} hydrogen {{to power the}} road transportation sector could greatly improve tropospheric air quality but also raises the question whether the adoption would have adverse effects on <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> The possibility of these undesirable impacts must be fully evaluated to guide future policy decisions. Here we evaluate the possible impact of a future (2050) H 2 -based road transportation sector on stratospheric composition and chemistry, especially on <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> with the MOZART chemical transport model. Since future growth is highly uncertain we evaluate the impact for two world evolution scenarios, one based on a high emitting scenario (IPCC A 1 FI) {{and the other on}} a low emitting scenario (IPCC B 1), as well as two technological options: H 2 fuel cells and H 2 internal combustion engines. We assume a H 2 leakage rate of 2. 5 % and a complete market penetration of H 2 vehicles in 2050. The model simulations show that a H 2 -based road transportation sector would reduce <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations as a result of perturbed catalytic ozone destruction cycles. The magnitude of the impact depends on which growth scenario the world evolves and which H 2 technology option is applied. For the same world evolution scenario, <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> decreases more in the H 2 fuel cell scenarios than in the H 2 internal combustion engine scenarios because of the NO x emissions in the latter case. If the same technological option is applied, the impact is larger in the A 1 FI emission scenario. The largest impact, a 0. 54 % decrease in annual average global mean <b>stratospheric</b> column <b>ozone,</b> is found with a H 2 fuel cell type road transportation sector in the A 1 FI scenario; whereas the smallest impact, a 0. 04 % increase in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> is found with applications of H 2 internal combustion engine vehicles in the B 1 scenario. The impacts of the other two scenarios fall between the above two bounding scenarios. However, the magnitude of these changes is much smaller than the increases in 2050 <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> expected as <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> recovers due to the limits in ozone depleting substance emissions imposed in the Montreal Protocol...|$|R

Using this technique, we have produced a 32 -yr (1979 - 2010) long record of tropospheric and <b>stratospheric</b> column <b>ozone</b> from the combined Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and OMI. Analyses of these time series suggest that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is the dominant source of inter-annual variability of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and is clearest in the Southern Hemisphere during the Aura time record with related inter-annual changes of 30 - 40 Dobson Units. Tropospheric ozone for the long record also indicates a QBO signal in the tropics with peak-to-peak changes varying from 2 to 7 DU. The most important result from our study is that global <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> indicates signature of a recovery occurring with ozone abundance now approaching the levels of year 1980 and earlier. The negative trends in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> in both hemispheres during the first 15 yr of the record are now positive over the last 15 yr and with nearly equal magnitudes.
