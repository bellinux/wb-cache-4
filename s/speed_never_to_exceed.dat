The receiving transducer scans a plane area containing the sound field generated or scattered from the objects.

The simulated position and velocity signals contain errors that adversely {{affect the quality of}} the images. This thesis presents an analysis of scanning errors in holography when both the receiver and source are scanned. These errors affect the hologram resolution, magnification and image position.

Patients affected by chronic inflammatory diseases {{as well as by}} connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis, often have the need to take anti-platelet therapy (e. g. ASA or clopidogrel). Current consensus recommendations state that patients prescribed clopidogrel plus aspirin should receive a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce gastrointestinal bleeding. Although each single PPI has similar efficacy in many cases, differences between them should be considered when choosing a treatment regimen. Many studies show PPI and clopidogrel drug interaction, with clopidogrel non-responsiveness in about 25 % of the population. Only pantoprazole, which does not inhibit CYP P 450 2 C 19, doesn't seem to have interaction with clopidogrel or other drugs. Patients affected by systemic sclerosis have high frequency of oesophageal mucosal abnormalities and should take long-term PPI therapy. When addressing long-term therapy safety data are clearly needed. Two recent studies have reported increased hip fracture rates with long-term PPI use, raising concerns about adverse effects of this class of drugs on mineral metabolism. The use of PPIs is also associated with an increase in the risk of development of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the use of PPIs during CDI treatment is associated with an increased risk of recurrence.

Far ultraviolet imaging was carried out with the Solar Blind Channel of the ACS on HST in the F 122 M (Lya on-line) and F 140 LP (continuum) filters. The resulting Lya images {{are the product of}} careful modeling of both the stellar and nebular continua, facilitated by supporting HST imaging in Ha and 5 continuum bands, combined with Starburst 99 evolutionary synthesis models, and prescriptions for dust extinction on the continuum. In all, the resulting morphologies in Lya, Ha, and UV-continuum are qualitatively very different and we show that the bulk of Lya emerges in a diffuse component resulting from resonant scattering events. Lya escape fractions, computed from integrated Ha luminosities and recombination theory, are found <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>exceed</b> 14 %. Internal dust extinction is estimated in each pixel and used to correct Lya fluxes. However, the extinction corrections are far too small (factors from 2. 6 to infinity) to reconcile the global Lya luminosities with recombination theory. Surprisingly, when comparing the global equivalent widths of Lya and Ha, the two quantities appear anti-correlated, which {{may be due to the}} evolution of mechanical feedback. This calls for caution in the interpretation of Lya observations. The images presented have a physical resolution 3 orders of magnitude better than attainable at high-z from the ground with current instrumentation and our images may therefore serve as useful templates for comparing with observations and modeling of primeval galaxy formation. We therefore provide the reduced Lya, Ha, and continuum images to the community. Comment: Accepted by the Astronomical Journal. See also [URL]...|$|R
