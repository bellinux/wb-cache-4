25|$|The two rear {{dropouts}} (which {{join the}} seat stays to the chain stays, {{and hold the}} axle of the rear wheel) may have integral lugs in some designs. The fork dropout or ends may be joined to the fork blades using a similar method as well. The fork crown, which joins the <b>steering</b> <b>tube</b> to the fork blades, may have either an external or internal socket design.|$|E
5000|$|... 731OS - Oversize tubeset {{introduced}} in 1992 double butted oversized tubes with laterally aligned stiffening ribs on the but sections to maximize stiffness and torsional rigidity. Tubeset: Strength <b>steering</b> <b>tube</b> and fork 802N/mm2, top, down and seat tube 925N/mm2 and rear triangle 1315N/mm2.|$|E
5000|$|Some have {{employed}} linkages {{to provide the}} mechanical action instead of relying upon telescoping elements. Others, notably Cannondale use a single shock built into the <b>steering</b> <b>tube</b> above the crown. Another notable recent development in fork technology is the Lauf Spring which utilises composite leaf springs to provide mechanical shock absorption and damping, whilst offering a sizable weight reduction compared to conventional designs ...|$|E
50|$|Headset {{wrenches}} are oversized (32 - 36 mm) flat open-end wrenches for tightening headset {{cups and}} lock nuts on threaded <b>steering</b> <b>tubes.</b> May {{be designed to}} contact 7 sides of an 8 sided (8-point) lock nut.|$|R
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the <b>steering</b> axis (head <b>tube)</b> act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|R

50|$|Developed by MotoCzysz {{for their}} C1 and awarded United States Patent 7111700 on September 26, 2006.Defined as a {{motorcycle}} or bicycle front end having coaxial {{steering and suspension}} components, and having telescopic forks. Swing weight of the forks is dramatically reduced by removing their suspension components to the central location, coaxially within the <b>steering</b> <b>tube.</b> Ride height can be adjusted without loosening the forks in the triple clamps.|$|E
50|$|The first road frame from Cannondale was {{produced}} in 1983. It sold for $350 and included the frame and fork. The fork was steel with helical reinforcement ribs inside the steel <b>steering</b> <b>tube.</b> The frame was recognizable by its oversized down tube and enlarged head tube. The seatstays and chainstays were ovalized to reduce flex. Unlike steel frames, there were no lugs: the aluminum tubes were mitered, hand welded, and then heat treated.|$|E
50|$|Like {{threadless}} headsets, threaded headsets {{can also}} be internal. Under the internal design, the races and cones are embedded into the head tube, creating a tidy, streamlined appearance. No component is visible between the fork crown and head tube except for perhaps a plastic ring, and only the locknut protrudes {{from the top of}} the head tube. In the image shown of the 2016 Brodie Quantum's steering assembly, the lock nut is hidden from view by a plastic cover. The widened top and bottom sections of the head tube contain the bearings. A quill stem inserts into the <b>steering</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1986 Greg LeMond won the Tour de France on {{the first}} Look carbon frame, the KG 86. It was {{completely}} handmade and combined Kevlar with carbon for increased rigidity. In the early nineties, Look designed the revolutionary KG 196, the company's first monocoque carbon frame made of carbon, Kevlar, ceramic and aluminum. Being years ahead of its time, the KG186/KG196 featured sculpted aerodynamics, exceptional stiffness, an integrated fork and <b>steering</b> <b>tube</b> with limited front suspension, an adjustable stem, and was designed for both road, time-trial and track racing. The frame was extensively used by the ONCE cycling squad in the mid-1990s. The KG 196 has since evolved {{to become one of}} the most widely used and venerable series of track bikes of the past two decades, namely the KG 196, KG 296, KG 396, 496, and L96, ridden by numerous national squads to World and Olympic championships. Its key innovative aero features and integrated bayonnet-style fork has been widely imitated by other competitors to this day. The national and/or domestic track cycling teams of France, Russia, China, Japan and intermittently, Canada, Germany and the USA have used LOOK track bicycles to resounding success.|$|E
