40|$|Time-frequency {{techniques}} to characterize cuspate patterns in {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) data are introduced using {{examples from the}} Atlantic coast of Florida, United States. These techniques permit the efficient study of beach face landforms over many kilometers of coastline at multiple spatial scales. From a lidar image, a beach-parallel spatial series is generated. Here, this series is the shore-normal position of a specific elevation (contour line). Well-established time-frequency analysis techniques, wavelet transforms, and <b>S-Transforms,</b> are then applied to the spatial series.

50|$|S {{transform}} as a time-frequency distribution {{was developed}} in 1994 for analyzing geophysics data. In this way, the S transform is a generalization of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), extending the continuous wavelet transform and overcoming some of its disadvantages. For one, modulation sinusoids are fixed {{with respect to the}} time axis; this localizes the scalable Gaussian window dilations and translations in S transform. Moreover, the S transform doesn't have a cross-term problem and yields a better signal clarity than Gabor transform. However, the S transform has its own disadvantages: the clarity is worse than Wigner distribution function and Cohen's class distribution function. To avoid some of these disadvantages, various adaptive forms of the <b>S-transform</b> have been introduced.|$|E

40|$|To {{explore the}} effects of {{altering}} the leve 1 of Activator (Ac) transposase (TPase) expression, a series of plasmids was constructed in which heterologous promoters were fused to the TPase gene. Promoters for the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 s transcript and the octopine synthase (ocs) and nopaline synthase (nos) genes were tested. These fusions, and constructs expressing TPase from the wild-type Ac promoter, were introduced into tobacco, and their activity was monitored by crossing to a line carrying Dissociation (Ds) in a streptomycin phosphotransferase gene (Ds::SPT). The SPT marker provides a record of somatic excisions of Ds that occur during embryo development. The patterns of somatic variegation that resulted from transactivation by each fusion were distinct and strikingly different from the pattern trig-gered by the wild-type Ac constructs. Unlike wild-type Ac, which caused transposition throughout embryo development, each fusion gave rise to sectors of d iscbte size. Sectors triggered by the CaMV 35 s fusion were largest, ocs sectors were intermediate, and nos were smallest. These patterns appear to indicate differential timing of the activation of these promoters during embryogeny. Measurement of transcript abundance for each transformant indicated that the CaMV 35 <b>s-transformed</b> plants accumulated approximately 1000 -fold more TPase mRNA than plants containing wild-type Ac, whereas ocs- and nos-transformed lines accumulated about 100 -fold and 20 -fold higher levels, respectively.

40|$|When we {{consider}} {{the nature of the}} scientific community in conjunction with a sense of typical economic circumstances we find that there are two distinct paths for development. One path involves hypothesis testing and evolution of strategies that are linked with iterations in equipment advances. A second, more complicated scenario, can involve external influences whether economic, political, or otherwise, such as the government closure of NASA 2 ̆ 7 s space program in 2011 which will no doubt influence research in associated fields. The following chapters are an account of examples of two statistical techniques and the importance of both on the two relatively unrelated geological fields of coastal geomorphology and ground water hydrology. The first technique applies a multi-dimensional approach to defining groundwater water table response based on precipitation in areas where it can reasonably be assumed to be the only recharge. The second technique applies a high resolution multi-scalar approach to a geologic setting most often restricted to either high resolution locally, or low resolution regionally. This technique uses time-frequency analysis to characterize cuspate patterns in LIDAR data are introduced using examples from the Atlantic coast of Florida, United States. These techniques permit the efficient study of beachface landforms over many kilometers of coastline at multiple spatial scales. From a LIDAR image, a beach-parallel spatial series is generated. Here, this series is the shore-normal position of a specific elevation (contour line). Well-established time-frequency analysis techniques, wavelet transforms, and <b>S-Transforms,</b> are then applied to the spatial series. These methods yield results compatible with traditional methods and show that it is useful for capturing transitions in cuspate shapes. To apply this new method, a land-based LIDAR study allowing for rapid high-resolution surveying is conducted on Melbourne Beach, Florida and Tairua Beach, New Zealand. Comparisons and testing of two different terrestrial scanning stations are evaluated {{during the course of the}} field investigation. Significant cusp activity is observed at Melbourne Beach. Morphological observations and sediment analysis are used to study beach cusp morphodynamics at the site. Surveys at Melbourne were run 500 m alongshore and sediment samples were collected intertidally over a five-day period. Beach cusp location within larger scale beach morphology is shown to directly influence cusp growth as either predominantly erosional or accretional. Sediment characteristics within the beach cusp morphology are reported coincident with cusp evolution. Variations in pthesis size distribution kurtosis are exhibited as the cusps evolve; however, no significant correlation is seen between grain size and position between horn and embayment. During the end of the study, a storm resulted in beach cusp destruction and increased sediment sorting. In the former technique using multi-dimensional studies, a test of a new method for improving forecasting of surficial aquifer system water level changes with rainfall is conducted. The results provide a more rigorous analysis of common predictive techniques and compare them with the results of the tested model. These results show that linear interpretations of response-to-rainfall data require a clarification of how large events distort prediction and how the binning of data can change the interpretation. Analyses show that the binning ground water recharge data as is typically done in daily format may be useful for quick interpretation but only describes how fast the system responds to an event, not the frequency of return of such a response. Without a secure grasp on the nonlinear nature of water table and rainfall data alike, any binning or isolation of specific data carries the potential for aliasing that must be accounted for in an interpretation. The new model is proven capable of supplanting any current linear regression analysis as a more accurate means of prediction through the application of a multivariate technique. Furthermore, results show that in the Florida surficial aquifer system response-to-rainfall ratios exhibit a maxima most often linked with modal stage...|$|R

30|$|A {{performance}} {{comparison between}} the AW-XWVD and <b>S-transform</b> estimators of IIB-phase shows that the AW-XWVD is superior to the <b>S-transform</b> for classifying PSK signals. Results show that the mean square error of the phase estimate using AW-XWVD is on the average lower by 20 dB. The <b>S-transform</b> has a frequency-dependent window width which performs poorly as a phase estimator for high-frequency signal components. Since peak detection {{is used for the}} estimation of the IIB-phase for both methods, the frequency resolution and MLW contribute to the estimation accuracy. The AW-XWVD maintains the frequency resolution through the window adaptation and yields better accuracy for the IIB-phase estimate. It also meets the CRLB at moderate SNR for all the defined signals unlike the <b>S-transform</b> that never meets the bound even at high SNR. For symbol error rate performance, the AW-XWVD is also better compared to the <b>S-transform</b> and it is comparable to the conventional detector at the cost of higher number of computations.
