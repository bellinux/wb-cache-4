50|$|Olimpija had {{a string}} of mixed results for the {{remainder}} of the season, getting knocked out in the round of 16 of the 2003-04 Slovenian Cup and finishing runners-up in the 2003-04 Slovenian PrvaLiga. However, most sponsors (including Schollmayer) decided to abandon the club at the end of the season which led to serious financial difficulties for the club. Following Schollmayer's exit, Olimpija were forced to sell almost all of their players. Although the club had started competing in the 2004-05 championship, the club had struggled on the pitch and failed to obtain competition licences issued by the Football Association of Slovenia, which led to its dissolution. Eventually the club, with a debt consisting of over 700 million <b>Slovenian</b> <b>tolars</b> (around three million euros in 2004 exchange rate), filed for bankruptcy and was dissolved by the end of year. However, the Football Association of Slovenia had exceptionally allowed the club to finish the 2004-05 season and, after finishing sixth in the national championship, Olimpija effectively ceased all operations.|$|R
50|$|One of {{his most}} {{prominent}} career highlights was in 1991, {{when he won the}} contest for designing new <b>Slovenian</b> currency, the <b>tolar.</b> The banknotes, which were in circulation from October 1991 until the end of 2006, featured portraits of prominent Slovenian personalities, the work of painter Rudi Španzel. When Slovenia adopted the euro as the national currency, Licul designed the national side of Slovenian euro coins, together with Maja Licul and Janez Boljka. Licul and Boljka designed tolar coins together, as well.|$|R

50|$|The tolar was the {{currency}} of Slovenia from 8 October 1991 until {{the introduction of the}} euro on 1 January 2007. It was subdivided into 100 stotinov (cents). The ISO 4217 currency code for the <b>Slovenian</b> <b>tolar</b> was SIT. From October 1991 until June 1992, the acronym SLT was in use.|$|E

50|$|Rudi Španzel {{graduated}} from the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana.

He has received many domestic and foreign awards for achievements, among them the Prešeren Fund Award in 1985. He painted portraits on <b>Slovenian</b> <b>tolar</b> banknotes, in circulation from October 1991 until the introduction of euro in January 2007.|$|E
50|$|In 1965 {{a primary}} school in Šiška {{was named after}} him. Since 1969, the Jakopič Award, the highest Slovenian award in fine arts, is {{presented}} annually. In 1970-72, a statue of Jakopič by Bojan Kunaver was erected on the original site of the pavilion. In 1979, a new Jakopič Gallery (Galerija Jakopič) opened at Slovene Street (Slovenska cesta) in Ljubljana. After Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Jakopič was portrayed by Rudi Španzel on the 100 <b>Slovenian</b> <b>tolar</b> banknote, in circulation from October 1991 until the introduction of euro in January 2007.|$|E
50|$|Slovenia was {{the first}} country to join the eurozone after {{the launch of the}} coins and banknotes. Participation in ERM II began on 28 June 2004 and on 11 July 2006 the Council of EU adopted a {{decision}} allowing Slovenia to join the euro area as from 1 January 2007. The euro replaced the <b>Slovenian</b> <b>tolar</b> on 1 January 2007. The exchange rate between the euro and tolar had been set on 11 July 2006 at 239.640 SIT, but unlike the previous launches, cash and non-cash transactions were introduced simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|The Venetians {{learned from}} the silver crisis of 1465, and they used copper coins instead of silver as {{currency}} in 1473. The well-organized precious metal trade in Venice led the Venetians to open new copper mines in the Alps and Carpathians. The idea of using copper as a currency {{took a long time}} to get used to for the Venetians and those who traded with them; even after copper-based currency started flowing into the market, the desire for silver did not end. That continued demand led to the opening of a silver mine at Joachimsthal in Bohemia in 1516, which produced 3 million ounces of silver per year at its peak in the 1530s. Silver from the Joachimsthal mine was used to make silver coins called Joachimsthaler, which later came to be called the Thaler and saw use around much of Europe for over four hundred years. This name lives on today in the dollar as well as the <b>Slovenian</b> <b>tolar.</b>|$|E
40|$|On 1 January 2007, Slovenia was {{the first}} new EU member state to enter the euro area. Since June 2004, the <b>Slovenian</b> <b>tolar</b> participated in the {{exchange}} rate mechanism ERM-II with a central parity of 239. 64 against the euro. This parity was also the conversion rate upon euro area accession. Applying a macroeconometric model of Slovenia, this paper analyses the macroeconomic effects of different conversion rates. These simulations are compared to a scenario with flexible exchange rates. The best results are obtained with the actual conversion rate. In addition, it is shown that the labour market performance can be significantly improved by cutting non-wage labour costs. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{accuracy}} of vector autoregressive (VAR), restricted vector autoregressive (RVAR), Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR), vector error correction (VEC) and Bayesian error correction (BVEC) models in forecasting the exchange rates of five Central and Eastern European currencies (Czech Koruna, Hungarian Forint, Slovak Koruna, <b>Slovenian</b> <b>Tolar</b> and Polish Zloty) against the US Dollar and the Euro. Although these models tend to outperform the random walk model for long-term predictions (6 months ahead and beyond), even the best models in terms of average prediction error fail to reject the test of equality of forecasting accuracy against the random walk model in short-term predictions.

40|$|Slovenia was {{the first}} of the ten new EU member states to enter the Euro Area on January 1, 2007. It was an {{explicit}} objective of Slovenian policy-makers to introduce the euro as early as possible. Slovenia was participating in the exchange rate mechanism ERM-II since June 2004. This paper analyses whether the choice of participating in the ERM-II soon after EU accession was the best strategy in terms of the macroeconomic performance. It is shown that a better overall economic performance could have been achieved under a crawling peg regime allowing a depreciation of the <b>Slovenian</b> <b>tolar</b> (SIT) before introducing the euro in 2007. The worst policy results are obtained when the exchange rate is totally fixed at an early stage of EMU integration. The labor market performance can be significantly improved by cutting income taxes and social security contribution rates...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to show the threats {{connected}} with the exchange rate stabilization within the framework of ERM II and the analysis of the randomly selected EU countries – candidates for the Euro Zone. A two year stabilization of the exchange rate within the ERM II required prior to the Euro Zone accession is connected with numerous risks typical of a fixed rate with a hard band of fluctuations. There are two ways of exchange rate stabilization – a standard one as in the case of the <b>Slovenian</b> <b>Tolar</b> or a currency board (the case of the Baltic states). Neither of them is free of drawbacks. Against this background a question can be formulated: is the exchange rate stabilization indispensable for the Euro Zone accession at all? More and more arguments are raised against it. The most relevant ones refer to the criteria of price stability and fiscal stability. Stabilization of the exchange rate within the ERM II for two years in the situation of free capital flows may not be successful and there is a probability of the currency crisis in the country stabilizing the exchange rate.
