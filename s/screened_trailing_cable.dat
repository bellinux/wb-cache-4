40|$|Mine <b>trailing</b> <b>cables</b> {{operated}} above safe thermal limits {{can cause}} premature insulation failure, increasing electrocution and fire hazards. Previous U. S. Bureau of Mines Pittsburgh Research Center research showed that, under static test conditions, electrical current levels permitted under present regulations may not limit cable temperatures {{to less than}} the 90 20 C rating of reeled <b>trailing</b> <b>cable.</b> Continuing research under the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) addresses thermal characteristics of reeled <b>trailing</b> <b>cable</b> under dynamic test conditions more representative of field conditions, where operators constantly reel in and pay out cable. This research is in support of efforts by industry associations and the Mine Safety and Health Administration to establish safety guidelines for cyclically rated reeled machines. This paper describes a unique approach to measuring temperatures within reeled cable under dynamic test conditions. Fiber-optic sensors embedded within the metallic conductors measure temperatures at 1 -m intervals along {{the entire length of}} cable. Temperature measurements are reported to be accurate to within 12120 C. The test setup requires access to only one end of the <b>trailing</b> <b>cable,</b> allowing researchers to freely reel in and pay out cable while temperature measurements are made, simulating field conditions. Manufacture of a fiberoptic-embedded <b>trailing</b> <b>cable</b> is described, along with initial test results that indicate the fiber-optic approach is viable...|$|R

This research had a twofold purpose: (1) to define the thermal characteristics of electrically overloaded <b>trailing</b> <b>cables,</b> and (2) to conceptualize electrical protection for cables that allows maximum cable efficiency without diminishing electrical safety in underground mines. Several tasks were undertaken in support of these goals during the 3 -year research effort. Overload tests ranging from 2 to 12 times rated ampacity were conducted in the Bureau's Mine Electrical Laboratory. Two thermal models of energized type G-GC <b>trailing</b> <b>cables</b> were constructed, one based on thermodynamic theory and the other using empirical data from previous Bureau load tests. The empirical model was then incorporated into an interactive computer program that can assist designers and approvers of mining machines in selecting the appropriate size <b>trailing</b> <b>cable.</b> This program can {{be the basis for}} a cable protection system that ensures that cables are not the source of fires, ignitions, burns, or explosions underground.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} the operational characteristics of spliced portable power cables. This research had a dual purpose: (1) {{to determine the}} thermal and mechanical performance of repaired <b>trailing</b> <b>cables</b> and compare them with undamaged cables and (2) to gauge the impact of long-term, localized heating on the insulating and jacketing materials contained in cable splice kits accepted or approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. The ranges of splice joint resistance and tensile breaking strength were determined from laboratory measurements. The choice of crimping tools affected {{the strength of the}} splice under tension. Thermal profiles of energized spliced cables were constructed, which showed that spliced conductor joints operated 5 to 2020 C hotter than the intact cable at rated currents. Accelerated life tests of thermally aged samples of splice kit insulation and jacket materials confirmed a deficiency in the thermal rating of the insulating tape. The recommendations in this report may be utilized to revise splice kit design, splice kit approval criteria, and <b>trailing</b> <b>cable</b> loading guidelines.

40|$|Recent {{research}} conducted by NIOSH, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory showed that electrical current levels permitted under parent regulations may not limit cable temperatures to less than 90 20 C in reeled <b>trailing</b> <b>cables.</b> Reeled cables, tightly wrapped with many turns, ell carrying current in an enclosed space, can become overheated due to poor heat transfer. This overheating can cause the cable insulation to soften and become easily damaged. The damaged insulation reduces {{the life of the}} cable and can lead to shock, electrocution, and mine foes. This paper describes a method of measuring the conductor temperature of untie <b>trailing</b> <b>cables</b> during no anal operation. The temperature is measured using a 50 / 175 micrometer Graded Index Multimode Optical Fiber located {{in the center of the}} metallic conductors. Distributed temperature measurements arc made using an Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR). This system is capable of measuring temperature with an accuracy of plus or minus one degree centigrade over a length of 4 km at 1 -m intervals. With this unique way of measuring temperature, tests can be conducted simulating actual mine conditions and provide important data to allow MSHA's Approval and Certification Center to develop approval criteria for cyclically rated reeled machines...|$|R
50|$|Early surveys (beginning {{in the mid}} 20th century) {{often used}} the Wenner array, which was a linear array of four probes. These were {{arranged}} current-voltage-voltage-current, at equal distances across the array. Probes were mounted on a rigid frame, or placed individually. While quite sensitive, this array has a very wide span for its depth of investigation, leading to problems with horizontal resolution. A number of experimental arrays attempted to overcome the shortcomings of the Wenner array, The most successful of these being the twin-probe array, which has become the standard for archaeological use. The twin-probe array - despite its name - has four probes: one current and one voltage probe mounted on a mobile frame to collect survey readings, and the other current probe placed remotely along with a voltage reference probe. These fixed remote probes {{are connected to the}} mobile survey probes by a <b>trailing</b> <b>cable.</b> This configuration is very compact for its depth of investigation, resulting in superior horizontal resolution. The logistical advantage of the more compact array is somewhat offset by the <b>trailing</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Electrical {{equipment}} {{should be}} regularly maintained by competent people. Machines {{should not be}} allowed to overheat. Care should be taken not to cover machines while they are switched on as this is particularly likely to cause overheating. <b>Trailing</b> <b>cables</b> should be regularly checked for damage. Loose or poor connections in traditional electrical accessories and switchgear can cause heat to develop capable of starting a fire. This problem is known as High Resistance Connection (HRC) and safety devices such as fuses and Residual Circuit Devices (RCDs) are unable to disconnect the electrical supply because they cannot sense HRC. Consideration should be given to the installation of a preventative system designed to stop electrical connections and accessories from reaching a temperature which would result in a fire. Such a device operates by effectively closing a switch at a pre-set temperature to prevent ignition, smoke or burning odour.|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} research {{to determine the}} relationship between cur-rent load and temperature rises in coal mine <b>trailing</b> <b>cables.</b> Six low-voltage, unshielded, portable power cables were continuously and intermittently loaded with direct current of various magnitudes. Temperature rises within and on the cables were measured with thermocouples, and the data were recorded with a computer. Thermal time constants were calculated, which fixed the periods of the duty-cycle tests. Relationships between average temperature at the conductor-insulation interface and current load were established. The steady-state and intermittent currents that produce a 9020 C average conductor-insulation temperature were then determined. Comparisons with Insulated Cable Engineers Association (ICE A) steady-state ratings revealed that 10 to 25 pct more current than recommended ICEA ampacities is required to reach rated insulation temperature. Examination of the maximum intermittent temperatures attained showed that autoignition of coal dust and burn injuries to personnel handling the cable would not be concerns if the temperature at the conductor-insulation interface averaged 9020 C...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Electric mining {{excavators}} (rope {{shovels and}} draglines) represent {{a larger and}} the most dynamic part of the electric load at an open cut mine site. These excavators are currently undergoing an upgrade to the newly adopted high power IGBT-based AC drive technology. Such an upgrade requires that essentially every component inside an excavator {{is replaced by a}} new one. In this project an alternative upgrade solution is proposed, which is based on a transition from AC to DC form of power delivery, across the mine and to individual motors inside an electric excavator. Multiple advantages associated with such a solution are argued in the thesis. These include higher efficiency, higher power throughput for the same type of <b>trailing</b> <b>cables,</b> improved mobility due to longer <b>trailing</b> <b>cables,</b> utilisation of the existing motor fleet, potential peak power shaving and other advantages. This thesis presents a proof of concept for the DC-based power distribution system for open cut mines, including theoretical calculations, an aggregated modeling of an AC-fed excavator based on a novel approach, a detailed modeling of the internal structure of a DC-fed excavator, and extensive simulations under various realistic conditions, associated with coordinated and non-coordinated motor operation, load changes, regenerative braking, faults, etc. For a bidirectional interconnection of the external DC supply and the internal DC bus of an excavator, a particular, less known DC-DC converter type is proposed, namely, a transformerless LCL DC-DC converter. The advantages of this converter include its proven ability to operate in MW power range, reduced switching losses, soft switching operation under the full load, etc. Due to its importance for the proposed DC system, a new design procedure and a novel control scheme are proposed for this converter. Furthermore, a laboratory prototype of such a converter is developed together with the proposed novel control. Extensive experimental studies are used to validate its design, control and applicability. DC fault studies, performed in this project by simulation and experiment, confirm good fault tolerance of the proposed DC system. To address specific protection needs of an electric excavator, a comprehensive fault tolerance strategy is developed based on analysis of electrical and mechanical operation of an electric rope shovel and identification of its working cycle...|$|R
