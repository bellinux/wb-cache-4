40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this research effort {{was to investigate the}} transmission of high-power picosecond (ps) laser beams through various fibers for a fiber-coupled ps-CARS system. In particular, the damage threshold, nonlinearity, fiber length, and spatial beam profile through various fibers was investigated. It has been experimentally determined that an approximate increase in signal of 100 to 1000 times is possible by designing a system for ps fiber-based CARS. The other unique feature of the picosecond CARS system that makes it ideal for fiber coupling is the requirement of only ~ 200 µJ of energy for the pump and probe beams as compared to 25 mJ of energy per laser beam generally required in nanosecond laser-based CARS.
