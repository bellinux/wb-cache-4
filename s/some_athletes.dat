5|$|Athletes {{train to}} achieve endurance, strength, speed, skill and {{flexibility}} {{at different levels}} of intensity. Offseason training often occurs on dry land, sometimes on roller skis. The organization of cross-country ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences. As with other sports that require endurance, strength and speed, <b>some</b> <b>athletes</b> have chosen to use banned performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>athletes</b> {{without a}} {{disability}} also {{compete at the}} Paralympics; The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and {{essential part of the}} competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>athletes</b> won medals both {{individually}} {{and as part}} of a mixed team, so these medals are tabulated under different nations in the official counts. Dionysios Kasdaglis, an athlete of Greek origins living in Alexandria, Egypt, is listed by the IOC as Greek during his competition in the singles tennis competition but Kasdaglis and his doubles tennis teammate, Greek athlete Demetrios Petrokokkinos, are listed a mixed team.|$|E

5|$|Doping {{has played}} a {{significant}} part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and anabolic steroids marked the rise of women from the German Democratic Republic {{in track and field}} from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. <b>Some</b> <b>athletes,</b> who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems {{as a result of the}} regime. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using anabolic steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. Doping problems have also been associated with sprinters such as Tyson Gay, Michael Rogers, and Justin Gatlin, all from the United States. Doping has also affected entire nations, such as Russia, which has been banned from competing at both the Indoor World Championships and the Olympics in 2016. This ban was imposed in 2016 after major allegations of doping and covering up were discovered in 2015.|$|E

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>athletes</b> {{have used}} {{colostrum}} {{in an attempt}} to improve their performance, decrease recovery time, and prevent sickness during peak performance levels. Supplementation with bovine colostrum, 20 grams per day (g/d), in combination with exercise training for 8 wk may increase bone-free lean body mass in active men and women.|$|E
25|$|There {{were rumors}} that <b>some</b> <b>athletes</b> were {{considering}} boycotting the 2008 Summer Olympics over the Tibetan violence. The vice-president of the International Olympic Committee discouraged this, {{as well as}} the European Union and the Olympic Committees of Europe and Australia, who condemned politicizing sport. Even the 14th Dalai Lama reiterated that he was against any boycott.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>athletes</b> {{also use}} GHB, as GHB {{has been shown}} to elevate human growth hormone in vivo. One study found that it doubled growth hormone {{secretion}} in normal young males. The growth hormone elevating effects of GHB are mediated through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and can be prevented by prior administration of pirenzepine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor blocking agent.|$|E

25|$|Sportswomen of Pakistan {{have always}} been plagued by the patriarchal society and many have come forward to claim that coaches, {{selectors}} {{and others who are}} in position of power demand sexual favours. Sexual abuse of this kind has led <b>some</b> <b>athletes</b> to commit suicide due to inaction of authorities in pursuing the suspects. In some cases the female athletes who register the cases of sexual abuse and harassment are banned or put on probation.|$|E
25|$|The 1998 {{home run}} race had {{generated}} nearly unbroken positive publicity, but Barry Bonds' {{run for the}} all-time home run record provoked a backlash over steroids, which increase a person's testosterone level and subsequently enable that person to bodybuild with much more ease. <b>Some</b> <b>athletes</b> {{have said that the}} main advantage to steroids {{is not so much the}} additional power or endurance that they can provide, but that they can drastically shorten rehab time from injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} the {{countries and territories}} {{in the order of}} their entrance. It is worth noting that not all the athletes participated in the opening ceremonies, as some may have chosen to prepare themselves for races and competitions that were scheduled the very next morning. Other commitments may have prevented <b>some</b> <b>athletes</b> from participating in the parade. For example, most men's hockey teams would not arrive in Turin until the following week since most of the players are involved with the NHL. On the other hand, the parade included officials, judges, coaches and other team staff.|$|E

25|$|Former Labour first {{minister}} Henry McLeish published {{a report in}} May 2014 that found no obvious barriers to an independent Scotland competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics. McLeish said that <b>some</b> <b>athletes,</b> particularly those in team sports, may choose {{to compete for the}} existing Great Britain team rather than Scotland, as they would be nationals of both states. International Olympic Committee representative Craig Reedie pointed out that Scotland would need to obtain United Nations membership and may want to set its own Olympic qualifying standards, which would need {{to be done in the}} period between independence (March 2016) and the closing date for entries (July 2016).|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>athletes</b> {{used the}} championships as their final {{preparation}} before the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics, {{which was held}} in Moncton, Canada, later that month. Mutaz Essa Barshim provided one of the event highlights in the men's high jump as he broke the championship record as well setting the Qatari senior record with a clearance of 2.31m. Another Qatari, Mohamed Al-Garni completed a double in the men's 800 metres and 1500 metres. Thailand's Supachai Chimdee set a championship record in the men's 200 metres and also helped the Thais to victory in both relay events. India's Harminder Singh was the third competition record-breaker, winning the hammer throw in 71.53 metres – also an Indian junior record.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{like their}} Olympic counterparts, Soviet rugby players had a fair degree of shamateurism. Both the Olympics and rugby union were officially amateur, {{but this was}} not really the case. For example, the Dinamo clubs were {{sponsored}} and financed by the KGB, but no one could say that openly that <b>some</b> <b>athletes</b> were full-time shamateurs, and received bonuses for winning including dollars. Masters of Sport were full time, and paid by their sports society. They received 180 rubles each year, plus 30-40 rubles if they were capped for the USSR team paid for by the USSR sports committee. There were frequently unofficial bonuses, and some people could be Masters of Sport for life, meaning that they would receive pay long after their retirement.|$|E

25|$|Unresearched nonprescription {{products}} or programs {{for weight loss}} are heavily promoted by mail and print advertising and on the internet. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends caution with use of these products, {{since many of the}} claims of safety and effectiveness are unsubstantiated. Individuals with anorexia nervosa and <b>some</b> <b>athletes</b> try to control body weight with laxatives, diet pills or diuretic drugs, although these generally have no impact on body fat. Products that work as a laxative can cause the blood's potassium level to drop, which may cause heart and/or muscle problems. Pyruvate is a popular product that may result in a small amount of weight loss. However, pyruvate, which is found in red apples, cheese, and red wine, has not been thoroughly studied and its weight loss potential has not been scientifically established.|$|E
500|$|However, the FIVB's mandating of the bikini {{ran into}} problems. Some sports {{officials}} consider it exploitative and impractical in colder weather. It also drew {{the ire of}} <b>some</b> <b>athletes.</b> At the 2006 Asian Games at Doha, Qatar, only one Muslim country– Iraq– fielded a team in the beach volleyball competition because of concerns that the uniform was inappropriate. They refused to wear bikinis. The weather during the evening games in 2012 London Olympics was so cold that the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings. Earlier in 2012, FIVB had announced it would allow shorts (maximum length [...] above the knee) and sleeved tops at the games. Richard Baker, the federation spokesperson, said that [...] "many of these countries have religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible".|$|E
500|$|The V-style {{itself had}} a {{transitional}} period of its own, going from a narrower [...] "V" [...] {{in the early}} to mid-1990s – which retained some features of the parallel style – to a much wider one {{at the end of the}} decade. <b>Some</b> <b>athletes</b> preferred to cross the back of the skis to exaggerate the [...] "V" [...] angle, while others leaned even more forward so that their body lay almost flat between the skis; both variations remain in use. The V-style was still not immune to failure if the air pressure under one ski was lost, but the results were much less catastrophic than with the parallel style; the latter had resulted in more head-first landings, whereas the V-style saw somewhat 'safer' landings on the back or shoulders.|$|E
