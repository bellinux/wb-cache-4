500|$|The pier, {{which cost}} £11,740 to build, {{originally}} {{consisted of a}} promenade [...] long and [...] wide, extending to [...] wide at the pier-head. The bulk of the pier was constructed from cast iron, with a wooden deck laid on top. The cast iron piles on which the structure rests were inserted using Birch's <b>screw</b> <b>pile</b> process; the screw-tipped piles were twisted into the sand until they hit bedrock. This made construction much quicker and easier, and guaranteed that the pier had a solid foundation. The cast iron columns, [...] in diameter, were filled with concrete for stability at intervals of , and supported by struts that were on average were slightly more than [...] thick. The pier's promenade deck is lined with wooden benches with ornamental cast iron backs. At intervals along the pier are hexagonal kiosks built around 1900 in wood and glass with minaret roofs topped with decorative finials. On opening two of the kiosks were occupied by a bookstall and confectionery stall and the kiosks near {{the ends of the}} pier were seated shelters.|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{designed}} two lighthouses for the town: The Upper Lighthouse, usually {{referred to}} as the Pharos (after the Pharos of Alexandria in Egypt, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World), can be seen for [...] and Beach Lighthouse is visible for [...] Both opened in 1840. A third lighthouse, Wyre Light, built in 1839–40 by blind engineer Alexander Mitchell, offshore on the northeast corner of North Wharf, was the first <b>screw</b> <b>pile</b> lighthouse to be built in Great Britain. Fleetwood is the only town in the United Kingdom to possess three lighthouses and the two within the town itself remain fully operational. Wyre Light has now fallen into a state of disrepair.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes a {{lighthouse}} {{needs to be}} constructed in the water itself. [...] Wave-washed lighthouses are masonry structures constructed to withstand water impact, such as Eddystone Lighthouse in Britain and the St. George Reef Light off California. [...] In shallower bays, Screw-pile lighthouse ironwork structures are screwed into the seabed and a low wooden structure is placed above the open framework, such as Thomas Point Shoal Lighthouse. As screw piles can be disrupted by ice, steel caisson lighthouses such as Orient Point Light are used in cold climates. [...] Orient Long Beach Bar Light (Bug Light) {{is a blend of}} a <b>screw</b> <b>pile</b> light that was converted to a caisson light because of the threat of ice damage.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this review is the design of axially loaded <b>screw</b> <b>piles.</b> Through a {{comprehensive}} collation of all relevant literature regarding the design of <b>screw</b> <b>piles,</b> comparisons are made and relations are drawn which will ultimately be relevant to future efforts associated with the design of <b>screw</b> <b>piles.</b> Contemporary design approaches to <b>screw</b> <b>piling</b> are covered and the consequential relationships among the various geotechnical design parameters are asserted. The review is centred on vertically loaded axial piles in compression and tension in both cohesive and cohesionless soils. Through a rigid analysis of all viable design methods, {{in relation to the}} bearing capacity of helical piles, comparisons are made among the different design methods and attention is brought to the need for more research on the settlement of <b>screw</b> <b>piles</b> in order to allow for a more complete design...|$|R
50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>piles,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as screw anchors, screw-piles, helical piles, and helical anchors are a steel screw-in piling and ground anchoring system used for building deep foundations. <b>Screw</b> <b>piles</b> are manufactured using varying sizes of tubular hollow sections for the pile or anchors shaft.|$|R
25|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>piles,</b> {{also called}} helical piers and screw {{foundations}}, {{have been used}} as foundations since the mid 19th century in screw-pile lighthouses. <b>Screw</b> <b>piles</b> are galvanized iron pipe with helical fins that are turned into the ground by machines to the required depth. The screw distributes the load to the soil and is sized accordingly.|$|R
2500|$|The West Pier (1863–66 by Eugenius Birch), {{dedicated}} {{entirely to}} leisure and promenading, was [...] "one {{of the most}} important piers ever built"—but after its closure in 1975 it decayed, caught fire twice and is now a rusting hulk stranded in the sea. [...] Many of its features were innovative, from the <b>screw</b> <b>pile</b> foundations developed by Alexander Mitchell to the Royal Pavilion-inspired Orientalist kiosks and other buildings which defined how seaside architecture should be. [...] Further dome-topped entertainment venues were added in 1893 and 1916; the first of these was built because a new rival had appeared closer to the centre of Brighton. Between 1891 and 1901, £137,000 was spent on the Palace Pier. [...] It was built by Arthur Mayoh to a design by R. St George Moore, and many additions were subsequently made—starting with an elaborate Winter Garden (now the Palace of Fun) by Clayton & Black in 1910–11. [...] A funfair was built at the seaward end, [...] from land, in 1938. [...] Domes, elaborate kiosks and ornate columns characterise the pier.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{correlations}} between installation torque and uplift capacity of helical <b>screw</b> <b>piles</b> are frequently {{employed as a}} procedure for on site quality control {{of this type of}} foundation. In this work a theoretical relationship between uplift capacity and installation torque of deep helical <b>screw</b> <b>piles</b> in sand is proposed. The component of this relationship related to the contribution of helical plates to the uplift capacity was verified by centrifuge modelling in the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussées (Nantes). Twelve model piles with different number of helices and diameters were tested in reconstituted sand samples with different relative densities. The pile installation and pull-out tests were carried-out in flight. Direct shear interface tests were conducted to characterize the interface between soil and pile. The experimental results were compared with the values predicted by the suggested theoretical approach. This comparison showed good agreement between the measured and calculated uplift capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} {{to take into}} account flexibility of pile foundation in design of such structures as towers for mobile communication or radio equipment especially under dynamic loads (seismic, fluctuating component of wind load and the resonant vortex excitation) has been considered. The specific features of modeling of pile ductility, using program complex SCAD, were discussed and examples of corresponding calculations are given. The influence of pile parameters on internal forces and deflections of structure were also discussed. It was found, that for <b>screw</b> <b>piles</b> in the calculation results are mostly influenced by diameter of the broadening; the influence of trunk diameter of piles is considerably less. The effect of trunk pile diameter is much more important for piles without the broadening than for <b>screw</b> <b>piles.</b> It was also found that in most cases the effect of pile ductility in the vertical direction is much more significant than in horizontal...|$|R
50|$|This {{light was}} {{constructed}} in 1893, a late date for a screw-pile structure.

50|$|The Margate pier led to {{a series}} of new commissions, which {{eventually}} ran to 14 piers in total, the most famous of which is the West Pier, Brighton. His effect on pier construction techniques can be measured in the fact that, from 1862 to 1872, 18 new pleasure piers were built, the majority using <b>screw</b> <b>piling.</b> His last pier was Plymouth, opened in the year he died, 1884.|$|R
50|$|An iron pier {{was built}} {{beginning}} in 1871 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and completed in 1882. The 1700 ft pier {{was designed to}} carry rail traffic directly out to ships in the harbor. The structure used iron <b>screw</b> <b>piles</b> with wood decking. The pier was later adapted {{for use by the}} U.S. Lifesaving Station and the quarantine station. The iron pier shafts remain visible in the harbor, a hazard to navigation.|$|R
50|$|Central Pier is {{constructed}} mostly {{of cast iron}} with wooden decking. The piles on which the structure rests were driven using the <b>screw</b> <b>pile</b> method pioneered by Eugenius Birch. This involved twisting screw-tipped cast iron piles down through the sand until they hit bedrock. The materials and building techniques {{were similar to those}} used for North Pier but the structure of Central is a little more delicate in appearance.|$|E
50|$|The Annan River Bridge {{is a rare}} {{example of}} a plate girder and <b>screw</b> <b>pile</b> bridge. It is also an {{uncommon}} example of a low-level bridge. Low-level bridges are being progressively replaced with those at much higher levels {{in order to avoid}} road closures during floods. The Annan River Bridge {{is one of the last}} remaining bridges of its type in Australia. At 275 metres in length, it is also one of the longest structures of its type.|$|E
50|$|Bridge No.7 {{across the}} Buckingham Canal connects the {{terminus}} with the railway yards and stations to the north. The bridge, measuring 33.02 m {{in length and}} carrying six tracks, acts as the gateway to the terminus. The bridge was originally resting on cast iron <b>screw</b> <b>pile.</b> Following the 2001 accident of Mangalore-Chennai express killing 52 passengers, Southern Railway started replacing all bridges resting on screw piles, and the bridge was replaced with a new RCC box bridge resting on well foundation in September 2010, with ancillary works getting completed by March 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by Frederick Foster, {{it had a}} {{concrete}} and stone neck, wooden piles supporting iron girders, and a wooden deck. After opening in 1846, it was rebuilt in 1872 along the new classical Victorian era civil engineering lines, with <b>screw</b> <b>piles</b> made from iron, steel supporting girders and a wooden deck. In 1895, works extended its deck length to 570 ft, with a T-shaped pontoon end, a pavilion, and added a [...] railway baggage line.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} fulfill the new {{structural}} requirements of the renovation design over 200 helical <b>screwed</b> <b>piles</b> were installed through the existing slab on grade to support a new floor slab. Demolition and abatement of the space was completed in November 2001. Build-out was awarded to Gilford Corporation with Design by Ai Architects on September 14, 2001. The original completion date was set as March 2003, with tenant move in scheduled for April 2003. The project was completed in June 2003.|$|R
50|$|The current bridge replaces a five-span {{plate girder}} bridge {{built for the}} Wycombe Railway in 1863.

They wanted to replace the bridge but were prevented by the First World War. Therefore, with the consent of the Thames Conservancy, the GWR shored up the bridge with wooden trestles resting on foundations of bagged cement until the end of wartime restrictions would allow the bridge to be replaced.|$|R
