40|$|Companies need {{integrated}} {{information systems}} {{to react to}} requirements of their customers, collaborate with partners, identify and exploit new opportunities quickly and effectively. A need for solid technology that will provide effective Knowledge Management within and across industrial enterprises is crucial. Nowadays a new integration concept based {{on the notion of}} Semantic Web is being developed, which pretends to address the industrial challenges concerning integration and interoperability. The concept assumes semantic annotation of Web resources and services to make them “understandable ” by computers. On the other hand, emerging Peer-to-Peer technology and appropriate networks suite well to the increasingly decentralized nature of modern companies and their industrial and business processes, whether it is a <b>single</b> <b>enterprise</b> or a <b>group</b> of companies. In this paper a potential of combination of Semantic Web and Peer-to-Peer is analyzed {{in the context of the}} integration and interoperability of industrial enterprises. A brief analysis of an industrial information infrastructure is provided. A survey of existent solutions is made showing the benefits from Semantic Web and Peer-to-Peer to provide evidence in favour of combining these two technologies. A real industrial case of the global network of maintenance services is described that implements the above concepts within the OntoServ. Net project...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the reality}} of the {{multinational}} <b>enterprise</b> <b>group,</b> many jurisdictions only deal with the single corporate entity. This is also the case in the context of cross-border insolvency. This article aims to provide guidance on how the European Union should respond to this problem. A logical first step would be to include specific provisions to deal with multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> in the European Insolvency Regulation. This article elaborates on the possibility of an 'adaptive framework', as the enormous variety of possibilities in the way these multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> are structured would then be appreciated. The second step in the process of regulating multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> in insolvency would be the standardization of insolvency laws on the treatment of multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> in insolvency, as a universalist approach, e. g. the centralization or coordination of the insolvency proceedings against <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups,</b> would be difficult to achieve without the legal means to consolidate the insolvency proceedings against multinational <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

Based on the combination of industrial capitals and financial capitals, this paper analyzes the concepts, characteristics, and types of industry and finance combination in large <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> that regard the industry as the main body. Besides, this paper makes a theoretical analysis of comparing {{the industry and}} finance combinations in domestic and foreign <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups.</b> By this research, the author hopes to discuss how large <b>enterprise</b> <b>groups</b> make best use of resources, economy of scale, and economy of scope and improve the core competitiveness by combining industrial capitals and financial capitals. </p...|$|R

40|$|A line {{of credit}} {{is one of the}} most {{flexible}} financing tools for companies. Banks give companies lines of credit to strengthen their profitability and competitive ability. On the other hand, companies draw the lines of credit that will increase banks' credit risk. It is very difficult for banks to determine the lines of credit for an <b>enterprise</b> <b>group.</b> Based on principle of credit risk evaluation and structural model, this paper first defines bank's tolerable default risk and lines of credit, and then analyzes integrated lines of credit of parent and subsidiary companies. The results of this research indicate that the lines of credit of single company is related to its asset value growth, and integrated lines of credit of an <b>enterprise</b> <b>group</b> is also related to member's asset value growth and the associated relationships. Furthermore, this study shows that the integrated lines of credit of an <b>enterprise</b> <b>group</b> can be determined by the weighted sum of member's lines of credit and the computational formula of weight. This study provides a quantitative analysis tool to ascertain the <b>enterprise</b> <b>group's</b> integrated lines of credit and analyze how the associated relationships affect the integrated lines of credit.

In this paper, we built a theoretical model of the proliferation of credit risk based on the simplified model. Further, from the two basic factors that influence the intensity of related party transactions- the scale of <b>enterprise</b> <b>Groups</b> and the intensity of the related relationship, we did a simulation research. The study found: when the two basic factors are controlled in a reasonable range, <b>enterprise</b> <b>Group's</b> credit risk can be controlled at a lower level...|$|R
