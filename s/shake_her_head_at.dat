60|$|Mrs. Woodford could {{scarcely}} <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the disobedience, {{and she asked}} if there were really no other varieties.|$|E
6000|$|But {{my mother}} would <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> this, and reply almost hotly, ‘I tell you if I ever go into that man’s office, I go in silk.’ ...|$|E
60|$|The tapping recommenced, {{light as}} from the bill of a little bird; her illegitimate hope overcame her vow; she went and pulled back the shutter, determining, however, to <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him and keep the {{casement}} securely closed.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Chinnery, who {{was hot and}} flustered, <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Again the blankness of non-comprehension. She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him and smiled.|$|R
60|$|The {{little girl}} <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> this. She {{had been too}} young to remember.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you think}} I don't know,' said my aunt, turning a deaf {{ear to the}} sister, and {{continuing}} to address the brother, and to <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him with infinite expression, 'what kind of life you must have led that poor, unhappy, misdirected baby? Do you think I don't know what a woeful day {{it was for the}} soft little creature when you first came in her way--smirking and making great eyes at her, I'll be bound, as if you couldn't say boh! to a goose!' ...|$|E
6000|$|At last, {{after much}} rustling, hammering, and very audible {{directions}} {{from the stage}} manager, the curtain rose to soft music, and Bess was discovered sitting on a stool beside a brown paper fire-place. A dearer little Cinderella was never seen; for the gray gown was very ragged, the tiny shoes all worn, the face so pretty under the bright hair, and the attitude so dejected, it brought tears, as well as smiles, to the fond eyes looking at the baby actress. She sat quite still, till a voice whispered, [...] "Now!" [...] then she sighed a funny little sigh, and said, [...] "Oh I wish I tood go to the ball!" [...] so naturally, that her father clapped frantically, and her mother called out, [...] "Little darling!" [...] These highly improper expressions of feeling caused Cinderella to forget herself, and <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> them, saying, reprovingly, [...] "You mustn't 'peak to me." ...|$|E
60|$|For the terrors {{undergone}} by Mr Dolls {{that evening}} when his little parent sat profoundly meditating over her work, {{and when he}} imagined himself found out, as often as she changed her attitude, or turned her eyes towards him, there is no adequate name. Moreover it was her habit to <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> that wretched old boy whenever she caught his eye as he shivered and shook. What are popularly called 'the trembles' being in full force upon him that evening, and likewise what are popularly called 'the horrors,' {{he had a very}} bad time of it; which was not made better by his being so remorseful as frequently to moan 'Sixty threepennorths.' This imperfect sentence not being at all intelligible as a confession, but sounding like a Gargantuan order for a dram, brought him into new difficulties by occasioning his parent to pounce at him in a more than usually snappish manner, and to overwhelm him with bitter reproaches.|$|E
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> me {{with that}} same smile I could have struck her for.|$|R
60|$|They {{discussed}} the matter until Mrs. Acton {{appeared on the}} veranda and <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Prime {{understood}} him as {{alluding to}} a small family, and again <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the allusion.|$|R
5000|$|Robin Pogrebin, in The New York Times in 1999 {{wrote of}} Stroman visiting a swing club and noticing a dancer {{in a yellow}} dress. [...] "The woman would {{step up to the}} dance floor as a song was {{beginning}} and nod or <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the various men asking to be her partner. Then, after holding everyone's attention with her nervy grace, she would disappear into the crowd. What came out of this was Contact... " ...|$|E
60|$|Amy <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> this vain-glorious boast, and {{was more}} than ever in doubt of the {{soundness}} of the good man's intellect.|$|R
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him good-humouredly. He turned away, disappointed, {{and waved}} his hand to Lenora and Quest on the upper deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ark at him," [...] {{said the}} {{blushing}} Mr. Kemp, as Mrs. Bradshaw <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the offender {{and told him}} to behave himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry I can't, and I've {{never seen}} Wallace do so," [...] Carroll answered, laughing, and Mrs. Chisholm <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kept {{on eating}} the cake {{after she had}} <b>shaken</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> me," [...] {{interrupted}} the captain, who was busy picking up the provisions.|$|R
6000|$|The lady <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him reproachfully. [...] "And I {{thought you}} were slow in the bush," [...] said she. [...] "Still, Thorne will know." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Puritan aunt <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the idea. [...] "It's {{a terrible}} thing to go {{unprepared}} into the presence of your Maker," [...] said she.|$|R
6000|$|... "You never mean to say," [...] pursued Dot, {{sitting on}} the floor and <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him, [...] "that it's Gruff and Tackleton the toymaker!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, he's very tiresome!" [...] and she <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> Tim; who smiled, {{laid his}} hand on his breast, and {{endeavored}} to look affecting.|$|R
60|$|The girls couldn't help laughing, {{and felt}} better for it, though Meg <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> {{the young lady}} who could find {{consolation}} in a sugar bowl.|$|R
6000|$|To {{which she}} only replies, <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the {{prostrate}} figure more amazedly than angrily, [...] "Oh, you Jo, you Jo. I have found you at last!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has a bad}} sound--a {{sound of}} a bad augury, bad sign," [...] said Madame. [...] "Ma-rà-sca!" [...] She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> {{the taste of the}} syllables.|$|R
60|$|The landlady, smiling amiably, {{subsided}} into {{a comfortable}} Windsor-chair, and <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him so severely that, against his better sense, he {{felt compelled to}} demand an explanation.|$|R
60|$|Jacob {{confessed to}} some {{acquaintance}} with modern dancing and a knowledge {{at least of}} the steps. They danced a fox trot, and at its conclusion she <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No more balls {{for these}} boys till they have atoned for this bad {{behavior}} by doing something kind to you," [...] said Mrs. Jo, <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the three culprits.|$|R
60|$|Paul felt it safest to {{say nothing}} at all, so he only looked at Miss Blimber's spectacles. Miss Blimber having <b>shaken</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him gravely, {{referred}} to a paper lying before her.|$|R
60|$|Lady Jane made {{a gesture}} as if Mary King were a hopelessly weak good-natured woman; and <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with a sort of}} lady-like vexation, ordered the coachman to drive on.|$|R
6000|$|Grandmother Smallweed, who {{has been}} mumbling and <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> the trivets, hearing figures mentioned, connects them with money and screeches like a horrible old parrot without any plumage, [...] "Ten ten-pound notes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your late wife, sir, {{was a most}} unworldly, most unhappy, most unfortunate baby,' {{returned}} my aunt, <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him. 'That's {{what she}} was. And now, {{what have you got}} to say next?' ...|$|R
60|$|He kissed 'is dirty paw--which is {{more than}} I should 'ave liked to 'ave done it if it 'ad been mine--and waved it, and the gal turned round and <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>at</b> 'im.|$|R
60|$|He smiled weakly, and {{his bony}} fingers stole round the tumbler which stood by his side. She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him smiling, and crossed over to him. She {{was not afraid}} any more.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Tidger bit <b>her</b> lip and <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>at</b> him scornfully. [...] "In plain English, Tidger, as {{plain as}} I can speak it,"—she said, severely, [...] "they’re after Ann and ’er bit o’ money." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Noel <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>At</b> {{that moment}} she struck her father as startlingly grown-up-so composed, swaying above {{that young man}} at her feet, whose sunny face was all adoration. 'No longer a child!' he thought. 'Dear Nollie!' ...|$|R
