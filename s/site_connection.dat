40|$|As {{demand for}} {{broadband}} service increases in emerging regions, high-capacity wireless links can accelerate and cost-reduce {{the deployment of}} new networks (both backhaul and customer <b>site</b> <b>connection).</b> Such links are increasingly common in developed countries, but their reliability in emerging regions is questioned where very heavy tropical rain is present. Here, we investigate the robustness of the standard (ITU-R P. 837 - 6) method for estimating rain rates using an expanded test dataset. We illustrate how bias/variance issues cause problematic predictions at higher rain rates. We confirm (by construction) that an improved rainfall climatology can largely address these prediction issues without compromising standard ITU fit evaluation metrics.

40|$|In {{the traffic}} impact studies (micro level) {{accessibility}} {{is affected by}} different activities within a commercial, office or residential land. Activities include pedestrian and bicycle conditions, transport infrastructure changes, network capacity, level of service within a site. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide better understanding of how transportation infrastructure changes within the commercial site influence on car-based trip generation rates at micro level. Transportation changes include development of new connections to the site: signalized and unsignalized intersections with different allowed traffic movements. Three parameters: demand, supply and readiness were considered and analyzed. Readiness (the number of traffic flows at the connections after changes in geometrical parameters) was determined by Synchro / Simtraffic 6. 0 simulation tool with assumption that the level of service of the <b>site</b> <b>connection</b> should be better than D / E. Verification and validation of simulation model were performed. Demand for commercial site was calculated based on ITE trip generation rates taking into account “smart growth” criteria for local conditions. Supply including existing incoming and outcoming traffic flows for the commercial site was observed by the survey...|$|E

This paper describes a study combining microbial tracers, intensive FIO measurement, open channel hydrology and molecular microbial source tracking (MST) to enhance understanding of recreational water quality at Amroth in southwest Wales, UK. Microbial tracers were released from four stream inputs during a moderate hydrograph event. Tracers from two local streams impacted simultaneously with a period of maximum FIO concentrations at the near-shore compliance monitoring <b>site.</b> <b>Connection</b> between these inputs and this site were rapid (9 ? 33 min). Water quality impairment from a more remote stream input followed, 12. 85 h after tracer release, sustaining FIO concentrations above desired compliance levels. MST analysis showed dominance of ruminant Bacteroidales genetic markers, associated with agricultural pollution. This integration of tracers and MST offers additional information on the movement and individual sources causing water quality impairment. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Public dissemination brings the adobe at Olompali closer, allowing remote visitors to interact with their own heritage.
