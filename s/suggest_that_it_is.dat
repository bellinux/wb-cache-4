5|$|The first {{description}} of B.nothofagi {{was published in}} 2012 by Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard. DNA studies of the fungus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a somewhat basal member of the genus Boletopsis. The fungus is most likely a native species of New Zealand and was present there {{before the arrival of}} Europeans. As it is very rare and possibly threatened, B.nothofagi is listed in the Red List of Threatened Species as an endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{saprobic}} fungus, Cyathus olla obtains {{nutrients from}} {{the breakdown of}} dead organic matter, and as such is usually found growing on woody debris; specimens found growing on soil are usually attached to bits of wood or stems present in the soil. Brodie notes that this species usually grows in moist and shaded locations, although its discovery in the arid regions of Lima, Peru, <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> tolerant of low-moisture conditions. It is the most abundant species of Cyathus found in Europe, and is also common in North America. Its range extends north to Sweden and far south in South America; {{it has also been}} reported in Australia, South Africa, Iran, and India.|$|E
5|$|Federal Forest Highway16 (FFH16) is {{a forest}} highway {{in the western}} Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. This road runs through the Ottawa National Forest in Iron, Houghton and Ontonagon counties. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has erroneously marked it as H-16 on their {{official}} state map. FFH16 is designated by the US Forest Service (USFS) with maintenance shared by the county road commissions (ICRC, HCRC, OCRC, respectively). Although the MDOT maps would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a part of the}} County-Designated Highway System (CDH system), it is not. The three counties in question do not participate in the system, and the roadway falls {{in the middle of the}} G zone for numbering purposes.|$|E

5|$|Heating in Enceladus has {{occurred}} through various mechanisms ever since its formation. Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it, {{giving it a}} warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal forces, could be no greater than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from Cassini's infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, and <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in thermal equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases. This led Schaller and Ryan to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a receptor, but instead {{is involved in the}} processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in biological systems {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E

50|$|Henodus, however, {{differs from}} other placodonts in having {{developed}} unique baleen-like denticles, which alongside {{features of the}} hyoid and jaw musculature <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a filter feeder. Recent comparisons to Atopodentatus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a herbivore as well, bearing a similar broad jaw shape, albeit it obtained plant matter through filter-feeding it from the substrates.|$|R
50|$|The precise {{date and}} {{location}} of composition <b>is</b> disputed: some <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written in Salzburg, the boy's home town, in 1762 or 1763; others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written in Paris in 1763 or 1764, during Mozart's first visit to <b>that</b> city. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> published in Paris in February 1764, along with another violin sonata, K. 7, as Mozart's “Opus 1”.|$|R
5|$|The Alcathoe bat (Myotis alcathoe) is a European bat in {{the genus}} Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary {{when it was}} first {{described}} in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M.alcathoe and any other species.|$|E
5|$|The Horton Plains are the {{headwaters}} of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha Eliya Plains. Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of Sri Lankan sambar deer feature as typical mammals and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback {{is one of the}} major threats to the park and some studies <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> caused by a natural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{degree of}} serotiny and fire {{mortality}} in B.prionotes varies with latitude, or, more likely, climate. Observations <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> always killed by {{fire in the}} north of its range, which is relatively hot and dry, and where individual plants are usually smaller, but may survive fire in the cooler, moister, south. Moreover, it is essentially non-serotinous in the south, since all seed is released {{by the end of the}} second year, but seed retention increases steadily to the north, and at the northern end of its range, it typically takes around four years for a plant to release half of its seed in the absence of bushfire, with some seed retained for up to 12 years.|$|E

5|$|Various {{anatomical}} {{features of}} the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sluggish in nature. This species hunts for teleost fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans both near the sea floor {{and in the middle}} of the water column. Its long snout is covered with ampullae of Lorenzini that enable it to sense minute electric fields produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.|$|E
