40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel haptic tele-manipulation {{environment}} is presented. This includes an interface between a master haptic mechanism and a slave mechatronic mechanism for biomedical operations. The novelty {{stems from the}} fact that the environment’s slave is a micromechatronic device driven by two inexpensive centripetal force vibration micromotors. The unique characteristics and challenges that arise during the haptic micromanipulation of the specific device are described and analyzed. The developed solutions are presented and discussed. The environment employs three input modes and two force control phases, which are described in detail. The haptic telemanipulation {{environment is}} illustrated by several examples. These show that, while the interaction between the haptic mechanism and the vibration driven device is complicated, the micromanipulation of the device can be successful and appear to the operator as <b>simple.</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Terms</b> — Haptics, micro mechatronic device, micromanipulation, vibration-driven actuation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{method for}} {{estimating}} unknown node positions in a sensor network based exclusively on connectivity-induced constraints is described. Known peer-to-peer {{communication in the}} network is modeled {{as a set of}} geometric constraints on the node positions. The global solution of a feasibility problem for these constraints yields estimates for the unknown positions of the nodes in the network. Providing that the constraints are tight enough, simulation illustrates that this estimate becomes close to the actual node positions. Additionally, a method for placing rectangular bounds around the possible positions for all unknown nodes in the network is given. The area of the bounding rectangles decreases as additional or tighter constraints are included in the problem.

We present a method to combine these decisions based on the Transferable Belief Model (TBM), an interpretation of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. The TBM is shown to provide a powerful and flexible framework, well suited to this problem. Special emphasis is put on the construction of basic belief assignments, an important issue which has not yet been fully explored in the literature.

To {{assess the impact of}} link sharing, we measure the File Transfer and Web Browsing throughput achieved over a Selective Repeat (SR) protocol, with or without contention from Media Distribution. Our results indicate that the optimal protocol settings strongly depend on the level of contention for the link. We therefore present two link layer protocols that adapt to the available bandwidth, our Adaptive Selective Repeat (ASR) protocol which dynamically modifies its retransmission timeouts, and the Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol specified for use by UMTS networks which does not employ retransmission timers. We first repeat our performance measurements to determine the optimal settings for each protocol, and then compare the fine tuned versions of all protocols with respect to their File Transfer and Web Browsing throughput, {{as well as to the}} delay induced to the contending Media Distribution packets.

40|$|Abstract — The quickest change {{detection}} {{problem is}} studied in de-centralized decision systems, where {{a set of}} sensors receive independent observations and send summary messages to the fusion center, which makes a final decision. In the system where the sensors {{do not have access}} to their past observations, the previously conjectured asymptotic optimality of a procedure with a Monotonic Likelihood Ratio Quantizer (MLRQ) is proved. In the case of additive Gaussian sensor noise, if the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at some sensors are sufficiently high, this procedure can perform as well as the optimal centralized procedure that has access to all the sensor observations. Even if all SNRs are low, its detection delay will be at most pi/ 2 − 1 ≈ 57 % larger than that of the optimal centralized procedure. Next, in the system where the sensors have full access to their past observations, the first of asymptotically optimal procedures in the literature is developed. Surprisingly, the procedure has same asymptotic performance as the optimal centralized procedure, although it may perform poorly in some practical situations because of slow asymptotic convergence. Finally, it is shown that neither past message information nor the feedback from the fusion center improves asymptotic performance in the <b>simplest</b> model. <b>Index</b> <b>Terms</b> — Asymptotic optimality, CUSUM, multi-sensor, quanti-zation, sensor networks, sequential detectio...|$|R

Many paths within these networks utilize molecular codebooks, such as the genetic code, to translate information written in one class of molecules into another molecular "language". The present paper examines the emergence and evolution of molecular codes in terms of rate-distortion theory and reviews recent results of this approach. We discuss how the biological problem of maximizing the fitness of an organism by optimizing its molecular coding machinery is equivalent to the communication engineering problem of designing an optimal information channel. The fitness of a molecular code takes into account the interplay between the quality of the channel and the cost of resources which the organism needs to invest in its construction and maintenance. We analyze the dynamics of a population of organisms that compete according to the fitness of their codes. The model suggests a generic mechanism for the emergence of molecular codes as a phase transition in an information channel.

40|$|Abstract—Ultra-wideband (UWB) systems {{having a}} {{bandwidth}} {{on the order}} of gigahertz have recently received wide attention both in the U. S. and in Europe. The family of UWB systems may communicate either by generating ultra-wideband signals or with the aid of innovatively combining conventional narrowband, wideband, or broadband signals. At the time of writing, UWB sys-tems have only been implemented using ultra-wideband signals, such as those known from impulse radio systems. Hence, in this paper, UWB systems using narrowband signals are explored as a design alternative, which are based on the well-known family of frequency-hopping (FH) spread-spectrum multiple-access techniques. In the proposed UWB system, FH is implemented using multistage frequency-hpping multiple access (MS/UWB FHMA). We highlight the principles of the synchronous MS/UWB FHMA communication system, investigate the associated spec-trum assignment, and the residue number system (RNS) based FH strategy. Detection of the received signal can be achieved with the aid of existing fast FH signal detection schemes. Our study shows that the RNS assisted FH strategy is capable of efficiently dividing the huge number of users supported by the synchronous MS/UWB FHMA system into a number of reduced-size user groups, where the multiuser interference only affects the users within the same group. Since the number of users in each group is {{only a small fraction of}} the total number of users supported by the synchronous MS/UWB FHMA system, advanced multiuser detec-tion algorithms can be employed for achieving near-single-user performance at an acceptable complexity. Our results show that MS/UWB FHMA is capable of supporting an extremely high number of users, while employing relatively <b>simple</b> receivers. <b>Index</b> <b>Terms</b> — Frequency-hopping (FH), multiuser detectio...|$|R

When the accident happen under the mine, {{the first thing to do}} is to locate the workers, there are many methods been proposed; however, each has pros and cons. For example, we can use RFID to locate the people, the problem is when there are too many miners at the same spot, the method doesn’t work well; we can use CDMA indoor GPS system to locate the person, however, the base station is not cheap; we can use IEEE 802. 15 Zigbee system to locate people, but we need huge amount of nodes to cover reasonable size of mine; for these reasons, we propose to use low cost WiFi system to fulfill the task.
