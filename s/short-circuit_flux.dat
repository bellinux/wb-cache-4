40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{energetics}} of active transport, a hypothetical carrier model is considered in which the active transport process is reduced to a minimal number of elementary steps. The relation between the following three quantities is examined: The affinity of the reaction driving the active transport, the ratio of isotope fluxes between identical solutions (“short-circuit”), and the maximal chemical potential difference which the active transport system can maintain. The interdependence of isotopeinteraction {{and the degree of}} coupling between transport and chemical reaction is shown explicitly: when the transport and chemical reaction are completely coupled, there is marked isotope interaction. In general, the logarithm of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>flux</b> ratio (multiplied by RT) and the maximal chemical potential are not equal. The two quantities are approximately equal, when coupling between metabolism and transport is very loose, or when the reaction step is much faster than the transfer of the adsorbed solute across the barrier. Without prior knowledge of the kinetic parameters of the carrier, the maximal potential and the dependence of the metabolic reaction on solute flow have to be measured in order to derive the affinity of the driving reaction. Measurement of the flux ratio in the same system will then yield independent information on the carrier mechanism...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} iron losses caused by {{fringing}} fluxes {{generated by the}} concentrated stator windings of an Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (AFPMSM). Fringing fluxes enter the laminated stator stack perpendicularly to {{the plane of the}} Laminated Silicon Steel Sheets (LSSS). They cause additional eddy currents and losses in the sheets. Three approaches for reducing these losses are compared experimentally with a dedicated set-up. The set-up has no moving parts and makes accurate iron loss measurement possible. The first method directly restricts the eddy-current losses by segmenting the lamination surface. The second method deflects the fringing flux by using Soft Magnetic Composite (SMC). The third method magnetically <b>short-circuits</b> the fringing <b>flux</b> using ferromagnetic wires. The first method gives the best results, with a reduction of six percent of the total iron loss at an induction level of 0. 6 T and a frequency of 200 Hz...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Linaclotide {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} the same gastrointestinal indications for which lubiprostone has been approved, chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Stressors damage the epithelial cell barrier and cellular homeostasis leading to loss of these functions. Effects of active linaclotide on repair of barrier and cell function in pig jejunum after ischemia and in T 84 cells after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α were examined. Comparison with effects of lubiprostone, known to promote repair of barrier function was carried out. Results In ischemia-damaged pig jejunum, using measurements of transepithelial resistance, 3 H-mannitol <b>fluxes,</b> <b>short-circuit</b> current (Cl − secretion) and occludin localization, active linaclotide failed to effectively promote repair of the epithelial barrier or recovery of short-circuit current, whereas lubiprostone promoted barrier repair and increased short-circuit current. In control pig jejunum, 1 [*]μM linaclotide and 1 [*]μM lubiprostone both caused similar increases in short-circuit current (Cl − secretion). In T 84 cells, using measurements of transepithelial resistance, fluxes of fluorescent macromolecules, occludin and mitochondrial membrane potential, active linaclotide was virtually ineffective against damage caused by interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α, while lubiprostone protected or promoted repair of epithelial barrier and cell function. Barrier protection/repair by lubiprostone was inhibited by methadone, a ClC- 2 inhibitor. Linaclotide, but not lubiprostone increased [cGMP] i as expected and [Ca 2 +] i and linaclotide depolarized while lubiprostone hyperpolarized the T 84 plasma membrane potential suggesting that lubiprostone may lead to greater cellular stability compared to linaclotide. In T 84 cells, as found with linaclotide but not with lubiprostone, transepithelial resistance was slightly but significantly decreased by guanylin, STa and 8 -bromo cGMP and fluorescent dextran fluxes were increased by guanylin. However the physiological implications of these small but statistically significant changes remain unclear. Conclusions Considering the physiological importance of epithelial barrier function and cell integrity and the known impact of stressors, the finding that lubiprostone, but not active linaclotide, exhibits the additional distinct property of effective protection or repair of the epithelial barrier and cell function after stress suggests potential clinical importance for patients with impaired or compromised barrier function such as might occur in IBS. </p...|$|R
