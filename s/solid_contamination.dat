The information coming from the flow field solution is used to identify regions having higher probability to be impacted by particles dragged by the fluid, and to estimate the erosion potential of solid particles having different size. The value of the kinetic energy of particles approaching the walls of the geometric domain is used to estimate the amount of material potentially eroded by impacting particles, and to provide a potential correlation between ISO 4406 and NAS 1638 <b>solid</b> <b>contamination</b> level classification.

40|$|The wheel {{rail contact}} {{operates}} in an arduous environment. Damage {{to the surface of}} either component is possible during manufacture, installation, or operation. The question arises as to how tolerant is the railway wheel or section of track to surface indentation or damage. In this work a twin disc simulation has been used to relate the level of surface damage (as well as the way it is generated) to the fatigue life of the surfaces. A related problem is the presence of <b>solid</b> <b>contamination</b> on the track. Sand (applied for improved adhesion) or track ballast material can cause damage to the rail and wheel surfaces. These mechanisms have been explored to assess the effect on contact fatigue life and wear. The disc specimens have been either artificially damaged (with dents and scratches) or run with particles of sand or ballast material. The discs were then loaded and rotated at realistic conditions of contact pressure and controlled slip. For normal operation of the contact, either dry or with water lubrication, surface dents and scratches have little effect on fatigue life. The normal plastic flow in the rail surface layer acts to close up dents. The failure of the disc is then by fatigue cracking across the whole surface with no particular preference to the dent location. Alternatively, if the contact is lubricated with oil then this plastic flow is greatly reduced and the dents act as stress raisers and fatigue cracks initiate from their trailing edge. Sand or ballast particles are crushed as they enter the wheel/rail contact. The fragments indent the surfaces and rapidly roughen the contact faces. The surface indentation is relatively minor, but the presence of particles increases the level of traction (over the wet case) and promotes further surface plastic flow. This can reduce the residual fatigue life of the contact. Further, high concentrations of sand were shown to promote a low cycle fatigue process that caused very high wear by the spallation of material. The twin disc simulations have shown that, under conditions similar to that of wheel/rail operation, surface damage is not a primary cause of fatigue failure. However, wear is greatly accelerated by the presence of solid contaminants and some evidence of a low cycle fatigue process was observed for sanded contacts...|$|E
50|$|The {{tunable laser}} {{provides}} a narrow, tunable wavelength light source {{that can be}} used to analyze these small spectral features. According to the Beer-Lambert law, the amount of light absorbed by the gas is proportional to amount of the gas present in the light’s path; therefore this technique is a direct measurement of moisture. In order to achieve a long enough path length of light, a mirror is used in the instrument. The mirror may become partially blocked by liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>contaminations,</b> but since the measurement is a ratio of absorbed light over the total light detected, the calibration is unaffected by the partially blocked mirror (if the mirror is totally blocked, it must be cleaned).|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the effect of}} <b>solid</b> {{particle}} <b>contamination,</b> whether intentionally introduced or not, on the breakdown process in air gaps has been explored previously. Unwanted solid particle contaminants in commercial electrical systems can lead to arcing and failure of transmission lines and gas insulation systems. Sand and dust with particle sizes above several tens of microns were shown to initiate breakdown across gap lengths of several centimeters [18, 19]. The previous works concluded that the sand and dust particles in the inter-electrode gap played a negligible role in the volume processes during breakdown; however, {{the formation of a}} thin contaminant layer on the cathode enhanced secondary electron emission and significantly reduced the breakdown voltage in some circumstances. Other works have shown that larger (100  s of microns to 100  s mms) conductive particles in an inter-electrode air gap can {{play a significant role in}} reducing breakdown voltage, time-lag of impulses, and breakdown probability [20 - 22].

On December 5, 2011, Operations personnel delivered six samples from the SHT (MCU- 11 - 1452 through - 1457) for analysis. These samples are intended to verify that the solvent is within the specified composition range. The results from the analyses are presented in this document. Samples were received in p-nut vials containing {approx} 10 mL each. Once taken into the Shielded Cells, the samples were combined. Samples were removed for analysis by density, semi-volatile organic analysis (SVOA), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and Fourier-Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR). Details for the work are contained in a controlled laboratory notebook. Each of the six p-nut vials contained a single phase, with no apparent <b>solids</b> <b>contamination</b> or cloudiness. Table 1 contains {{the results of the}} analyses for the combined samples. A duplicate density measurement of the organic phase gave a result of 0. 844 g/mL (1. 2 % residual standard deviation - RSD). Using the density as a starting point, we know that the Isopar{reg_sign} L should be slightly higher than nominal and the other components should be slightly lower than nominal. The results as a whole are internally consistent. All measurements indicate Isopar{reg_sign} L higher than nominal, and Modifier lower than nominal. The extractant result is higher than expected - given the other results, the extractant concentration should be under nominal values. Using the measured density as well as the Isopar{reg_sign} L and Modifier concentrations from the FTIR results, we calculate an extractant concentration of 6888 mg/L. This value is outside the analytical uncertainty of the reported HPLC value. Given the other results, this most likely indicates that the HPLC extractant result was biased high. When compared to the MCU density target of 0. 845 g/mL, {{there is no need to}} add an Isopar{reg_sign} L trim. However, it is advisable to add sufficient trioctylamine (TOA) to return the solvent composition to within specifications as that component has declined to about 64 % the concentration since the last analysis. The TOA measurement was performed twice, so the result is not an analytical aberration. TOA has not been added to the system since the previous quarterly sample in October 2011. As with the previous solvent sample results, these analyses indicate that the solvent does not require Isopar{reg_sign} L trimming at this time. However, addition of TOA is warranted. These findings indicate that the new protocols for solvent monitoring and control are yielding favorable results. Nevertheless, the deviation in the TOA concentration since the last analysis indicates continued periodic (i. e., quarterly) monitoring is recommended...|$|R

At temperatures usual for the temperate climatic zone, the mercury is a liquid metal with relatively high tension of saturated vapours. Interaction of these vapours with a solid phase is realised predominantly by physical forces on the phase interface through the mediation of the adsorption mechanism. Contamination of the soil occurs and the soil consequently becomes an emitter of mercury since the processes of physical adsorption and desorption in the environment are reversible processes.

The overall aim of this thesis is to obtain {{a better understanding of}} deposition and machining of WAAM wall parts through an integrated system. This research includes the study of the comparison of deposition of WAAM wall structures on different WAAM platforms, namely an Integrated SAM Edgetek grinding machine, an ABB robot and a Friction Stir Welding (FSW) machine. The result shows that WAAM is a robustly transferable technique that can be implemented across a variety of different platforms typically available in industry. For WAAM deposition, a rise in output repeatedly involves high welding travel speed that usually leads to an undesired humping effect. As part of the objectives of this thesis was to study the travel speed limit for humping. The findings from this research show that the travel speed limit falls within a certain region at which humping starts to occur. One of the objectives of this thesis was to study the effect of lubricants during sequential and non-sequential machining/deposition of the WAAM parts.

The milling process {{was conducted in}} a planetary ball milling using stainless steel vials (225 mL) and balls (19 mm diameter), rotary speed of 300 rpm, and a ball-to-powder weight ratio of 10 : 1. Hot pressing of mechanically alloyed Ti-Nb-Si-B powders was performed under vacuum at 1100 oC for 1 h. The as-milled and hot-pressed Ti-Nb-Si-B samples were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry. XRD results of milled Ti-Nb-Si-B powders indicated that the peaks of Nb and Si were reduced for longer milling times, suggesting that Nb and Si atoms were dissolved into the Ti lattice to form extended <b>solid</b> solutions. Iron <b>contamination</b> close to 6 at % was detected by EDS analysis. Hot pressing produced dense and homogeneous samples containing {{a small amount of}} Ti 6 Si 2 B...|$|R
