5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
25|$|On November 27, 1945, Johnson finally <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{ring with}} Joe Jeanette. The 67-year-old Johnson squared off against the 66-year-old Jeanette in an {{exhibition}} held at a New York City rally to sell war bonds. Fellow former colored heavyweight champ Harry Wills also participated in the exhibition.|$|E
25|$|WWF {{eventually}} surpassed its arch-rival WCW. With {{its business}} steadily declining and a corporate takeover of {{its parent company}} (Time Warner) by America Online, WCW was put up for sale and purchased by Vince McMahon in 2001, once again making WWF the single-largest wrestling company in North America. Bret Hart's entry into WCW had been hailed {{at the time as}} a major coup for the company, but it subsequently failed to utilize his popular appeal. Hart's active wrestling career ended in 2000 after he suffered a serious concussion during a match with Goldberg. After dropping the WWF title to Austin at WrestleMania XIV in 1998, Michaels was forced into retirement for four years due to a serious back injury. After a long period of rehabilitation, Michaels returned to the ring in 2002, and eventually retired for good in 2010 at Wrestlemania 26, losing a Streak vs. Career match to The Undertaker in the show's final match of the night. Michaels has occasionally reappeared for skits on WWE programming since, but has not <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ring as a competitor.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Stepping</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{apartment}} {{he seized}} a leathern thong that depended from the ceiling.
