5000|$|The pulleys on the jackshafts of mills {{or power}} plants were {{frequently}} {{connected to the}} shaft with clutches. For example, in the 1890s, the generating room of the Virginia Hotel in Chicago had two Corliss engines and five dynamos, linked through a jackshaft. Clutches on the jackshaft pulleys allowed {{any or all of}} the dynamos to be driven by either or both of the engines. [...] With the advent of chain-drive vehicles, the term jackshaft was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a chain driven <b>shaft</b> driving <b>pinions</b> that directly engaged teeth {{on the inside of the}} rims of the drive wheels, or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.|$|R
50|$|Most {{front-wheel-drive}} transmissions for {{transverse engine}} mounting are designed differently. For one thing, {{they have an}} integral final drive and differential. For another, they usually have only two shafts; input and countershaft, sometimes called input and output.

At {{the end of the second}} (counter/output) <b>shaft</b> is a <b>pinion</b> gear that mates with the ring gear on the differential.|$|R
50|$|The manual {{transmission}} uses a true gear type viscous limited slip center differential.

50|$|The first {{design was}} {{produced}} from 1973 to 1984. The first design remained unchanged until 1986.

One change {{that occurred in the}} second design was that on some models the brake drum could be removed without having to remove the hub and axle <b>shaft.</b> Additionally, the <b>pinion</b> received a larger diameter bearing while the pinion stayed the same diameter, which increased the durability of the pinion.

5000|$|Jaguar {{first used}} the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type {{as well as}} other models. It was used through 1996 (Jaguar IRS Article). There are some {{differences}} in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" [...] Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model {{through the use of a}} special installation kit which includes special shouldered bolts to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jag IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears a slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500 hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 131 - 144 For {{more than}} 40 years, {{integrally}} geared centrifugal compressors {{have been in}} use worldwide, in the plant air sector first, and increasingly in the process industry. Apart from reliability, efficiency and operating range, the most striking features of this compressor concept, particular when used in the process industry, are the versatility and configurability of the machine. Today, all sorts of process gases, including toxic and flammable ones, can be compressed or expanded using integrally geared centrifugal compressor and expander units. The high level of modular construction employed in integrally geared turbomachines (IGTMs) allows for {{a high degree of}} standardization; the resulting building block system makes it possible to adapt the machine concept to each field of application and, in particular, to the customer's own requirements. Of prime importance here are the definition and geometry of the interfaces between the individual modules and equipment units, such as compressor and expansion stages, gear case, <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts,</b> seal systems, etc. The integrally geared centrifugal compressor has conquered many ranges of application in the process industry starting with compressors operated purely on air, followed by nitrogen and then carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, chlorine, hydrocarbons, acetylenexide, and isobutyric aldehyde, and so forth. A recent success involving the compressing of high purity oxygen to high discharge pressures using integrally geared centrifugal compressors deserves special mention. It had been thought that this could only be achieved using single shaft compressors. This means that for oxygen, too, the advantages of integrally geared centrifugal compressors such as efficiency and very broad operating ranges can be used, {{as in the case of}} variable oxygen supply systems (varox) in air separation plants. Energy recovery in the process industry has presented integrally geared centrifugal compressors with a new task. Tail gases often have high energy contents which can be returned directly to a compression process in the same machine through addition of expander stages. In its original concept, the integrally geared centrifugal compressor is primarily suitable for the use of low-speed drive units. By using "free" <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> extensions or additional <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts,</b> high speed drive units without an external intermediate gear can also be used. This aspect, together with the integration of expander stages already mentioned, leads to a very interesting and economical application of integrally geared centrifugal compressors: alongside compression and expansion functions, IGTMs can be used for mechanical output power distribution in sophisticated process equipment such as dimethylterephthalate (DMT) and pure terephthalic acid (PTA systems) ...|$|R
