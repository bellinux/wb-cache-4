In addition, the AMF imposes very few administrative sanctions (reprimand or warning). Despite the increase in the maximum fines that may be imposed by the AMF, the set fines by the Enforcement Committee are very weak relative to the volume of the Paris market, to the total assets under management and to the volume of transactions on the Paris stock exchange.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between private transnational regulation through standards {{and the formation of}} transnational networks. More particularly, focusing on standards compliance, the analysis is intended to test whether private regulation induces the existence of networks able to: (a) enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of compliance coordination in accordance with a “whole-chain supply approach” to safety regulation; (b) contribute to monitoring along the chain, even when this function is in different ways performed by other players (public authorities, independent certifiers, etc.); (c) possibly and eventually redistribute costs of compliance along the chain. Starting from the observation of contractual practices, mainly within supply chains subject to international certification schemes (for example in the case of food supply chains), different models of networks will be compared depending on: (i) the allocation of monitoring and <b>sanctioning</b> <b>powers</b> (these being assigned to producers, traders or independent actors); (ii) the means of monitoring (peer monitoring v. more formalised monitoring duties); (iii) the types of sanctions (particularly, label/certificate suspension or revocation); (iv) the structure of the network (as based on merely linked contracts or on a mix of contractual and organizational relations) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between United Nations sanctions {{and the rule of}} law. Its primary contention is that sanctions have been applied {{in such a way that}} they have undermined the rule of law, thus weakening the authority and legitimacy of the U. N. Security Council and the U. N. sanctions system. As a consequence, States are less likely to comply with their sanctions obligations to the extent necessary to ensure that sanctions are effective. The challenge is therefore how to modify the Security Council's sanctions practice so that sanctions command such respect and inspire such confidence that States both desire and feel compelled to implement sanctions fully and effectively. The thesis proceeds in four Parts. Part I sets the stage for analysis, introducing U. N. sanctions and proposing a basic accountability-based model of the rule of law, according to which the central aim of the rule of law is to prevent the abuse of power. Part II explores the origins of the Security Council's <b>sanctions</b> <b>powers,</b> tracing the path leading to the enshrinement of the Security Council's <b>sanctions</b> <b>powers</b> in the U. N. Charter and describing the legal basis for the application of sanctions. Part III illustrates how the Security Council has acted upon its <b>sanctions</b> <b>powers</b> in practice, charting the manner in which the Council's sanctions-related decisions have shaped the contours of the U. N. sanctions system. Part IV then operationalises the theoretical framework for analysis developed in Part I, critically evaluating the extent to which sanctions have strengthened the rule of law. It concludes that the U. N. sanctions system exhibits shortcomings in respect of each of the key elements of the rule of law and makes proposals for reforming the Security Council's sanctions practice so that sanctions can strengthen, rather than undermine, the rule of law...|$|R

40|$|Social sanctioning {{is widely}} {{considered}} a successful strategy to promote cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision. Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed with <b>sanctioning</b> <b>powers,</b> conditional cooperators can discipline defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However, extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single monitor, and we experimentally manipulated {{the process by which}} the monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1, 543 Ugandan farmers from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies, cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy...|$|E

Yet the effort is worthwhile, even if a country has {{had a history of}} 'false dawns' in this policy field. This article introduces the new competition regime in the Philippines.

40|$|Catchphrase The Dutch Schools Inspectorate has {{a certain}} {{perspective}} {{on the quality of}} education. This perspective leads towards a different agenda setting on quality improvement issues of the school, sometimes through a change of attitude of school management. Not included in the research is influence of the <b>sanctioning</b> <b>powers</b> of the Schools Inspectorate Summary The (Dutch) Schools Inspectorate evaluates schools by checking them on the quality of education. School management do influence the quality of the given education. This empirical study focuses on schools for children with special educational needs, more precise in an age of 12 - 19 years old and having autism. The way the School Inspectorate inspects the schools has changed some years ago {{and the quality of the}} given education has improved significantly since then. For that reason influence can supposed of the evaluations of the schools by the Schools Inspectorate. This study examines the influence of new information on the attitude of the school management. A positive attitude, which expresses itselves in commitment, leads to another agenda setting. On the relative influence of the different contact moments of the Schools Inspectorate with the schools has not been published a lot, so this is still an open issue. The main question of this study is therefore: To which extent does elaboration of new information, coming from the evaluation of the school by School Inspectorate, lead to an attitude change of the school management and thus leading to a different agenda setting, stressing quality improvement and which contact moment has most influence? The mechanism that is examined in this study was extracted from conceptual framework of Mark and Henry that describes mechanisms via which influences of evaluations might work. The mechanism is being empirically studied by using a multiple case study of seven equivalent school for children of 12 - 19 years with special educational needs within the Randstad, a cluster of cities in the west of The Netherlands. Triangulation was applied by interviewing school directors, using a survey for the middle management and studying relevant documents. New information means mostly the use of a new perspective of already known facts. This new perspective is being processed cognitively by discussing it with other people. The attitude of the school leader might change after having elaborated the new perspective, though this is not always demonstrated. The implementation of newly developed policy setting on quality improvement plans is preferably scheduled for a new school year. The visit of the School Inspector with the final discussion is, together with his written report, influencing the attitude of the school leader as well as the policy setting for quality improvement plans. The visit with the final discussion, together with the written report is being used to formulate a list of actions. The study recommends to go into discussion with the School Inspector, prior to his visit. This is because discussing new perspectives, influences attitudes the most. Furthermore, the Schools Inspectorate might already announce new perspectives so they can be elaborated. Most ideal is to include the middle management into the discussions, because they have to implement new policies. Clearly described school identity can be implemented in a planned way and thus information that deviate from the used perspective can easily be recognized and assimilated within the organization when needed. Due to its scope the study has a restricted validity and reliability. It is recommended that the mechanism from the conceptual framework of Mark and Henry be studied in another setting. The <b>sanctioning</b> <b>powers</b> of the School Inspectorate can lead to another explanation of the reasons for a change in policy setting, whether or not through a school leader attitude change. Hence this mechanism was not studied, it could be a rival explanation for the found results...|$|E

40|$|The study {{concludes that}} the Chief Executive's dual {{accountability}} need not be an impossible mission, either from a theoretical or an empirical perspective. That said, the practice of dual accountability {{must take into account}} the significance of the liberal notion of accountability that has emerged in Hong Kong. Despite the possibility of further demarcating its functions and roles, the smooth functioning of the office of the Chief Executive depends on the willingness and the ability to negotiate solutions between the contending parties. It also depends on the participants to internalize the values in both responsiveness and responsibility. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) This dissertation examines the dual accountability of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the People's Republic of China. As stipulated in Article 43 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Chief Executive "shall be accountable to the Central People's Government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [...] " The Basic Law, thus, creates a situation where one agent serves two principals, while raising a theoretical question for the liberal notion of political accountability. With its emphasis on sanction as the indispensable tool for reinforcing responsiveness, the liberal notion of political accountability implies that one agent cannot possibly serve two principals, unless the two principals seek identical goals and conceptualize the role of agent in the same way, and exercise <b>sanctioning</b> <b>powers</b> with full agreement. The dual accountability experiment hence puts the logic and limits of the liberal accountability theory to the test. This study begins with the assumption that the Chief Executive's dual accountability is an impossible mission, as liberal accountability theory would imply. In searching for a remedy, different connotations and models of accountability are examined, the politico-legal framework of the office of the Chief Executive is reviewed and the dynamics among the competing, players [...] -the people in the Hong Kong SAR and the Central People's Government as the principals, and the Chief Executive as the agent [...] -are analyzed. The possibilities of the construct are then evaluated and remedies to it deliberated. Poon Kit. "August 2005. "Adviser: Kuan Hsin-chi.

The authors study this issue by looking at the development of the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market in France, Germany, and the Netherlands from 1999 to 2009. In all three countries, this market involved financial innovations designed to evade regulations.

African leaders promised to stop genocide with the calculation that no one with <b>sanctioning</b> <b>power</b> would challenge them. Burden shifting by the United States and other major powers was such that African leaders expected to be rewarded with increased aid flows. A combination of African nationalism and aid dependence trumped a highly needed international public good—the political will and military capability to stop genocide...|$|R
