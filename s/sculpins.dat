5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, <b>sculpins,</b> flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, <b>sculpins,</b> cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{species of}} fish inhabit Messers Run. These include a highly {{substantial}} population of brook trout. Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, there are two {{species of fish}} inhabiting the stream: brook trout, eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three species of fish inhabit the stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook trout, brown trout, and blacknose dace. Six species of fish inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook trout, blacknose dace, tessellated darters, brown trout, white suckers, and <b>sculpins.</b> However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E

5|$|As {{marine mammal}} species often play {{a large part}} in their ecosystems, it is {{possible}} that the sea mink was an important intertidal predator. It may have had a similar diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the waves. Remains of toad <b>sculpins</b> and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, {{it is possible that}} they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in <b>sculpins,</b> sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E

500|$|This alcid {{typically}} fed in shoaling {{waters that}} were shallower than those frequented by other alcids, although after the breeding season, {{they had been}} sighted as far as [...] from land. They {{are believed to have}} fed cooperatively in flocks. Their main food was fish, usually [...] in length and weighing , but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird's own length. Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favoured prey. Other fish suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn <b>sculpins,</b> cod, sand lance, as well as crustaceans. The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adults.|$|E
500|$|Cutthroat trout are {{opportunistic}} feeders. Stream-resident {{cutthroat trout}} primarily feed on larval, pupal and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically caddisflies, stoneflies, mayflies and aquatic dipterans), and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that {{fall into the}} water, fish eggs, small fish, along with crayfish, shrimp and other crustaceans. As they grow the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. In saltwater estuaries and along beaches, Coastal cutthroat trout feed on small fish such as <b>sculpins,</b> sand lance, salmon fry and herring. They also consume shrimp, small squid and krill. In fresh water they consume the same diet as stream resident troutaquatic insects and crustaceans, amphibians, earthworms, small fish and fish eggs.

500|$|During the day, the thornback {{guitarfish}} {{spends much}} time partially buried in sediment. It may be encountered singly, in small groups, or in large aggregations that form seasonally in particular bays and sloughs. The diet of this ray consists of polychaete worms, crustaceans (including crabs, shrimps, and isopods), squids, and small bony fishes (including anchovies, sardines, gobies, <b>sculpins,</b> and surfperches). It can detect prey with its electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini, which are most sensitive to electric fields with a frequency of 5â€“15 Hz. In turn, the thornback guitarfish is preyed upon by sharks {{and the northern}} elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Echinobothrium californiense and the nematode Proleptus acutus. Thornback guitarfish mate in late summer, and females give birth the following year at around the same time, peaking in August. It is aplacental viviparous, with developing embryos sustained until birth by yolk.|$|E
500|$|The {{marine waters}} around the {{province}} are considered boreal, or sub-Arctic, in nature. [...] A {{great deal of}} the coastline is rock-strewn, allowing an extensive variety of plant and animal life to thrive. The leading plants of the shoreline are the large brown seaweeds, such as bladder, forked and knotted Wracks, and winged and sugar kelps, though there are also a number of red and green seaweeds present. Common animals of the seashore region include barnacles, [...] tortoiseshell limpet, common periwinkle, blue mussels, sea anemones, sea slugs, sea urchins, starfish, and rock crabs. The deeper waters are home to a variety of fish, such as Atlantic cod, <b>sculpins</b> and cunners, halibut, haddock, sharks, and marine mammals, such as dolphins, porpoises, and whales. Whales seen off Newfoundland include Pilot whales, minkes, sei whales, fin whales and humpbacks. Harp and hooded seals are usually found in the spring, giving birth to their young on coastal ice floes.|$|E
500|$|Over 200 {{species of}} animals inhabit {{the river and}} its tributaries. Birds such as loons, grebes, ducks, kingfishers, and bald eagles are known to live around streams and {{other regions of the}} watershed. Auks, gulls, and terns have been spotted around the river's mouth, and black-legged kittiwakes nest in the area during the winter. The {{wildlife}} in the Kalmiopsis region of the Chetco watershed is more diverse than that of any other region in Oregon. Mammals such as American black bears, black-tailed deer, bobcats, ring-tailed cats, and gray foxes are common inhabitants of this region. The rare Siskiyou chipmunk is endemic to the Klamath Mountains. Steelhead and chinook and coho salmon are the most common anadromous fish that inhabit the Chetco River. Steelhead are abundant and have been spotted in most major and minor streams. Chinook salmon usually travel as far as Boulder Creek, about halfway between the Chetco's headwaters and its mouth. Coho also generally stay in this area, but some have been found in the Granite and Carter Creek area, about [...] above Boulder Creek. Coastal cutthroat trout can be found all around the watershed; some migrate to the ocean, while others live in the river and its tributaries year round.

500|$|River otters consume an {{extensive}} assortment of fish species {{ranging in size}} from [...] that impart sufficient caloric intake for a minute amount of energy expenditure. River otters generally feed on prey that is in larger supply and easier to catch. As a result, slow-swimming fish are consumed more often than game fishes when both are equally available. Slow-moving species include suckers (Catostomidae), catfish, sunfish and bass (Centrarchidae); and daces, carp, and shiners (Cyprinidae). For instance, Catostomidae are the primary dietary component of river otters in Colorado's Upper Colorado River Basin. Likewise, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a preferred fish species for the otter in other regions of Colorado. Fish species frequently found in the diets of the North American river otters include: Catostomidae, which consists of suckers (Catostomus spp.) and redhorses (Moxostoma spp.); Cyprinidae, made up of carp (Cyprinus spp.), chubs (Semotilus spp.), daces (Rhinichthys spp.), shiners (Notropis and Richardsonius spp.), and squawfishes (Ptychocheilus spp.); and Ictaluridae, which consists of bullheads and catfish (Ictalurus spp.). Other fish {{an integral part of the}} river otters' diets are those that are often plentiful and found in large schools: sunfish (Lepomis spp.); darters (Etheostoma spp.); and perches (Perca spp.). Bottom-dwelling species, which have the tendency to remain immobile until a predator is very close, are susceptible to river otters. These include mudminnows (Umbra limi) and <b>sculpins</b> (Cottus spp.). Game fish, such as trout (Salmonidae) and pike (Esocidae), are not a significant component of their diets. They are less likely to be prey for the North American river otters since they are fast-swimming and can find good escape cover. However, river otters will prey on trout, pike, walleye (Sander vitreus vitreus), salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and other game fish during spawning.|$|E
