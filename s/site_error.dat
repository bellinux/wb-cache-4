The non-linear growth and decay of thunderstorms and their accompanying cloud-to-ground lightning activity is described by the three parameter logistic growth model.

40|$|Lightning {{location}} network (LLN) with DF/TOA (direction-finder/time-of-arrival) combined {{technique has}} been widely used in the world. However, {{the accuracy of the}} lightning data from such LLNs has still been restricted by “site error”, especially for those detected only by two DF/TOA sensors. In this paper we practice a statistical approach for evaluation and correction of “site error” for DF/TOA type LLN based on its lightning data. By comparing lightning locations recorded by at least 4 sensors between DF and TOA techniques, the spatial characteristics of “site error” for each sensor in the network can be obtained. The obtained “site error” then can be used to improve the accuracy of lightning locations especially those recorded by only 2 sensors. With this approach, the “site error” patterns for 23 sensors in Yunnan LLN are obtained. The features of these <b>site</b> <b>error</b> patterns are in good consistency with those in literature. Significant differences in lightning locations before and after “site error” corrections indicate that the proposed approach works effectively. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

S. and Brazilian participants from NASA, INPE, INMET, and various universities. The network utilizes ALDF IMPACT (Improved Accuracy from Combined Technology) sensors to provide cloud-to-ground lightning observations (i. e., stroke/flash locations, signal amplitude, and polarity) using both time-of- arrival and magnetic direction finding techniques. The observations are collected, processed and archived at a central site in Brasilia and at the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Initial, non-quality assured quick-look results are made available in near real-time over the Internet. The network, which is still operational, was deployed to provide ground truth data for the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite that was launched in November 1997. The measurements are also being used to investigate the relationship between the electrical, microphysical and kinematic properties of tropical convection. In addition, the long-time series observations produced by this network will help establish a regional lightning climatological database, supplementing other databases in Brazil that already exist or may soon be implemented. Analytic inversion algorithms developed at the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center have been applied to the Rondonian ALDF lightning observations to obtain <b>site</b> <b>error</b> corrections and improved location retrievals.

The method is utilized to combine radial velocity from HF Radar and u and v component of velocity from Global Copernicus - Marine environment monitoring service (CMEMS) model. The initial ensemble {{is based on the}} time variability of the CMEMS model result. Data tested are from 2 CODAR Seasonde radar sites in Sunda Strait and 2 dates such as 09 September 2013 and 08 February 2016 at 12. 00 UTC. The radial HF Radar data has a hourly temporal resolution, 20 - 60 km of spatial range, 3 km of range resolution, 5 degree of angular resolution and spatial resolution and 11. 5 - 14 MHz of frequency range. The u and v component of the model velocity represents a daily mean with 1 / 12 degree spatial resolution. The radial data from one HF radar site is analyzed and the result compared to the equivalent radial velocity from CMEMS for the second HF radar <b>site.</b> <b>Error</b> checking is calculated by root mean squared error (RMSE). Calculation of ensemble analysis and ensemble mean is using Sangoma software package. The tested R which represents observation error covariance matrix, is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal 0. 05, 0. 5 or 1. 0 m 2 /s 2. The initial ensemble members comes from a model simulation spanning a month (September 2013 or February 2016), one year (2013) or 4 years (2013 - 2016). The spatial distribution of the radial current are analyzed and the RMSE values obtained from independent HF radar station are optimized. It was verified that the analysis reproduces well the structure included in the analyzed HF radar data. More importantly, the analysis was also improved relative to the second independent HF radar site. RMSE of the improved analysis is better than first HF Radar site Analysis.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 71 - 72). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Texas A&M IMProved Accuracy from Combined Technology (IMPACT) lightning detector has been analyzed for 1997 and 1998 - 99 to determine detection characteristics. These characteristics include stroke detection efficiency as a function of range and azimuth, site errors, signal strength, attenuation coefficient, and peak current. Cloud-to-ground (CG) return stroke measurements from the IMPACT detector were compared to National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) measurements to determine these detection characteristics. Because the IMPACT detector's sensitivity was increased in 1998, was determined that a higher stroke detection efficiency occurred in 1998 - 99. The IMPACT sensor's signal strength amplitudes were also affected by the increased sensitivity. The sensor's range-normalized signal strengths (RNSS) were 1. 6 times higher in 1998 - 99 than in 1997. These were corrected using a calibration factor determined statistically from IMPACT and NLDN RNSS values. Results from peak current analyses show that the increased sensitivity caused a higher percentage of weak signals to be detected. Electromagnetic Gelds from CG lightning channels are attenuated with distance. Attenuation coefficients are a function of geographical area. A coefficient of 1. 14 was determined for the area 1000 km within the IMPACT detector location. A <b>site</b> <b>error</b> correction curve was used to correct for azimuthal errors in bearings to CG stroke locations. Errors were reduced to less than 4 ? in most cases. The IMPACT detector uses a crossed-loop magnetic field antenna to determine stroke location bearings and magnetic field amplitudes. Analyzing sisal strengths revealed that strokes in the north-south direction had amplitudes approximately 20 % higher than strokes in the east-west direction. This {{is a result of the}} north-south loop of the antenna being more sensitive than the east-west loop. This condition also affected the detection efficiency of the IMPACT sensor as a function of range. Efficiency minima in the north and south directions predicted by theory are not present...|$|E

The accuracy of the TanDEM-X iDEM in UK was obtained as follows: against ICESat GLA 14 elevation data, TanDEM-X iDEM has − 0. 028 ± 3. 654  m over England and Wales and 0. 316  ±  5. 286  m over Scotland for 12  m, − 0. 073  ±  6. 575  m for 30  m, and 0. 0225  ±  9. 251  m at 90  m.
