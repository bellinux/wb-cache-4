50|$|Stoneleigh House, in High Street, was {{formerly}} {{the premises of}} parchment makers. Springs were fed under the house into ponds which were used for <b>soaking</b> and <b>cleaning</b> the skins. Remnants of the drying sheds and other buildings still exist at the rear.|$|R
30|$|The two {{reusable}} scopes required decontamination {{after each}} use. There were two decontamination procedures, {{depending on the}} type of scope and the duration between uses, according to the national guidelines of the Health General Direction. Decontamination procedures were manual, because no mechanical washer disinfector was available in our hospital. If a scope was used in the previous 7  days, a two-part 60 -min incomplete decontamination procedure was performed: 20  min before use (including preparation, one <b>soak,</b> and <b>cleaning)</b> and 40  min after use (<b>cleaning,</b> three <b>soaks</b> with <b>cleaning,</b> drying, and storage). In other cases, a complete procedure of 75  min (35  min before use and 40  min after use) was performed. In case of damage, the reusable scope was sent to the manufacturer and no other scope replaced it.|$|R
50|$|Before sowing, certain seeds first {{require a}} {{treatment}} {{prior to the}} sowing process.This treatment may be seed scarification, stratification, seed <b>soaking</b> or seed <b>cleaning</b> with cold (or medium hot) water.|$|R
30|$|CdS QDs were {{deposited}} on the DTTO and CuInS 2 /DTTO electrodes by CBD method. The precursors are a 50  mM Na 2 S aqueous solution and a 50  mM CdCl 2 aqueous solution. The electrode was first dipped into 50  mM Na 2 S aqueous solution for 1  min, and then rinsed with DI water. After that, the electrode was dipped into 50  mM CdCl 2 aqueous solution for another 1  min, and then rinsed again with DI water. Such a <b>soaking</b> and <b>cleaning</b> {{process is a}} typical CBD cycle of CdS deposition. The DTTO and CuInS 2 /DTTO electrodes after n cycles of CdS deposition are denoted as CdS(n)/DTTO and CdS(n)/CuInS 2 /DTTO, respectively.|$|R
30|$|A {{silicon wafer}} 100 (p-type, Boron-doped) was cut into 1 × 1 cm 2 pieces. The silicon {{substrates}} were cleaned as follows: <b>soaking</b> in the <b>cleaning</b> bath at 75 °C for 10 min. The cleaning solution {{was composed of}} 100 ml of 96 % NH 4 OH, 35 ml of 35 % H 2 O 2 and 65 ml deionized water. The cleaned substrates were further rinsed in deionized water for 10 min and finally deposited by horizontal precipitation Langmuir-Blodgett (HP-LB) method [31].|$|R
40|$|Control Center (PCC) {{regarding}} any {{reports of}} illness {{in the state}} caused {{by the use of}} recreational designer drugs sold as “bath salts. ” Unlike traditional cosmetic bath salts, which are packaged and sold for adding to bath water for <b>soaking</b> and <b>cleaning,</b> the drugs sold as “bath salts ” have no legitimate use for bathing and are intended for substance abuse. These products can contain stimulant compounds such as 3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) or 4 -methylmethcathinone (mephedrone). The PCC told MDCH that, earlier in the day, the PCC had learned that numerous persons had visited the local emergency department (ED) in Marquette County with cardiovascular and neurologic signs of acute intoxication. This report summarizes the subsequent investigation, which identified 35 persons who had ingested, inhaled, or injected “bath salts ” and visited a Michigan ED during November 13...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} part describes the malting process, {{which includes a}} receiving and grain <b>cleaning,</b> <b>soaking</b> grain, germination and kilning. They describe the basic types of malts. The next section describes the brewing industry, which involves the production of wort, spent grains and subsequent production of beer. The latest focus of work is pri-marily the use of brewery-spent grains which created {{in the production of}} wort. Work, in addition to literature review also includes a practical part, which focuses on the addi-tion of spent grains into baked goods and fresh both in form and in dried...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cleaning,</b> <b>soaking</b> and wetting are {{the three}} most common objetives listed on the labels of rigid lens care solutions. Debate however, still {{persists}} over wether combinations solutions (aimed at doing two or more simultaneously) are really just care step compromises, versus whether single purpose solutions (the purist apprach) are truly worth the compliance risks that multiple steps can invite. While the patient clearly represents the least predictable variable {{in the use of}} such solutions, products through their distinctive formulation philosophies can represent, as well markedly different approaches to the same problem, or intended mission. Our purpose here is {{to look at some of}} the differences which are not commonly listed on labels, among sveral products intended for rigid lens care...|$|R
40|$|Processing of {{parboiled}} rice consists of paddy <b>cleaning,</b> <b>soaking,</b> steaming, drying, and milling. Parboiled process of paddy {{is intended to}} increase the milling yield, to prevent nutrition losses and to decrease glychemic index. The purpose {{of this research is}} (1) To assess the impact of soaking time on the physical and chemical quality of parboiling rice, (2) To determine the optimum soaking time for parboiling rice and it’s impact on rice quality. This research is using IR 64 variant with soaking duration treatment about 4, 6, and 8 hours. The result showed that parboiled process increase the milling yield and reduce the rice amylose content. Gelatinization profile of the {{parboiled rice}} showed that the longer of soaking duration increase the trough viscosity, final viscosity, peak time viscosity, and pasting temperatures and also decreased the peak viscosity, breakdown viscosity, and setback viscosity. The treatment of soaking duration did not significantly affect the chemical contents of parboiled rice. The exposure time of paddy soaking that suggested is 4 hours in dip water at temperature of 60 oC...|$|R
40|$|Conservation treatments, while {{focused on}} {{preserving}} the physical {{form of a}} ceramic vessel, may inadvertently {{have a negative impact}} on other information stored in preserved organic residues that may remain on or in the object. This research investigates the effect of common conservation treatments on the preservation of organic residues in order to better understand how conservation treatments commonly used in the field and laboratory can affect the integrity of organic residues in archaeological ceramic sherds. Olive oil, an organic residue that is frequently found in the archaeological record of the Near East, was applied in an experimental setting to the surface of archaeological ceramic sherds. The sherds then underwent various conservation treatments, such as mechanical <b>cleaning,</b> <b>soaking</b> in water over various periods of time, and acid cleaning. Residue retention was quantified by organic extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The results suggest that increasing the soaking time of a sherd in water decreases the amount of residue retained, and the addition of mechanical cleaning further reduces residue retention. The data gathered from this study can assist in predicting the condition of organic residues on ceramics based on previous conservation treatments and shed light on the integrity of organic residues on previously conserved objects.
