2500|$|The third, and {{practically}} most important strategy for creditor protection, was {{to require that}} dividends and other returns to shareholders could only be made, generally speaking, if a company had profits. The concept of [...] "profit" [...] is defined by law as having assets above the amount that shareholders, who initially bought shares from the company, contributed {{in return for their}} shares. For example, a company could launch its business with 1000 shares (for public companies, called an [...] "IPO" [...] or initial public offering) each with a nominal value of 1 penny, and an issue price of £1. Shareholders would buy the £1 shares, and if all are sold, £1000 would become the company's [...] "legal capital". Profits are whatever the company makes on top of that £1000, though as a company continues to trade, the market price of shares could well be going up to £2 or £10, or indeed fall to 50 pence or some other number. The Companies Act 2006 states in section 830 that dividends, or any other kind of distribution, can only be given out from <b>surplus</b> <b>profits</b> beyond the legal capital. It is generally the decision of the board of directors, affirmed by a shareholder resolution, whether to declare a dividend or perhaps simply retain the earnings and invest them back into the business to grow and expand. The calculation of companies' assets and liabilities, losses and profits, will follow the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the UK, but this is not an objective, scientific process: a variety of different accounting methods can be used which can lead to different assessments of when a profit exists. The prohibition on falling below the legal capital applies to [...] "distributions" [...] in any form, and so [...] "disguised" [...] distributions are also caught. This has been held to include, for example, an unwarranted salary payment to a director's wife when she had not worked, and a transfer of a property within a company group at half its market value. A general principle, however, recently expounded in Progress Property Co Ltd v Moorgarth Group Ltd is that if a transaction is negotiated in good faith and at arm's length, then it may not be unwound, and this is apparently so even if it means that creditors have been [...] "ripped off". If distributions are made without meeting the law's criteria, then a company has a claim to recover the money from any recipients. They are liable as constructive trustees, which probably mirrors the general principles of any action in unjust enrichment. This means that liability is probably strict, subject to a change of position defence, and the rules of tracing will apply if assets wrongfully paid out of the company have been passed on. For example, in It’s A Wrap (UK) Ltd v Gula the directors of a bankrupt company argued that they had been unaware that dividend payments they paid themselves were unlawful (as there had not in fact been profits) because their tax advisers had said it was okay. The Court of Appeal held that ignorance of the law was not a defence. A contravention existed so long as one ought to have known of the facts that show a dividend would contravene the law. Directors can similarly be liable for breach of duty, and so to restore the money wrongfully paid away, if they failed to take reasonable care.|$|E
6000|$|... 5. At present you--every one of you--speak, and act, as {{if there}} were only one alternative; namely, between a system in which profits shall be divided in due {{proportion}} among all; and the present one, in which the workman is paid the least wages he will take, under the pressure of competition in the labor-market. But an intermediate method is conceivable; a method which appears to me more prudent, and in its ultimate results more just, than the co-operative one. An arrangement may be supposed, and I have good hope also may one day be effected, by which every subordinate shall be paid sufficient and regular wages, according to his rank; by which due provision shall be made out of the profits of the business for sick and superannuated workers; and by which the master, being held responsible, as a minor king or governor, for the conduct as well as the comfort of all those under his rule, shall, on that condition, be permitted to retain to his own use the <b>surplus</b> <b>profits</b> of the business which the fact of his being its master may be assumed to prove that he has organized by superior intellect and energy. And I think this principle of regular wage-paying, whether it be in the abstract more just, or not, is at all events the more prudent; for this reason mainly, that {{in spite of all the}} cant which is continually talked by cruel, foolish, or designing persons about [...] "the duty of remaining content in the position in which Providence has placed you," [...] there is a root of the very deepest and holiest truth in the saying, which gives to it such power as it still retains, even uttered by unkind and unwise lips, and received into doubtful and embittered hearts.|$|E
60|$|It {{should be}} clearly {{understood}} that this constant pressure {{to extend the}} area of markets is not a necessary implication {{of all forms of}} organized industry. If competition was displaced by combinations of a genuinely cooperative character in which the whole gain of improved economies passed, either to the workers in wages, or to large bodies of investors in dividends, the expansion of demand in the home markets would be so great as to give full employment to the productive powers of concentrated capital, {{and there would be no}} self-accumulating masses of profit expressing themselves in new credit and demanding external employment. It is the ``monopoly'' profits of trusts and combines, taken either in construction, financial operation, or industrial working, that form a gathering fund of self-accumulating credit whose possession by the financial class implies a contracted demand for commodities and a correspondingly restricted employment for capital in American industries. Within certain limits relief can be found by stimulation of the export trade under cover of a high protective tariff which forbids all interference with monopoly of the home markets. But it is extremely difficult for trusts adapted to the requirements of a profitable tied market at home to adjust their methods of free competition in the world markets upon a profitable basis of steady trading. Moreover, such a mode of expansion is only appropriate to certain manufacturing trusts: the owners of railroad, financial and other trusts must look always more to foreign investments for their <b>surplus</b> <b>profits.</b> This ever-growing need for fresh fields of investment for their profits is the great crux of the financial system, and threatens to dominate the future economics and the politics of the great Republic.|$|E

60|$|In {{all this}} time the true state of the several Presidencies, and the real conduct of the British {{government}} towards the natives, {{was not at all}} known to Parliament: it seems to have been very imperfectly known even to ministers. Indeed, it required an unbroken attention, and much comparison of facts and reasonings, to form a true judgment on that difficult and complicated system of politics, revenue, and commerce, whilst affairs were only in their progress to that state which produced the present inquiries. Therefore, whilst the causes of their ruin were in the height of their operation, both the Company and the natives were understood by the public as in circumstances the most assured and most flourishing; insomuch that, whenever the affairs of India were brought before Parliament, as they were two or three times during that period, the only subject-matter of discussion anywise important was concerning the sums which might be taken out of the Company's <b>surplus</b> <b>profits</b> for the advantage of the state. Little was thought of but the disengagement of the Company from their debts in England, and to prevent the servants abroad from drawing upon them, so as that body might be enabled, without exciting clamors here, to afford the contribution that was demanded. All descriptions of persons, either here or in India, looking solely to appearances at home, the reputation of the Directors depended on the keeping the Company's sales in a situation to support the dividend, that of the ministers depended on the most lucrative bargains for the Exchequer, and that of the servants abroad on the largest investments; until at length there is great reason to apprehend, that, unless some very substantial reform takes place in the management of the Company's affairs, nothing will be left for investment, for dividend, or for bargain, and India, instead of a resource to the public, may itself come, in no great length of time, to be reckoned amongst the public burdens.|$|E
60|$|For {{while the}} least {{fortunate}} sort of children have {{at any rate}} {{the protection of the}} police and school inspectors, and the baser sort of parent has all sorts of public and quasi-public helps and doles, the families that make the middle mass of our population are still in the position of the families of a hundred years ago, and have no help under heaven against the world. It matters not how well the home of the skilled artisan's wife or the small business man's wife has been managed--she may have educated her children marvellously, they may be clean, strong, courteous, intelligent--if the husband gets out of work or suffers from business ill-luck or trade depression, or chances to be killed uninsured, down they all go to want. Such insurance as they are able to make, and it needs a tremendously heavy premium to secure an insurance that will not mean a heavy fall of income with the bread-winner's death--must needs be in a private insurance office, and there is no effectual guarantee for either honesty or solvency in that. In most of the petty insurance business the thrifty poor are enormously overcharged and overreached. Rumour has been busy, and I fear only too justly, with the financial outlook of some of the Friendly Societies upon which the scanty security of so many working-class families depends. Such investments as the lower and middle-class father makes of <b>surplus</b> <b>profits</b> and savings must be made in ignorance of the manœuvres of the big and often quite ruthless financiers who control the world of prices. If he builds or trades, he does so as a small investor, at the highest cost and lowest profit. Half the big businesses in the world have been made out of the lost savings of the small investor; a point to which I shall return later. People talk as though Socialism proposed to rob the thrifty industrious man of his savings. He could not be more systematically robbed of his savings than he is at the present time. Nowhere beyond the limit of the Post Office Savings' Bank is there security--not even in the gilt-edged respectability of Consols, which {{in the last ten years}} have fallen from 114 to under 82. Consider the adventure of the thrifty well-meaning citizen who used his savings-bank hoard to buy Consols at the former price, and now finds himself the poorer for not having buried his savings in his garden. The middling sort of man saves for the sake of wife and child; our State not only fails to protect him from the adventures of the manipulating financier, but it deliberately avoids competition with banker, insurance agent and promoter. In no way can the middle-class or artisan parent escape the financier's power and get real security for his home or his children's upbringing.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in a Capital and Class symposium on the 1987 crash. Its analysis retains its full force in 2009. It compared the 1987 and the 1929 crash, and explored the historical similarities between the long US postwar decline and the UK’s, from the mid-nineteenth century. It situated both in a rigorous value-theoretic framework rooted in Marx’s concept of superprofit. It was the author’s first such published attempt. It combined, critically, Kondratieff’s account of long waves as developed by Ernest Mandel, with Kindleberger’s concept of hegemony. The article did not refer to the falling rate of profit, but did introduce the competitive struggle for shares of <b>surplus</b> <b>profit</b> between the advanced or imperialist powers. In distinction from Kindleberger and later Kennedy, I argued that the US hegemonised not {{the world as a}} whole but the high-productivity powers only. US leadership consisted in organising all aspects of the extraction of <b>surplus</b> <b>profit</b> from the third world, whose economic superexploitation, and political suppression, it organised on behalf of the other great powers. The three sources of this surplus or superprofit are: technical superprofit, arising from possession of superior productive techniques; financial superprofit, arising from control over financial institutions and flows; and commercial superprofit, arising from monopolistic manipulation of trade. The article compared these three sources of <b>surplus</b> <b>profit</b> to three legs of a tripod. Stable hegemonies –UK in the mid- 19 th Century, US in the mid- 20 th – rest on all three. Instability arises because these sources of <b>surplus</b> <b>profit</b> are ultimately incompatible. A country that specialises in financial and commercial advantages, above all when cemented by a world military role, does so at the cost of its technical advantage – the development of its productive forces. The US emerged from world war II dominating all three sources of <b>surplus</b> <b>profit.</b> To avoid the fratricidal competition that led to world war I, it created a division of labour between specialists in each form of <b>surplus</b> <b>profit.</b> This was however inherently self-destructive. Germany and Japan, denied all right to imperial expansion, were confined to intensive development, specialising in technical superprofit. This steadily eroded the US’s technical advantage, forcing it into ever greater dependence on its commercial, financial, and ultimately military advantages. This in turn eroded the material basis of US hegemony, namely, its ability to use its surpluses to buttress its potential rivals’ combined dominance of the third world. 1987 was a critical turning point. From then on, the US was driven to the ‘America First’ policies that led it successively into the first Gulf War, neoliberalism, ‘globalisation’, and finally the neoconservative gambit. The economic origins of this succession of detours from the US’s 2008 rendezvous with its destiny are mapped out in this article.
