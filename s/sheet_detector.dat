40|$|A {{deformable}} volume segmentation {{method is}} proposed {{to detect the}} breast parenchyma in frontal scanned 3 D whole breast ultrasound. Deformable volumes are {{a viable alternative to}} the deformable surface paradigm in noisy images with poorly defined object boundaries. A deformable ultrasound volume model was developed containing breast, rib, intercostal space and thoracic shadowing. Using prior knowledge about grey value statistics and shape the parameterized model deforms by optimization to match an ultrasound scan. Additionally a rib shadow enhancement filter was developed based on a Hessian <b>sheet</b> <b>detector.</b> An ROC chestwall detection study on 88 multi-center scans (20 non-visible chestwalls) showed a significant accuracy which improved strongly using the <b>sheet</b> <b>detector.</b> The results show the potential of our methodology to extract breast parenchyma which could help reduce false positives in subsequent computer aided lesion detection...|$|E

We demonstrate that the proposed rubber <b>sheet</b> type neutron <b>detector</b> can show a clear neutron absorption peak in the pulse height spectrum and can easily eliminate gamma-ray events with pulse height discrimination in neutron TOF experiments at the 45 MeV electron Linac facility of Hokkaido University...|$|R
40|$|In this experiment, {{layers of}} {{radiation}} detectors and biological specimens, bacterial spores (Bacillus subtillis), shrimp eggs (Altemia salina), and maize seeds (Zea mays) are sandwiched {{together in the}} Radiation Monitoring Container. The <b>detectors,</b> <b>sheets</b> of plastic materials, record the nuclear track of cosmic radiation. The dosimeter package contains conventional detectors made of materials such as lithium fluoride or magnesium-silica-terbium. The thermoluminescent materials (TLD) will, when moderately heated, emit luminescent photons linearly depending upon the dose of radiation received. The experiment, enclosed in a box-like container, is mounted on the aft end cone of the Spacelab, {{the area where the}} shielding is somewhat less than other locations...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{photofission}} on (nat) Ta, (nat) W and (nat) Pt nuclei induced by monochromatic photons of 69 MeV has been performed. The fission yields have been measured by using makrofoil <b>sheets</b> as fission-track <b>detectors,</b> in thick-target 2 pi geometry. The absolute photofission cross sections for the tantalum, tungsten and platinum targets are found, respectively, to be 4. 8 +/- 1. 0 mub, 5. 2 +/- 1. 2 mub and 10 +/- 2 mub, {{and the corresponding}} deduced fissilities are (3. 2 +/- 0. 7) x 10 (- 4), (3. 4 +/- 0. 8) x 10 (- 4) and (6. 4 +/- 1. 3) x 10 (- 4...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction and}} performance of a scintillating fiber detector used in the near detector for the K 2 K (KEK to Kamioka, KEK E 362) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. The detector uses 3. 7 m long and 0. 692 mm diameter scintillating fiber coupled to image-intensifier tubes (IIT), and a CCD camera readout system. Fiber <b>sheet</b> production and <b>detector</b> construction began in 1997, and the detector was commissioned in March, 1999. Results from the first K 2 K runs confirm good initial performance : position resolution {{is estimated to be}} about 0. 8 mm, and track finding efficiency is 98 ± 2...|$|R
40|$|Energetic ions and ultrashort X-rays were {{generated}} by an intense ultrashort laser interacting with a copper target. Fast ions up to 3 MeV were observed with CR- 39 nuclear track <b>detector</b> <b>sheets</b> when 7 TW laser was used. Cu 12 + ∼ Cu 17 + ions {{with the energy}} from 50 keV to 220 keV were detected with a Thomson parabola detector {{in the case of}} the laser power of 2. 5 TW. Time-resolved X-ray diffrac-tion was carried out using ultrashort X-rays generated from the copper target irradiated by the intense laser pulses. A change of diffraction patterns was observed in the X-ray diffraction from a GaAs(111) crystal irradiated by the ul-trashort laser pulses. ...|$|R
40|$|Data {{acquired}} {{over several}} years of proficiency and independent quality assurance testing have indicated that the apparent accuracy of the ~adtrak @ radon monitor {{may be influenced by}} the chamber in which the test exposures are conducted. These experiences suggest the existence of an unknown factor associated with the calibration chamber facility that can affect the calibration value relating (rack density to radon exposure established for alpha (rack monitors. Landauer, Inc. conducted an experiment in which ~adtrak @ radon monitors were sent simultaneously to eight calibration facilities which were instructed to expose the monitors to radon using a standard handling procedure. The monitors were manufactured from the same <b>sheet</b> of <b>detector</b> material and, except for those from two chambers, the monitors were processed and analyzed together. In this way analytical variables were minimized. The results demonstrated statistically significant differences in the apparent sensitivity of the monitors among several of the facilities. These differences are large enough to cause unacceptable biases when the monitor system is calibrated in one chamber and tested in another. The causes of the differences are not understood and could be the subject of worthwhile research for organizations interested in radon intercomparisons and calibrations...|$|R
40|$|An optical {{method and}} system sense and {{identify}} a foreign particle in a gaseous environment. A light source generates light. An electrically-conductive sheet has {{an array of}} holes formed through the sheet. Each hole has a diameter that is less than {{one quarter of the}} light's wavelength. The sheet is positioned relative to the light source such that the light is incident on one face of the <b>sheet.</b> An optical <b>detector</b> is positioned adjacent the sheet's opposing face and is spaced apart therefrom such that a gaseous environment is adapted to be disposed there between. Alterations in the light pattern detected by the optical detector indicate the presence of a foreign particle in the holes or on the sheet, while a laser induced fluorescence (LIF) signature associated with the foreign particle indicates the identity of the foreign particle...|$|R
40|$|The Heavy Ions In Space (HIIS) {{experiment}} has {{two primary}} objectives: (1) {{to measure the}} elemental composition of ultraheavy Galactic cosmic rays, beginning in the tin-barium region of the periodic table; and (2) to study heavy ions which arrive at LDEF below the geomagnetic cutoff, either {{because they are not}} fully stripped of electrons or because their source is within the magnetosphere. Both have practical as well as astrophysical consequences. The HIIS experiment used eight thick stacks of plastic track detectors mounted in two trays on the space facing end of LDEF. Since the last LDEF symposium, the statistics were increased of the observations and have extended the analysis to a second stack and to <b>detector</b> <b>sheets</b> near the top of a stack. New results are reported on the detector resolution and on the observations of both stopping and relativistic particles...|$|R
40|$|The {{linear energy}} {{transfer}} (LET) spectra of charged particles was measured in the 5 to 250 keV/micron (water) interval with CR- 39 and in the 250 to 1000 keV/micron (water) interval with polycarbonate plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) under different shielding depths in the P 0006 experiment. The optimal processing conditions were determined for both PNTDs {{in relation to the}} relatively high track densities due to the long term exposure in space. The total track density was measured over the selected samples, and tracks in coincidence on the facing surfaces of two <b>detector</b> <b>sheets</b> were selected for measuring at the same position on each sheet. The Short Range (SR) and Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) components were measured separately. The integral dose and dose rate spectra of charged particles are also given. The high LET portion of the LET spectra was measured with high statistical accuracy. This is a unique result of this experiment due to the low flux of this type of particle under typical shielding conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{documents the}} radiation environment inside Biorack and compares it to theoretical predictions. Other experiments inside Biorack need {{this information to}} determine whether changes to samples are caused by radiation or microgravity. Dosimetric stacks, each with 20 to 100 <b>sheets</b> of plastic <b>detector</b> foils (cellulose nitrate, Lexan, and CR 39) and nuclear emulsions of different radiation sensitivity are packed together with Thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) inside Type 1 containers. Crew members place two stacks in the 37 C incubator and four in the 36 C incubator, {{two of which are}} placed on the 1 g centrifuge. Two stacks are located in a stowage position at ambient temperature. After the mission, the plastic detectors are etched and the nuclear emulsions are developed similar to photographic emulsions. The traces resulting from the interaction of heavy ions with matter can then be evaluated under the microscope. The number, charge, and energy of the particles will be determined. From the TLD readings, the absorbed dose of the low LET components will be received...|$|R
40|$|For {{economical}} {{reasons it}} is desirable to apply the highest possible speed during laser welding. Increasing the welding speed at a certain laser power might result in insufficient penetration of the weld. This work describes {{the design of a}} feedback controller, which is able to maintain full penetration in mild steel <b>sheets.</b> An optical <b>detector,</b> which is placed inside the Nd:Yttrium–aluminium–garnet laser source, measures the intensity of the weld-pool radiation through the optical fiber. This sensor signal is used as input of a feedback control system. A model, which describes the dynamic response of the welding process including the sensor and laser source dynamics, has been obtained, using system identification techniques. The input of this model is the laser power and the output is the modeled sensor signal. Based on this dynamic model a feedback controller is designed and implemented. The laser power is used as an actuator. The controller maintains full penetration during welding of tracks with disturbances like sudden artificial power fluctuations and sudden speed changes. This feedback controller opens the possibility to optimize the welding speed without risking lack of penetratio...|$|R
40|$|In a push {{to reduce}} global energy consumption, it is {{necessary}} to reduce the energy needed for optical devices. In addition, there are other important issues for optical devices such as fabrication cost and miniaturization. With this point of view, in this PhD work various optical devices based on liquid crystal (LC) and nanorods (NR) are investigated and fabricated. Firstly, fabrication of thin film polarizers and color filters based on photo-polymerization of reactive LC is demonstrated. The thin film polarizer is fabricated for applications which require very small thicknesses of the final device such as electro-active contact lenses. These films are suitable to be processed in optical device manufacturing as additional films or as in-cell optical components. The third fabricated device is a widely tunable optical filter with microsecond switching time. A microsecond-range optical shutter for unpolarized light is demonstrated as a forth application using reactive LCs. On the other hand, I demonstrate full alignment of colloidal NRs in suspension by an electric field. Finally, I present four methods for the homogeneous deposition and alignment of NRs from a colloidal suspension. They may be applied in polarized emitters in OLED, polarized fluorescent <b>sheets</b> or polarization-selective <b>detectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the heavy nucleus {{collector}} (HNC) experiment was to obtain high resolution composition measurements for cosmic ray nuclei in the platinum-lead and actinide region of the periodic table. Secondary objectives include studies of selected groups of elements of lower charge. These goals were to be realized by orbiting a large area array of dielectric nuclear track detectors in space for several years. In this time sufficient actinide nuclei would be collected to determine the nucleosynthetic age of the cosmic radiation and the relative mix of r- and s-process elements in the cosmic ray source. The detector consists of approximately 50 trays assembled in pressurized canisters. Each tray would contain 8 half-stacks (4 stacks total) and an event thermometer which would record the temperature of each event {{at the time of}} exposure. Each stack would contain 7 layers of Rodyne-P, CR- 39 and Cronar plastic track detectors interleaved with copper stripping foils. Upon return to Earth, detectors would be removed for analysis. Ultraheavy nuclei would have left tracks through the <b>detector</b> <b>sheets</b> that would be made visible after etching in a hot sodium hydroxide solution...|$|R
