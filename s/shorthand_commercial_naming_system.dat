40|$|ABSTRACTThe MINUS {{system was}} {{developed}} as a minimally invasive procedure that uses a diaphyseal cephalic extramedullary implant {{for the treatment of}} transtrochanteral fractures of the femur in elderly patients. The implant consists of a sliding screw coupled to a plate adapted to the minimally invasive technique. The surgical access is approximately three centimeters in length located on the lateral surface of the hip, below the projection of the small trochanter. A perfectly adapted instrument was used for the procedure, which also requires the use of an image intensifier, reducing surgery time and rate of bleeding. The objective {{of this study is to}} present a new instrument and implant, developed specifically for treatment with the minimally invasive technique, reducing the length of the conventional surgical access from 10 to three centimetres. This new implant was given the <b>commercial</b> <b>name</b> of MINUS <b>System...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{marketing}} potential of <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> involved in the clientoriented communication and, more precisely, on the mechanisms of semantic derivation proper {{to the formation of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>names.</b> The author argues that the semantic shifts in the meaning of the original word result from its use {{as a part of a}} commercial message, i. e. for the transmission of specific marketing information. One of the current trends in contemporary Russian <b>commercial</b> <b>naming</b> is related to the actualization of the marketing content components (MCCs) ‘big’ and ‘small’ which communicate complementary information about the named object. The marketing content component ‘big’ communicates the idea of respectability, economic might, wide choice of goods. This idea is most commonly transmitted by the foreign language prefixes mega-, super-, hyper-, grand-, maxi-, macro-, big-. In <b>commercial</b> <b>naming</b> their meanings overlap, making them stereotypic means of advertising. The marketing content component ‘small’ often appears in the names of cosy cafés and restaurants, cheap shops and child care institutions. This marketing content component can be communicated by foreign language prefixes, e. g. mini-, micro-, nano-, but it is most often actualized by Russian diminutive suffixes. The analised MCCs are also transmitted by means of direct, metaphoric, metonymic and symbolic names in which it is also possible to distinguish stereotypic patterns of <b>commercial</b> <b>naming...</b>|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> having {{reference}} to the cultural space of Russia. Their connotative meaning includes a ‘Russian ethno-cultural marker’ (REM) actualized in the advertising discourse by a multi-coded text constituted by an integrated complex of semantic, stylistic, and symbolic verbal and visual signs. The article analyzes the verbal means of expression of the REM in commercial naming: lexical, semantic, and stylistic features of the names; national precedent phenomena reflected by the words designating elements of Russian spiritual and material culture; notions of Russian history; ethnonyms; culture-specific vocabulary; archaic words; precedent personal names and toponyms; Russian colloquial expressions. The author also analyzes graphic elements and models of <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> formation as supplementary REM actualizers. The article focuses on three major functions of REM-names: informational, phatic, and connotative functions, outlining their spheres of use in commercial discourse, particularly in the <b>commercial</b> <b>naming</b> of Russian state enterprises and brands and in labeling exported goods and services. The Russian ethnically marked names represent an open, dynamically developing system which can be represented as a field structure whose center is constituted by <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> including ethnonyms, culture-specific vocabulary and words designating national precedent phenomena, and the periphery by all Russian names...|$|R

40|$|Internet domains {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of our lives, so one can easily understand that during their use, conflicts can arise, whose participants will search for rules enabling resolution of conflicts. Since the domain name is a replacement of the computer IP address, in the technical sense of the word, this does not concern for domain <b>names</b> a <b>commercial</b> <b>name</b> or brand, because it primarily does not belong to a person in the legal sense of the word and does not serve for its individualization. The average user regularly affiliates domain names with a person offering goods or services on the relevant Website. Domain names used by entrepreneurs in their business activity are often chosen so that the second-level domain (SLD) would use words that form the trade name of corporations formed of trading companies. This fact brings domain names close to such designations that serve the individualization of persons or products, especially the trademarks and the <b>commercial</b> <b>name.</b> Domains can come into conflict with the rights to designations, especially trademarks and <b>commercial</b> <b>names.</b> Court practice is resolving these conflicts using rules for unfair competition, or rules for protection of <b>commercial</b> <b>names</b> and trademarks, but it is not ruled out that in the future, special legal regulation of domain names could be established...|$|R
