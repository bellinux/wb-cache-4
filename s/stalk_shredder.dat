40|$|The {{main object}} {{of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of tillage and crop residues management of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) on quantification and qualification yield of corn (Zea mays L.). Treatments were laid out in complete randomized block design with seven treatments and three replications and include (1) fire of straw and stubble, plow, disc and furrower (2) gathering and transfer of straw and stubble out of farm, plow, disc and furrower, (3) Plow, disc and furrower (4) <b>Stalk</b> <b>shredder,</b> plow, disc and furrower, (5) <b>Stalk</b> <b>shredder,</b> plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea and furrower (6) <b>Stalk</b> <b>shredder,</b> plow, disc, 100 kg. ha- 1 urea and furrower, (7) <b>Stalk</b> <b>shredder,</b> plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and furrower. The results showed that treatments had significant effect on nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous and protein of leaf, diameter and height of stem, ear yield, stem yield, leaf yield, total yield of corn, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, bulk density and of soil, wilting point, field capacity, available water. Maximum amount of nitrogen (2. 57 %) and phosphorous (0. 32 %) of leaf obtained from treatment of seven (<b>Stalk</b> <b>shredder,</b> plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and furrower) and the highest amount of potassium of leaf equal 1. 72 % obtained from treatment of seven (<b>Stalk</b> <b>shredder,</b> plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and furrower) and treatment of six (<b>Stalk</b> <b>shredder,</b> plow, disc, 100 kg. ha- 1 urea and furrower) with amount of equal 1. 60 %. Maximum total yield of corn equal 47. 65 t. ha- 1 obtained from treatment seven that laid at same group with treatment of six with yield of 46. 16 t. ha- 1 and had no significant difference together. Therefore, the best method of seed bed for obtained total yield of corn was using <b>stalk</b> <b>shredder,</b> plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and furrower...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} properties of cotton stalk fuel from the agricultural residues. The whole cotton stalk plant is converted into shredded material {{with the help of}} cotton <b>stalk</b> <b>shredder.</b> The capacity of cotton <b>stalk</b> <b>shredder</b> machine is 218 kg/h.

40|$|Two prototypes of a stalk burial {{implement}} {{were tested}} for energy requirements at the University of California, Shaffer Research Station. Both {{versions of the}} implement are designed to bury the cotton stalks in a concentrated zone and reform {{the bed in the}} same location. To plow under <b>shredded</b> <b>stalks,</b> both versions of the implement required less energy than a conventional tillage systems typical of the San Joaquin Valley of California. Both stalk burial implements were also used to plow under whole cotton stalks. This offers additional energy savings by eliminating the <b>stalk</b> <b>shredding</b> operation...|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{location}} of the islands, stretching like a broken bridge from Asia to America, many anthropologists believe they were a route of the first human occupants of the Americas. The earliest known evidence of human occupation in the Americas is much farther south; the early human sites in Alaska have probably been submerged by rising waters during the current interglacial period. People living in the Aleutian Islands developed fine skills in hunting, fishing, and basketry. Hunters made their weapons and watercraft. The baskets are noted for being finely woven with carefully <b>shredded</b> <b>stalks</b> of beach rye.|$|R
50|$|Three main {{techniques}} are employed over a 3- to 5-year period: pheromone traps for detection, cultural practices {{to reduce the}} weevilâ€™s food supply, and malathion treatments. During the first year, applications of malathion are made every five to seven days starting in late summer. The frequency is reduced to every 10 days during the later part of the growing season until the first frost. The cotton <b>stalks</b> are <b>shredded</b> and plowed into the ground to eliminate their use as a winter shelter. During years 2 through 5, the automatic spraying is supplemented by an intensive trapping program (one trap per 1-2 acres), and malathion applications are made only in those fields where weevils are detected. This phase begins in late spring and continues until the first killing frost. The final phase of the program involves monitoring and trapping at a density of one trap per 10 acre, with spot spraying as required. The program has become more high-tech in recent years, employing GPS mapping technology and bar code readers that transmit trap data electronically.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{plans to}} field test several prototypes of plows that cut cotton stalks after harvesting and plows then {{back into the}} soil to prepare {{the field for the}} next planting. Modifications to the design have been made to allow the soil to more easily slide off the plow to reduce fuel consumption. A prototype has been shipped to Australia for testing in their fields and further product development. A farm machinery manufacturer has been selected to build two full-scale preproduction prototypes. Field testing will be done at sites in California and Arizona, since both have regulations specifying that cotton <b>stalks</b> must be <b>shredded...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{corn silage}} {{harvester}} using a shredding/crushing mechanism was designed, fabricated, and tested during two harvesting {{seasons with the}} objective of improving the feed value of corn silage. Two pairs of toothed rolls turning at different speeds shredded whole-plant corn. Corn <b>stalks</b> were <b>shredded,</b> kernels were broken, and cobs were crushed. Average specific energy required to shred whole-plant corn ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 9 kWh/Mg DM. Average specific energy for an added flail cutter/blower ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 7 kWh/Mg DM for a total harvester specific energy requirement of 4. 5 to 10. 6 kWh/Mg DM. Average specific energy requirements for shredding varied significantly among different roll speed treatments at a unit roll force of 15 N/mm (front and rear), but no significant effect of roll speed configuration was found at other unit roll forces. Packed density was lower for shredded silage than for chopped silage, but shredded and chopped samples both ensiled well with pH values of 3. 8 to 4. 1 after fermentation. Particle size distributions of shredded and flail-cut samples were similar at moisture levels of 60 % and 65 % w. b.; however, the 70 % moisture crop was coarser. Shredding produced fewer small particles ( 9 mm) than chopping, while shredded and flail-cut samples had more small particles and more large particles than chopped samples...|$|R
40|$|In {{search of}} a more {{environmentally}} friendly alternative {{to the use of}} chemical fertilizers, a study was conducted to evaluate the use of compost for improved crop productivity. We compared the succession of microorganisms in the compost heaps using hot bed method of composting. They contained grass clippings, sawdust, NPK fertilizer, ashes, corn cobs, bean chaff, vegetable <b>stalks,</b> newspaper <b>shreds</b> and soil arranged in layers in a round structure. Poultry dropping was the organic nitrogen source of one heap while pig waste was used for the other heap. Samples were taken weekly and analyzed using soil dilution method for isolation of moulds on potato dextrose agar medium. The qualities of composts after eight weeks were evaluated by performance and yield of tomato crops. Eleven fungal isolates were obtained in compost containing poultry dropping and nine fungal isolates were obtained from compost containing pig manure. The predominant mycoflora of poultry dropping compost at 3 weeks of composting was Fusarium pallidoroseum (23. 08 %) while Aspergillus fumigatus (38. 96 %) dominated compost containing pig waste. Fungi isolated from the composts included cellulolytic fungi like Chaetomium sp. and Phoma sp. Soil amended with both composts improved the growth and yield of tomato crop significantly. It was concluded that compost containing poultry droppings was richer and therefore encouraged higher microbial activity than compost containing pig waste. Knowledge of the microbial succession during composting and conditions required could further be employed to enhance composting...|$|R
