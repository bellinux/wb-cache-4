40|$|Polypeptides {{corresponding}} to hydrophobic transmembrane �-helices, such as residues 69 – 101 of glycophorin A, are notoriously difficult to prepare in quantities sufficient for biophysical experiments. Simple synthetic and purification approaches reported {{here have been}} developed by combining a few modifications to standard procedures, without resorting to elevated temperatures, expensive activation strategies, or complex hydrophobic solvent mixtures. The cost of screening projects, preparing labeled peptides, and examining sequence variations is thereby significantly reduced. The quality of the peptide synthesized by this small-scale 9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy is {{comparable to that of}} the peptide synthesized by an experienced resource facility using a large-scale tert-butyloxycarbonyl strategy. Using reverse-phase HPLC, the desired peptide was separated from the primary side product (a Leu or Ile deletion) and quantitatively recovered at greater than 98 % purity. Baseline resolution was achieved using a water: acetonitrile gradient to elute the peptides from a cyanopropyl column at ambient temperature. Combining these approaches readily yields 10 to 20 mg of pure transmembrane peptide from a small-scale Fmoc synthesis. The approaches are readily transferable to transmembrane sequences not previously synthesized and do not require setting up a specialized facility.

It intends to gain an advantage {{of being the first}} company to target a completely new sector in China, i. e. young citizens who find themselves under pressure. It aims to become a leading provider of emotional support to local white-collar workers and college students. Market research already conducted has suggested a ready market for such a venture. Guo Xin, who has a good knowledge of starting a new venture, will be the sole manager of Cry Bar. The company is scheduled to begin operations on October 1 st 2009 and will recruit 4 employees, including one caterer, two servers and a part-time accountant. Training will be given to the two servers to deliver a professional and personalised customer service in response to the needs of such a highly pressured group. Cry Bar’s initial marketing strategy is to send out attractive leaflets to office workers and students around Zhongguan Village. The largest free-access social networking website (xiaonei. com) will be used as a communication platform to give Cry Bar a high exposure rate. Moreover, cc 98. com, which is the most famous BBS (on-line forum) has a large number of Beijing bar fans, will also be utilised to implement online marketing. Psychological clinics and other bars in Beijing will be direct competitors to Cry Bar, especially the existing “venting bar”, which provides a series of venting facilities including punch bags, pillows and a screaming room, although the venting bar has problems in terms of its operation and pricing policy, and efforts have been made to enable Cry Bar overcoming such operational drawbacks.

50|$|After {{decades of}} capital {{investment}} in United States's infrastructure {{such as the}} Interstate Highway System, local water treatment facilities, electric transmission and utility lines, the need to sustain such infrastructure experiences mounting challenges. The current duress includes tight state and local budgets, deferral of needed maintenance funding, and political pressures to cut public spending. Today, shrinking federal appropriations, progressively aging capital stock, and parochial statuses and interest groups have inhibited flexible procurement strategies. And {{with the rise of}} design firms, professional societies, licensures, construction and industry associations, and related specialties the management of the infrastructure system has dramatically altered. As a result, the life cycle of a facility, including Planning, Design, Construction, Operations, Maintenance, Upgrading, and Replacement, has become bifurcated between agencies and firms where Design and Construction becomes contracted separately from Operations and Maintenance. The push for more dual-track strategies and not segmented ones such as Design-Build and Build-Operate-Transfer helps in maintaining public facilities.

40|$|Young {{households}} who {{are new to}} {{the interior}} goods market pertinently experience the financial implication of major purchases, such as furniture or appliances. Due to the high <b>start-up</b> <b>expense</b> of furnishing a home, younger consumers {{may not be able}} to afford all the durables they need simultaneously, and would therefore have to deliberate and prioritise their spending in terms of the different interior product categories and zones in their home. In this deliberation, households will justify their expenditures on the basis of the need they have for the perceived value or meaning a room or object has. It is proposed that consumers often evaluate and purchase objects for its symbolic meaning rather than for its pragmatic, functional value or meaning. Since individuals define themselves and others in terms of their possessions and appearance, the home serves as the ideal social environment in which to convey a desired message regarding the household's identity and values. Extant research shows that a common order of acquisition of household durables exists for different consumer groups, and that different consumer groups attach different levels of importance to the symbolic meanings of products and appearances. Consequently, this study set out to investigate and describe young households' allocation of financial and physical resources (i. e. money, effort and attention) toward specific interior product categories and different zones in their home; to investigate and describe households' justification for the allocation of their resources in terms of the functional utility, symbolic meaning (specifically status) and aesthetic appeal of interior products and zones; and to investigate and describe whether young households from different population groups (specifically White and Black) and income groups differ in their interior choices. These objectives were approached from the symbolic interactionist, cultural and multiple mental accounting perspectives. Data was collected from 277 respondents residing in Tshwane, Gauteng during May to December 2011, by means of a structured questionnaire. The sampling criteria were age (25 - 39 years), location (Tshwane) and home occupancy status (owning or renting a home with multiple rooms). Findings indicated that young households valued a room mostly for its perceived symbolic meaning, then its aesthetic appeal and lastly its functional purpose, but conversely valued the utilitarian purpose of an interior object the most and its symbolic meaning the least. Most resources were therefore allocated to rooms in the social zone, since this area presents more opportunities for appearance and impression management, by means of social symbols, than other, less public areas of the home. Furniture, as interior product category, was households' largest expenditure, possibly due to the role furniture's utilitarian purpose plays in making a home functional and liveable. Regardless of their level of income, Black households allocated more resources to the interiors of their homes for symbolic- and aesthetic-related reasons, than their White counterparts. There was no significant difference between population groups in terms of their tendencies to allocate resources toward the interiors of their homes for utilitarian reasons. No significant differences were observed among the three income categories regarding the allocation of their resources, except when physical resources were allocated toward the interiors of zones in their homes for aesthetic reasons. In this particular instance, households in the upper income category (> R 29 000) devoted the most effort and attention to the appearance and emotional appeal of their interiors. The findings of this study have useful implications for retailers, buyers and forecasters in the household furniture, appliances and equipment sector, as well as for consumer facilitation. Retailers may incur noticeable losses if they underestimate the importance of interior goods‟ functional qualities, relative to their symbolic and aesthetic utility. In terms of visual merchandising, retailers may benefit from displaying interior goods as part of a 'room' instead of displayed as separate entities, since consumers, especially Black consumers, would pay more attention to the contextual symbolic and aesthetic meanings of interior goods. The findings also contribute to existing literature, which is dated and limited regarding households' acquisition of interior durables, as well as the functional, symbolic and aesthetic motivations that guide households' allocation of resources towards different zones and interior product categories in their homes, especially in the South African context.
