In order to put {{pressure}} on the court, Argentine Colonel Mariano Necochea along with 30 Mounted Grenadiers and sailors stormed La Argentina and took control of the ship {{in the name of the}} United Provinces. Then, the corsair's defense decided to accelerate the trial and the judge decided, on 9 December, to return all <b>ships,</b> <b>papers</b> and documents to Bouchard; however the money and the booty were not given back.|$|E

Floridas Commander John Newland Maffitt armed Clarence with one gun so that Read might capture prizes {{on his way}} to Hampton Roads.|$|E

Nicholson ordered his barge broken out and went ashore with the <b>ships</b> <b>papers.</b> Later that morning, the American frigate surrendered to Capt. Caldwell of Emerald. A Congressional court of inquiry into the fiasco cleared Capt. Nicholson of blame, and all the officers of the unlucky frigate saw action later during the Revolution.|$|E
50|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with {{appendicitis}} {{during the previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyds agent, who had been on the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the <b>ships</b> <b>papers</b> at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.|$|E
50|$|Fortunately {{area where}} they were was not as rocky and at daybreak they found that they were 400 meters from shore. Three of the crew took a rope from the boat to shore, being {{followed}} by the remaining five. Here {{the next stage of}} their adventure began, because right in front of where they had landed, at the side of a stream, was a Maori pa. Fortunately it was uninhabited, otherwise they could have been killed. The party then went along the beach back towards New Plymouth as stealthily as they could, at times walking below the cliffs where they could. Crossing probably the Hangatahua River, the Captain Smith lost the <b>ships</b> <b>papers</b> and log. Twelve hours after they began walking they reached Oakura. It was 10pm. The sentry, not expecting any Europeans coming from their direction, fired. Fortunately the shot missed and after the party identified themselves they were taken in.|$|E

50|$|That night, Tautog {{was headed}} for Alors Strait when she sighted a ship (thought to be a freighter) coming west, {{accompanied}} by an escort. The targets suddenly turned toward Tautog and were recognized as an antisubmarine warfare team. The submarine went deep but still received a severe pounding. On 5 January 1943, Tautog sighted a sail off her port bow and promptly closed the ship. It {{turned out to be}} a native craft with a dozen Muslim sailors, four women, several babies, some chickens, and a goat on board. After he had examined the <b>ships</b> <b>papers,</b> Tautogs commanding officer allowed the vessel to resume its voyage. On 9 January at 08:38, Tautog (relying on ULTRA) sighted a Natori-class cruiser off Ambon Island, at a range of about 3000 yd. Three minutes later, the submarine fired her first torpedo. At 09:43, her crew heard a loud explosion, and sonar reported the cruisers screws had stopped. In the next few minutes, as the cruiser got underway at reduced speed, Tautog scored two more hits, while the cruiser opened fire on her periscope with 5 in guns, preventing her from tracking the target for another attack; the cruiser limped into Ambon.|$|E
50|$|On 9 July 1819, {{exactly two}} years after Bouchard left Buenos Aires, the Santa Rosa and the María Sofía arrived to Valparaíso. the 12th of the same month arrived the Neptuno and one day later arrived La Argentina. Bouchard was {{informed}} that Thomas Cochrane had ordered his arrest. The corsair replied that the Chilean government had no authority to judge him {{and that he would}} only speak about his travels to the Argentine authority.The trial for piracy started on 20 July. In September a Chilean fleet had left to Peru to try to take El Callao fortress. In order to put pressure on the court, Argentine Colonel Mariano Necochea along with 30 Mounted Grenadiers and sailors stormed La Argentina and took control of the ship {{in the name of the}} United Provinces. Then, the corsair's defense decided to accelerate the trial and the judge decided, on 9 December, to return all <b>ships,</b> <b>papers</b> and documents to Bouchard; however the money and the booty were not given back.The ships had no sails nor cannons, because they had been requested by the Chilean navy. Bouchard, virtually in bankruptcy, used a schooner to deliver clay to Buenos Aires, and due to the poor future of his ships, he decided to change the name of La Argentina to Consecuencia, the name she had before being taken. They were used as transport ships: the Consecuencia carried 500 soldiers to Peru, while Santa Rosa took cattle and weapons.|$|E
