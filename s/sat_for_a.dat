He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{was allowed}} to elect sixteen {{representative}} peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a Dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued {{to be entitled to}} sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{inspired}} by {{his visit to the}} Spanish court in 1623, Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled. In Spain, he <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others. In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck. His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group. In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna. His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, da Vinci, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt. By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1760 paintings, most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.|$|E

Sequoyah began to journey into areas of present-day Arizona and New Mexico, to meet with tribes there.|$|E
25|$|Before he returned, he {{answered}} a challenge set down by Effie Gray, whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie {{had asked him}} to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at Leamington Spa to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, The King of the Golden River (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by Richard Doyle). A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.

500|$|Fortunately for the Macdonald government, {{economic}} conditions improved during the 1930s. In March 1937, Macdonald announced that after 14years of running operating deficits, the Nova Scotia government had recorded a surplus with another forecast {{for the next}} year.

Macdonald promised the government would spend another $7.5million on its popular road paving program overseen by A. S. MacMillan, the veteran Minister of Highways. MacMillan, also Chairman of the Nova Scotia Power Commission, had been extending electrical service into rural areas. He now introduced a rural electrification bill designed to subsidize the cost of providing electricity.|$|E

500|$|Inspiration for Marching Men came in {{part from}} the author's time as a laborer in Chicago between 1900 and 1906 (where he, like his protagonist, worked in a warehouse, went to night school, was robbed, and fell in love several times) and his service in the Spanish–American War which took place {{towards the end of the}} war and just after the {{armistice}} in 1898–99. Of the latter, Anderson wrote in his Memoirs about the time he had been marching and got a rock in his shoe. After separating from his fellow soldiers to remove it, he observed them and recalled [...] "I had become a giant.... I was, in myself, something huge, terrible and at the same time noble. I remember that I <b>sat,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, while the army passed, opening and closing my eyes". Combined with his later reading of works by Thomas Carlyle, Mark Twain, and possibly Jack London, Anderson had inspiration for Marching Men that was both experiential and literary.|$|E
500|$|The Eagles {{finished}} the 2004 {{season with a}} 13–3 record and earned a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they were to play the AFC Champion New England Patriots.

500|$|Sam Witwer as Galen Marek/Starkiller— The {{child of}} two Jedi, Starkiller becomes Darth Vader's secret {{apprentice}} and is dispatched by his master {{to kill the}} Jedi who survived Palpatine's Jedi purge. Although acting as a villain, Starkiller is [...] "really just [...] damaged kid." [...] Developers decided not to give Starkiller a name in the game, but the novelization gives his name as Galen Marek. Although Starkiller starts as Vader's apprentice, a focus {{of the game is}} to allow the character to evolve into [...] "something more heroic, something greater." [...] Audio director David Collins saw a resemblance between Starkiller concept art and his friend, Witwer; Collins asked for Witwer's headshot and an audition reel, and a few weeks later Witwer <b>sat</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 45-minute audition. Witwer secured the role by demonstrating to developers his deep understanding of the character; in portraying Starkiller, Witwer brought many new ideas about the character and imbued him with a sense of humanity. Developers tried not to make Starkiller so evil that players would have difficulty connecting to him. The Force Unleashed’s character's name is an homage to [...] "Annikin Starkiller," [...] the original name of the character that eventually became Luke Skywalker.|$|E
