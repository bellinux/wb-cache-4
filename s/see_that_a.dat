Rapid changes in vessel diameter may lead to turbulent flow, for instance when a narrower vessel widens to a larger one. Furthermore, a bulge of atheroma may be the cause of turbulent flow, where audible turbulence may be detected with a stethoscope.|$|E

25|$|In Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in {{the upper}} reaches of the Yangtze River, Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni are {{distributed}} in mountainous areas, and are not subjected to flood influence as much as in the middle and lower reaches of the river. It is interesting to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> relatively lower number of haplotypes were found in this region as compared with Oncomelania hupensis hupensis. It appears likely that there has been certain degree of isolation for these mountainous populations.|$|E
25|$|A pointed pseudotriangulation can {{be defined}} as a finite non-crossing {{collection}} of line segments, such that at each vertex the incident line segments span an angle of at most π, and such that no line segments can be added between any two existing vertices while preserving this property. It is not hard to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> pointed pseudotriangulation is a pseudotriangulation of its convex hull: all convex hull edges may be added while preserving the angle-spanning property, and all interior faces must be pseudotriangles else a bitangent line segment could be added between two vertices of the face.|$|E
25|$|Nadezhda von Meck {{saw things}} very differently. To her, filling {{the roles of}} mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the machine of a {{government}} organization. Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging {{him to make a}} break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.|$|E

25|$|Retaliation has {{occurred}} when {{a sexual harassment}} victim suffers a negative action {{as a result of}} the harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades, have their projects sabotaged, be denied work or academic opportunities, have their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after reporting sexual harassment or leading to unemployment as they may be suspended, asked to resign, or be fired from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also stalking and cyberstalking of the victim. Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.|$|E
25|$|Factors such {{as nature}} {{of work and}} lack of {{influence}} within their jobs leads some theorists {{to the conclusion that}} most Americans are working class. They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas. These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence in their jobs. Also, they are not paid to think. For example: The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were $136,960 in May 2006, indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The dentist creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment. In 2009, Dental assistants made roughly $14.40 an hour, about $32,000 annually. Unlike dentists, dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients. They carry out routine procedures and follow the dentists' instructions. Here we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> dental assistant being classified as working class. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations.|$|E
25|$|The ships {{reached their}} {{scouting}} position {{south of the}} rendezvous and Beatty issued orders {{to turn to the}} north. The turn resulted in the 5th Battle Squadron leading the ships in a generally northerly direction, the intention being that it would arrive properly placed to take up its assigned position at the meeting with the Grand Fleet. Outlying cruisers screening the main ships now made contact with a German force to the south east, which meant because of the just completed turn the British ships were heading away from the enemy. Beatty hoisted a flag signal for his ships to turn to a new course SSE, which both battlecruiser squadrons did. Confusion ensued in the 5BS, which could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> signal had been made but could not read it across the greater distance, and these ships continued north. Before the first northerly turn HMS Tiger, the last ship in Beatty's squadron, had been successfully relaying messages to the 5BS by searchlight, but Tiger was now furthest away from Evan-Thomas and no other ship took on the duty. Eventually it became apparent that the main squadron had turned south and the 5BS followed, but by now the gap between the two groups had grown to ten miles.|$|E

He followed Balakirev in {{his use of the}} whole tone scale, treatment of folk songs and musical orientalism and Liszt for harmonic adventurousness. (The violin melody used to portray Scheherazade is very closely related to its counterpart in Balakirev's symphonic poem Tamara, while the Russian Easter Overtures follows the design and plan of Balakirev's Second Overture on Russian Themes.) Nevertheless, while he took Glinka and Liszt as his harmonic models, his use of whole tone and octatonic scales do demonstrate his originality. He developed both these compositional devices for the [...] "fantastic" [...] sections of his operas, which depicted magical or supernatural characters and events.|$|E

If E detects that a machine does print a 0 (we assume, Turing doesn’t say) then G prints :: or just skips this entry, leaving the squares blank.

2500|$|The {{oriented}} ambient isotopy {{classes of}} these four oriented knots are all distinct. [...] And, when one considers ambient isotopy of the knots without regard to orientation, there are two distinct equivalence classes: [...] { A ~ B } and { C ~ D }. [...] To <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>A</b> and B are unoriented equivalent, simply note that they both may be constructed from the same pair of disjoint knot projections as above, the only difference being the orientations of the knots.

It is important to compare the two authors and the remarkable similarities between them because it is essential in understanding Plautus. He writes about Greeks like a Greek. However, Plautus and the writers of Greek New Comedy, such as Menander, were writing in two completely different contexts.|$|E
