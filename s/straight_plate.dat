40|$|Purpose: Relapse {{caused by}} {{clockwise}} (opening) {{rotation of the}} distal segment (dentate segment) in the sagittal plane {{is one of the}} postoperative complications sometimes seen after sagittal split ramus osteotomy. The force involved in this movement is primarily exerted by the masticatory and suprahyoid muscles. For postoperative stability, we have used two plates on each side: a <b>straight</b> <b>plate</b> placed over the vertical osteotomy line at the buccal surface of the first molar and an L-shaped plate placed at the distal or lateral part of the last molar over the osteotomy line, just crossing over the upper-lateral edge of the buccal shelf, to prevent the tail of the distal segment from moving upward. Although postoperative stability was clinically fine, experimental evaluations have not previously been performed. To clarify the effects of the L-shaped plate, we performed an experimental study using a bioabsorbable plate system. Methods: A custom-fabricated jig was made to simulate rotational movement of the segments. Two segments made from polyoxymethylene resin were fixed with a four-hole straight or four-hole box poly-L-lactate ioabsorbable plate. An L-shaped plated was then added for rigidity, and mechanical testing was performed. Result: The yield load exerted by the four-hole <b>straight</b> <b>plate</b> alone was 152. 4 ± 11. 0 N. This increased significantly to 273. 8 ± 43. 7 N with addition of an L-shaped plate (p< 0. 05).

Known operative procedures were examined with this foil using a self-compressing plate and a synthetic tube model. Contract area, compressive force, pressure and pressure distribution were measured simultaneously and analogously. A <b>straight</b> <b>plate</b> produces extremely little force and pressure on the gap. Both are limited to {{about a quarter of the}} cross-section just below the plate. The consequence is no sufficient stability. Also, using a prebent plate results in inhomogeneous pressure distribution with high values, but a distinct decrease of the stress on the opposite side of the plate, especially by compression applied at the end of the plate. But compression from near the fracture side gives the highest values and a most homogeneous force distribution. In this case the force recorded 1700 N, the mean p ressure 5, 2 MPa and the contact 90 % of the cross-section. The length thrust of the plate ends approximately at a torque of screw tightening at 1, 0 Nm. Using torques up to 2, 5 Nm, force and pressure increase isometrically. Higher torques have no influence.

Shear behavior was examined computationally using calibrated Finite Element Models (FEM) to perform parametric studies that incorporated horizontal curvature and critical geometric properties. This information was used to develop two shear buckling coefficients, one based on simplified representation of Batdorf’s shear buckling coefficient and the other by introducing horizontal curvature into Timoshenko and Gere’s shear buckling coefficient. Effectiveness of these shear buckling coefficients was assessed via comparisons between shear capacities from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Load and Resistance Factor Design Bridge Design Specifications (AASHTO LRFD). Comparisons involved girder FEM models whose properties cover the range of possible horizontal curvatures, web slenderness and panel aspect ratios. After assessing how horizontal curvature could influence shear behavior, possible beneficial effects were assessed by evaluating increased possible increases in shear stiffener spacing using proposed shear buckling coefficients. ^ Results showed that horizontal curvature enhanced shear strength for the slender, steel girder webs that were studied.

30|$|High-energy {{trauma of}} the distal forearm may result in {{fractures}} that simultaneously involve the diaphysis and the metaepiphyseal parts of the bones; soft tissue damage may be associated. These lesions represent a major treatment challenge, as the radial length, articular congruity, and the correct relationship of the distal radioulnar joint {{may be difficult to}} restore. External fixation respects the biology of the consolidation process and is mainly indicated in multifragmented and comminuted fractures. This technique may be effective at restoring radial length but it often fails to correct palmar angulations; moreover, indirect reduction through ligamentotaxis may not effectively reduce articular fragments in fractures with major joint involvement. Excessive distraction of the hardware, to obtain satisfactory reduction, can result in delayed union, nonunion, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or digital stiffness [3, 4]. Despite the fact that randomized trials do not provide strong evidence regarding the type of surgical intervention that is the most appropriate treatment for fractures of the distal radius in adults, superior functional and radiological results of ORIF with respect to external fixation have been reported recently [5]. Standard <b>straight</b> <b>plates</b> result in optimal diaphyseal stabilization but may be inadequate for fixing metaphyseal and epiphyseal fractures. When positioned on the volar aspect of the radius, <b>straight</b> <b>plates</b> are too bulky and may create attritional damage to flexor tendons; they need to be bent to follow the radial volar inclination, and are not sufficiently wide to adequately fix the epiphysis and capture small articular pieces for such fractures. A new technique described by Ginn et al. [6] involves “bridging” the fracture using a standard 3.5 mm plate applied dorsally and fixed in distraction from the radius to the third metacarpal shaft distally. The distraction plate technique also uses the concept of ligamentotaxis and, like external fixation, is especially indicated for intra-articular fractures with small, comminuted fragments which may be difficult to manage with plates or other nonbridging methods; when distraction fails to obtain adequate reduction, the use of bone grafts, K-wires and supplementary screws are included in the procedure. The hardware is removed after radiographic evidence of consolidation (mean time: 124  days) and wrist motion has been initiated. Excellent clinical and radiographical results are reported with this technique [7]. Disadvantages of this method include the long period of immobilization of the wrist, the need for a second operation to remove the hardware, potential attritional damage to the extensor tendons, difficulty in reducing and stabilizing the volar fragments of the distal radius, and the risks related to overdistraction of the radiocarpal joint (CPRS, finger functional impairement) [3, 4].|$|R

In this case, we also used two 2.0 -mm system plates and screws. Because the estimated area of angle ostectomy was overlapped with reduction and fixation area, posterior object among two plates was located more anteriorly than the usual position. Anatomical reduction is the most important thing in the operation of fracture management. So, reduction and fixation were progressed before angle ostectomy. After fixation, usual ostectomy of mandibular angle was performed under the plate fixation and IMF state to make the mandible stable. Because that situation is more similar and stable condition in shape than in displaced state, the operator could be more familiar for angle ostectomy. But, it was assumed that fixation plate was damaged by the reciprocating saw during angle ostectomy. Distortion of plate shape could be observed on immediate postoperative radiograph. Even though the operator paid particular attention to ostectomy, plate damage occurred on the account of limited operation field of vision. Immediately after the operation, there was no clinical problem such as malocclusion despite the damage of a plate.

CONCLUSIONS: The NET, a face and construct valid open-source partial task neuroendoscopic trainer, was designed. Presimulation novice neurosurgeons and neurosurgical residents were described as having insufficient skills and preparation to practice neuro-endoscopy. Plate tilt and endoscope angle were shown to be important factors in participant performance. The NET was found to be a useful partial-task trainer for skill building in neuro-endoscop...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of asymmetrical plate rolling in the finishing rolling stand of a 3600 mill. The investigation was carried out for S 690 Ql steel sheets. Tests were conducted for two types of the asymmetric rolling process. In the first case, the asymmetry of the process was introduced by varying the speed of the upper working roll, while in the second case, two types of asymmetry were introduced simultaneously by reducing the rotational speed of the upper roll and reducing the diameter of the lower roll. Based on the obtained results it has been found that the simultaneous introduction of two types of asymmetry significantly reduces the energy-force parameters of the process, and regardless of relative deformation applied, it yields also a <b>straight</b> rolled <b>plate...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Wow!" [...] yelled the Buffalo coacher. Rube sped up the sidewheeler and Schultz reached wide {{to meet it}} and failed. The {{third was}} the {{lightning}} drop, <b>straight</b> over the <b>plate.</b> The batter poked weakly at it. Then Carl struck out and Manning following, did likewise. Three of the best hitters in the Eastern retired on nine strikes! That was no fluke. I knew what it meant, and I sat there hugging myself with the hum of something joyous in my ears.|$|R

The 21st-century Winchester Single Shot rifles are built with modern {{technology}} and steels, {{enabling them to}} fire modern smokeless cartridges; the currently popular cartridges of [...]17 Remington, [...]243 Winchester and [...]30-06 Springfield were offered with standard rubber recoil pads and <b>straight</b> butt <b>plates.</b> However, four of those Limited Series Model 1885 SSs were subtitled Traditional Hunters. Those four rifles, in calibers [...]38-55 and [...]405 Winchester, [...]45-70 Government, and [...]45-90 BPCR, {{were built in the}} style of the 19th century, with crescent steel butt plates and 19th-century style folding tang sights, along with full octagon 28-inch-long barrels. Their rifling, in the case of the [...]38-55, are the (Winchester) traditional one complete turn within eighteen inches (1-18") with rifle grooves at [...]376, and rifle lands measuring [...]368 of an inch.
