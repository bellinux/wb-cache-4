A distinct and separate group of performers from the chorus, they are purely instrumentalists; the type of instruments featured and the order in which they sit on stage follow established practices. The leftmost performer plays a small taiko, set on a stand before him, with two drumsticks. To his right is the ōtsuzumi hip drum, followed by the kotsuzumi <b>shoulder</b> <b>drum,</b> and the Noh flute (nōkan or simply fue).|$|R

These {{are used to}} play music from the Mikagura-Uta, a body of music, dances and songs created by Nakayama. Most of the world's foremost authorities on Gagaku music (the ancient classical Shinto music of the imperial court of Japan) are also Tenrikyo followers, and Gagaku music is actively promoted by Tenrikyo, although, strictly speaking, the Mikagura-Uta and Gagaku are separate musical forms.|$|R

5000|$|The dances are {{accompanied}} by traditional Japanese music. The primary instrument is the shamisen. The shamisen {{was introduced to the}} geisha culture in 1750 and has been mastered by female Japanese artists for years. This shamisen, originating in Okinawa, is a banjo-like three-stringed instrument that is played with a plectrum. It has a very distinct, melancholy sound that is often accompanied by flute. The instrument is described as [...] "melancholy" [...] because traditional shamisen music uses only minor thirds and sixths. All geisha must learn shamisen-playing, though it takes years to master. Along with the shamisen and the flute, geisha also learned to play a ko-tsuzumi, a small, hourglass-shaped <b>shoulder</b> <b>drum,</b> and a large floor taiko (drum). Some geisha would not only dance and play music, but would write beautiful, melancholy poems. Others painted pictures or composed music.|$|R
500|$|Noh theatre is {{accompanied}} by a chorus and a hayashi ensemble (Noh-bayashi 能囃子). Noh is a chanted drama, and a few commentators have dubbed it [...] "Japanese opera". However, the singing in Noh involves a limited tonal range, with lengthy, repetitive passages in a narrow dynamic range. Texts are poetic, relying heavily on the Japanese seven-five rhythm common to nearly all forms of Japanese poetry, with an economy of expression, and an abundance of allusion. The singing parts of Noh are called [...] "Utai" [...] and the speaking parts [...] "Kataru". The music has many blank spaces (ma) in between the actual sounds, and these negative blank spaces are in fact considered the heart of the music. In addition to utai, Noh hayashi ensemble consists of four musicians, also known as the [...] "hayashi-kata", including three drummers, which play the shime-daiko, ōtsuzumi (hip <b>drum),</b> and kotsuzumi (<b>shoulder</b> <b>drum)</b> respectively, and a nohkan flutist.|$|R

Local elders used to ban ohangla music in the early 80’s. Because the music was meant for adults. “the songs can only be interpreted by very intelligent or mature people, but not children or teenagers” says Juma Oketch a ohangala band vocalist based in Nairobi.|$|R

5000|$|Following {{a series}} of urgent reports by his medical team, on 4 February 1782 General Murray sent a list of ten {{surrender}} terms to the Duc de Crillon, {{based on the principle}} that the garrison should be provided with transport back to Britain, which would be paid for by the British government. These had to be rejected, as de Crillon had been instructed to insist on the garrison being declared prisoners of war, but he hinted strongly that a compromise should be possible. The final agreement, accepted by both sides on 5 February and signed on 6 February, allowed the men to become temporary prisoners of war while they waited for the transport ships, and even stipulated that [...] "in Consideration of the Constancy and Valour which General Murray and his Men have shewn in their brave Defence, they shall be permitted to go out with their Arms <b>shouldered,</b> <b>Drums</b> beating, lighted Matches, and Colours flying, till having marched through the Midst of the Army, they shall lay down their Arms and Colours". This the 950 or so who could walk duly did, the ranks of Spanish and French troops stretching all the way along both sides of the road from St. Philip's Castle to Georgetown, where the defenders laid down their arms in surrender [...] "to God alone". Though he looked straight ahead as he marched, Murray was informed by de Crillon and his deputy the Baron de Falkenhayn that many of the French and Spanish wept at what they saw. In some respects, De Crillon and his subordinates went far beyond the agreement, and Murray noted that they provided [...] "every Thing which can contribute to our Recovery".|$|R

5000|$|The {{edge of a}} {{suspended}} cymbal may be hit with <b>shoulder</b> of a <b>drum</b> stick to obtain a sound somewhat akin {{to that of a}} pair of clash cymbals.

Other effects that can be used include drawing a cello or bass bow across the edge of the cymbal for a sound not unlike squealing car brakes.|$|R
50|$|This grip {{is called}} {{traditional}} because it descends from military marching drummers who carried a snare drum on a sling {{hung from the}} neck or one <b>shoulder,</b> with the <b>drum</b> riding closer to one hip than the other and tilted slightly for easier reach. This allowed the drummer to play the drum and march without banging his knees or thighs into the drum. Because of that drum position, using an overhand grip on the high (left) side of the drum would force the elbow into a very awkward position while an underhand grip is much more comfortable. Even when the drum is on a stand, many drummers will tilt their drum when using traditional grip, although tilting is not required. Many drummers use traditional grip on drums that are perfectly horizontal, especially in marching percussion.|$|R

50|$|It has {{the shape}} of two cones kept in {{opposite}} direction i.e., an hour-glass like shape. The traditional size of thimila made of heart wood or fully grown jackwood (particularly varikka-plaavu) has a length of 24.k virals (one viral = 1.77 inches), 6 virals at ends and 2.5 virals at the centre, besides having a thickness of ¾ viral (finger). The tun is hollow. Of late, presumably for reducing the weight, the measurements are changed without much loss in symphony. According to the procedure of manufacture, the tun of thimila is made in jackwood in the shape described above. Then the sides are made independently by using rings (known as valayal) made up from climbers known as vennil-valli or manja-valli. The circumference of the rings is slightly more {{than that of the}} ends of the tun. The refined leather taken from a calf (between 1-2 years of age) is properly cut and fixed to these rings with the help of gum (made up of raw rice). The fixing of leather has to be done tightly as it determines the symphony of thimila. Six holes of size 3/8 viral each is made on either side and they are fixed to the tun with the help of twined leather threads (total requirement of thread is 25 feet). The tension of strings is very important as it is closely linked with the symphony. For suspending the thimila at the <b>shoulders</b> of the <b>drummer</b> a long cloth of 9 feet length and at least 6 inches width is used. In every respect it is an excellent masterpiece of art as it produces charming sounds.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sound {{production}} and hearing sensitivity of ectothermic animals {{are affected by}} the ambient temperature. This is the first study investigating the influence of temperature on both sound {{production and}} on hearing abilities in a fish species, namely the neotropical Striped Raphael catfish Platydoras armatulus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Doradid catfishes produce stridulation sounds by rubbing the pectoral spines in the <b>shoulder</b> girdle and <b>drumming</b> sounds by an elastic spring mechanism which vibrates the swimbladder. Eight fish were acclimated for at least three weeks to 22 °, then to 30 ° and again to 22 °C. Sounds were recorded in distress situations when fish were hand-held. The stridulation sounds became shorter at the higher temperature, whereas pulse number, maximum pulse period and sound pressure level did not change with temperature. The dominant frequency increased when the temperature was raised to 30 °C and the minimum pulse period became longer when the temperature decreased again. The fundamental frequency of drumming sounds increased at the higher temperature. Using the auditory evoked potential (AEP) recording technique, the hearing thresholds were tested at six different frequencies from 0. 1 to 4 kHz. The temporal resolution was determined by analyzing the minimum resolvable click period (0. 3 - 5 ms). The hearing sensitivity was higher at the higher temperature and differences were more pronounced at higher frequencies. In general, latencies of AEPs in response to single clicks became shorter at the higher temperature, whereas temporal resolution in response to double-clicks did not change. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate that sound characteristics as well as hearing abilities are affected by temperatures in fishes. Constraints imposed on hearing sensitivity at different temperatures cannot be compensated even by longer acclimation periods. These changes in sound production and detection suggest that acoustic orientation and communication are affected by temperature changes in the neotropical catfish P. armatulus...|$|R
