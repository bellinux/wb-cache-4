5|$|Skírnir {{requests}} that Freyr {{give him}} a horse and Freyr's sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. Under the cover of darkness, Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, {{the home of the}} jötnar, and proceeds to Gymir's courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence that surrounds Gerðr's hall. Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> maiden beyond Gymir's dogs. An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir, during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> girl.|$|E
5|$|Both the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner {{production}} contain {{portions of}} dialogue that, according to Hischak, <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power of Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy. Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all-around performance of Carousel on disc, despite uneven singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy's Julie {{and the strong}} supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard). The Stratford Festival issued a recording in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Chinese PEN Center {{director}} Bei Ling alerted Apple Daily to Lee Bo's disappearance, and {{the journal}} reported on 1 January 2016 that Lee {{had become the}} fifth member of Causeway Bay Books to disappear.

25|$|Despite initial {{suspicions that}} other agents, {{including}} Angelo Lano, had been <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Post, in a taped conversation on October 19, 1972, Haldeman {{told the president}} that he had sources, which he declined to name, confirming Felt was <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press.|$|R
5|$|In 1908, {{the number}} of {{attendees}} at St. Peter Church began to dwindle. Many of the priests who had served the congregation had been reassigned a few years earlier. In 1908, a popular priest, Father Sacchi, was sent to Mother of Sorrows Church in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Parishioners formed a committee to go <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bishop on Father Sacchi's behalf. Although Father Sacchi {{was not allowed to}} return to St. Peter, Reverend James Vocca, who had also been at St. Peter prior to his reassignment, was brought back to the church.|$|E
5|$|In October 2004 France 2 allowed three French {{journalists to}} view the raw footage—Denis Jeambar, {{editor-in-chief}} of L'Express; , former France 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at Arte, a state-run television network; and , former editor-in-chief of Le Monde. They also asked to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|Marie herself {{begins the}} {{operation}} {{on a quest}} to seduce and betray her target. Her reversal (followed by two subsequent changes of heart, {{back to the original}} mission and then in opposition to it) counterbalance the wickedness of Madame du Gua and Corentin. Her ultimate fidelity to the object of her desire demonstrates the possibility of sincere passion, even as the other pair <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> venom of the slighted heart.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, President Bartlet {{tries to}} persuade Ellie to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press {{to contain the}} incidence, but Ellie insists she is not as {{comfortable}} with the spotlight as {{the other members of}} the family. She later watches her mother do a light-hearted appearance on Sesame Street, to defend her right to practice medicine even after voluntarily giving up her licence. This inspires her to follow her father's advice, and give a passionate public statement about the necessity of a politically independent scientific community.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August boats from Alceste put {{the party}} ashore at Ostia, near Rome, where they {{made contact with}} a {{representative}} of the Vatican who agreed to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pope but failed to return. When it was deemed necessary to travel to Rome to re-establish contact, the priests refused to go. Maxwell sent them back to Palermo in Acorn, which returned a week later with another volunteer of Drummond's. Landed on the night of 19 September, the envoy was captured and shot as a spy the following day. Consequently, the entire plan was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1944, {{leaders of}} the Blocco del popolo (Popular Front) in Sicily, the {{communist}} Girolamo Li Causi and Pantaleone, went to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landless labourers {{at a rally in}} Villalba, challenging Don Calò in his own personal fiefdom. In the morning tensions rose when Christian Democrat mayor Beniamino Farina – a relative of Vizzini as well as his successor as mayor – angered local communists by ordering all hammer-and-sickle signs erased from buildings along the road on which Li Causi would travel into town. When his supporters protested, they were intimidated by separatists and thugs.|$|E

WWE paid tribute to Warrior on the April 14 episode of Raw.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Aiden, the game becomes monochromatic. Amongst the shades of greys, {{interactive}} objects are highlighted by an aura shining {{in one of}} several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.|$|E
5|$|Çakır was scrutinised by the British {{media in}} 2013 {{when he sent}} off Manchester United's Nani in a Champions League quarter-final and the English team went on to lose to Real Madrid.

UEFA confirmed that no action would be taken against the referee, concluding that he made the correct judgement.|$|E

5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had {{met before}} the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs {{to be higher than}} 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the secondary control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|As {{an escaped}} POW, Pechersky was conscripted into a special penal battalions, {{conforming}} to Stalin's Order No. 270 {{and was sent}} to the front to fight German forces in some of the toughest engagements of the war. Pechersky's battalion commander, Major Andreev, was so shocked by his description of Sobibor that he permitted Pechersky to go to Moscow and <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commission of Inquiry of the Crimes of Fascist-German Aggressors and their Accomplices. The Commission listened to Pechersky and published the report Uprising in Sobibor based on his testimony. This report was included in the Black Book, one of the first comprehensive compilations about the Holocaust, written by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg.|$|E
