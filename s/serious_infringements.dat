40|$|Swiss {{competition}} policy {{has traditionally been}} relatively lenient and low profile. The impact of {{competition policy}} on economic development has therefore been at best neutral. As the slow rate of growth becomes an issue, however, a more vigorous approach to competition {{has been identified as}} an important factor for improving growth prospects. The 2003 reform of the Cartel Act strengthened Swiss competition law, in particular by introducing direct sanctions for the most <b>serious</b> <b>infringements</b> and a leniency programme, thus bringing it closer to that of the European Union and of many other OECD countries. The Swiss Competition Commission has been given considerable new powers to combat private restraints of competition.

40|$|Among the {{negative}} effects on Internet consumers, the divulgence of personal {{information to the public}} has been reported {{as one of the most}} <b>serious</b> <b>infringements</b> on consumer rights. Both consumers and sellers around the world have sought to come up with an optimal solution for information privacy. Several incompatible characteristics of regulating consumer privacy in e-commerce between the U. S. and Korea were explored, and curative suggestions were made to establish a new legal framework to protect online consumer privacy. First, Korea’s regulations for protecting online consumer privacy were found to be centrally controlled, while the U. S. authorities have encouraged self-regulation. Considering the long run efficiency of self-regulation, the Korean authorities should seek more self-regulatory measures and establish consensus among the businesses to voluntarily protect consumer online privacy. Second, U. S. regulations on protection of online consumer privacy are for the most part commercially oriented and controlled by the FTC, whereas in Korea, an administrative department, the Ministry of Information and Communication, regulates online consumer privacy as a primary authority, resulting in lack of specialization in the matters of consumer protection. To improve the efficiency and specialization in regulation of online consumer privacy in Korea, it would be necessary to promulgate a directive specially designed for protecting consumer privacy and delegating the regulatory power to the Korea Consumer Protection Agency established by the Consumer Protection Act. Finally, international arbitration is recommended as the best tool to resolve and prevent the intricacies of international litigation brought against violation of online consumer privacy...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the interpretation of}} section 35 (5) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, which empowers the courts to exclude unconstitutionally obtained evidence in criminal trials. A generous and purposive interpretation {{should be at the}} heart of the admissibility assessment. This work explores the threshold requirements and the substantive phase of the interpretation of section 35 (5). Given that this provision is manifestly modelled on the terms contained in section 24 (2) of the Canadian Charter, the manner in which the courts of that country have grappled with the interpretation of section 24 (2) has been accorded particular importance. As a preliminary issue, the courts must consider whether the threshold requirements of section 35 (5) have been satisfied. It is concluded that the courts of South Africa have interpreted the threshold requirements of section 35 (5) in a broad manner, thereby making it less onerous to satisfy, compared to the threshold requirements contained in section 24 (2) The substantive phase of the admissibility assessment should consist of two legs that must be clearly separated from each other, for the reason that the assessment in each leg of the analysis serve to enhance different societal interests. The public interest in protecting the rights of the accused should be the central consideration during the first leg, while the societal interest in convicting the guilty should be contemplated during the second leg. The first leg of the analysis is concerned with the effect that admission of the evidence would have on the fairness of the trial. It is suggested that the trial fairness requirement should be determined by means of a conscription analysis. The prosecution may rely on the ‘discoverability’ doctrine or on the ‘independent source’ exception. The admission of evidence based on these exceptions would not render the trial unfair. Such an infringement would, accordingly, not add to the seriousness of the violation. Conversely, although admission would tend to render the trial unfair, the evidence should not ‘automatically’ be excluded. However, such an infringement should be regarded as a serious violation, since section 35 (5) was designed to prevent unfair trials. The second leg is focused on the effect that either the admission or exclusion of the evidence would have on the integrity of the criminal justice system. It is concluded that the ‘current mood’ of society should not be determinative of the admissibility assessment. The following overall admissibility framework is recommended: Despite the fact that admission would render the trial unfair, the courts should be allowed to consider police ‘good faith’ and other factors ordinarily considered during the second leg, in order to make an admissibility ruling. Differently put, a balancing exercise should be performed, in which the factors identified in the seminal case of Collins are considered and weighed at the end of the analysis. More importantly, the seriousness of the violation should be a significant factor in the overall admissibility assessment, since judicial condonation of <b>serious</b> <b>infringements</b> would generally impact negatively on the repute of the criminal justice system.

40|$|Within {{many areas}} of {{medicine}} and science animal experiments are seen as indispensable, however ethically not unproblematic {{by the majority of}} the general public. In Germany these experiments are subject to notification or licensing. In Great Britain regulated procedures must also be licensed. In both countries, the compliance with legal rules and regulations as well as with licensing terms and conditions must be guaranteed through appropriate forms of supervision and control. The present study examines German regulations and their practical implementations in view of a forthcoming amendment of German animal welfare legislation, resulting from changes in the German constitution of 2002. Comparisons with Great Britain might show further potential for improvement for German procedures. To include all relevant aspects, the legal situation of both countries, literature searches, as well as results from a study via questionnaire are being evaluated. Regarding the countries’ legal situation {{it must be noted that}} Germany and Great Britain both share the same legal foundations due to both of them being members of the European Union. However, legal implementation differs between the two countries. In Germany, supervision of animal experiments and of laboratory animals husbandry is being dealt with according to regional law: in four federal states a regional licensing authority and in further twelve states the Veterinäramt (veterinary department) are responsible. In comparison, in Great Britain official supervision is centrally organised and subdivided between two departments within the Home Office: Animal Scientific Procedures Division and Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. Internal control is required explicitly in the German Tierschutzgesetz (Animal Welfare Act). Every establishment carrying out experiments on vertebrates must appoint a Tierschutzbeauftragter (Animal Welfare Officer) who among other duties must take care of the compliance with rules and regulations as well as with terms and conditions in the interest of animal welfare. An obligation for internal control as comprehensive as this does not exist in the British Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. As an element of internal control the local Ethical Review Process of the establishment should, among other things, allow for retrospective project reviews. Furthermore, some of its members like the Named Animal Care & Welfare Officer, the Named Veterinary Surgeon and the project licence holder have additional duties and powers in the interest of internal supervision of regulated procedures. To fulfil their supervision roles there are various possibilities available to the authorities. Visits represent the most important official supervision method and are to be used as often as possible in both Germany and Great Britain. In Germany however, these and other official supervision methods are highly limited by an unsatisfactory staff situation (on average one visit per establishment and year compared with an average of eleven visits per designated establishment and year in Great Britain). In Great Britain a similar number of announced and unannounced visits take place, whereas in Germany unannounced visits are rare. Unannounced visits have the advantage of allowing an insight into everyday routine, but bare the risk that important contact people are unavailable or no experiment currently takes place. Whilst qualification of the supervising staff in Great Britain is no cause for discussion, in Germany it is criticised particularly when delegated to the Veterinärämter. Furthermore, the partly divided responsibility for licensing and supervision or for differing supervision methods and non-uniform nation-wide enforcement in Germany are subject to serious criticism. The necessity for effective supervision is shown clearly by the variety of infringements described. In Germany as in Great Britain, mild consequences such as further instructions or letters of admonition dominate. Although tougher sanctions such as fines or imprisonment are legally possible in both countries, they are rarely imposed. Regarding internal supervision too, on-site controls are viewed as particularly helpful but in Germany as well as in Great Britain are conducted only in a small portion of all animal experiments taking place. Additionally, retrospective project reviews can make a positive contribution to laboratory animal welfare. They are a required method of control in Great Britain and therefore are used regularly, whilst in Germany so far they are applied considerably less often. For the Tierschutzbeauftragter as well as for the Ethical Review Process and its members it is necessary to be supported by the establishment. Although the personnel reviewed in both countries mainly expressed satisfaction with their access to project licence holders, personal licence holders and certificate holders and did not need to reckon with negative consequences for themselves when voicing criticism, German discrimination prohibition for the Tierschutzbeauftragter obviously is not always met and criticism and suggestions in Great Britain are not always taken into account. However, as it has turned out the supervisors’ personal commitment plays an important role, too. Involving the authorities in cases of serious or on-going infringements seems to be seen as a breach of the use of official channels by the Tierschutzbeauftragte reviewed. In comparison, in Great Britain there seem to be no misgivings regarding this. Thus, it can be noted that in Germany internal supervision and control is handled very differently depending on each establishment and its Tierschutzbeauftragter, whereas in Great Britain it is insufficiently regulated and therefore can be regarded as moderately efficient. On the basis of the data, information and findings collected in this study, the nation-wide responsibility of the licensing authorities also for the supervision of projects licensed by them can be recommended for Germany particularly regarding professional competence. Establishments conducting regulated procedures should be visited by the authority considerably more often, at least twice yearly, with as many unannounced as announced visits. For this it is necessary to provide more staff to the authorities responsible. During those visits the authority representatives of both countries should watch the conduction of animal experiments more often to assess the practical abilities of those performing them. In cases of repeated or <b>serious</b> <b>infringements,</b> considerably tougher action with use of those legal instruments available is necessary. To provide effective internal supervision or control by the Tierschutzbeauftragter, his authority to issue directives as legally granted to him, his support by the establishment as well as his personal commitment regarding his regular presence in the laboratories and at experiments taking place must be assured. In Great Britain, however, a comprehensive legal obligation for further control would need to be considered to provide effective internal supervision. Overall it can be noted that regarding supervision and control of regulated procedures there seems to be potential for improvement in both Germany and Great Britain. Germany’s federally structured official supervision seems to be less efficient than the centrally organised supervision by the British Home Office. However, some arguments seem to suggest that compulsory German Tierschutzbeauftragte, despite potential for improvement, can achieve a higher level of efficiency than Great Britain’s Ethical Review Processes...|$|E
