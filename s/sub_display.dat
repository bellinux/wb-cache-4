40|$|Donkeys and mules are {{frequently}} kept as companion animals for horses and ponies, with these different equids often being considered a homogenous group. However, {{the extent to}} which domestic equids form inter-specific bonds and display similar social behaviour when living in a mixed herd has not previously been studied. Here we compare the social organization of these three (sub) species when housed together, providing the first systematic analysis of how genetic hybridization is expressed in the social behaviour of mules. A group of 16 mules, donkeys and ponies was observed for 70 h and preferred associates, dominance rank and the linearity of the group's hierarchy was determined. The different equids formed distinct affiliative groups that were ordered in a linear hierarchy with ponies as the most dominant, mules in the middle ranks and donkeys in the lowest ranks. Within each equid subgroup, the strength of the hierarchy also varied. Thus in the present study, the three (<b>sub)</b> species <b>displayed</b> different social organization and levels of dominance and preferred to associate with animals of the same equid type, given the opportunity. These results suggest that different domestic equid (<b>sub)</b> species <b>display</b> variations in social behaviour that are likely to have a strong genetic basis...|$|R

In this study, the recombinant keratinase (r-SUB 3) was produced by the Pichia pastoris expression system and purified to homogeneity. Recombinant <b>SUB</b> 3 <b>displayed</b> identical biochemical properties with the native protease. Experimentally cutaneously infected guinea pigs showed specific lymphoproliferative response towards r-SUB 3, while no specific humoral immune response was induced except for one animal. The heterologous expression of SUB 3 provides a valuable tool for addressing further investigations on the role of this keratinase in the specific cellular immune response and on its use in vaccination trials in the cat.

40|$|Transcription and {{processing}} of mRNA precursors are coordinated events that require numerous complex interactions {{to ensure that}} they are successfully executed. We described previously an unexpected association between a transcription factor, PC 4 (or Sub 1 in yeast), and an mRNA polyadenylation factor, CstF- 64 (Rna 15 in yeast), and provided evidence that this was important for efficient transcription elongation. Here we provide insight into the mechanism by which this occurs. We show that Sub 1 and Rna 15 are recruited to promoters and present along the length of several yeast genes. Allele-specific genetic interactions between SUB 1 and genes encoding an RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) -specific kinase (KIN 28) and phosphatase (FCP 1) suggest that Sub 1 influences and/or is sensitive to the phosphorylation status of elongating RNAP II. Remarkably, we find that cells lacking <b>Sub</b> 1 <b>display</b> decreased accumulation of Fcp 1, altered RNAP II phosphorylation and decreased crosslinking of RNAP II to transcribed genes. Our data provide evidence that Rna 15 and Sub 1 are present along the length of several genes and that Sub 1 facilitates elongation by influencing enzymes that modify RNAP II. © 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.

40|$|Submergence- 1 (Sub 1), a major {{quantitative}} trait locus affecting tolerance to complete submergence in lowland rice (Oryza sativa), contains two or three ethylene response factor (ERF) -like genes whose transcripts are regulated by submergence. In the submergence-intolerant japonica cultivar M 202, this locus encodes two ERF genes, Sub 1 B and Sub 1 C. In the tolerant near-isogenic line containing the Sub 1 locus from the indica FR 13 A, M 202 (Sub 1), the locus additionally encodes the ERF gene Sub 1 A. During submergence, the tolerant M 202 (<b>Sub</b> 1) <b>displayed</b> restrained leaf and internode elongation, chlorophyll degradation, and carbohydrate consumption, whereas the enzymatic activities of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase were increased significantly compared with the intolerant M 202. Transcript levels of genes associated with carbohydrate consumption, ethanolic fermentation, and cell expansion were distinctly regulated in the two lines. Sub 1 A and Sub 1 C transcript levels were shown to be upregulated by submergence and ethylene, with the Sub 1 C allele in M 202 also upregulated by treatment with gibberellic acid (GA). These findings demonstrate that the Sub 1 region haplotype determines ethylene- and GA-mediated metabolic and developmental responses to submergence through differential expression of Sub 1 A and Sub 1 C. Submergence tolerance in lowland rice is conferred by a specific allele variant of Sub 1 A that dampens ethylene production and GA responsiveness, causing quiescence in growth that correlates with the capacity for regrowth upon desubmergence...|$|R
40|$|Although most authors on Information Literacy do {{not really}} differ in their {{definitions}} of the information literacy concept, phenomenographic research makes clear that {{in the context of}} education at least two different conceptions can be distinguished: an “Information Problem Solving” conception and a “Personal Knowledge Base” conception [1]. The conception of “Information Problem Solving” has been elaborated on in various models by many researchers but the operationalization of the “Personal Knowledge Base conception” has, until now, been ignored in LIS research.

40|$|White matter {{comprises}} {{over half}} of the brain, and its role in axonal survival is being reconsidered, consistently with the observation that axonal degeneration follows demyelization. The recent evidence of an extra-mitochondrial aerobic ATP production in isolated myelin vesicles, thanks to the expression therein of the mitochondrial Oxydative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery, stands in for myelin playing a functional bioenergetic role in ATP supply for the axon. The observation that subunits of the OXPHOS encoded by the mitochondrial genome are expressed in myelin, suggests that they can be the same as those of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This would mean that the OXPHOS is exportable. Here the hypothesis is exposed that the mitochondrion is the unique site of the assembly of the OXPHOS, so that this is exported to those <b>sub</b> cellular districts <b>displaying</b> high energy demand, such as myelin sheath. There the OXPHOS would display a higher efficiency in oxidative ATP production than inside the mitochondrion itself.

In addition, blending odorants or additives into hydrogen {{in a manner similar to}} natural gas is generally undesirable for certain applications including proton exchange membrane fuel cells. To facilitate detection of the location of hydrogen leaks, a special chemochromic H(sub 2) sensing material that employs titania (Ti 0 (sub 2)) supported palladium oxide (PdO) pigments encapsulated within a special silicone matrix has been developed at the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC). Several batches of PdO H(sub 2) sensing pigments were synthesized using various Ti 0 (sub 2) supports and their hydrogen detection activity determined. TEM and Particle size distribution analysis showed that smaller particles with hemispherical crystalline structure produced faster coloration kinetics when exposed to H(sub 2) gas. However, uniformly distributed PdO particles on the Ti 0 (<b>sub</b> 2) surface <b>displayed</b> greater color contrast, quantified by delta epsilon measurements.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{characterized the}} rice (Oryza sativa) Submergence 1 (Sub 1) locus encoding three ethylene-responsive factor (ERF) transcriptional regulators. Genotypes carrying the Sub 1 A- 1 allele are tolerant of prolonged submergence. To elucidate {{the mechanism of}} Sub 1 A- 1 -mediated tolerance, we performed transcriptome analyses comparing the temporal submergence response of Sub 1 A- 1 -containing tolerant M 202 (Sub 1) with the intolerant isoline M 202 lacking this gene. We identified 898 genes <b>displaying</b> <b>Sub</b> 1 A- 1 -dependent regulation. Integration of the expression data with publicly available metabolic pathway data identified submergence tolerance-associated pathways governing anaerobic respiration, hormone responses, and antioxidant systems. Of particular interest were a set of APETALA 2 (AP 2) /ERF family transcriptional regulators {{that are associated with}} the Sub 1 A- 1 -mediated response upon submergence. Visualization of expression patterns of the AP 2 /ERF superfamily members in a phylogenetic context resolved 12 submergence-regulated AP 2 /ERFs into three putative functional groups: (1) anaerobic respiration and cytokinin-mediated delay in senescence via ethylene accumulation during submergence (three ERFs); (2) negative regulation of ethylene-dependent gene expression (five ERFs); and (3) negative regulation of gibberellin-mediated shoot elongation (four ERFs). These results confirm that the presence of Sub 1 A- 1 impacts multiple pathways of response to submergence...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} meal patterns {{during and after}} exposure to the visible burrow system (VBS), a rodent model of chronic social stress, {{to determine how the}} microstructure of food intake relates to the metabolic consequences of social subordination. Male Long-Evans rats were housed in mixed-sex VBS colonies (4 male, 2 female) for 2 wk, during which time a dominance hierarchy formed [1 dominant male (DOM) and 3 subordinate males (SUB) ], and then male rats were individually housed for a 3 -wk recovery period. Controls were individually housed with females during the 2 -wk VBS period and had no changes in ingestive behavior compared with a habituation period. During the hierarchy-formation phase of VBS housing, DOM and SUB had a reduced meal frequency, whereas SUB also had a reduced meal size. However, during the hierarchy-maintenance phase of VBS housing, DOM meal patterns did not differ from controls, whereas <b>SUB</b> continued to <b>display</b> a reduced food intake via less frequent meals. During recovery, DOM had comparable meal patterns to controls, whereas SUB had an increased meal size. Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA levels were not different between these groups during the experimental period. Together, the results suggest that exposure to chronic social stress alters ingestive behavior both acutely and in the long term, which may influence the metabolic changes that accompany bouts of stress and recovery; however, these differences in meal patterns {{do not appear to be}} mediated by hypothalamic NPY...|$|R
40|$|Submergence-tolerant rice {{maintains}} viability during complete submergence {{by limiting}} underwater elongation until floodwaters recede. Acclimation responses to submergence are coordinated by the submergence-inducible Sub 1 A, which encodes an ethylene-responsive factor-type transcription factor (ERF). Sub 1 A {{is limited to}} tolerant genotypes and sufficient to confer submergence tolerance to intolerant accessions. Here we evaluated the role of Sub 1 A in the integration of ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellin (GA) signaling during submergence. The submergence-stimulated decrease in ABA content was Sub 1 A-independent, whereas GA-mediated underwater elongation was significantly restricted by Sub 1 A. Transgenics that ectopically express <b>Sub</b> 1 A <b>displayed</b> classical GA-insensitive phenotypes, leading to the hypothesis that Sub 1 A limits the response to GA. Notably Sub 1 A increased the accumulation of the GA signaling repressors Slender Rice- 1 (SLR 1) and SLR 1 Like- 1 (SLRL 1) and concomitantly diminished GA-inducible gene expression under submerged conditions. In the Sub 1 A overexpression line, SLR 1 protein levels declined under prolonged submergence but were accompanied {{by an increase in}} accumulation of SLRL 1, which lacks the DELLA domain. In the presence of Sub 1 A, the increase in these GA signaling repressors and decrease in GA responsiveness were stimulated by ethylene, which promotes Sub 1 A expression. Conversely, ethylene promoted GA responsiveness and shoot elongation in submergence-intolerant lines. Together, these results demonstrate that Sub 1 A limits ethylene-promoted GA responsiveness during submergence by augmenting accumulation of the GA signaling repressors SLR 1 and SLRL 1...|$|R

Theory and closed-form analytic solutions for the static magnetoelectric and the bending response coefficients are presented. Results of systematic variation of layer numbers, layer sequences, PE volume fractions, substrate thicknesses, and four different material systems (employing FeCoBSi, Terfenol-D, AlN, PZT, and Si) are given for a fixed total composite thickness of 5 μm. Among more than 105 structures investigated the greatest static ME coefficient of 62. 3 V/cmOe is predicted for all odd layer number FeCoBSi-AlN multilayer composites on a Si substrate at vanishing substrate thickness and a PE material fraction of 38 %. Varying the substrate thickness from 0 μm to 20 μm and the PE fraction from 0 % to 100 %, broad parameter regions of high ME coefficients are found for odd and large layer number nanocomposites. These regions are further enhanced to narrow maxima at vanishing substrate thickness, which correspond to structures of vanishing static bending response. For bilayers and even layer number cases broad maxima of the ME coefficient are observed at nonzero substrates and bending response. The optimal layer sequence and PE fraction depend on the material system. Bending response maxima occur at zero Si substrate thickness and nonzero PE fractions for bilayers.

The experiments employ pulsed laser photolysis coupled with polarized Doppler-resolved laser induced fluorescence detection {{of the radical}} products. Raw experimental data collected in a previous study of the reaction H+H sub 2 O -> OH(v',j') + H sub 2 have been re-analysed for mean collision energy close to 1. 44 eV. In addition, rotational populations distributions and alignment parameters for both reactions have been determined in a separate series of experiments. The OH(sup 2 PI sub 1 sub / sub 2, v' = 0, N' = 1, A') and OD(sup 2 PI sub 1 sub / sub 2, v' = 0, N' = 1, A') angular distributions generated by the two isotopic reactions are quite distinct: that for the reaction with H sub 2 O shows intensity {{over a wide range}} of centre-of-mass scattering angles and peaks in the sideways direction, while the state-resolved angular distribution for the reaction with D <b>sub</b> 2 O <b>displays</b> more scattering in the backward hemisphere. For higher OH(OD) angular momentum states the differences in the angular distributions for the two reactions are less marked, with both systems showing a slight preference for backward scattering. For the H + D sub 2 O system, there are only slight differences in the OD angular scattering with the increase in collision energy. The kinetic energy release distributions are insensitive to OH (OD) quantum state and to isotopic substitution, and reveal that the H 2 (HD) co-products are born internally cold at 1. 44 eV; the 2. 48 eV data suggest higher internal excitation of the HD co-product.

40|$|The mutant adenoviruses H 5 sub 304 and H 5 RIr were {{isolated}} sequentially from adenovirus 5 wild type by selection {{for the loss}} of EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites by Jones and Shenk (Cell 13 : 181 - 188, 1978). sub 304 lacks the site at 84. 0 map units (m. u.), and RIr lacks both that and the site at 75. 9 m. u. A set of derivatives of RIr that lack the site at 75. 9 m. u. accumulated virus more slowly at 38. 8 or 39. 5 degrees C than those with the site present, as measured by low-multiplicity passage or single-step replication cycles, respectively. Since the EcoRI site at 75. 9 m. u. is predicted to lie in the gene encoding the precursor to virion polypeptide VIII (pVIII), the failure to accumulate virus rapidly could lie either in some step in processing and assembly of virions or in an increased virion thermolability. The latter possibility was shown to be the case, as all strains mutated at the EcoRI 75. 9 m. u. site were extremely thermolabile in vitro, even at 37 degrees C. CsCl equilibrium density centrifugation of heated crude stocks of RIr and sub 304 demonstrated that loss of infectivity in RIr was accompanied by physical disruption of virions. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of infected cell extracts or of purified virions showed that pVIII of RIr had an apparent molecular weight that was slightly greater than that of sub 304, and mature RIr and <b>sub</b> 304 virions <b>displayed</b> polypeptide VIIIs which appeared to be of identical molecular weights. Nucleotide sequence analysis of RIr demonstrated that it contained a 9 -base-pair (bp) substitution for 6 bp found in sub 304, leading to a loss of the EcoRI site and a predicted insertion of a single amino acid. Comparison of the sequence of sub 304 with the published sequence of adenovirus 2 revealed two changes, a single transversion at bp 1, 722 and a bp deletion at 1, 749, leading to the loss of a TaqI site.

40|$|Sustainable {{growth in}} rice yield {{requires}} a second-generation of varieties that are productive {{in the face}} of one or multiple abiotic stresses {{over the course of the}} plant life cycle. Rice researchers have used the extensive diversity in rice germplasm to uncover genetic variation associated with greater resilience to abiotic stresses. The responsible loci are being exploited to limit the loss in yield due to unpredictable climatic conditions. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for submergence tolerance (Sub 1 A; Xu et al., 2006), anaerobic germination tolerance (AG 1; Angaji et al., 2010) and salinity tolerance (Saltol; Bonilla et al., 2002) have been mapped on rice chromosomes 9 S, 9 L and 1 S, respectively. These three QTLs have been introgressed into the widely-grown high-yielding cultivar IR 64 at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) as single locus additions or as pyramided loci. The goal of this dissertation research was to examine the interconnections between AG 1, Sub 1 and Saltol, at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels. The central hypothesis was that if the mechanisms of abiotic stress resilience controlled by these loci are expressed in a developmentally distinct manner or are functionally distinct, then farmers could rely on a triply-pyramided genotype for direct seeding, submergence and salinity tolerance. During this analysis, my colleagues at IRRI successfully demonstrated that the AG 1 locus encodes a functional trehalose- 6 -phosphate phosphatase, namely OsTPP 7, that enhances anaerobic germination tolerance. The trait is absent in the IR 64 variety due to a small interstitial chromosomal deletion. In the three separate chapters the combined and pyramided lines were evaluated for independent anaerobic germination, vegetative submergence and salinity stress treatments. These treatments showed that AG 1, Sub 1 and Saltol provide their tolerance trait in presence of other two loci. For example, when introgressed in the genetic background of Sub 1 and Saltol, AG 1 displayed the anaerobic germination phenotype. Similarly, the Sub 1 showed the vegetative submergence tolerance in presence of AG 1 and Saltol. Finally the Satlol exhibited salinity tolerance phenotype when combined with AG 1 and Sub 1, although there was little additional benefit to the already saline-insensitive IR 64 genotype. These results demonstrate that interaction between loci, if any, does not have negative ramifications under the scenarios tested. Therefore these pyramided lines can be used in the farmer’s fields to cope with independent stresses throughout the growing season. Farmer’s also must cope with combined stresses, such as submergence with salinity or submergence following direct seedling. Therefore, combined stresses of vegetative submergence and salinity or anaerobic germination continuing with vegetative submergence, were investigated to evaluate possible negative interactions between AG 1 and Sub 1, and Sub 1 and Saltol, respectively. To test the former, we improvised a combined salinity and submergence scenario that simulated a natural field condition in which roots were subjected to a saline stress accompanied by shoot submergence in fresh water. The data showed that the benefits of Saltol and Sub 1 could be maintained in the same genotype. To test combined anaerobic germination and vegetative submergence stress, seed were planted in soil and the seedlings continually submerged from 0 through 16 d. Four genotypes, including the pyramided IR 64 (AG 1 Sub 1) line, were evaluated in a series of physiological, biochemical and molecular analyses. In this scenario, the pyramided line was less able to survive submergence than IR 64, IR 64 (AG 1) or IR 64 (Sub 1) This was illuminated by the significant consequences on the global transcriptome at every timepoint assayed, reflecting antagonism between the coleoptile escape and shoot quiescence survival strategies characteristic of AG 1 and Sub 1, respectively, during seedling establishment. IR 64 (AG 1 <b>Sub</b> 1) <b>displayed</b> some transcript abundance features regulated by SUB 1 A- 1, a few regulated by OsTPP 7, and an overall delay in development that was manifested in a lower survival rate. Moreover, the analysis showed that Sub 1 promotes the transition to photoautotrophy in seedlings cultured underwater from seed, an aspect of the traits provided by this locus that had previously not been described. These data indicate that the hydrology of the flood can impact the success of the combined IR 64 (AG 1, Sub 1) genotype. Altogether, this dissertation provides mechanistic knowledge of the independent function and interactions of three high-value genetic loci used to increase the yield stability of rice in South and Southeast Asia...|$|R
