40|$|This article {{discusses}} nine {{criteria for}} evaluation of potential Burden Sharing Rules (BSRs) in climate policy agreements. Three of the criteria reflect fairness principles while six of them are operational requirements. These criteria are useful for identifying potential BSRs that could be promising in future climate policy negotiations. The two <b>sector</b> <b>approaches,</b> Multi-sector Convergence Approach and Triptych, received the highest score according to the criteria presented in this article. The Multi-sector Convergence Approach {{was developed in the}} joint ECN (Netherlands Energy Research Foundation) and CICERO (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research – Oslo) project on burden sharing in climate policy agreements. This is a sector-oriented approach that comprises convergence of per capita emissions to the same level for all countries, and has a global coverage. The Triptych approach has been employed by the European Union for their internal differentiation of national abatement targets. <b>Sector</b> <b>approaches</b> have some specific advantages in linking burden sharing to the economic structure of countries. This indicates that the Multi-sector Convergence Approach could play a useful role in climate policy negotiations among a larger group of countries, and could encourage developing countries to take on greenhouse gas abatement targets...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to inform {{the wide range of}} senior {{managers}} about the Broad <b>Sector</b> <b>Approach</b> to development program investment. This report concerns itself with the theoretical and operational aspects of the Broad <b>Sector</b> <b>Approach,</b> to date. The Broad <b>Sector</b> <b>Approach</b> to Investment lending is very much concerned about the increasing benefits gained through providing the link between macro- economic policy and the pattern of investment within individual sectors. The Broad <b>Sector</b> <b>Approach</b> is therefore a solution to give the chance to local stakeholders to have a voice in the preparation and operational process of investment, (e. g., government agencies, donors, NGOs, ultimate beneficiaries). The BSAp success and failure depends mostly on how, honestly efficiently and effectively the actors handle its operation with full commitment. It is clear that the BSAp has gone far ahead in many countries; thereby countries can use BSAp to challenge the requirements of the today`s changing investment environments...|$|E
