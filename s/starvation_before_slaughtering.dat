40|$|Aggressiveness, nervousness, flightiness, gregariousness {{and overall}} {{disposition}} were evaluated in F 2 Nellore-Angus embryo transfer calves (n = 443) from 13 full sib families and in half Bos indicus, half Bos taurus natural service calves (n = 259) from 4 paternal half sib families. Calves were born from 2003 to 2007, and evaluated shortly after weaning. Steers were evaluated shortly <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> for all 5 disposition traits and at slaughter for overall disposition. Heifers were evaluated for overall disposition at calving every year. Scores ranged from 1 to 9, with 1 being docile and 9 being unruly, except at calving where {{scores ranged from}} 1 to 5. Between sires for overall disposition, calves by 297 J were lowest at weaning (2. 83), <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> (2. 84), and at slaughter (2. 45) and second lowest in first calf heifers (2. 27). Calves by 437 J were highest at weaning (4. 10), <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> (3. 54), at slaughter (2. 89) and in first calf heifers (3. 10). Bulls had the lowest scores at weaning (2. 54), although the number was small (n= 10); females were the highest (4. 01), and steers were intermediate (3. 70). All 5 weaning traits were correlated (P < 0. 05) with each other (0. 73 to 0. 96). The correlation of recipient disposition and weaning disposition of the calves was 0. 12 (P < 0. 05). Aggressiveness was not significantly correlated with other component traits <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> but was with overall disposition (0. 19, P < 0. 05). All other traits were significantly inter-correlated (0. 60 to 0. 97). Disposition at weaning was correlated with disposition <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> (0. 43, P < 0. 05). Slaughter disposition was correlated with weaning disposition (0. 30, P < 0. 001) and disposition <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> (0. 27, P < 0. 001). Disposition in first calf heifers was correlated with weaning disposition (0. 34, P < 0. 001) and disposition in second calf females (0. 53, P < 0. 0001). The results indicate that both genetics and recipient disposition affect calf disposition at weaning, calves with better dispositions at weaning have better dispositions later in life, and there is sufficient variability within and between these full sib and half sib families for use in QTL analysis for major genes for disposition in Nellore-Angus cross cattle...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} the starvation tolerance of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) and Sitophilus oryzae (L.) {{in terms of}} both adult survival and reproduction, the impact of starvation on reproduction not having been studied before.

The number of progeny was a better indicator of the impact of starvation on a species than adult survival. Tribolium castaneum was the most tolerant species, requiring up to 35 d <b>starvation</b> <b>before</b> no progeny were produced. Rhyzopertha dominica and S. oryzae required up to 8 d <b>starvation</b> <b>before</b> no progeny were produced.

40|$|Abstract. A study {{involving}} {{two groups}} of feedlot cattle (n = 84 and 112) was undertaken to compare the effect of two preslaughter lairage (L) durations (3 h v. 18 h) on carcass and meat quality properties. The cattle were grainfed for 150 days <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> and had a mean carcass weight of 347. 0 ± 25. 4 kg. Cattle from the same feedlot pen were randomly allocated to the two treatments on the day <b>before</b> <b>slaughter.</b> One group was transported to the abattoir the day <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> and held overnight (L– 18 h) whereas the other group remained at the feedlot and was transported the following morning and remained in the lairage for 3 h <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> (L– 3 h). After slaughter, meat quality was evaluated on a subset of 15 carcasses/lairage treatment from the two slaughter groups. Objective meat quality measures were made on unaged and 14 -day-aged striploins (longissimus lumborum) from these carcasses. Cattle from the reduced lairage treatment had heavier bled bodyweights at slaughter (P 0. 05) on carcass weight, muscle glycogen concentration, pH 3 h, ultimate pH, shear force or Minolta lightness values. Significant interactions (P< 0. 05) between lairage duration and aging were observed for cooking loss percentage and Minolta a ∗ and b ∗ values but these were relatively small in magnitude. There were no differences {{in the incidence of}} ingesta contamination or rumen rupture between the lairage treatments. It was concluded that shortening holding times in lairage from 18 to 3 h for cattle that have travelled < 6 h would not affect carcass or beef quality...|$|R

40|$|Stunning is {{the process}} of {{rendering}} animals immobile or unconscious, with or without killing the animal, when or immediately prior to slaughtering them for food. In modern slaughterhouses a variety of stunning methods are used on livestock. Methods include: Electrical stunning, Gas stunning, Percussive stunning. There are three opinions of Islamic scholars about stunning. Those scholars; who do not allow stunning at all; are of the view that the method of rendering animals unconscious <b>before</b> <b>slaughter</b> is against the shairah method and Sunnah, and it is Makrooh e Teḥreemi. <b>Before</b> <b>slaughtering,</b> if an animal died due to stunning, then that animal is carcass and is not allowed to be eaten. But, if <b>before</b> <b>slaughter,</b> ḥayat e Mustaqirrah is present in animal and it is slaughtered in that condition then it is permissible to eat it. Certain scholars allow stunning in certain situations with some terms and conditions. The decisions of Mjam e Faqhiyyah of modern age are also based on conditional permission. Moreover, Mufti Muḥammad Taqi Usmani, Dr. Wahabah Zoḥaili and Abdul Aziz Bin Baaz agree with conditional permission, while some other scholars allow all types of stunning without any condition; Mufti Muḥammad Abduho and his pupil Allamah Rasheed Raza Miṣri agree with later opinion...|$|R

40|$|In the {{production}} chain, animals {{are exposed to}} a series of factors and commercial practices that result in stress.

These pre-slaughter adverse effects have impact not only on animal welfare, but they also have clear repercussion in meat quality and economic profit of livestock producers.
