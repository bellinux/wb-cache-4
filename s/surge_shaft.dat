40|$|A {{groundwater}} mound (or pressure mound) {{is defined as}} a volume of fluid dominated by viscous flow contained within a sediment volume where the dominant fluid flow is by Knudsen Diffusion. High permeability self-sealing {{groundwater mound}}s can be created as part of a sustainable urban drainage scheme (SUDS) using infiltration devices. This study considers how they form, and models their expansion and growth as a function of infiltration device recharge. The mounds grow through lateral macropore propagation within a Dupuit envelope. Excess pressure relief is through propagating vertical <b>surge</b> <b>shafts.</b> These <b>surge</b> <b>shafts</b> can, when they intersect the ground surface result, in high volume overland flow. The study considers that the creation of self-sealing groundwater mounds in matrix supported (clayey) sediments (intrinsic permeability = 10 – 8 to 10 – 30 m 3 m – 2 s – 1 Pa – 1) is a low cost, sustainable method which can be used to dispose of large volumes of storm runoff (3 / 24 hr storm/infiltration device) and raise groundwater levels. However, the inappropriate location of pressure mounds can result in repeated seepage and ephemeral spring formation associated with substantial volumes of uncontrolled overland flow. The flow rate and flood volume associated with each overland flow event may be substantially larger than the associated recharge to the pressure mound. In some instances, the volume discharged as overland flow in a few hours may exceed the total storm water recharge to the groundwater mound over the previous three weeks. Macropore modeling is used {{within the context of a}} pressure mound poro-elastic fluid expulsion model in order to analyze this phenomena and determine (i) how this phenomena can be used to extract large volumes of stored filtered storm water (at high flow rates) from within a self-sealing high permeability pressure mound and (ii) how self-sealing pressure mounds (created using storm water infiltration) can be used to provide a sustainable low cost source of treated water for agricultural, drinking, and other water abstraction purposes. storm water disposal; infiltration; macropores; natural pipe; water treatment; water supply sources; groundwater mound; overland flow; storm water recycling; SUDS; infiltration device; soakaway; seepage; ephemeral spring; clay clods; modeling; air-water contact; standing water...|$|R
40|$|The City of Rochester, New York, is {{developing}} the Combined Sewer Overflow Abatement Program (CSOAP) to handle sanitary sewage and storm water. The system includes many conventional dropshafts which transport the water collected in surface conduits to the storage and conveyance tunnels {{at a lower}} elevation beneath the ground surface. At several locations where <b>surge</b> <b>shafts</b> are near conventional dropshafts the two structures are combined. These combined surge and dropshaft structures have a dual purpose of conveying water from the ground level to the underground tunnels and relieving surge pressures in the system. Located throughout the system are control structures to regulate and divert the flow as required. One of these structures is designated as control structure 46 (CS 46). The structure is to be located near the Van Lare treatment plant {{at the end of}} the three-mile long siphon tunnel. This is also the downstream terminus of the 22 mile tunnel system. The. primary purpose of the structure is to raise flows coming in through the siphon tunnel and direct them to. a distribution structure at the head of the Van Lare treatment plant. The configuration of the structure in this siphon mode is intended to maximize the transport of sediment entering through the siphon tunnel, up the siphon riser, and through the bifurcation structure. Since it will be difficult to remove all the sediment in the siphon mode, the structure will be operated in the flushing mode. In this mode, supercritical flows will pass straight through the structure and enter a tunnel to the Cross:Irondequoit pumping station.

40|$|The City of Rochester, New York, is {{developing}} the {{combined sewer overflow}} and abatement plan (CSOAP) to handle sanitary sewage and storm water. The west side system contains 40 dropshafts along a 26 mile long tunnel. The function of these dropshafts is to transport the water from one elevation and energy level to a lower elevation and energy level. At several locations along the tunnel it is proposed to construct surge shafts to attenuate surge pressures in the system. To minimize construction disturbances at the surface, {{reduce the amount of}} boring and excavation, and consequently reduce the construction costs, the surge shafts have been combined with conventional dropshafts. These combined surge and dropshaft structures would have dual functions of conveying water from the ground surface to the underground tunnels and relieving surge pressures in the system. Conduits at the ground surface collect the water and convey it to a quarter cylinder elbow which deflects the water 90 degrees into a verticalrectangular shaft. The vertical shaft is located inside and at the upstream side of the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft.</b> One wall of the vertical shaft is slotted to provide for air re-entrainment and also pressure relief in the dropshaft. The <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> is a large excavated and lined cylinder which extends from the tunnel level to the ground surface. A boot is attached to the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> just below the dropshaft. Attached to the downstream side of the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> is a deaeration chamber containing a slotted weir, false crown with air slots, and a bellmouth entrance to the exit conduit. An air vent is provided along the downstream side of the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft.</b> The water falling through the elbow and vertical shaft entrains considerable air while gaining kinetic energy. The falling water-air mixture impinges {{on the floor of the}} <b>surge</b> <b>shaft.</b> The boot, <b>surge</b> <b>shaft,</b> and deaeration chamber dissipate some of the energy, remove and collect the entrained air, and direct the water at a reduced velocity into the exit conduit. Some of the entrained air is released in the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> and rises directly to the surface. The remaining air rises to the false crown in the deaeration chamber, passes through the air slots into the chamber above, and returns to the upper part of the surge tank through a vent shaft.

40|$|System {{flow control}} components, such as valves or pumps {{are a part}} of routine {{operation}} in a water distribution system. When a flow control component changes state the steady-state flow condition in the system is altered. The values of the initial flow conditions of the system, characterized by the measured velocity and pressure at positions along the pipeline change with time until the final flow conditions are established in a new steady-state condition. The physical phenomenon that occurs during this time interval is known as a hydraulic transient. Transients resulting from more rapid changes in flow rate are called waterhammer. The waterhammer causes excessively high and low pressures, which can lead to failure in the pipe system. The implementation of a surge tank is a method to intercept and reduce rapidly these extreme pressure situations. For the new hydropower station Jinping 2 in Sichuan province Southwest of china, the optimum type and dimensions of a <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> need to be determined. Within this thesis, a Matlab program is applied to determine the highest and lowest pressures in the pipe system, especially at the valve.

Rectangular conduits near the ground surface collect the storm water and convey it to a vertical part of the structure which has several components. At the lower elevation is a large excavated chamber called the sump. Extending from the sump to the ground surface is a circular <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> containing two vertical walls. A diaphragm wall {{near the center of}} the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> forms a dropshaft at the upstream end. The free trajectory inlet and diaphragm wall deflect the incoming water 90 degrees into the vertical dropshaft entraining considerable air. The water-air mixture falls down the dropshaft impinging on the sump invert. The entrained air has the effect of reducing impact pressures on the invert of the sump. A second wall at the downstream end of the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> provides an air vent for returning air to the ground surface. The purpose of the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> is to reduce pressure surges in the system. Downstream of the sump-surge shaft is the deaeration chamber. The sump and deaeration chamber provide for energy dissipation and air removal. Some air rises to the water surface in the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> and escapes; the remaining air is carried into the deaeration chamber where it is removed. The deaeration chamber contains a false crown provided with air slots. The air rises to the false crown and escapes through the air slots to a horizontal chamber above; this chamber conveys the air to the vertical air shaft at the downstream end of the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft.</b> It is desirable to remove most of the entrained air from the water before it enters the tunnels. The entrapped air in the tunnels reduces the capacity for storage and conveyance and introduces the danger of high waterhammer effects upon its sudden release, which could cause damage to the system. The release of high velocity air at ground surface structures could also be hazardous. The effectiveness of the sump and deaeration chamber in dissipating energy and removing the entrained air was one factor considered in the evaluation of the various types tested. At the downstream end of the deaeration chamber a cylindrical surface was provided as an efficient entrance to the transition. In the transition the cross section gradually changed from a square section to the round section of the exit tunnel. Design information was needed for the three drop structures in the project.

Due to complex nature of geology, construction of underground structures is a challenging issue in the Himalayan. A complete geological evaluation is essential in the entire project area for technically viable, economic and safe construction of underground structures. Geological assessment is more significant for the underground structures; unlined power tunnel, settling basins, <b>surge</b> <b>shaft,</b> powerhouse cavern, tailrace and access tunnel proposed for the case of Nyadi Hydropower Project. Nyadi Hydropower project is a run-of-river type project, located in Lamjung district of western development region of Nepal. Using the additional tailrace water of Siuri Khola Hydropower Project, the project has been planned for an installed capacity of 30 MW with a gross head of 347. 5 m. The proposed tunnel length of the project is about 4000 m with 9. 14 m 2 in cross-sectional area and about 675 m long penstock of 1. 75 m diameter to convey 11. 08 m 3 /s design flow from Nyadi Khola to the underground powerhouse. The entire project lies in metamorphic units of higher Himalayan. This thesis aims to carry out an engineering geological evaluation of all underground works for Nyadi Hydropower Project. In this regards, an alternative alignment has been proposed with the unlined power tunnel about 4270 m long, 15. 4 m 2 in cross-sectional area in which about 2330 m is high pressure and remaining about 1940 m as low pressure tunnel has been proposed to convey 18. 5 m 3 /sdesign discharge to generate 249 GWh annually. The settling basin has been designed for fibre reinforced shotcrete instead of concrete lining {{on the basis of}} cost comparison. The proposedalternative alignment excludes penstock pipe, vertical shaft and also reduces additional tunnel length nearby <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> and access road to the adit of <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> which is considerable component for the reduction in overall cost of the project. About 5 million USD will be benefited from additional energy generation during wet season with this proposed alternative layout. The entire project is located in themetamorphic units of higher Himalayas. Faults and weakness zones intersect with the alignment of power tunnel at some sections where one parent thrust zone of tectonic thrust crosses at high pressure tunnel. Further stability analysis and rock support estimation has been carried out for the proposed underground structures. The unlined high pressure tunnel experiences hydrostatic pressure up to 3. 5 MPa (35 bars). The Norwegian criterion for confinement has been used to ensure safety against hydraulic fracturing in the pressure tunnel. This has also been performed by numerical analysis using Phase 2 program. Numerical analysis using Phase 2 and Generalized Hoek-Brown failure criterion has been used for the stability analysis and rock support optimization of pressurized headrace tunnel, settling basins and powerhouse cavern. Estimation of required input parameters for numerical analysis has been based on the preconstruction phase geological investigations in the project area and lab tested based resultsfrom the similar rock type with almost similar geological conditions projects such as Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project and Middle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric project have been used to estimate rock mechanical properties. Finally, conclusion has been made on the stability and estimated rock support for the proposed alternative underground structures on the basis of analytical and numerical analysis and recommendations have been proposed for good results that resemble with the ground conditions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Power {{companies}} {{are on a}} daily basis making operational strategies to operate power plants in an efficient and good way. To do this must all impacts and challenges with influence be comprised in the analytical work. In a hydropower plant, one of these challenges is related to the estimation of friction impact from dynamics generated after regulating the water flow in the conduit. Usually are power plants constructed to operate at specific flow conditions, such operation condition may nowadays be difficult to maintain or not desirable as price and demand in the power network are always changing. To operate with economic advantage, is it thus important to find the optimal production that corresponds to the optimal combination of price and demand. Hence, the plants has to be regulated. Similar experience occur at some large hydropower plants as they have the responsibility for maintaining the stability of the network frequency by balancing the power production against consumption. Regulation introduce as mention the system to harmonic oscillatory flow, which further presents the challenge of friction modeling. The frictional effect may be difficult to foresee, as the knowledge on the frictional response is undesirably low. Economic losses and expected production are thus hard to estimate. It is thus of interest to purpose a model that can estimate the losses in a manageable way, not requiring too much computational power. In hydropower plants are one of the generated dynamics called mass oscillations, where the water mass is oscillating between two free surfaces, the surface of the upper reservoir and the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft.</b> There are today few simple models suited to predicting these oscillations. The existing models require a lot of computational power, making them unfit for power companies to use in their daily work. This challenge {{is one of the main}} motivation for this thesis, and will thus be the subject of interest to investigate closer. In the early phase of this thesis was a paper written on the work presented in a project work made by the author in the autumn of 2016 [1], and additionally the planed work of this thesis. The paper was presented at the 7 th International symposium on Current Research in Hydraulic Turbines (CRHT-VII) at Kathmandu University in April 2017 and is attached in Appendix H. The thesis starts with presenting fundamental theory and existing literature on the subject of conduit flow, friction modeling and flow dynamics in hydropower plants. Further, is the experimental test described with laboratory facilities and supported preliminary work. The thesis provides with knowledge and experience on frictional losses through five test cases, which is tested in the established dynamic test rig. The test results are compared against simulations. Four transient friction models are tested, the Quasi-steady model, the model by Ogawa et al., the model by Vitkovsky and the idea of the one-term friction model. The simulation approach for all models is described in detail before results are presented and further discussed. In the preliminary work was a dynamic test rig for measurements on harmonic oscillatory flow designed, where necessary instruments, sensors and components are installed. Four static pressure transducers and one electromagnetic flowmeter respectively measure pressure and flow rate. One of the pressure probes was located in the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> to measure the water fluctuation. Five meters downstream the upper tank is the EMF located, giving the flow rate and mean velocity. All sensors installed are located at preferred locations, satisfying fully developed flow. Additionally, a test section is established, facilitated for water flow visualization with particle image velocimetry. The dynamic test rig performed well, running with both the traditional <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> and the siphon system. Test results from laboratory measurement showed good correspondence on dynamic transient theory and how the dynamics are expected to propagate. Unsteady flow conditions introduced the fluid to additional friction, where acceleration, deceleration and zero average velocity was present. Simulation results from different models showed large variety in performance. The change in velocity seems to be the main parameter affecting the performance of the diverse modeling results. Performance showed strong relation to how each model was implementing the velocity. Flow acceleration and zero average velocity in the turnings of the oscillations seems to be the main challenges of friction modeling. The new "one-term" model shows a positive trend by providing extra friction in relation to the original Darcy-Weisbach equation under acceleration and deceleration, which correspond to measurement results. The thesis will describe the challenges closer and evaluate the models in more detail, and thus positively contribute to increasing the knowledge on the subject...|$|E
40|$|Frictional losses during {{unsteady}} {{flow in the}} waterway of power plants are a progressing science, as the hydropower market keeps evolving to a more dynamic market. In fact, the transitional region in pipe flow is a rather unknown phenomenon. The experimental data on the topic is limited {{and there are no}} analytical solutions. This study looks into the opportunity of establishing a test rig to study frictional losses in oscillating pipe flow, at the Water Power Laboratory at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Previous work on oscillating pipe flow mainly addresses flow in U-tubes. There are only a few experimental test rigs for oscillations in horizontal pipes, which primarily generates oscillations by the use of a piston. In this thesis, a different approach applies: the shutdown of a control valve generates oscillations in a horizontal pipe between a <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> and a reservoir. The study is a combination of relevant measuring techniques, laboratory considerations and applicable instrumentation to design a flexible and easy operated test rig. A review of the basic theory of transient pipe flow is {{the first part of this}} thesis. The second part presents relevant pressure transducers and connections for measuring head loss in pipe flow. Followed by measuring techniques to measure local velocities: Particle Image velocimetry, Laser Doppler Anemometer and Hot-Wire Anemometer. An important part of the study was to consider the limitations and constraints in the Water Power Laboratory. A thorough review of the laboratory was therefore necessary. The final part presents the required apparatuses and devices to create the desired flow through the test section, including challenges and alternatives to solution. The results describe the flow situations that are possible to obtain in The Water Power Laboratory. Followed by descriptions of recommended apparatuses and necessary instrumentations. At last an overview of measuring techniques recommended for specific fields of interest is presented...|$|E
40|$|Any {{changes of}} the volume flow through a turbine gives {{acceleration}} or deceleration of the masses {{of water in the}} penstock. This induces dynamic pressure changes in front of the turbine. A pressure transient must be controlled as it can cause severe damage on mechanical equipment, such as a turbine, if it becomes too abrupt. A widely used solution is to decrease the water inertia time constant, by placing surge shafts between the turbine and the reservoirs. Surge shafts introduces U-tube oscillations between the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> and any free surface. These oscillations can give problems if the surges becomes too large. Air can be drawn into the system and cause cavitation near the turbine. Free surface flow in the tunnel can occur and expose the turbine to more stress. The surge shafts must be dimensioned according to the dynamics of the system, which is usually found through numerical simulations. One dimensional modeling with discrete elements comprising inelastic water and pipes, is a well suited method for simulating U-tube oscillations in hydropower systems. The method is however restricted to a limited complexity of the system to be modeled. This thesis investigates a solution that aims to enable any system to be modeled with discrete elements of inelastic water and pipes. The use of "Virtual surge shafts" is implemented in a generic simulation program written in Matlab. Four turbine models are implemented to extend the simulation possibilities. The program is verified with the well known, fully transient simulation program LVTrans. Simulations of two hydropower systems with significantly different complexity is compared to simulation results from LVTrans. The simulations show generally good compliance with simulations produced with LVTrans. The maximum up surge and down surge deviated with less than 5 % for all simulations. It can be concluded that the use of virtual surge shafts is a feasible solution, provided that the correct cross sectional is used. The implemented turbine models have enhanced the programs ability to simulate changes on the turbine opening degree, as the turbine characteristics are included. The feasibility of "Virtual surge shafts" shows to be strongly dependent on the correct cross sectional area. It is recommended with further verification of the solution, to determine if an empirical value of the correct cross sectional area can be established...|$|E
40|$|Kirne Power Plant is {{a planned}} {{expansion}} of Khimti I Hydro Power Plant in Nepal. During the monsoon period {{there is a}} lot of excess water, and the the plan is to utilize this water in an extra power plant during the monsoon. The same tunnel as for Khimti I is to be used for the whole volume flow. A new external pressure shaft is planned for the water down to the new power house of Kirne. The hydrology is studied in this thesis, and a flow of 11 m 3 /s can be utilized in Kirne through 80 % of the monsoon, through the rest of the period, the flow is lower, on the average. The flow limit is found based on the head loss and surges in the water way. The sediment basin will have to be doubled in size to handle the doubling of the volume flow. The placing of the basin can be on the opposite riverbank of the existing settling basin. Another possibility is to build the planned power plant Khimti II upstream Khimti I, and handle the sediments there. Excavation of a volume of 170 m 3 is necessary at the top of the <b>surge</b> <b>shaft,</b> to give room for the upsurges. The down-surges are reduced by prolonging the opening time of the turbines and valves. The new pressure shaft will be a 1800 meter long external shaft of steel, with an optimal pipe diameter of 2, 16 meter. The shaft will be external due to difficult conditions in the rock, and experiences of the building of Khimti I. It will be shown that the best solution for Kirne is to install one Pelton turbine wiht five nozzles, or two Pelton turbines with three nozzles each, in the power plant. Two Pelton turbines will give a better production than one, but at the same time the costs of the power house, and the turbines will increase. The size of the turbine will be 64 MW for one turbine, and 32 MW each, if two smaller turbines are chosen. The production will be about 240 GWh depending of the flow through the year, which can be up to 30 % less than the average. The income of Kirne will be about 13 - 14 MUSD, depending on the final choices. In order to finish this thesis, a lot of assumptions are made. The power evacuation and agreements with locals and national governments are not investigated. This is done to narrow the scope of the thesis, but at these points, the largest risks of the project are placed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Hydropower {{represented}} in 1999 19 % {{of the world}} electricity production and the absolute production {{is expected to grow}} considerably during the next 30 years. Francis turbines {{play a major role in}} the hydroelectric production due to their extended range of application. Due to the deregulated energy market, hydroelectric power plants are increasingly subjecting to off design operation, start-up and shutdown and new control strategies. Consequently, the operation of Francis turbine power plants leads to transients phenomena, risk of resonance or instabilities. The understanding of these propagation phenomena is therefore paramount. This work is a contribution to the hydroacoustic modelling of Francis turbine power plants for the investigation of the aforementioned problematic. The first part of the document presents the modelling of the dynamic behavior and the transient analysis of hydroelectric power plants. Therefore, the one-dimensional model of an elementary pipe is derived from the governing equations, i. e. momentum and continuity equations. The use of appropriate numerical schemes leads to a discrete model of the pipe consisting of a T-shaped equivalent electrical circuit. The accuracy in the frequency domain of the discrete model of the pipe is determined by comparison with the analytical solution of the governing equations. The modelling approach is extended to hydraulic components such as valve, surge tanks, <b>surge</b> <b>shaft,</b> air vessels, cavitation development, etc. Then, the modelling of the Francis, Pelton and Kaplan turbines for transient analysis purposes is presented. This modelling is based on the use of the static characteristic of the turbines. The hydraulic components models are implemented in the EPFL software SIMSEN developed for the simulation of electrical installations. After validation of the hydraulic models, transient phenomena in hydroelectric power plants are investigated. It appears that standard separate studies of either the hydraulic or of the electrical part are valid only for design purposes, while full hydroelectric models are necessary for the optimization of turbine speed governors. The second part of the document deals with the modelling and analysis of possible resonance or operating instabilities in Francis turbine power plants. The review of the excitation sources inherent to Francis turbine operations indicates that the draft tube and the rotor-stator interaction pressure fluctuations are of the major concern. As the modelling of part load pressure fluctuations induced by the cavitating vortex rope that develops in the draft tube at low frequencies is well established, the focus is put on higher frequency phenomena such as higher part load pressure fluctuations and rotorstator interactions or full load instabilities. Three hydroacoustic investigations are performed. (i) Pressure fluctuations identified experimentally at higher part load on a reduced scale model Francis turbine are investigated by means of hydroacoustic simulations and high speed flow visualizations. The resonance of the test rig due to the vortex rope excitation is pointed out by the simulation while the special motion and shape of the cavitating vortex rope at the resonance frequency is highlighted by the visualization. A description of the possible excitation mechanisms is proposed. (ii) A pressure and power surge measured on a 4 × 400 MW pumped-storage plant operating at full load is investigated. The modelling of the entire system, including the hydraulic circuit, the rotating inertias and the electrical installation provides an explanation of the phenomenon and the related conditions of apparition. A non-linear model of the full load vortex rope is established and qualitatively validated. (iii) The rotor-stator interactions (RSI) are studied in the case of a reduced scale pump-turbine model. An original modelling approach of this phenomenon based on the flow distribution between the stationnary and the rotating part is presented. The model provides the RSI pressure fluctuation patterns in the vaneless gap and enables to predict standing waves in the spiral case and adduction pipe. The proposed one-dimensional modelling approach enables the simulation, analysis and optimization of the dynamic behavior of hydroelectric power plants. The approach has proven its capability of simulating properly both transient and periodic phenomena. Such investigations can be undertaken at early stages of a project to assess the possible dynamic problems and to select appropriate solutions ensuring the safest and optimal operation of the facility...|$|E
40|$|Hydropower {{development}} has resurged {{in the developed}} and in the developing countries due to the global issue of climate change, the need to reduce carbon footprints {{and the need to}} achieve energy stability and energy security. The IPCC‟s fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) had showed that renewable energy (RE) has the potential to contribute to the mitigation of climate change via the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector. Therefore, hydropower is to remain as the largest renewable source of electricity generation and its development is going to play vital roles in the supply of reliable and sustainable energy for the socio-economic development of many developing countries. The topography and large annual volumes of water flow in Bhutan combine to give huge hydropower potential. With the gross estimated capacity of 30000 MW, the energy sector is expected to {{play a significant role in}} the Bhutanese economy as a major source of revenue. Apart from the need to meeting the increasing growth in domestic energy demand, there is a huge possibility of exporting the power to India and generate revenue. The shortage of power and the thermal driven nature of the Indian grid offer ready market for the hydroelectricity from Bhutan. As such, in order to exploit this opportunity, the government has placed high priority on accelerated hydropower development. It has set ambitious target to add minimum of 10000 MW generation capacities by 2020. Several large hydropower projects are under construction and many are in the planning stages. With the accelerated hydropower development taking place in the country, the construction of tunnels and underground works are going to increase considerably in the future. Hydropower plants have to be necessarily put underground in view of the limited stable surface space and the environmental concerns, as more than 51 % of the national territory falls within the protected areas of national parks and biological corridors meant for environmental conservation. However, underground construction remains a challenge in the Himalayas. Due to active tectonics and weathering, the rocks are highly deformed, schistose and altered. Predicting rock mass quality and stability of underground constructions is difficult during planning due to high overburden, forest coverage and rugged nature of topography. Hydropower projects have experienced high discrepancies in the predicted and actual rock mass and encountered major adverse geological occurrences in tunneling, resulting in delay and cost overrun. In this thesis, engineering geological study of the Punatsangchu Stage – I Hydroelectric Project in Bhutan has been done with the aim to study the stability assessment and support requirement in Headrace tunnel and Powerhouse caverns. The details of planning and investigation works done during preparation of detailed project report have been utilized in the study. Details on rock mass collected during visit to construction site have been incorporated. The thesis deals with the review of engineering geological investigations which includes geological mapping and assessment of rock mass conditions, laboratory and in-situ tests and measurements; determination of engineering parameters of rock mass; stability assessment and estimation of rock support requirements with wedge analysis, empirical approaches and numerical modeling with Phase 2 finite element program. The HRT is a low pressure tunnel and hydraulic fracturing is not occurring even at the point of <b>surge</b> <b>shaft</b> where the maximum hydrostatic pressure is 0. 74 MPa while the minimum confining in-situ rock stress is 3. 5 MPa at the point with minimum rock cover. But due to stress redistribution after excavation, the confining stress around the tunnel periphery reduces to almost zero, which would lead to opening up of joints and raveling of rocks. Tunnel lining with concrete is necessary. However, this is only an indication as there are still uncertainties with the assumptions in the analysis. The HRT is aligned unfavorably with one minor joint set for more than 2 km stretch towards upstream of adit 1. The wedge analysis shows that in general, with the major discontinuities mapped during construction, there is formation of roof wedge in the tunnel arch back but not in the ribs. The most critical wedge indicates wedge apex height of about 5 m. This is the basis for the lengths of rock bolts in HRT. Goel‟s empirical approach qualifies the HRT at maximum rock overburden (> 500 m) for the mild squeezing condition with poor rock mass. Rock burst will not be the problem with poor jointed rock mass. With the Q-method, the ratio of maximum tangential stress and UCS of rock mass estimated by empirical methods is high, indicating heavy squeezing condition. Rock slabbing and popping is possible during heading from the junction of invert and walls due to high stress concentration in the area. During benching, the stress concentration is reduced. Deformations in the plastic analysis even after application of supports are higher than the elastic limits but are considered acceptable. The Powerhouse caverns have also been analyzed with numerical modeling. There are potential wedge formation in the cavern arch back and ribs. The most critical wedge apex heights indicates the requirement of roof bolt length of 8 - 10 m long and wall bolt length of 12 - 13 m long. The minimum distance of the rock pillar between Machine hall and Transformer hall needed is 50 - 53. 5 m. The deformation and yielding of rock mass around excavation periphery is huge. The maximum displacement in the Machine hall walls occurs at elevations from 844. 5 masl to 864. 5 masl while in Transformer hall it occurs from elevation 856. 5 masl to 867. 5 masl after full excavation. After application of full supports, the maximum displacement in Machine hall is about 174 mm occurring on the walls. This is higher than the elastic limit of 71. 8 mm but is considered acceptable. In the Transformer hall, the maximum displacement is about 111 mm and occurs in the downstream wall (R/S of the section). The stage-wise displacements in the cavern excavation vary and are given in Appendix 8 - 3. The support requirements are heavy but the results are only indicative and have to be verified with instrumentation and back analysis. Parametric study of underground excavation is carried out with the HRT section by independently varying some key rock parameters and observing displacements occurring in the excavation section. GSI is the most important rock mass parameter in the numerical analysis. It has great influence on the tunnel displacement. More importantly, it influences all other engineering parameters used in the analysis. Rock parameters have to be chosen/determined carefully that best represent the actual site condition. </p...|$|E
