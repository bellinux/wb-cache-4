Each week there is a different maqam assigned to the cantor according to the theme of the given Torah portion of the week. A pizmon may also be sung in honour of a person called up to the Torah, immediately before or after the reading: usually this is chosen so as to contain some allusion to the person's name or family.|$|E

500|$|The Scharnhorst-class {{ships were}} built with nine 28.3cm (11.1 inch) SK C/34 54.5caliber quick-firing guns in three triple turrets, two forward and one aft. These guns were an {{improvement}} over the earlier 28.3cm SK C/28 guns mounted on the Deutschland-class cruisers. While the 28.3cm guns were of a smaller caliber than main guns of other navies, they were still preferred {{by a number of}} gunnery officers in the Kriegsmarine due to their higher rate of fire. The guns were equipped with three different types of shells, an armour-piercing (AP) L/4,4 shell that weighed 330kg (727.5lb) and two high explosive (HE) shells that both weighed 315kg (694.4lb)— an L/4,4 type with a base fuse and an L/4,5 version with a nose fuse. All three types of shells used the same propellant charges: an RPC/38 42.5kg (93.7lb) fore charge and an RPC/38 76.5kg (168.6lb) main charge. They fired these shells at a rate of fire of 3.5rounds per minute. Muzzle velocity for the AP shells was 890meters per second (2,920feet per second); the guns were expected to fire 300 rounds before enough wear had been incurred to warrant replacement. Scharnhorsts and Gneisenaus guns were mounted in three Drh LC/34 turrets. The turrets were named, in alphabetical order from the bow of the ship: [...] "Anton", [...] "Bruno" [...] and [...] "Cäsar". Similarly to most other German installations, those turrets had an electric <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> but all other operations were hydraulic systems. Although rotating mass of the turret was 750 tonnes (internal barbette diameter 10.2 m), traversing speed was quite good– 7.2 deg/sec. The turrets allowed depression of the guns to −8° and elevation to 40° for [...] "A" [...] and [...] "C" [...] turrets, while [...] "B" [...] turret was capable of depressing to −9°. At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to 40,930m (44,760yards).|$|E

It is {{equipped}} with a 300hp (220kW) MTU / Mercedes electronic engine with overcharging by turbocharger and intercooler. The boomerang suspension has received improvements in performance, the disc brake system is completely new and the engine exhaust drawing as well, expelling the air upwards and not backwards, thus reducing the thermal signature of the car. It also provides a highly praised air conditioning system for the crew. Integrates night vision for the driver and shooting systems. The tower received the electro-hydraulic <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> and tube elevation (back-up by manual system) similar to that used in the German KMW's Leopard tank, as well as receiving the laser, thermal and infrared rangefinder systems made by Orlaco, of Netherlands, selected by the commander and / or shooter through a joystick and associated keys, and increased ammunition capacity in the tower. On the outside, two anti-tank missile launchers (ATGM), which can be sized to receive both systems such as MSS-1.2 (integrating the laser rangefinder of the vehicle) and more sophisticated ones like the Russian Ataka and the Israeli Spike (with autonomous acquisition and targeting system) ...|$|E
6000|$|Whilst these {{passport}} difficulties {{were being}} solved, {{the rest of}} the party was as busy in settling about passage and passage-money. The peculiar rules of the port of Suez require a few words of explanation.[FN#10] [...] "About thirty-five years ago" [...] (i.e. about 1818 A.D.), [...] "the ship-owners proposed to the then government, with the view of keeping up freight, a Farzah, or <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> It might be supposed that the Pasha, whose object notoriously was to retain all monoplies in his own hands, would have refused his sanction to such a measure. But it so happened in those days that all the court had ships at Suez: Ibrahim Pasha alone owned four or five. Consequently, they expected to share profits with the merchants, and thus to be compensated for the want of port-dues. From that time forward all the vessels in the harbour were registered, and ordered to sail in rotation. This arrangement benefits the owner of the craft ‘en depart,' giving him in his turn a temporary monopoly, with the advantage of a full market; and freight is so high that a single trip often clears off the expense of building and the risk of losing the ship-a sensible succedaneum for insurance companies. On the contrary, the public must always be a loser by the ‘Farzah.' Two of a trade do not agree elsewhere; but at Suez even the Christian and the Moslem shipowner are bound by a fraternal tie, in the shape of this rotation system.

Various failures of the drive belts (foot shear, tooth wear, hollowed teeth, back cracks) are common in rotating machines and can cause economic losses. To increase efficiency, reliability and safety of the machines the use of new fault diagnosis techniques of belts, identification and classification is required. In this paper Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet transform complementary methods are used for fault monitoring of drive belts, analyzing {{in this way the}} limitations and advantages of using these methods. Experimental investigations for the fault diagnosis of drive belts are made using experimental platform and Bruel & Kjaer equipment for measuring vibration and PULSE and MATLAB software for recorded signal processing.
