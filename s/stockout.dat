5000|$|<b>Stockouts</b> {{frustrate}} shoppers {{and force}} them to take a number of corrective actions that are beyond the retailer’s control. Understanding how consumers respond to <b>stockouts</b> is therefore {{the starting point for}} retailers who wish to improve on-shelf availability. When shoppers are unable to find an item that they had intended to purchase, they might switch stores, purchase substitute items (brand switch, size switch, category switch), postpone their purchase or decide not to buy the item at all. [...] Although these responses differ in severity, each entails negative consequences for retailers. <b>Stockouts</b> cause lost sales, dissatisfy shoppers, diminish store loyalty, jeopardize marketing efforts, and obstruct sales planning, because substitution disguises true demand. Moreover, shopper surveys reveal <b>stockouts</b> to currently be the most prevalent annoyance to shoppers. Shoppers spend a considerable amount of time looking for and asking for out-of-stock items. [...] Shopper response to <b>stockouts</b> has been investigated by researchers with respect to cognitive response (e.g. perceived availability), affective response (e.g. store satisfaction), behavioural response (e.g. brand switching) and aggregated response in terms of category sales effects. [...] Studies find shopper response to out-of stocks depends on brand-related antecedents (e.g. brand equity), product and category-related antecedents (hedonic level), store-related antecedents (e.g. service or price-oriented), shopper-related antecedents (e.g. shopper age) and situational antecedents (e.g. purchase urgency).|$|R
40|$|Economic {{magnitude}} {{of the increase in}} <b>stockouts</b> The empirical analysis in the paper finds that, on average, taking on high leverage increases <b>stockouts</b> by about 8 to 9 percent. To put this magnitude in perspective, I construct an estimate of the profit impact of an 8 percent increase in <b>stockouts</b> for the average supermarket firm. The calculation, which is presented in Panel A of Table A 1, trades off the benefit of reduced inventory investment for the lost profits from forgone current and future sales. The value of reduced inventory investment equals the decrease in inventories times the cost of carrying inventory, which includes storage, utilities, handling, insurance, taxes, obsolescence, and the cost of capital. On the other hand, more frequent <b>stockouts</b> reduce current sales when customers substitute to lowervalue products or cancel their intended purchase of the out-of-stock item. The profit impactof this substitution equals the value of forgone sales (which others have estimated based on surveys of customer substitution patterns) times the gross margin on these products. More frequent <b>stockouts</b> also have a longer-run impact on sales in that the firm is likely to lose customers when its reputation for service deteriorates. Assuming the firm forgoes sales to a lost customer in perpetuity, the profit impact of customer switching equals the value of forgone annual sales time...|$|R
5000|$|Safety stock {{term used}} by logisticians to {{describe}} a level of extra stock that is maintained to mitigate risk of <b>stockouts</b> (shortfall in raw material or packaging) due to uncertainties in supply and demand. Adequate safety stock levels permit business operations to proceed according to their plans. [...] Safety stock is held when there is uncertainty in demand, supply, or manufacturing yield; it serves as an insurance against <b>stockouts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The models {{differ in}} their {{attitude}} towards <b>stockouts.</b> Most authors consider either backlogs, when the demand must be fulfilled later {{at the expense of}} providing lower price or lost sales which also includes some theoretical costs (e.g., loss of goodwill, loss of profit, etc.). Some models include a service level constraint, which limits the occurrence or quantity of expected <b>stockouts.</b> Even the 100% service level can be achieved with additional or emergency production (e.g., overtime, outsourcing) for higher costs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of product {{availability}} in attracting consumer demand. We start with a newsvendor model, but additionally assume that <b>stockouts</b> are costly to consumers. The seller sets an observable price and an unobservable stocking quantity. Consumers anticipate the likelihood of <b>stockouts</b> and determine whether to visit the seller. We characterize the rational expectations equilibrium in this game. We propose two strategies that the seller can use to improve profits: (i) commitment (i. e., the seller, ex ante, commits to a particular quantity) and (ii) availability guarantees (i. e., the seller promises to compensate consumers, ex post, if the product is out of stock). Interestingly, the seller has an incentive to overcompensate consumers during <b>stockouts,</b> relative to the first-best benchmark under which social welfare is maximized. We find that first-best outcomes do not arise in equilibrium, but can be supported when the seller uses a combination of commitment and availability guarantees. Finally, we examine the robustness of these conclusions by extending our analysis to incorporate dynamic learning, multiple products, and consumer heterogeneity. availability guarantee, commitment, product availability, search costs, <b>stockouts,</b> newsvendor, rational expectations...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>stockout,</b> or out-of-stock (OOS) {{event is}} an event that causes {{inventory}} to be exhausted. While out-of-stocks can occur along the entire supply chain, the most visible kind are retail out-of-stocks in the fast-moving consumer goods industry (e.g., sweets, diapers, fruits). Stockouts are the opposite of overstocks, where too much inventory is retained.|$|E
40|$|The study {{primarily}} {{investigated the}} role of single sourcing strategy in either exacerbating or mitigating persistent supply failure in Malawi’s public healthcare delivery supply chain. It also investigated {{the role of}} the single supplier in recurrent drug <b>stockouts</b> in the country’s public hospitals. The study was conducted at five public healthcare delivery centres in southern Malawi. Data was collected using two sets of self administered questionnaires to, hospital managers and procurement staff at participating hospitals. Follow up interview with randomly selected managers were also scheduled to complement the data from questionnaires. The study findings confirmed that single sourcing exacerbates the risk of supply failure, evidenced by persistent <b>stockouts</b> of drugs in hospitals that consequently put at risk lives of many patients who rely on the public healthcare system. Such <b>stockouts</b> had multiple effects on the public healthcare delivery supply chains ranging from death of patients, deterioration of medical conditions of patients, hospital overcrowding, to transfer of patients to other hospitals (mostly private). Failure by the government instituted single supplier namely the Central Medical Stores, to maintain an adequate inventory of drugs both in quantity and variety, was found {{to be the most important}} cause of <b>stockouts.</b> From the study, it has been shown that the single sourcing strategy exacerbated the risk of supply failure, and is therefore generally inappropriate for healthcare delivery systems. It is hoped that these findings will help policy makers in making the right procurement strategies and policies in order to enhance healthcare delivery...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{authors have}} shown that if demand that cannot be filled from stock is {{partially}} backordered, then using the full-backordering model or assuming that all <b>stockouts</b> will result in lost sales can lead to substantial increases in cost relative to using a model that specifically recognizes {{the percentage of the}} <b>stockouts</b> that will be backordered. The models that these authors developed resulted in procedures or equations that are relatively difficult to use. In this paper we take a different approach to modeling the deterministic EOQ with partial backordering that results in equations that are more like the comparable equations for the basic EOQ and its full-backordering extension.

Data gathered from a third party provider of information services are then used to illustrate that this incentive arrangement may, at least implicitly, be employed in industry.

40|$|Approved for Public release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe classic single echelon inventory model is restructured as a two echelon problem in which demand and resupply are deterministic. Using cost minimization as the objective, three models are developed which {{address the problems}} of (1) no <b>stockouts</b> allowed (EOQ), (2) backorders allowed, and (3) finite production with no <b>stockouts</b> allowed. General solutions for the optimal policy are obtained in the EOQ and finite production models. In the backorder model, the analytical argument {{is limited to the}} case in which only time dependent backorder costs occur. Algorithms are developed for solving problems for all three models, and selected parameter values are used to test the behavior of the models. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

50|$|Several factors {{determine}} how much delivery time stock and safety stock should be held. In summary, the efficiency of a replenishment system affects how much delivery time is needed. Since the delivery time stock is the expected inventory usage between ordering and receiving inventory, efficient replenishment of inventory would {{reduce the need for}} delivery time stock. And the determination of level of safety stock involves a basic trade-off between the risk of <b>stockout,</b> resulting in possible customer dissatisfaction and lost sales, and the increased costs associated with carrying additional inventory.|$|E

This is a more conservative strategy and opposite of a lead capacity strategy. It decreases the risk of waste, but it may result {{in the loss of}} possible customers either by <b>stockout</b> or low service levels. Three clear advantages of this strategy are a reduced risk of overbuilding, greater productivity due to higher utilization levels, and the ability to put off large investments as long as possible.

Medical information is used to issue orders (look-ahead approach), in a 'pulled' flow of information from bed to hospital pharmacy warehouses.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{behavioral}} theory to predict actual ordering behavior in multilocation inventory systems. The theory {{rests on a}} well-known stylized fact of human behavior: people's preferences are reference dependent. We incorporate reference dependence into the newsvendor framework by assuming that there are psychological costs of leftovers and <b>stockouts.</b> We also hypothesize that the psychological aversion to leftovers {{is greater than the}} disutility for <b>stockouts.</b> We then experimentally test the proposed theory in both the centralized and decentralized inventory structures using subjects motivated by substantial financial incentives. Consistent with the proposed theory, actual orders exhibit the so-called "pull-to-center" bias and the degree of bias is greater in the high-profit margin than in the low-profit margin condition. These systematic biases are shown to eliminate the risk-pooling benefit when the demands across store locations are strongly correlated. Because the proposed model nests the standard inventory and ex post inventory error minimization theories as special cases, one can systematically evaluate the predictive power of each alternative using the generalized likelihood principle. We structurally estimate all three theories using the experimental data, and the estimation results strongly suggest that the proposed behavioral theory captures actual orders and profits better. We also conduct two experiments to validate the behavioral model by manipulating the relative salience of the psychological costs of leftovers versus that of <b>stockouts</b> to alleviate the pull-to-center bias. multilocation inventory system, newsvendor, behavioral operations management, experimental economics...|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to minimize the expected cost of <b>stockouts</b> over all line items subject to a budget constraint, given the probability distribution of demand. The concept of static marginal analysis is applied in the generation of a revised Repair Material Requirements List.
