5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on Australia's {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped delay the takeover of South Vietnam, {{and the spread of}} communism to Laos and Cambodia, by almost a decade. [...] "Whether that was worthwhile", he added, [...] "is a matter for the historian to judge". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict [...] "unless you are prepared to win", because it was [...] "not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can just put one foot in and feel the temperature".|$|E

I think I {{became interested in the}} question of what if nothing ever popped that balloon? What if you couldn't tell the difference between when you were awake and when you were asleep? And then I started {{looking for a way to}} marry those two ideas up, and a few months later we had Awake." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the last}} song created for Revival, Gomez has called [...] "Me & the Rhythm" [...] a {{personal}} favorite from the record. When asked about collaborating with Gomez, Michaels commented: [...] "I think Selena {{is a lot}} like Justin and I, in the way that…when you find <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> feel connected to, and it's real and it's honest, you don't let it go. You see where it can lead you." [...] A snippet of the track was first teased along with the official artwork on September 26, 2015. Later, the song was fully released as the album's first and only promotional single, a week before album release, followed by the album's two singles, [...] "Good for You" [...] and [...] "Same Old Love".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Spears revealed that her idea initially was to make an album that was [...] "fresh-sounding [...] for the clubs or <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> play in your car when you're going out at night that gets you excited, but I wanted it to sound different from everything else out right now." [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] is a party song with a heavy club beat. The elements used on the song's background were compared to similar used on songs by The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga, while its bass line {{was said to be}} [...] "a cousin of the ground" [...] for the Eurythmics' 1983 single [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)".|$|E
500|$|Burshtein found {{creating}} a believable relationship between Yiftach Klein and Hadas Yaron {{to be one}} of the more challenging aspects of the production. She hoped to keep the relationship between Yochay and Shira enigmatic, with a strong undercurrent of tension, throughout the film. One method of doing so was ensuring that the actors never touched while filming. She explained, [...] "That's how we see the enigma—the power of wanting and then restraining. The restraining is the power. The passion cannot exist if you have it all the time—the passion is only for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't have. You have to work to keep the passion. Judaism is all about that." [...] Burshtein considered including a scene in which Shira and Yochay kissed about halfway through the movie but decided against it, believing that the energy would be lost.|$|E

Chefs and media personalities [...] Anthony Bourdain, Gordon Ramsay, and Mario Batali also guest starred in the episode, but as themselves in a dream sequence.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010, Perry revealed that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was the first song she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour (2009). Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells, who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry considers it {{to be like that}} of a two-part song because she had started working on [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] before she met Brand, and completed it after they began dating. She stated it is a [...] "really special" [...] song to her because, at {{the first part of the}} track, it is a story that she needed to let out, which was claiming to know <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not actually know. Perry later expressed relief at being able to put all of her feelings into [...] "Not Like the Movies".|$|E
500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had [...] "sent a message to everyone that music is free, and that's disturbing. It's easy {{to do that when}} you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> worry about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away hundreds of millions of albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E
500|$|Katie Hasty of HitFix was not {{impressed}} by the lyrical potential of the song, stating that with lines like [...] "sunburned baby / hurts like crazy," [...] "we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight" [...] and rhyming [...] "yum yum" [...] with [...] "some some" [...] won't get this song [...] "very good scores on the SAT". She concluded by stating that: [...] "In fact, it seems that Lopez goes {{out of her way}} to sing with a little-girl inflection to her 41-year-old pipes. But it comes off youthful, upbeat, and a little lighter than the single [...] and her island-inflected collaboration with Lil Wayne, 'I'm Into You'." [...] Amos Barshad of Vulture questioned Lopez' music, stating that [...] "with the other facets of her multimedia empire clicking [...] why does she insist on continuing to make music? Why not sit back, relax, and enjoy the fact that there is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do that people like? [...] Well, one can only assume, Jennifer Lopez keeps making music because Jennifer Lopez actually loves making music. And that's admirable".|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the iPhone 5S, the German Chaos Computer Club {{announced}} on September 21, 2013 that they had bypassed Apple's new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by using [...] "easy everyday means". The group explained that the security system had been defeated by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image to make a latex model thumb which was then pressed against the sensor to gain access. The spokesman for the group stated, [...] "We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token." [...] However, in 2013, 39% of American smartphone users used no security measures at all to protect their smartphone. Others have also tried Chaos Computer Club's method, but concluded that it is not an easy process in either time or effort, given that the user has to use a high resolution photocopy of a complete fingerprint, special chemicals and expensive equipment, and because the spoofing process takes some time to achieve.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Paige's first full studio album of new {{recordings}} in 12years was marked in 2006, titled Essential Musicals. The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted. At this point, Paige had recorded 20 solo albums in total, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum, {{and she had}} been featured on seven cast albums. Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. On 20 and 21 December 2006, she performed in concert in Shanghai, extending her concert tour to two dates to satisfy demand. With a noticeable absence from musical theatre, having not taken a role for many years, she explained in 2006 that [...] "there's been nothing that I've wanted to do, and if you're going to commit to a year at the theatre, six days a week, and have no life, then it's got to be <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want to do with all your heart". [...] She also affirmed that she believes for older actors it becomes harder to obtain theatre roles.|$|E
500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny. And when I write Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E

I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|... 20th Century Fox, Gracie Films, and Film Roman {{produced}} an animated The Simpsons film that {{was released on}} July 27, 2007. The production staff of The Simpsons had entertained {{the thought of a}} film since early in the series, but production never came together. Groening felt a feature-length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for a TV series. The film was directed by David Silverman and written by a team of Simpsons writers comprising Groening, Brooks, Jean, Reiss, Mirkin, Scully, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Work continued on the screenplay from 2003 onwards and did not cease, taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. He also wanted to make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, as [...] "we wanna really give you <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> haven't seen before." [...] Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded.|$|E

Time Out Rio de Janeiro stated that [...] "It was roundly rejected by traditional critics and short-sighted viewers." [...] Opinions were revised after its restoration in 1952 for a screening at the 1st Brazilian Cinema Retrospective, when it [...] "deeply impressed" [...] the directors who {{would be part of}} Cinema Novo movement in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, Glauber Rocha was especially impressed and later cited it as [...] "one of the 20 best films of all time" [...] in his book Revisão Crítica do Cinema Brasileiro. Another film director, Walter Lima, Jr., declared, [...] "there are two films that are such clear archetypes of Brazil's eternal quest, namely Limite and Ganga Bruta. They represent <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to polish and something that determines its own space, suggesting {{at the same time that}} something more exists beyond its confines." [...] In 2015 it would be further recognized by the Brazilian Film Critics Association as the 24th best Brazilian film of all time on its Top 100.|$|E
