This assumes that heat may enter or leave the system, and that input <b>shaft</b> <b>work</b> can appear as both increased pressure (usually useful work) and increased temperature above adiabatic (usually losses due to cycle efficiency). Compression efficiency is then the ratio of temperature rise at theoretical 100 percent (adiabatic) vs. actual (polytropic). Polytropic compression will use a value of n between 0 (a constant-pressure process) and infinity (a constant volume process). For the typical case where an effort is made to cool the gas compressed by an approximately adiabatic process, the value of n will be between 1 and k.|$|E

Firstly, it establishes the equivalent stiffness matrix and damping matrix of the rotation shaft with mechanical seal in the fixed-coordinate system, then derives the motion equation {{of the shaft}} with mechanical seal and applies the numerical simulation method to analyze and gain the vibration characteristics of the rotation shaft with mechanical seal system. Numerical simulation results show that: when the rotation <b>shaft</b> <b>works</b> {{at the speed of}} the subcritical speed, the trajectory of centre will change with the speed of the shaft.

6000|$|... § XVI. We {{have not}} spoken of the {{intermediate}} form, b, of Fig. LXIX. (which its convenience for admission of light has rendered common {{in nearly all}} architectures), because it has no transitions peculiar to itself: in the north it sometimes shares {{the fate of the}} outer architrave, and is channelled into longitudinal mouldings; sometimes remains smooth and massy, as in military architecture, or in the simpler forms of domestic and ecclesiastical. In Italy it receives surface decoration like the architrave, but has, perhaps, something of peculiar expression in being placed between the tracery of the window within, and its shafts and tabernacle work without, as in the Duomo of Florence: in this position it is always kept smooth in surface, and inlaid (or painted) with delicate arabesques; while the tracery and the tabernacle work are richly sculptured. The example of its treatment by colored voussoirs, given in Plate XIX., may be useful to the reader as a kind of central expression of the aperture decoration of the pure Italian Gothic;--aperture decoration proper; applying no <b>shaft</b> <b>work</b> to the jambs, but leaving the bevelled opening unenriched; using on the outer archivolt the voussoirs and concentric architrave in reconcilement (the latter having, however, some connection with the Norman zigzag); and beneath them, the pure Italian two-pieced and mid-cusped arch, with rich cusp decoration. It is a Veronese arch, probably of the thirteenth century, and finished with extreme care; the red portions are all in brick, delicately cast: and the most remarkable feature of the whole is the small piece of brick inlaid on the angle of each stone voussoir, with a most just feeling, which every artist will at once understand, that the color ought not to be let go all at once.|$|E
5000|$|Non-mechanical {{work also}} {{contrasts}} with <b>shaft</b> <b>work.</b> <b>Shaft</b> <b>work</b> {{is the other}} of the two mainly considered kinds of mechanical contact work. It transfers energy by rotation, {{but it does not}} eventually change the shape or volume of the system. Because it does not change the volume of the system it is not measured as pressure-volume work, and it is called isochoric work. Considered solely in terms of the eventual difference between initial and final shapes and volumes of the system, <b>shaft</b> <b>work</b> does not make a change. During the process of <b>shaft</b> <b>work,</b> for example the rotation of a paddle, the shape of the system changes cyclically, but this does not make an eventual change in the shape or volume of the system. <b>Shaft</b> <b>work</b> is a kind of contact work, because it occurs through direct material contact with the surrounding matter at the boundary of the system. A system that is initially in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium cannot initiate any change in its internal energy. In particular, it cannot initiate <b>shaft</b> <b>work.</b> This explains the curious use of the phrase [...] "inanimate material agency" [...] by Kelvin in one of his statements of the second law of thermodynamics. Thermodynamic operations or changes in the surroundings are considered to be able to create elaborate changes such as indefinitely prolonged, varied, or ceased rotation of a driving shaft, while a system that starts in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is inanimate and cannot spontaneously do that. Thus the sign of <b>shaft</b> <b>work</b> is always negative, work being done on the system by the surroundings. <b>Shaft</b> <b>work</b> can hardly be done indefinitely slowly; consequently it always produces entropy within the system, because it relies on friction or viscosity within the system for its transfer. The foregoing comments about <b>shaft</b> <b>work</b> apply only when one ignores that the system can store angular momentum and its related energy.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{operation}} of the gas turbine {{is similar to that}} of the steam power plant except that the working fluid is air instead of water. Fresh atmospheric air flows through a compressor that brings it to higher pressure. Energy is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. This high-temperature high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a <b>shaft</b> <b>work</b> output in the process. The turbine <b>shaft</b> <b>work</b> is used to drive the compressor and other devices such as an electric generator that may be coupled to the shaft.

50|$|Thermodynamic work is {{performed}} by actions such as compression, and including <b>shaft</b> <b>work,</b> stirring, and rubbing. A simple case is work due to change of volume against a resisting pressure. Work without change of volume {{is known as}} isochoric work, for example when an outside agency, in the surroundings of the system, drives a frictional action {{on the surface of}} the system. In this case the dissipation is usually not confined to the system, and the quantity of energy so transferred as work must be estimated through the overall change of state of the system as measured by both its mechanically and externally measurable deformation variables (such as its volume), and its corresponding non-deformation variable (such as its pressure). In a process of transfer of energy as work, the change of internal energy of the system is then defined in theory by the amount of adiabatic work that would have been necessary to reach the final from the initial state, such adiabatic work being measurable only through the externally measurable mechanical or deformation variables of the system, that provide full information about the forces exerted by the surroundings on the system during the process. In the case of some of Joule's measurements, the process was so arranged that heat produced outside the system (in the paddles) by the frictional process was practically entirely transferred into the system during the process, so that the quantity of work done by the surrounds on the system could be calculated as <b>shaft</b> <b>work,</b> an external mechanical variable.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{kind of work}} is isochoric work, {{that is to say}} {{work that}} involves no eventual overall change of volume of the system between the initial and the final states of the process. Examples are friction {{on the surface of the}} system as in Rumford's experiment; <b>shaft</b> <b>work</b> such as in Joule's experiments; and slow vibrational action on the system that leaves its eventual volume unchanged, but involves friction within the system. Isochoric work for a body in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is done only by the surroundings on the body, not by the body on the surroundings, so that the sign of isochoric work with the present sign convention is always negative.|$|E
