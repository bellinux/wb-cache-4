5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians {{recruited}} {{an army of}} 40,000, many drawn locally from Transylvania. Many knights and Hungarian aristocrats followed, one of {{them being}} Stefan Báthory. With them, they brought 500 cannons and other heavy siege equipment. The Moldavians, being fewer in number and <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hungarians were determined to wage war, started to evacuate the population close to the Hungarian border and blockaded the passages by cutting down trees and placing them on the roads.|$|E

5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{constituted}} {{the first major}} conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire and represents {{the first phase of}} the Greco-Persian Wars. Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, but Darius had vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the revolt. Moreover, <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> political situation in Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, he decided to embark on the conquest of all Greece.|$|E
5|$|It {{was planned}} that the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move past 1st Infantry Brigade once Grévillers was {{captured}} {{but it was}} forced into action early, when its commander, Brigadier General Robert Young, <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 37th Division was struggling to take its objective of Biefvillers, decided to use his brigade to assist. Accordingly, two battalions cleared the village by 10:00 am although casualties were incurred when they were fired upon by some Whippet tanks. The commander {{of one of the}} attacking battalions, along with its padre, intervened and directed the tanks onto Biefvillers. With the village captured, this secured the flank of 1st Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Americans {{were likely}} to build a Nicaragua Canal, {{the owners of the}} defunct French company, {{including}} Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who still had exclusive rights to the Panama route, lowered their price. Beginning in early 1902, President Roosevelt became a backer of the latter route, and Congress passed legislation for it, if it could be secured within a reasonable time. In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia. Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia's acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay-Herrán Treaty, granting $10 million to Colombia for the right to build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later. In August, however, the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate.|$|E

5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{constituted}} {{the first major}} conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire, and as such represents {{the first phase of}} the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, according to Herodotus, Darius decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, began as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Brigade {{commander}} {{had been}} taken ill, so Birdwood appointed Brigadier-General Harold Walker, a staff officer already ashore, as commander. The Auckland Battalion had landed by 12:00, and were being sent north along the beach to Walker's Ridge {{on their way to}} Russell's Top. <b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way along the ridge was in single file along a goat track, Walker ordered them to take the route over Plugge's Plateau. As each New Zealand unit landed they were directed the same way to Baby 700. However, in trying to avoid Turkish fire, they became split up in Monash Valley and Rest Gully, and it was after midday that two of the Auckland companies reached Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{served as}} a Border Ruffian in a company {{under the command of}} Captain Henry Clay Pate. On June 2, 1856, Washington and his company were {{attacked}} at their encampment near Baldwin City, Kansas by anti-slavery Free-Stater forces under the leadership of abolitionist John Brown. Upon <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Free-Staters' reinforcements were nearby, Captain Pate instructed Washington to send for reinforcements of their own. Washington departed during {{the early stages of the}} engagement to send for reinforcements, and sustained slight wounds. Pate surrendered to Brown and his men, and Brown took 25 of the Border Ruffians as prisoners. The attack came to be known as the Battle of Black Jack or the Black Jack Point Affray.|$|E

5|$|With {{defeat at}} Lade, the Ionian Revolt {{was all but}} ended. The next year, the Persians reduced the last rebel strongholds, and began the process of {{bringing}} peace to the region. The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire, and as such represents {{the first phase of}} the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the revolt.

5|$|A {{month and}} a half after Joaquim Inácio's marriage, Emperor PedroI abdicated and sailed to Europe. Since the former emperor's son and heir Dom PedroII was a minor, a regency was formed, and {{more than a decade of}} {{instability}} and turmoil ensued. On 6 October 1831, navy artillerymen, held under suspicion of plotting a mutiny, escaped the presiganga (prison ship) in which they had been confined. Joaquim Inácio commanded the schooner Jaguaripe which, along with other vessels, had been guarding the prison ship. <b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> artillerymen had set sail for Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Inácio and a few men took a boat to warn the city. They encountered musket fire from the artillerymen, who then changed course for the nearby Ilha das Cobras (Island of the Snakes) in the face of strong opposition from the mainland. They were defeated the next day when three columns of men from the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion and Permanent Municipal Guard Corps invaded the island.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

5|$|Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly {{released}} to Army Group Don, by Army Group A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered {{back to its}} original area of concentration, and did not prepare {{to go back to}} Army Group Don until 10 days after it had been asked for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviets were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own, from the opposite side, upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E
5|$|By mid-September, Grant warned Boutwell {{to be on}} {{his guard}} as the gold price {{continued}} to rise, while the conspirators bought ever more and the rising price affected the wider economy. Grant, <b>seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> increase was unnatural, told Boutwell to sell gold, which reduced its price. Boutwell did so the next day, on September 24, 1869, later known as Black Friday. The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould's scheme as the gold price plummeted, relieving the economic tension. This caused a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves. A Congressional investigation followed, chaired by James A. Garfield and cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Agesilaus's army, after {{brushing}} off {{attacks from}} the Thessalians during its march through that country, {{had arrived in}} Boeotia, where it was met by an army gathered from the various states of the anti-Spartan alliance. Agesilaus's force from Asia, composed largely of emancipated helots and mercenary veterans of the Ten Thousand, was augmented by half a Spartan regiment from Orchomenus, and another half a regiment that had been transported across the Gulf of Corinth. These armies met each other at Coronea, in Theban territory; as at Nemea, both right wings were victorious, with the Thebans breaking through {{while the rest of}} the allies were defeated. <b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest of their force had been defeated, the Thebans formed up to break back through to their camp. Agesilaus met their force head on, and in the struggle that followed a number of Thebans were killed before the remainder were able to force their way through and rejoin their allies. After this victory, Agesilaus sailed with his army across the Gulf of Corinth and returned to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. <b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chinese {{military}} was weaker than the superior Japanese forces, Tan stepped up his anti-Japanese campaign. In 1936, he raised {{enough money for}} the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes. In 1937, the Chinese Relief Fund Committee was set up with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman. In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the China Salvation Movement was born, with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. Tan fled to Indonesia {{just a few days}} before the fall of Singapore as he knew he would likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain. He returned to Singapore after the war and continued to play an active role in community services and charity work before returning to China in 1950. He died at the age of 87 in Beijing on 12 August 1961 and was accorded a national funeral by the People's Republic of China government for his various contributions to society.|$|E
