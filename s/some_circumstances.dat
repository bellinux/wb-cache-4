5|$|All Hubble data is {{eventually}} made available via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at STScI, CADC and ESA/ESAC. Data is usually proprietary—available {{only to the}} principal investigator (PI) and astronomers designated by the PI—for one year after being taken. The PI can apply {{to the director of}} the STScI to extend or reduce the proprietary period in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E
5|$|Psychological {{studies found}} that {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E

5|$|The {{extended}} family consists of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. In <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the {{extended family}} comes to live either with or {{in place of a}} member of the nuclear family. An example includes elderly parents who move in with their children due to old age. This places large demands on the caregivers, particularly the female relatives who choose to perform these duties for their extended family.|$|E
5|$|The term {{is mostly}} used in {{historical}} contexts {{and not in}} daily speech. In Danish, Skånelandene is used more often. The terms have no political implications as the region is not a geopolitical entity but a cultural region, without officially established political borders. In <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the term Skåneland, {{as opposed to the}} terms Skånelandskapen and Skånelandene, can also be used as a figure of speech for the province Scania.|$|E
5|$|The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) {{strongly}} reflects UV {{light and}} this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances</b> can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.|$|E
50|$|The {{main cause}} is undereating {{due to a}} medical {{condition}} such as decreased appetite, anorexia nervosa, digestive disease, or due to <b>some</b> <b>circumstance</b> such as fasting or {{lack of access to}} food. Hyperthyroidism can also be a cause.|$|R

5|$|Two of the judges, Justice Deane and Justice Gaudron, {{went further}} and {{suggested}} {{that the right to}} representation in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances</b> is founded in the Constitution. They said that Chapter Three of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature with the notion of separation of powers, and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires that judicial process and fairness be observed.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances</b> if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their {{insurers}} {{for the loss of}} the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
50|$|In <b>some</b> <b>circumstance,</b> {{the current}} in the winding of a {{toroidal}} inductor contributes {{only to the}} B field inside the windings and makes no contribution to the magnetic B field outside of the windings. This {{is a consequence of}} symmetry and Ampère's circuital law.|$|R
25|$|Conversion price: The {{nominal price}} per share at which {{conversion}} takes place, this number is fixed at the issuance {{but could be}} adjusted under <b>some</b> <b>circumstance</b> described in the issuance prospectus (e.g. Underlying stock split).

5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances.</b> There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs) are two or {{more police}} {{officers}} who are deployed by UK police forces to gather intelligence {{on the ground and}} in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> to disrupt activists and deter anti-social behaviour. They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of overt surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled that they must justify retention of photographs on a case-by-case basis. Any retained information is recorded on the Crimint database.|$|E

In addition, {{there are many}} [...] "industry standard" [...] flanges that in <b>some</b> <b>circumstance</b> may be used on ASME work.|$|R
5|$|In <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Procedural due process, {{arising from}} the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, is {{minimally}} the right to notice and a hearing, but has been held to include in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances</b> rights to counsel and rights to confrontation. Procedural due process is required any time a person faces the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As substantive due process arises from the liberty clause, a deprivation of a substantive due process right is a deprivation of liberty and thus requires procedural due process.|$|E
5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were the exception to the rule.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between growth and offshoring in a small economy. The movement of jobs abroad is of concern for many economies. I show, that growth is enhanced by offshoring in an economy that does offshore. Further, offshoring {{is seen as a}} potential for countries that receive offshoring. Therefore analysing a small economy that receives the offshoring I show that there are adverse effect under <b>some</b> <b>circumstance...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In <b>some</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>some</b> <b>circumstances</b> {{where this}} is not the case, and it is {{desirable}} to make the width of the transition line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and minimum values for the reflected light. The accepted method for increasing the band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in <b>some</b> <b>circumstances</b> relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E
60|$|Much more {{might be}} said very easily on this side; nevertheless, I think I shall go on with my plea for the small verse-maker who has long fallen out; and though I {{may be unable to}} make a case out, the kindly critic may find <b>some</b> <b>circumstance</b> to extenuate my folly--to say, in the end, that this appears {{to be one of the}} little foolishnesses which might be forgiven.|$|R
