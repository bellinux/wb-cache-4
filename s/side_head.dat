25|$|In 1998, Volvo {{installed}} a head-protecting airbag, {{which was made}} standard in all new models {{as well as some}} existing models. The IC head-protecting airbag was not available on the 1997 C70 since the initial design deployed the airbag from the roof, and the C70, being a convertible, could not accommodate such an airbag. A later version of the C70 featured a head-protecting airbag deploying upwards from the door, avoiding this problem. It has been stated by many testing authorities that <b>side</b> <b>head</b> protecting curtain airbags can reduce the risk of death in a side impact by up to 40% and brain injury by up to 55%, as well as protect occupants during a rollover. In 1998, Volvo introduced its Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), a safety device to prevent injury to front seat users during collisions.|$|E
25|$|Further, from 1995 {{designs were}} {{required}} {{to be drawn from}} a reference plane (template), and strict limitations were enforced as to the minimum and maximum tolerances for aspects of the vehicle such as the size of the cockpit opening (an idea well known in Champ Car for a decade) and of aerodynamic devices, commonly called wings. Further, maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.5 litres to 3 litres. Further changes were mandated as the FIA continued to try to curb the increase in speeds of Formula One cars as the years progressed. These changes included the increase in size of the cockpit opening (to ensure driver egress was easy and to minimise possible <b>side</b> <b>head</b> impacts), introducing grooved tyres (to reduce cornering speeds by reducing grip) and narrower bodywork (this would complicate cooling and also reduce cornering speed), raising and reducing wing sizes and elements (cutting aerodynamic downforce, thus reducing cornering speed), and introducing comprehensive checks on stiffness tolerances and measurements to ensure cars conformed completely with the regulations (for example, weight tests on wings and bodywork to ensure that they maintained integrity and did not flex to give an aerodynamic advantage in a straight line).|$|E
2500|$|The Rover 75 was {{designed}} with reinforced footwells, underfloor box beams, side impact bars and a [...] "ring of steel" [...] around each door opening to prevent jamming {{in case of}} an impact. [...] Driver and front passenger head and side airbags are fitted as standard, with <b>side</b> <b>head</b> [...] "windowbags" [...] available as an option until 2005 when they became standard equipment. If the window airbags had been standard equipment {{at the time of its}} Euro NCAP crash test in 2001, it would have scored the full five stars for the adult occupant impact rating. [...] Also fitted are disc brakes all round, anti-lock brakes (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) with a traction control system (TCS) available as an option on 2.0 engines and above. [...] On models fitted with Rover's Hi-Line infotainment system, a speed warning indicator was also included. [...] Additionally, electronic stability control (ESC) was due to be made standard fitment on the 75 from the 2006 model year onwards.|$|E

The construction method {{of the joint}} section connecting bridge and tunnel was simulated by FEM. After Calculating and comparing the result of stresses and effect of displacement-control in the surrounding rock under three methods of construction, it shown that the <b>side</b> <b>heading</b> method was very advantageous for the stress concentration, and the CRD method provided a good control of bottom heave, as for the top heave, the double <b>side</b> <b>heading</b> method was more favorable. From the dynamic analysis, the vehicle load is found to have, though small, wide influence.
