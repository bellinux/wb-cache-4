5|$|During the Great Depression, both {{enrollment}} and alumni donations <b>shrank.</b> While the faculty size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's {{survival in the}} administrations of Edmund D.

The percentage of Non-Hispanic whites declined from 82.8% in 1950 to 11.6% by 2010. The percentage of Latinos in Newark grew between 1980 and 2010, from 18.6% to 33.8% while that of Blacks decreased from 58.2% to 52.4%.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the Denver & Rio Grande Western {{began to}} phase out steam {{locomotives}} in favor of diesel locomotives, which require less maintenance. With the change in technology, Thistle faded in importance. Gradually the town <b>shrank</b> in population; the passenger depot was torn down in 1972 and the post office closed in 1974. By 1983, only a few families remained in Thistle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shrink</b> bands serve two {{purposes}} in the marketplace. Tamper evident <b>shrink</b> bands indicate if a product has been altered during fabrication, distribution or sale.

5|$|Roman {{city life}} and culture changed greatly {{in the early}} Middle Ages. Although Italian cities {{remained}} inhabited, they contracted significantly in size. Rome, for instance, <b>shrank</b> from a population {{of hundreds of thousands}} to around 30,000 {{by the end of the}} 6th century. Roman temples were converted into Christian churches and city walls remained in use. In Northern Europe, cities also <b>shrank,</b> while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals. Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities, the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. Officially they were tolerated, if subject to conversion efforts, and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas.|$|E
5|$|The Glider Pilot Regiment {{suffered}} the highest proportion of fatal casualties {{during the battle}} (17.3% killed). The regiment was so badly depleted that during Operation Varsity RAF pilots were used to fly many of the gliders. As glider operations were phased out after the war, the regiment <b>shrank</b> and was eventually disbanded in 1957.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} amphibians {{evolved in}} the Devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians <b>shrank</b> in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} Clan MacAulay and the fortune of the Lairds of Ardincaple diminished from the 17th century into the 18th century. Successive lairds {{were forced to}} divide and sell, piece by piece, the lands once governed by the clan. As the laird's {{resources}} dried up, their lands fell into decay, and the once expansive lands of Ardincaple <b>shrank</b> to only a few farms.|$|E
5|$|After 1970, as Fort Lauderdale became {{essentially}} built out, {{growth in}} the area shifted to suburbs to the west. As cities such as Coral Springs, Miramar, and Pembroke Pines experienced explosive growth, Fort Lauderdale's population stagnated, and the city actually <b>shrank</b> by almost 4,000 people between 1980, when the city had 153,279 people, and 1990, when the population was 149,377. A slight rebound brought the population back up to 152,397 at the 2000 census. Since 2000, Fort Lauderdale has gained slightly over 18,000 residents through annexation of seven neighborhoods in unincorporated Broward County.|$|E
5|$|After the punt, the Pirates {{were unable}} to obtain a first down. Three plays netted only twoyards, and ECU was forced to punt the ball away. On the ensuing drive, Boise State {{completed}} three first downs on the series. BSU kicker Kyle Brotzman, converted a 31yard field goal and the Broncos <b>shrank</b> the ECU lead further. The series went 40yards in nine plays. It took the team two minutes and 37seconds to score.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's {{own party}} was {{breaking}} down underneath him. There {{had been no}} official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government's existing nine-seat majority <b>shrank</b> during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, {{as a result of}} by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann were two of the government's most ardent opponents in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF <b>shrank</b> to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would {{find it hard to}} maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, it was hard for the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E
5|$|Tel Aviv {{gained in}} status, while Haifa {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} the role as regional capital. The opening of Ashdod as a port exacerbated this. Tourism <b>shrank</b> when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing Tiberias as a tourist centre. Nevertheless, Haifa's population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration from the former Soviet Union boosted the population by a further 35,000. Many of Wadi Salib's historic Ottoman buildings have now been demolished, and in the 1990s a major section of the Old City was razed {{to make way for a}} new municipal center.|$|E

5|$|Temperatures {{rose in the}} mid-continent {{during the}} Middle Archaic, a warming trend known as the Hypsithermal. Grasslands {{expanded}} east, forests became less common, and many Iowa lakes <b>shrank</b> or disappeared. Humans responded by diversifying their subsistence strategy: eastern Iowa saw a shift towards river resources, and western Iowa towards Plains resources. Excavated sites in eastern and central Iowa include the Brash Site, the Gast Spring Site, and the Ed’s Meadow Site. Western Iowa sites include the Turin Site, Horizon I of the Cherokee Sewer Site, and the Pony Creek Site.|$|E
5|$|The Army Service Forces was {{abolished}} on 14 May 1946, on {{the recommendation}} of War Department's Simpson Board, but the Army Ground Forces remained. Devers' November 1945 testimony before the board had urged that the Army Service Forces be retained. Army Ground Forces was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization gathered pace, the strength of the army <b>shrank</b> dramatically. Devers was faced with the unpleasant task of informing many officers that they were being demoted. One reform that he did achieve was {{to reduce the number of}} combat branches to just three: infantry, armor and artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army <b>shrank</b> {{with every}} costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the James River, forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg, Virginia. Lincoln then made an {{extended}} visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed {{the president to}} confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.|$|E
