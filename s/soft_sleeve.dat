Billboard did not chart the record as a single either, but as an EP; on the Hot 100, it peaked at number 68, which was also the highest position it achieved on the Cash Box chart. Capitol deleted 4 by the Beatles from its catalogue on 31 December 1965.|$|E
40|$|There is much {{interest}} in form-fitting, low-modulus, implantable devices or soft robots that can mimic or assist in complex biological functions such as the contraction of heart muscle. We present a soft robotic sleeve that is implanted around the heart and actively compresses and twists {{to act as a}} cardiac ventricular assist device. The sleeve does not contact blood, obviating the need for anticoagulation therapy or blood thinners, and reduces complications with current ventricular assist devices, such as clotting and infection. Our approach used a biologically inspired design to orient individual contracting elements or actuators in a layered helical and circumferential fashion, mimicking the orientation of the outer two muscle layers of the mammalian heart. The resulting implantable soft robot mimicked the form and function of the native heart, with a stiffness value of the same order of magnitude as that of the heart tissue. We demonstrated feasibility of this <b>soft</b> <b>sleeve</b> device for supporting heart function in a porcine model of acute heart failure. The soft robotic sleeve can be customized to patient-specific needs and may have the potential to act as a bridge to transplant for patients with heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of plastic deformation of bimetal co-extrusion process. Extrusion is related to large deformation of material and leads to non-homogeneous deformation within work-piece material. The mechanism of plastic deformation during the composite rod extrusion is much more complicated than that in single metal extrusion. Deformation patterns of co-extrusion of two different materials are characterized by several process parameters. In this paper, the analysis is focused to investigate the effect of contact conditions along the interface between two different materials. The rigid-plastic finite element method was applied to the analysis of co-extrusion process. The selected materials are AA 1100 aluminum alloy as hard material and CDA 110 as soft one. This type of material selection was to examine the effect of hard core and <b>soft</b> <b>sleeve</b> and vice versa in terms of deformation pattern. The initial composite billets were prepared by inserting the core material in tight (0. 023 mm) and weak (0. 012 mm) interference bonding, respectively. Four different cases of co-extrusion process in terms of material combination and interference bonding were simulated to investigate the effect of material arrangement between core and sleeve, and of bonding on the plastic zones. It is concluded from the simulation results that the plastic zones in this co-extrusion process are not influenced much by the selection of material arrangements or bonding condition between construction materials. However, it was seen from the simulation results that the extrusion ratio of each construction material, i. e. homogeneity of co-extrusion, depends much on the material arrangement and the bonding condition...|$|E

30|$|Osteotomies {{differ in}} the extent of {{surgical}} exposure necessary to complete them. With larger exposure and greater dissection, soft tissue stripping can occur and damage to the vital periosteum and ultimately vascular supply to the osteotomy can occur. Percutaneous techniques have been developed but do carry {{a higher risk of}} injury to vascular and neurological tissue. The deleterious effects of open exposure can be diminished nevertheless, by preserving the periosteum and <b>soft</b> tissue <b>sleeve</b> surrounding the bone.|$|R
50|$|Glass {{centrifuge}} tubes can be {{used with}} most solvents, but tend to be more expensive. They can be cleaned like other laboratory glassware, and can be sterilized by autoclaving. They must be handled with care, since small scratches can cause failure under the strong forces imposed during a run. Glass tubes are inserted into <b>soft</b> rubber <b>sleeves</b> to cushion them during runs. Plastic centrifuge tubes, especially tend to be less expensive and, with care, can be just as durable as glass. Water is preferred when plastic centrifuge tubes are used. They are more difficult to clean thoroughly, and are usually inexpensive enough to be considered disposable.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a response-effort intervention on the occurrence of self-injurious hand mouthing and a competing response (object manipulation) with 4 individuals who had profound developmental disabilities. During Phase 1, results of functional analyses showed that all participants engaged in high levels of hand mouthing in the absence of social contingencies, suggesting that the behavior was maintained by automatic reinforcement. In Phase 2, preferred leisure items were identified for participants during assessments in which duration of leisure item manipulation was used as the index of preference. In Phase 3, participants were observed to engage in high levels of hand mouthing and in varying levels of object manipulation when they had free access to their most preferred leisure items during baseline. The effects of increased response effort on hand mouthing and object manipulation were then evaluated in mixed multiple baseline and reversal designs. The response-effort condition was identical to baseline, except that participants wore <b>soft,</b> flexible <b>sleeves</b> that increased resistance for elbow flexion but still enabled participants to engage in hand mouthing. Results showed consistent decreases in SIB and increases in object manipulation during the response-effort condition for all participants. These results suggested that a less preferred reinforcer (produced by object manipulation) may substitute for a more highly preferred reinforcer (produced by hand mouthing) when response effort for hand mouthing was increased.

30|$|The {{use of a}} stemmed {{constrained}} revision component with structural distal femoral allograft composite {{has been}} described as an effective means of providing both implant and fracture stability [50 – 53]. This technique involves subperiosteal excision of involved distal femur with retention of <b>soft</b> tissue <b>sleeve</b> containing collateral ligaments and reconstruction with a structural allograft and a stemmed semiconstrained total knee prosthesis. Reconstruction of the distal femur with such a composite allows reattachment of host tissue, including the collateral ligaments, which provides additional stability to the knee postoperatively, thus circumventing the use of a hinged prosthesis. Kraay et al. published their results of using allograft–prosthesis composite in seven patients. They reported one case of dislocation and one popliteal artery injury, and two cases had persistent instability and required bracing. However, all components were well fixed at an average follow-up of 44 months [51]. Kassab et al. reported their experience of using distal allograft in periprosthetic fractures of the distal femur with poor bone stock in 12 patients. They achieved good interface union with no migration and loosening in nine out of ten patients available for review at a mean follow-up of 6  years [52]. More recently, Backstein et al. reported results of using 68 structural allograft around the knee for different indication including 17 periprosthetic femoral fractures. They did not separately report the results in periprosthetic fracture patient group, but overall they had only one nonunion, two cases of fractures through allograft and four cases of deep infection. Overall, 14.8 % required revision at an average follow-up of 5.4 years [53].|$|R
30|$|The {{anatomical}} dissections {{confirmed that}} the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is an unavoidable anatomical hazard for a pin inserted into the anterior inferior iliac spine. Grothaus et al. [15] demonstrated that the nerve emerges medial to the ASIS (6 – 73  mm) as multiple branches in 27 % of cases under cover of the inguinal ligament and courses laterally. These variations in its location means that it may pass close to the anterior inferior iliac spine and that damage can only be avoided by blunt dissection {{and the use of}} drill and <b>soft</b> tissue <b>sleeves</b> during pin insertion [16, 17]. The femoral neurovascular bundle lies well medial and is at little risk during pin insertion but if the track of the pin is not carefully followed on the internal oblique view by fluoroscopy, then there is risk of penetrating the sciatic notch and potentially injuring the superior gluteal neurovascular bundle and lumbosacral trunk. This study showed that there is at least 10  cm of bone available for pin purchase in the adult pelvis that correlates well with the biomechanical studies of pin fixation at this site [10, 12]. Noordeen et al. [12] investigated the mode of failure of pins inserted into either anterosuperior (behind the ASIS) or anteroinferior (above the AIIS) sites in response to a lateral closing force. The anteroinferior site failed gradually and at a higher load than the anterosuperior site indicating that {{within the confines of the}} bony pelvis this peri-acetabular site was suitable for external fixation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the {{literature}} it is mentioned that ski boots might decrease balance ability and this increases injury risk. The use of knee braces during skiing might help in knee stabilization and, therefore, improve balance ability. Eight female sport {{students participated in}} this study (age 24. 88 ± 2. 1 years; BMI 21. 6 ± 1. 97). Four knee supports were tested: the first (B 1) was a <b>soft</b> knee <b>sleeve</b> with a reinforcement around the patella and two thin flexible metal bars for the lateral stabilization; the second (B 2) was a neoprene sleeve with thin flexible metal bars for the lateral stabilization; the third (B 3) was an elastic brace with double-joint metallic bars for the lateral stabilization, a reinforcement and a hole around the patella and fixation straps; the fourth (B 4) was a massive knee brace with a more rigid structure ideated to return to sport after injury. The balance ability test was performed using the MFT-S 3 Check System. The test was repeated five times, one without knee brace and one with each type of knee brace, in randomized order. Wearing the B 3 a worsening in balance ability in comparison with the condition without brace was found. Wearing B 2 the stability index (symmetry of the platform movement) in the anterior-posterior direction was significantly better than wearing the more cumbersome braces B 3 and B 4. No significant differences between the conditions were detected for the balance ability in the medio-lateral direction. From this pilot study it is possible to conclude that knee braces might influence balance ability wearing ski boots...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of continuous passive, and intent-based assisted movements for neuromuscular training {{can be incorporated}} into a robotic elbow sleeve. The objective {{of this study is to}} propose the design and test the functionality of a <b>soft</b> robotic elbow <b>sleeve</b> in assisting flexion and extension of the elbow, both passively and using intent-based motion reinforcement. First, the elbow sleeve was developed, using elastomeric and fabric-based pneumatic actuators, which are soft and lightweight, in order to address issues of non-portability and poor alignment with joints that conventional robotic rehabilitation devices are faced with. Second, the control system was developed to allow for: (i) continuous passive actuation, in which the actuators will be activated in cycles, alternating between flexion and extension; and (ii) an intent-based actuation, in which user intent is detected by surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors attached to the biceps and triceps, and passed through a logic sequence to allow for flexion or extension of the elbow. Using this setup, the elbow sleeve was tested on six healthy subjects to assess the functionality of the device, in terms of the range of motion afforded by the device while in the continuous passive actuation. The results showed that the elbow sleeve is capable of achieving approximately 50 % of the full range of motion of the elbow joint among all subjects. Next, further experiments were conducted to test the efficacy of the intent-based actuation on these healthy subjects. The results showed that all subjects were capable of achieving electromyography (EMG) control of the elbow sleeve. These preliminary results show that the elbow sleeve is capable of carrying out continuous passive and intent-based assisted movements. Further investigation of the clinical implementation of the elbow sleeve for the neuromuscular training of neurologically-impaired persons, such as stroke survivors, is needed...|$|R
