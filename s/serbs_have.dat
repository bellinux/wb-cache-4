5|$|One {{explanation}} for the recent population decrease is the Croatian War of Independence. During the war, large sections of the population were displaced and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly Serb areas, more than 400,000 Croats and other non-Serbs were either removed from their homes by the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence. In 1995, during {{the final days of}} the war, more than 120,000 and perhaps as many as 200,000 Serbs fled the country before the arrival of Croatian forces during Operation Storm. Within a decade following the end of the war, only 117,000 Serb refugees returned out of the 300,000 displaced during the entire war. Most of Croatia's remaining Serbs never lived in areas occupied in the Croatian War of Independence. <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> been only partially re-settled in the regions they previously inhabited, while some of the settlements previously inhabited by Serbs were settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly from Republika Srpska.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{significant}} migrations {{came as a}} result of the 19911995 Croatian War of Independence. In 1991, more than 400,000 Croats and other non-Serbs were displaced by the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence in areas with significant Serb populations. During the final days of the war, in 1995, between 120,000 and 200,000 Serbs fled the country before the arrival of the Croatian forces during Operation Storm. Ten years after the war, only 117,000 Serb refugees returned out of the 300,000 displaced during the entire war. Most of the Serbs in Croatia who remained never lived in areas occupied during the Croatian War of Independence. <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> been only partially re-settled in the regions they previously inhabited; some of these areas were later settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, largely from the Republika Srpska.|$|E

5000|$|The Serbian Uprising in Banat (1594) {{included}} territories part of modern Romania. There were reprisals, contemporary sources speaking of [...] "the living envied the dead". After the crushing {{of the uprising}} in Banat, many Serbs migrated to Transylvania {{under the leadership of}} Bishop Teodor; the territory towards Ineu and Teiuș was settled, where <b>Serbs</b> <b>had</b> lived since earlier - the <b>Serbs</b> <b>had</b> their eparchies, opened schools, founded churches and printing houses.|$|R

25|$|The {{relations}} between Kosovo-Albanians and <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> been hostile since {{the rise of}} nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century. During Communism in Yugoslavia, the ethnic Albanians and Serbs were strongly irreconcilable with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that ethnic Albanians and Serbs rarely accepted each other as neighbours or friends and few held interethnic marriages. Ethnic prejudices, stereotypes and mutual distrust between ethnic Albanians and <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> remained common for decades. The level of intolerance and separation between both communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to be worse than that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia which also had tensions but held some closer {{relations between}} each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} of the NDH authorities to resistance had been to burn down the villages where this had occurred, and there were mass shootings of Serbs, which escalated {{the level of violence}} even further. In late May and June, 173 <b>Serbs</b> <b>had</b> been rounded up, tortured and killed in Nevesinje, and in early June, another 140 <b>Serbs</b> <b>had</b> been killed at Ljubinje. In response, Serbs attacked Ustaše officials and facilities, and conducted raids themselves, killing Muslim villagers.|$|R

25|$|Many <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> {{contributed to}} the field of science and technology.

50|$|At {{the time}} there was no active combat in the Joševica area, as the forces of rebel <b>Serbs</b> <b>had</b> already {{occupied}} the area. <b>Serb</b> military commanders <b>had</b> also made guarantees to the local Croats that they would enjoy peace and safety if they didn't partake in armed resistance.|$|R

25|$|Sometimes the Serbian {{authorities}} {{cooperated with}} the Germans as matter of course, whereas others took individual initiative; some Serbian military commanders rounded-up Gypsies {{so they could be}} concentrated in one area, where they were shot. German occupiers declared Serbia Judenfrei in August 1942. The major concentration camps in Serbia were Sajmište and Banjica but many others like Topovske Supe, Schabatz, and Nisch concentration camps also interned considerable numbers of Jews. Before the war was concluded, upwards of 14,500 Serbian Jews were murdered. Legends about Serbs saving the Jews in World War II are widespread in Serbia, and 132 <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> been honored as righteous Gentiles.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Alija Izetbegović, The Hague {{revealed}} that he was under investigation for war crimes; however the prosecutor did not find sufficient evidence in Izetbegović's lifetime to issue an indictment. Other Bosniaks who were convicted of or are under trial for war crimes include Rasim Delić, {{chief of staff of}} the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment on 15 September 2008 for his failure to prevent the Bosnian mujahideen members of the Bosnian army from committing crimes against captured civilians and enemy combatants (murder, rape, torture). Enver Hadžihasanović, a general of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was sentenced to 3.5 years for authority over acts of murder and wanton destruction in Central Bosnia. Hazim Delić was the Bosniak Deputy Commander of the Čelebići prison camp, which detained Serb civilians. He was sentenced to 18 years by the ICTY Appeals Chamber on 8 April 2003 for murder and torture of the prisoners and for raping two Serbian women. <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> accused Sarajevo authorities of practicing selective justice by actively prosecuting Serbs while ignoring or downplaying Bosniak war crimes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} and months {{following}} the assassination, Arghezi's articles blamed the push toward war on Serbian nationalism and the Balkans question at large: [...] "Until such time as when Europe shall incorporate and enslave the Balkans, they will endure as the nest where all of Europe's assassinations are being organized"; [...] "the <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> staged an attempt on Austria's existence, in dastardly manner." [...] Arghezi had set his mind on continued neutrality, arguing that it could turn Romania into an arbiter and broker of peace. A similar position was held by Karnabatt.|$|E
50|$|The Serbian Revival {{threatened}} to jeopardize Austria, to question its strategic interests. The <b>Serbs</b> <b>had</b> established the short-lived Serbian Vojvodina during the 1848 Revolutions through armed {{conflict with the}} Hungarians, {{as part of the}} Revival.|$|R
50|$|In the {{municipality}} {{according to the}} 2011 census there are 978 Turks or 1% of {{the municipality}} population. The number of <b>Serbs</b> <b>has</b> decreased due to boycott {{and the creation of}} the Serb-majority municipality of Parteš.|$|R
5000|$|According to the 10th-century De Administrando Imperio (DAI), {{written by}} the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, a second {{migration}} of Slavs into the Balkans occurred {{during the reign of}} Heraclius (r. 610-640). DAI mentions Croats and <b>Serbs</b> <b>having</b> settled the Western Balkans, the <b>Serbs</b> <b>having</b> founded [...] "baptized Serbia" [...] (known erroneously in historiography as Raška) which included the land of Bosna. The other Serb-inhabited lands (or principalities) that were mentioned in the DAI included the maritime Paganija, Zahumlje and Travunija, while maritime Duklja was held by the Byzantines (it was presumably settled with Serbs as well). All of the maritime lands bordered Serbia to the north.|$|R
500|$|Every November, Vukovar's {{authorities}} hold {{four days}} of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a [...] "Procession of Memory" [...] held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by {{tens of thousands of}} people from across Croatia. Local <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term [...] "Liberation Day" [...] has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply [...] "18 November". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or šajkača. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the Vuka flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, and they feel great stress if they do. A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to [...] "safety". As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an [...] "invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group." ...|$|E

50|$|Following {{the first}} multi-party {{election}} results, {{in the autumn}} of 1990, the republics of Slovenia and Croatia proposed transforming Yugoslavia into a loose confederation of six republics. By this proposal, republics would have right to self-determination.
