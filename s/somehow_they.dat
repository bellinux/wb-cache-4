The Americans learned to do it later. But at that time, Hahn and Strassmann were really the only ones who could do it. And that was because they were such good chemists. <b>Somehow</b> <b>they</b> really succeeded in using chemistry to demonstrate and prove a physical process.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Banach–Tarski paradox {{the number of}} pieces is finite and the allowed equivalences are Euclidean congruences, which {{preserve}} the volumes. Yet, <b>somehow,</b> <b>they</b> end up doubling {{the volume of the}} ball! While this is certainly surprising, some of the pieces used in the paradoxical decomposition are non-measurable sets, so the notion of volume (more precisely, Lebesgue measure) is not defined for them, and the partitioning cannot be accomplished in a practical way. In fact, the Banach–Tarski paradox demonstrates {{that it is impossible to}} find a finitely-additive measure (or a Banach measure) defined on all subsets of a Euclidean space of three (and greater) dimensions that is invariant with respect to Euclidean motions and takes the value one on a unit cube. In his later work, Tarski showed that, conversely, non-existence of paradoxical decompositions of this type implies the existence of a finitely-additive invariant measure.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Scully has {{discovered}} that the yellow substance mainly consists of organic material found in digestive juices, although it appears plant-like. Arriving at the field, Scully accidentally steps on another mushroom, and begins hallucinating. Scully and the coroner start to look for Mulder, only to find his skeletal remains. Back at the coroner's office, Scully identifies Mulder's remains from his dental records but finds no evidence of the secretion on the skeleton. Later, at Mulder's wake Mulder shows up, clearly alive. [...] Suddenly, the wake congregation disappears. As Mulder and Scully discuss what has happened, they both begin {{to realize that they}} are still in the cave being digested by the substance while they are comatose; <b>somehow,</b> <b>they</b> are sharing the same hallucination. As the realization occurs, they both awaken, deep in the cave and Mulder fights {{his way out of the}} ground dragging Scully behind him to safety.|$|E

Olympus demonstrates all too painfully how much Old Japan tolerates a lack of accountability among senior executives; inadequate disclosure; a disinclination to challenge authority and absolute deference to corporate boards regardless of share performance." [...] While he also observed that {{the independence of the}} directors was inadequate, he said Japanese executives were much more moderately paid compared to American ones. [...] "Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. Tough questions are rarely asked." [...] Errol Oh of The Star said a company apology for a fall in the share price [...] "trivialises the possible wrongdoings and misplaces emphasis on an effect rather than the cause ... Takayama's remark on the 'inconvenience' of a fall in share price reflects a common flaw in the mindset of the people who run listed companies. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>they</b> {{lose sight of the fact}} that they manage businesses, not share prices." ...|$|E

2500|$|Juan Seguín {{stated that}} with him, 15 men also entered {{to defend the}} Alamo. Lindley {{believes}} that the Flores brothers were defending the Alamo during the siege. After serving at the Battle of Béxar, Salvador {{was one of the}} few, 100 or so, that remained at the Alamo with Neill. His brother Manuel, and other Tejanos (15) entered on February 23. Neill's roster places Captain Flores in the Alamo as an artillery officer. Captain Flores also appears on Colonel Neill's voting tally, as well. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>they</b> seem to have exited soon after Seguin's departure, thus putting them on the Alamo survivor list. In 1907, Enrique Esparza claimed that Santa Anna called an armistice and he remembers some Flores leaving then. [...] They took this opportunity to gather Alamo reinforcements, bringing along a couple more of the Flores brothers (according to Seguin, they had a Tejano force of 100 when they regrouped in Gonzales), and secure their families (having not been seen, since abruptly entering the Alamo). They then rendezvoused with Seguin, now in Gonzales. [...] The company headed for the Alamo. The Tejano defenders were joined by up to fourteen more men from Gonzales (led by former Alamo couriers Alsbury and Sutherland). They proceeded toward the Alamo. There they waited on the Cibolo Creek to team up with Fannin. The Alamo fell before they could reach it.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{emancipation}} of Jews in 1867, the Jewish {{population of the}} Kingdom of Hungary (as well as the ascending German population) actively embraced Magyarization, because they saw {{it as an opportunity}} for assimilation without conceding their religion. (We also have to point out {{that in the case of}} the Jewish people that process had been preceded by a process of Germanization earlier performed by Habsburg rulers). Stephen Roth writes, [...] "Hungarian Jews were opposed to Zionism because they hoped that <b>somehow</b> <b>they</b> could achieve equality with other Hungarian citizens, not just in law but in fact, and that they could be integrated into the country as Hungarian Israelites. The word 'Israelite' (...) denoted only religious affiliation and was free from the ethnic or national connotations usually attached to the term 'Jew'. Hungarian Jews attained remarkable achievements in business, culture and less frequently even in politics. During the cabinet of pm. István Tisza three Jewish men were appointed as ministers. The first was Samu Hazai (Minister of War), János Harkányi (Minister of Trade) and János Teleszky (Minister of Finance). But even the most successful Jews were not fully accepted by the majority of the Magyars as one of their kind—as the events following the Nazi German invasion of the country in World War II so tragically demonstrated." [...] However, in the 1930s and early 1940s Budapest was a [...] for Slovak, German and Austrian Jewish refugees and a center of Hungarian Jewish cultural life.|$|E
2500|$|In 705, Wu Zetian {{was overthrown}} in a coup, {{and her son}} and crown prince Li Xian, {{formerly}} emperor, was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). [...] Around this time, Cui Shi became Kaogong Yuanwai Lang (考功員外郎), a low level official at the ministry of civil service affairs. [...] Upon Emperor Zhongzong's restoration, initially, five officials who were instrumental in the coup that overthrew Wu Zetian and restored him, Zhang Jianzhi, Cui Xuanwei, Huan Yanfan, Jing Hui, and Yuan Shuji, were powerful chancellors, but Emperor Zhongzong's cousin (Wu Zetian's nephew) Wu Sansi the Prince of Dejing, who was also the lover of Emperor Zhongzong's wife Empress Wei, soon became a trusted and powerful advisor to Emperor Zhongzong. [...] Huan and Jing feared what machinations Wu Sansi might have, and so tried to make Cui Shi an associate and have him {{keep an eye on}} Wu Sansi, but Cui Shi, realizing that Emperor Zhongzong trusted Wu Sansi and not the coup leaders, instead revealed the coup leaders' plans to Wu Sansi. [...] Subsequently, he became a strategist for Wu Sansi, and at Wu Sansi's recommendation was made Zhongshu Sheren (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (中書省). [...] The coup leaders were subsequently, after accusations by Wu Sansi, all exiled to the Lingnan region in 706 with provisions that they would never be allowed to return to the capital Chang'an. [...] However, Cui Shi warned Wu Sansi that if <b>somehow</b> <b>they</b> returned to the capital later, they would create problems for him, and that they should somehow be killed in exile. [...] Wu Sansi agreed, and at Cui Shi's recommendation, commissioned Cui Shi's cousin Zhou Lizhen (周利貞) to visit the Lingnan region, ostensibly to review the region, but with instructions to kill the five coup leaders. [...] When Zhou reached the region, Zhang and Cui Xuanwei had already died, and Zhou had Huan, Jing, and Yuan killed cruelly.|$|E
