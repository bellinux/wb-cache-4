5|$|The eastern <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> is {{an example}} of a {{destructive}} insect in fir and spruce forests. Birds are a natural form of biological control, but the Trichogramma minutum, a species of parasitic wasp, has been investigated as an alternative to more controversial chemical controls.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
25|$|The {{forests of}} Anticosti Island are typical boreal forest, with common {{species such as}} white spruce, balsam fir, and black spruce. It is {{distinguished}} by some minor stands of American white birch and trembling aspen. Balsam fir is slowly being replaced with white spruce because of intensive grazing done by deer and by periodic outbreaks of hemlock looper and <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm.</b> About {{a quarter of the}} island is covered by peat lands.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{economically}} important pests among the tortrix moths belong to this tribe, {{for example the}} Light brown apple moth and the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworms.</b> The larvae are often polyphagous.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>budworms</b> and {{relatives}} are {{a group of}} closely related insects in the genus Choristoneura. Most are serious pests of conifers. There are nearly forty Choristoneura species, and even more subspecies, or forms, with a complexity of variation among populations found {{throughout much of the}} United States and Canada, and about again this number in Eurasia.|$|R
40|$|Dispersal {{flights of}} {{selected}} species of forest insects which {{are associated with}} periodic outbreaks of pests that occur over large contiguous forested areas are discussed. Gypsy moths, <b>spruce</b> <b>budworms,</b> and forest tent caterpillars were studied for their massive migrations in forested areas. Results indicate that large dispersals into forested areas are due to the females, except {{in the case of}} the gypsy moth...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the forest}} around the lake, {{there are large}} numbers of {{northern}} flickers, American robins, hermit thrushes, mountain chickadees, dark-eyed juncos, western tanagers, red-breasted nuthatches, yellow-rumped warblers, chipping sparrows, song sparrows, red crossbills, golden-crowned kinglets, ruby-crowned kinglet, Townsend's solitaire, and Steller's jays. [...] The forest {{is also home to}} western wood pewee, olive-sided flycatcher, Hammond's flycatcher, American dusky flycatcher, warbling vireo, brown creeper, brown-headed cowbird, and pine siskin. [...] Pileated woodpeckers and hairy woodpeckers have been abundant in the forest around the lake since the 1990s when the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> infestation increased the insect population they feed on.|$|E
2500|$|The {{watershed}} that drains into Suttle Lake covers [...] [...] The watershed {{is covered}} by a mixed conifer forest that receives an average of [...] to [...] of precipitation annually. [...] The primary tree species in the watershed are ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and jack pine along with Douglas-fir and other fir species. [...] As a result, the watershed is normally covered by a dense forest canopy. [...] However, a western <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> infestation reached epidemic levels in 1993, defoliating {{large areas of the}} Suttle Lake watershed. [...] In 2003, the forest around the lake was burned by the B Complex Fires.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{sometimes}} described, e.g., by Switzer (1960), as relatively {{resistant to}} attack by insects and disease, white spruce {{is far from}} immune to depredation. Important insect pests of white spruce include the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> (Choristoneura fumiferana [...] ), the yellow-headed spruce sawfly (Pikonema alaskensis Rohwer), the European spruce sawfly (Gilpinia hercyniae [...] ), and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis [...] ) (Fowells 1965, Rose and Lindquist 1985, Ives and Wong 1988). As well, other budworms, sawflies, and bark beetles, gall formers, bud midges, leaf miners, aphids, leaf eaters, leaf rollers, loopers, mites, scales, weevils, borers, pitch moths, and spittlebugs cause varying degrees of damage to white spruce (Ives and Wong 1988).|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} insect hibernacula include self-spun silk hibernacula, {{such as those}} made and used by <b>Spruce</b> <b>budworms</b> as they moult and overwinter in their second instars. Woolly bear {{caterpillars}} overwinter as caterpillars and grow to be Isabella tiger moths. They use plant debris as makeshift hibernacula, {{to protect themselves from}} extreme elements. For freeze-avoidant insects, ideal hibernacula are dry, as freeze-avoidant insects are less likely to dampen and freeze in them, however moist hibernacula promote inoculative freezing for freeze-tolerant insects.|$|R
50|$|Under normal conditions, large fires {{like those}} of 1988 occur only once in every few generations. But, with {{approximately}} 40% of the Yellowstone still vulnerable to large-scale burns, any increased fire risk due to climate change would pose a significant problem. The replacement of old-growth forest stands by younger stands could threaten northern twinflower, Fairy Slipper, pine marten, and goshawk. Outbreaks of defoliating attacks by western <b>spruce</b> <b>budworms</b> could occur more frequently and become much more damaging for the conifer forests.|$|R
50|$|Formica lugubris are {{carnivorous}} ants that {{consume a}} variety of different foods. Red wood ants prey on pestiferous insects and forest defoliators like <b>spruce</b> <b>budworms.</b> They live in massive nests that can contain up to half a million colony members. They form large, domed nests on southerly facing slopes in relatively open woodland. The nests have several mechanisms for keeping the internal temperature stable. The southerly orientation captures sunlight; the nest is flattened on the south side to present a greater surface area to the sun and in spring, large numbers of workers can be seen sunbathing on the nest. When warm they will go into the nest to release their heat inside.|$|R
2500|$|The {{forest is}} also home to {{northern}} flickers, western wood-pewee, olive-sided flycatcher, Hammond's flycatcher, American dusky flycatcher, brown-headed cowbird, and pine siskin. [...] Pileated woodpeckers and hairy woodpeckers have been abundant in the forest around the park since the 1990s when the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> infestation increased the insect population they feed on. [...] Blue Lake and nearby Suttle Lake attract birds of prey such as red-tailed hawk, osprey and bald eagles as well as vultures. [...] Both the osprey and eagles normally stay well into the fall to feed on brown trout and kokanee salmon that spawn in Link Creek, between Blue and Suttle lakes.|$|E

50|$|Western tanagers eat fruits (~18%) and a {{wide range}} of insects (~82%). Fruits include {{hawthorn}} apples (Crataegus spp.), raspberries (Rubus spp.), mulberries (Morus spp.), elderberries (Sambucus spp.), serviceberries (Amelanchier spp.), and wild and cultivated cherries (Prunus spp.). Western tanagers have been observed foraging on Perry's agave (Agave parryi) nectar. Reports of western tanager eating Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) nectar, Russian-olive fruits, and human-provided food, including bird seed and dried fruit, were summarized in. Western tanagers are major consumers of western <b>spruce</b> <b>budworms</b> (Choristoneura occidentalis), and they have been observed eating Douglas-fir tussock moth larvae (Orgyia pseudotsugata). Hymenopterans, mostly wasps and ants constituted 75% of insects in western tanager stomachs in August. The other insects were beetles (Coleoptera, 12%), mainly click beetles (Elateridae) and woodborers (Bupestridae), true bugs (Hemipterans, 8%), grasshoppers (Orthoptera, 4%) and caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 2%).|$|R
50|$|While {{balsam fir}} is {{undoubtedly}} {{the host of}} preference, severe outbreaks {{have occurred in the}} Prairie Provinces and Northwest Territories in white spruce stands containing little or no balsam fir (Ives and Wong 1988). In severe outbreaks in north-central Ontario, young white spruce and black spruce outplants in cutovers became infested with dozens of late-stage larvae (Sutton 1982). Mortality among white spruce has also occurred in northwestern Ontario and the Algoma District of Ontario, as well as in certain areas of New Brunswick (Blais 1976). An ambitious study to determine (1) the degree of vulnerability of white <b>spruce</b> to <b>budworm</b> attack, (2) the rate of mortality with respect to defoliation, stand age and composition, geographical location, and relative to mortality among balsam fir, (3) sequence of attack by secondary insects, and (4) the rate of deterioration of killed trees, was begun in 1975 (Blais 1976) when 10 line plots 60 m wide averaging 0.5 km in length were established in mature stands of white spruce about 14 km apart along bush roads in the Dumoine and Coulonge river watersheds of western Quebec. There were 25 to 60 living trees per plot, all these and any dead white spruce were marked (Table 5.11).|$|R

50|$|The {{range of}} the insect coincides with the range of its hosts. In Ontario, the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> oviposits on needles of host trees in late June/early July. Large numbers of egg masses are {{deposited}} on the peripheral shoots of the crown. The number of eggs per egg mass varies from 1 to about 60, but commonly averages 20 (Sanders 1991). About 90 parasitoids have been collected from <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> in eastern North America. Henry (1996) found the suite of parasitoids collected from <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> in isolated white spruce plantations in southern Ontario differed from the usual suite of parasitoids found in the boreal forest.|$|E

50|$|The main {{hosts of}} the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> in eastern North America are balsam fir, white spruce, and black spruce (Blais 1964, 1980). White spruce is {{particularly}} useful for providing evidence, through radial-growth data, of past outbreaks of <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> (Blais 1962). Red spruce, in its limited distribution, is also attacked, as is tamarack (Sippell 1983). Significant damage is also caused to subalpine fir (Harvey 1985).|$|E

5000|$|The first {{recorded}} {{outbreak of the}} <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> in the United States occurred in Maine about 1807. Another outbreak followed in 1878. Since 1909 there have been waves of budworm outbreaks throughout the eastern United States and Canada. The states most often affected are Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. These outbreaks {{have resulted in the}} loss of millions of cords of spruce and fir. In 20th-century eastern Canada, the major outbreaks occurred in the periods [...] 1910-20, c. 1940-50, and c. 1970-80. Longer-term tree-ring studies suggest that <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> outbreaks have been recurring every three decades or so since the 16th century. Paleoecological studies suggest the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> has been breaking out in eastern North America for thousands of years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens (Lepidoptera: Torticidae), “the most {{destructive}} forest insect in North America” (Rose and Lindquist 1985), erupts periodically in massive epidemics in spruce-fir forests in northern and eastern Canada. Populations of <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> vary in density over several orders of magnitude. Recorded densities in the boreal forest range {{from less than}} 0.01 (Miller and Renault 1976) to more than 100 larvae per 45 cm branch tip (Henry 1996).|$|E
50|$|Notable tortricids {{include the}} codling moth and the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm,</b> which {{are among the}} most well-studied of all insects because of their {{economic}} impact.|$|E
50|$|Choristoneura freemani, {{the western}} <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm,</b> is {{a species of}} moth of the Tortricidae family. It is the most {{destructive}} defoliator of coniferous forests in western North America.|$|E
50|$|These birds feed on insects, and {{the numbers}} of these birds vary with the {{abundance}} of the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm.</b> These birds will also feed on berries and nectar in wintertime.|$|E
50|$|The Tennessee warbler feeds {{mainly on}} insects and prefers the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm.</b> This species fluctuates in {{population}} with {{the quantity of}} the budworm. It also likes flower nectar, fruit and some seeds.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} by Serge Payette that the spruce-moss forest ecosystem was changed into the lichen woodland biome {{due to the}} initiation of two compounded strong disturbances: large fire and the appearance and attack of the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm.</b> The <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> is a deadly insect to the spruce populations in the southern regions of the taiga. J.P. Jasinski confirmed this theory five years later stating “Their woodlands persistence, along with their previous moss forest histories and current occurrence adjacent to closed moss forests, indicate that they are an alternative stable state to the spruce-moss forests”.|$|E
50|$|Their {{breeding}} habitats are coniferous woodlands. Bay-breasted warblers nest 5 - 20 ft up in conifer trees, laying 3-5 {{eggs in a}} cup-shaped nest. Incubation is 12 days. More {{eggs are}} laid in <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> years.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{outbreaks}} of insect pests in forest-destroying plagues: the spruce-bark beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) in Yukon and Alaska; the mountain pine beetle in British Columbia; the aspen-leaf miner; the larch sawfly; the <b>spruce</b> <b>budworm</b> (Choristoneura fumiferana); the spruce coneworm.|$|E
