In 1978, {{in an effort}} to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset... an old paper mill where they <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to make old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper'... So we said... we'll call it Handmade Films." ...|$|E

He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, [...] "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to get out of prison", he quit smoking and began to refuse pork. After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils, Little concluded that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname [...] "Satan", became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common experience. You need someone to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E

He later adds, [...] "I just want to watch the moon glisten off your body...

[...] She said that the creators had happily indulged in the chance to [...] "visually draw on everything" [...] that British {{imagination}} can offer. David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we could have done this 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts". Arnold himself had devoted two years working on the ceremony and had turned down all other work including Skyfall, but said that it was the [...] "most fun" [...] he had [...] "ever had in music".

He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E

Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence.

Nature study will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
2500|$|Then Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, {{preferred}} Sony's console to {{the competition}} from Sega, saying [...] "Our game designer likes the Sony machine."

The staff of Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation {{a few weeks after}} its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is [...] "fairly average", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, [...] "To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war." [...] An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, [...] "Live in your world. Play in ours." [...] It is stylised as, [...] "LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS." [...] Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled [...] "You Are Not Ready" [...] or [...] "U R NOT [...]" [...] Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that [...] "it's the ultimate challenge.
