40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Heavy Current)) [...] Cape Technikon, 1991 Linear {{induction}} motors {{are built}} for numerous applications. Their robustness, gearfree-link to the load {{and the fact}} that speed is not a function of the number of poles (as in round machines) are only a few advantages. As every single phase motor needs some <b>starting</b> <b>aid,</b> so does a linear induction drive. For round machines, capacitors or shaded poles are usually used. A capacitor can be damaged electrically, which is a rare occurrence for shading rings. A useful combination of these advantages is a linear induction motor which is gearless and uses the shaded pole principle as a <b>starting</b> <b>aid.</b> In order to simplify the designing process, a computer program (Fortran) was written. The main objective on the electrical side was to obtain low input power, high power factor and high efficiency. In order to find the performance curves, torque measurements were made. Although the principles of torque measurements are well known the device to measure torque for this machine was not available and had to be constructed...|$|E

5000|$|The 5TDF opposed-piston engine, while {{powerful}} and compact, was very finicky {{and prone to}} malfunctions and fires. Russian expert Viktor Murakhovsky, then a battalion commander in Group of Soviet Forces in Germany reflected that in his unit {{the rate of the}} engines requiring a major overhaul was close to one per tank in a year. He also noted the difficulty of starting this engine, especially in the damp German winters, and that <b>starting</b> <b>aids</b> used by soldiers, like the high-pressure air and/or oil injection, often led to the engine fires.|$|R

In 1958, the PDKI {{was on the verge}} of unifying with the Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), but was then dismantled by the SAVAK secret police. The remains of the PDKI continued to support the KDP, but this changed as the Shah <b>started</b> <b>aiding</b> the KDP, which fought against the Iraqi regime that had overthrown the royal Hashemite dynasty.

Of the 442, 430 were men and 12 women.

Then the animals assailed the ass for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure to them, on a mere suspicion that the picture was not beautiful, without any evidence that such was the case. The ass was not, troubled; he was calm, and said there was one way to find out who was in the right, himself or the cat: he would go and look in that hole, and come back and tell what he found there. The animals felt relieved and grateful, and asked him to go at once--which he did.|$|R

50|$|In 1914, {{during the}} World War I the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs {{operated}} {{as part of}} the 8th (Jullundur) Brigade, 3rd Lahore Division on the Western Front in France, but was moved to Egypt in the late 1915 to fight against the Senussi, a tribal sect of Muslims led by Sayed Ahmed, also known as the Senussi. The devout Muslims were trained in battle and assisted by several Turkish military officers. The support received from the influential Turkish leader Nuri Bey has brought the Senussi a considerable advantage while fighting off the Italian occupiers of Libya. When the German submarines <b>started</b> <b>aiding</b> Turkey and the Senussi by bringing weapons to Libya and attacking the coast of Egypt, Nuri Bey, half-brother of Enver Pasha, the Turkish War Minister at the moment, persuaded Sayed Ahmed to fight against Britain and join forces with Turkey to invade Egypt in the Turkish Holy War.|$|R
