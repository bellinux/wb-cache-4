Another {{way to look at}} smells is with respect to principles and quality: [...] "smells are certain structures in the code that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality". Code smells are usually not bugs—they are not technically incorrect and do not currently prevent the program from functioning. Instead, they indicate weaknesses in design that may be slowing down development or increasing the risk of bugs or failures in the future. Bad code smells can be an indicator of factors that contribute to technical debt. Robert C. Martin calls a list of code smells a [...] "value system" [...] for software craftsmanship.|$|E

30|$|The {{hydrological}} {{properties of}} an area controlled by streams, rivers, underground water, saturation state of rocks/soils, and drainage pattern present in an area {{play a vital role}} in slope failure [35]. In hilly terrain, irregular flow of groundwater in rock slopes along structural discontinuities decreases shear strength of slope forming material and increases the possibility of slope failure. This irregular flow of groundwater seeps out and could be identified as surface indications along cut slope sections. The LHEF scheme suggests a direct method of field observation to identify the <b>surface</b> <b>indication</b> of hydrogeological conditions visually as flowing, dripping, wet, damp and dry and the ratings were assigned accordingly.

40|$|Since 1996, oscillatory, {{very long}} period (VLP) (25 > T> 5 s) seismic signals have been {{recorded}} at Mount Erebus by near-field broadband seismometers and found to be ubiquitously and uniquely associated with Strombolian eruptions. The VLP signal begins before there is any visible <b>surface</b> <b>indication</b> of an eruption and continues throughout the eruption and conduit recovery process. The eruptions occur as large gas bubbles (up to 10 -m diameter) explosively decompress at {{the surface of a}} lava lake, eviscerating the lake in the process. After the eruption the lava lake recharges and resumes its preeruption appearance. VLP and short-period waveforms are all highly similar from event to event, suggesting that the source mechanism is repeatable and non-destructive, or self-recreating. However, the initial vertical displacement polarity of the events may be either positive or negative, as is visible in systematic differences associated with two different eruptive styles seen in the first 5 - 10 seconds of seismograms.

Keeping in mind that “it {{is to be expected}} that certain core values such as those that pertain to family relationships tend to persist log after more <b>surface</b> <b>indication</b> of immigrant status have been erased,” I found that explaining Hawaiian Sansei dating patterns required a deeper study into the culture of the Issei and Nisei generations of Hawaii. As Fredrick Samuel says: “Thus, while it is stated that to a considerable degree traditional ways and values have been superseded by the more modern American mode of life, we must at the same time not underestimate the pull of tradition upon the attitude and actions of individuals. ” Because the Issei and Nisei have great influence upon the Sansei, it was important to understand Hawaiian Issei and Nisei culture {{in order to understand the}} Hawaiian Sansei dating game...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the results of brittle tectonic, palaeostress inversion, and hydrothermal mineralisation studies of the Hvalfjörður low-temperature geothermal field in Southwest Iceland. This geothermal field (including two pronounced thermal anomalies) is located in the highly altered core area of an extinct and deeply eroded Tertiary central volcano. Most of the geothermal water appears to be conducted by vertical extension fractures. Palaeostress analysis indicates a rather complex stress history, with four major trends of extension involving normal and strike-slip faulting modes as well as dyke injection. Analysis of the data on the relative chronology indicates that these four regimes were closely intricate in time and space. The most important regime is a NW-SE, rift-perpendicular extension related to the oceanic rifting in Iceland. This trend partly controls the past (Pliocene-Early Pleistocene) hydrothermal activity in the Hvalfjörður area; however, an E-W rift-oblique extension also occurred with a N-S trending fracture system including normal faults, dykes and veins that show higher levels of hydrothermal mineralisation. Currently, there is strong hot-water convection, producing a thermal anomaly, in this N-S-trending fracture system. Our study highlights the paleostress evolution and the development of fracture systems in Hvalfjörður, including the past geothermal history; nevertheless the most efficient tool in geothermal prospection in such complex area remains the shallow geothermal survey. It has proved successful in many localities in Early Pleistocene to Miocene rocks where no <b>surface</b> <b>indication</b> of geothermal activity exists...|$|E

40|$|Computer-enhanced Landsat {{images of}} the {{southern}} Powder River Basin {{have been used to}} define facies and linear structural features within the Wasatch Formation.

These newly defined geologic features are spatially related to known uranium mineral occurrences and are believed to be related to mineralization in the following ways.

Accurate numerical simulations of casting service performance allow designers to use the geometric flexibility of castings and the superior properties of steel to produce lighter weight and more energy efficient components for transportation systems (cars and trucks), construction, and mining. Accurate simulations increase the net melting energy efficiency by improving casting yield and reducing rework and scrap.
