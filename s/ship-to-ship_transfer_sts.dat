2500|$|LNG is transported {{using both}} tanker truck, railway tanker, and purpose built ships known as LNG carriers. LNG will be {{sometimes}} taken to cryogenic temperatures {{to increase the}} tanker capacity. The first commercial <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfer</b> (<b>STS)</b> transfers were undertaken in February 2007 at the Flotta facility in Scapa Flow with 132,000 m3 of LNG being passed between the vessels Excalibur and Excelsior. [...] Transfers have also been carried out by Exmar Shipmanagement, the Belgian gas tanker owner in the Gulf of Mexico, which involved the transfer of LNG from a conventional LNG carrier to an LNG regasification vessel (LNGRV). Prior to this commercial exercise LNG had only ever been transferred between ships {{on a handful of}} occasions as a necessity following an incident. SIGTTO - the Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators is the responsible body for LNG operators around the world and seeks to disseminate knowledge regarding the safe transport of LNG at sea.|$|E
50|$|The Harbour Authority area of Scapa Flow in Orkney {{has been}} {{measured}} {{as part of}} a wider consultation in ballast water management in 2013, and it has been accurately calculated that Scapa Flow is 324.5 km2 in area and that this area contains just under 1 billion cubic metres of water. It is currently a world-famous diving location, with the wrecks of the scuttled German Fleet offering unique diving challenges. Scapa Flow is also a major oil port serving the Flotta Oil Terminal, and is a prime location of <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfers</b> of crude oil product and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The world’s first <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfer</b> of LNG took place in Scapa Flow in 2007.|$|R

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the term is obscure, but may refer to ships moored closely {{side-to-side}} at a dock or at anchor, since it is possible literally to go [...] "across the decks" [...] from ship to ship via gangplank without touching land. Cross-decking implies <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfer.</b> Receiving personnel or supplies from shore usually would not be defined as [...] "cross-decking". An exception to this rule might be personnel who only briefly come to shore who are then immediately reassigned to an outbound ship without an intervening shore assignment or leave. The implication of cross-decking in this case would be an immediate turn around from one assignment to another without pause.|$|R
5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfer,</b> also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|R

The ESD supports a vehicle staging area, side port ramp, large mooring fenders, and up to three landing craft air cushioned vessel lanes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{standard}} for unit loads is MIL-STD-1660, a {{standard for}} ammunition unit loads. DOD unit loads generally use 40 x 48 in pallets, which unfortunately do not pack efficiently into ISO containers. They weigh less than 4000 lb to limit the stresses on handling equipment. They are weatherproof, and stack 16 ft high. They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. MIL-STD-1660 mandates that loads must never be less than {{the width of a}} pallet, while permitting some overhang. The markings are LOGMARS bar codes and standard inventory numbers. The standard describes major parts of the logistic path, including storage, ship, air, truck, forklift and sling (i.e. ship-to-ship and parachute). There are auxiliary standards for <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfers,</b> and amphibious transfers. There are tests for stacking, transport, sling, forklift and pallet jack, impact, drop tests, tip, water-retention (i.e. weather), and safe disassembly.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental work and simulations of pressure surges resulting from fast closing valves and activation of an emergency release coupling (ERC) in <b>ship-to-ship</b> LNG <b>transfer.</b> The first part {{presents the results of}} an ambient water flow test with a fast closing 4 -inch full bore valve in combination with a 4 -inch flexible multi-composite hose. High amplitude pressure surges up to 4 times the working pressure occur upstream of the valve. Pressure surge amplitudes strongly depend on valve closing time and flow rate. The propagation speed in the upstream hose is lowered considerably due to the hose flexibility. Furthermore the temporarily deformation of the hose results in loss of energy and acoustic damping of the pressure surge amplitudes. The measurement results are compared to the results of modeling. Acoustic damping and propagation speed of sound show a non-linear behavior of the hose, due to a varying internal pressure, which is not captured in the present modeling techniques. The second part of the paper {{describes the}} results of a full scale flow test on an 8 -inch ERC (KLAW make) for LNG <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfer</b> (Figure 1). The ERC in the test is located downstream of an 8 -inch 15 -meter long multi-composite flexible hose. The test is intended to investigate operational and mechanical integrity, spill rate and the impact of pressure transients and shock loads on the ERC including upstream hose and downstream piping...|$|R

40|$|In {{stevedoring}} operations, the <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfer</b> of containers in open-sea {{is becoming}} an alternative way to avoid port congestion and subsequently can increase port efficiency. This process involves a large container ship or a barge, equipped with a crane, and a smaller vessel which transports containers between the ship and the harbour. However, the harsh open-sea conditions can produce exogenous disturbances to the crane system during the load transfer. Besides, the uncertainties and disturbances in the crane system may degrade the control performance. Hence, one of the requirements of offshore container cranes is to enhance robustness of the crane control system. This paper addresses the problem of robust sliding mode control for offshore container crane systems subject to bounded disturbances and uncertainties. The mathematical model of the control plant is first derived whereas the effects of ocean waves and strong winds are taken into account. Then, a robust sliding mode controller is proposed to track an optimal trajectory of the crane system during load transfer. Extensive simulation results are given {{to show that the}} proposed controller can significantly suppress the effects of disturbances from the vessel's wave- and wind-induced motion...|$|R

40|$|Caused by {{the global}} {{increase}} of demand for natural gas the interest in offshore liquefaction, transport and re-gasification grows rapidly. The installations that are presently developed are in essence copies of the onshore systems that are already many years in operation. However, {{the fact that the}} installation is installed on a ship imposes limitations and leads to special system requirements. An important issue is that offshore offloading systems, in contrast to ship-to-shore offloading, have to function under harsh sea conditions. Systems should be flexible to deal with the ships moving relative to each other and extreme cases may require instantaneous disconnection. Besides, the offloading system has to transfer LNG at the highest possible rate, which requires that the equipment has to withstand high flow velocities and pressures. At present <b>ship-to-ship</b> <b>transfer</b> systems are being developed that apply loading arms or flexible pipes and hoses. Such systems have already been successfully operated in a number of cases. A question that remains appropriate continuously is whether the integrity of such a system can be guaranteed under all circumstances and in all configurations. This is of particular relevance in corrugated hose/pipe systems, where due to the inner profile local pressure and velocity fluctuations occur near the hose/pipe wall, a potential cause for bubbles to form. These vapor bubbles can affect the flow behavior and impose operational complications. The research described enables development of tools for the prediction of safe operation conditions and optimization of the LNG transfer and transport systems...|$|R
