5|$|Spring Brook flows {{across the}} Pocono Plateau and {{passes through the}} Moosic Mountains via a water gap known as the Spring Brook Gap. Its mouth is in the Lackawanna Valley. In its lower reaches, the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> {{channelized}} in a large open concrete channel. A number of bank stabilization projects have been done on the stream from Berlin Village downstream to its mouth. Some land {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> designated as a 100 year floodplain.|$|E
5|$|The pH of Messers Run {{between the}} Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir is 6.6. The {{concentration}} of alkalinity in {{this portion of}} the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> 4 milligrams per liter and the total water hardness is 18 milligrams per liter. The pH of the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir is 6.6. The concentration of alkalinity {{in this part of the}} <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> 5 milligrams per liter and the water hardness is 13 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|The pH of Messers Run {{upstream}} of the Lofty Reservoir is 6.3. The total {{concentration of}} alkalinity {{in this part}} of the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> 3 milligrams per liter. These values are similar to those measured in a similar area during a 1990 survey of the stream. The concentration of water hardness {{in this part of}} the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> 47 milligrams per liter. A 1997 report noted that this value was very high considering the concentration of alkalinity.|$|E

30|$|For each sequence, <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> {{selected}} successively; {{the selection}} continues until no more <b>streams</b> can <b>be</b> selected and the selected <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> kept the in set Ψ. This procedure is summarized in Algorithm 2.|$|R
50|$|The <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> {{rain and}} spring fed. Even though the <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> perennial, {{the best time}} to visit these waterfalls is after recent rains.|$|R
5|$|The velocity-depth of Twomile Run is low, {{but there}} is an {{adequate}} frequency of riffles in the stream. The right bank of the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> somewhat unstable.|$|E
5|$|At river mile 5.1, the pH of {{the waters}} of Scotch Run is 6.6 and at river mile 1.3, the pH is 7.0. At the stream's mouth, the pH is 6.8. The {{concentration}} of alkalinity in the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> 5 milligrams per liter at river mile 5.1 and 8 milligrams per liter at river mile 1.3 and at the mouth. At river mile 5.1, the level of water hardness in the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> 23 milligrams per liter, while at river mile 1.3, the water hardness is 15 milligrams per liter. It is 18 milligrams per liter at the stream's mouth.|$|E
5|$|Between one of Stafford Meadow Brook's {{reservoirs}} {{and southern}} Scranton, the watershed of the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> glacially deformed. At a saddle in this reach, the stream was once able to flow through Rocky Glen into Spring Brook during high flow conditions.

25|$|The {{region was}} {{formerly}} crossed by different streams and lagoons, {{some of which}} were refilled and others tubed. Among the most important <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cildañez and White. In 1908 many <b>streams</b> <b>were</b> channelled and rectified, as floods were damaging the city's infrastructure. Starting in 1919, most <b>streams</b> <b>were</b> enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954, and runs below Juan B. Justo Avenue.|$|R
5|$|In {{day-to-day life}} {{all of us}} observe that a stream of water {{emerging}} from a faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> emitted from the faucet. This {{is due to a}} phenomenon called the Plateau–Rayleigh instability, which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{was entered}} into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its {{identifier}} in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199983. The <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> named after Captain John Stafford, who started a sawmill on its banks in 1790.|$|E

5000|$|StreamSQL is a query {{language}} that extends SQL {{with the ability}} to process real-time data <b>streams.</b> SQL <b>is</b> primarily intended for manipulating relations (also known as tables), which are finite bags of tuples (rows). StreamSQL adds the ability to manipulate <b>streams,</b> which <b>are</b> infinite sequences of tuples that are not all available at the same time. Because <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> infinite, operations over <b>streams</b> must <b>be</b> monotonic. Queries over <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> generally [...] "continuous", executing {{for long periods of time}} and returning incremental results.|$|R
5|$|Wind {{power in}} an open air <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> thus {{proportional}} to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Wind turbines for grid electric power therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the swamp}} on Twomile Run, the {{discharge}} of the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> 511 gallons per minute. Upstream of Middle Branch Twomile Run, the discharge is 618 gallons per minute and downstream of Robbins Hollow, the discharge is 1402 gallons per minute. Downstream of the sampling site KC121, the discharge is 1893 gallons per minute and upstream of Huling Branch, the discharge is 2258 gallons per minute. The discharge {{at the mouth of}} Twomile Run ranges from 200 to 10,000 gallons per minute, which is between 0.6 and 2 percent of {{the discharge of}} Kettle Creek.|$|E
5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E
50|$|Losing <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> {{common in}} arid areas. Losing <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> also common in regions of karst {{topography}} where the streamwater may be completely captured by an underground cavern system, becoming a subterranean river.|$|R
50|$|The station's {{channels}} {{could be}} listened to {{both in the}} browser (via the RadioVeRVe website) {{as well as through}} traditional streaming using internet radio client applications and devices. <b>Streams</b> <b>were</b> available in low-bandwidth (suitable for use on mobile GPRS connections) as well as high-bandwidth (suitable for Wi-Fi or broadband connections) versions.

5|$|All {{but four}} of the streams lie within the large basin of the Columbia River, {{although}} the river itself does not flow through Idaho. Consequently, the predominant direction of the state's streamflow is northwest towards the Columbia River and its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. The only other major drainage basin in Idaho is the Great Salt Lake watershed in the state's southeastern corner, {{which is part of}} the Great Basin and has no outlet to the ocean. The Bear River, the second-longest <b>stream,</b> <b>is</b> within this watershed, along with the Malad River, Deep Creek, and the Logan River.|$|E
5|$|Briar Creek Reservoir {{is located}} in the Briar Creek watershed, on East Branch Briar Creek. It is owned by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Columbia County. It was {{originally}} constructed to control floods, but most recreational activities in the watershed take place at this lake. These include fishing, picnicking, and weddings. There are also Pennsylvania State Game Lands in the watershed. The waters of Briar Creek are approved trout waters and the <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> stocked with trout.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN began {{promoting}} audience interaction {{early in}} its history, by the regular incorporation of viewer telephone calls in its programming. It has since expanded into social media. In March 2009, viewers began submitting questions live via Twitter to guests on C-SPAN's morning call-in show Washington Journal. The network {{also has a}} Facebook page to which it added occasional live streaming in January 2011. The live <b>stream</b> <b>is</b> intended to show selected well-publicized events of Congress. In June 2010, C-SPAN joined with the website Foursquare to provide users of the application with access to geotagged C-SPAN content at various locations in Washington, D.C.|$|E
40|$|Methods {{and systems}} for {{streaming}} {{data in a}} network. Whether the network is experiencing high packet loss may be determined by a rate control module. If high packet loss is experienced, data is encoded into multiple streams by a coder using temporal domain partitioning. If high packet loss is not experienced, then data may is encoded by using frequency domain partitioning. Unequal error protection is applied {{to each of the}} streams so more important bit planes {{in a bit of a}} <b>stream</b> <b>are</b> provided with more error protection than less important bit planes. The <b>streams</b> <b>are</b> transmitted along, respectively, independent paths to a decoder.
