5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake {{was one of those who}} met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus re-instated Timothy Aelurus and Peter the Fuller {{to their}} sees, and by persuasion {{of the former}} issued (9 April 475) a {{circular}} letter (Enkyklikon) to the bishops calling them to accept as valid only the first three ecumenical synods, and reject the Council of Chalcedon. All bishops were to sign the edict. While most of the Eastern bishops accepted the letter, Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople refused, {{with the support of}} the population of the city, clearly <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> disdain towards Basiliscus by draping the icons in Hagia Sophia in black.|$|E

He sent out messengers to rally his scattered men with news that Bryennios had been killed, <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> parade horse as evidence. At the same time, the promised Turkish reinforcements began {{arriving at the}} scene, lifting his men's morale. All the while, on the battlefield, Bryennios's army had closed around Alexios's Franks, who dismounted and offered to surrender. In the process the rebel army had become totally disordered, with units mixed and their formations disordered. Bryennios's reserves had been thrown in confusion by the Pecheneg attack, while his front lines relaxed, thinking that the battle was over.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, aged 16, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Ponticelli {{was assigned to the}} 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion. He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment. According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving was his way of <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> gratitude. He served at Soissons in Picardy, northeast France, and at Douaumont, near Verdun. Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches. In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Elections and Transitions Committee {{arranged}} for the Whittemore Center {{to be used for}} the consecration, a large hockey rink {{on the campus of the}} University of New Hampshire in Durham.

The security was strong: just as Barbara Harris had to wear a bullet-proof vest at her consecration, Robinson was <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> bullet-proof vest to Harris herself. Robinson's parents, sister, daughter and their families and his ex-wife Boo were all at the consecration. Robinson was consecrated on November 2, 2003, in the presence of Frank Griswold, Presiding Bishop, and six co-consecrating bishops: 48 bishops in all.|$|E

5|$|At a Creation Convention in San Francisco, Adams {{received}} career {{advice from}} Steve Leialoha and Chris Claremont, and also met another aspiring illustrator, Mike Mignola, with whom Adams became friends, and later, business partners.

He would later become closely associated with the X-Men in his early career. After <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> portfolio to editor Bob Schreck at a Creation Convention, he gained permission to set up a table, doing drawings for fans for $5 – $10. He began submitting samples to Marvel Comics when he was 18, taking a job at a pizzeria after graduating high school.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{returned}} from injury after {{two and a}} half weeks on the sidelines immediately after the Fourth Test. He made 24 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. He delivered 14 overs in the second innings, taking 0/6, the most economical figures in the match apart from one bowler who bowled a solitary maiden. When Australia fielded, a point of interest for onlookers was where Barnes would field; he stayed at mid-wicket, well clear of the batsman. Barnes made 31 in the next game against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. After being given out lbw to Allan Watkins, he walked off visibly <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> displeasure at the umpiring decision, believing the ball would have missed leg stump. The hosts fell for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|By now, Chapman {{had retired}} as a player in {{first-class}} football, having played his last match against Watford in January 1909, but filled the gap he left, as well as <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> eye for spotting talent, by signing players such as future England international Fanny Walden. As Southern League champions, Northampton contested and lost the 1909 FA Charity Shield, 2–0 to Newcastle United, and although they did not win the Southern League title again during Chapman's time as manager, they {{finished in the top}} four in each of the following three seasons. Additionally, they proved their mettle in the FA Cup against First Division sides, knocking out The Wednesday and taking Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United to replays, losing 1–0 both times.|$|E

With the Bangladesh spinners being more {{effective}} in limited-over games, Mashud had more chance to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> class. His 91 catches and 35 stumpings in ODI testify to that.|$|R
5|$|Loretta {{gradually}} becomes {{good friends}} with Nancy and Hannah. When Nancy's abusive ex-husband Jake Dean, who tried to rape her and kill his and his ex-wife Becca's son Charlie (Joshua McConville), returns to the village Loretta consoles Nancy and moves in with her. Loretta grows close to Jake and, although initially hesitant, forms a relationship with him. After Jake and Loretta go public, Loretta is kicked out by Nancy and moves in with Jake. When Jake's sister Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) suggests the pair are moving too quickly Loretta agrees, she talks to Jake who gets angry <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> temper to Loretta for the first time. The couple reconcile {{with the help of}} Steph. Loretta strikes up a friendship with Holly Hutchinson (Lydia Waters) who aspires to be a dancer like Loretta after feeling unnoticed by her mother Cindy. As they bond Loretta gives Holly advice on dancing. Loretta faces prejudice when she starts applying for new jobs, as no one will employ her due to her previous jobs as a stripper. She later lies during an interview, her interviewers discover her previous employment and make derogatory remarks to her.|$|E
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, Maisky {{agreed to}} the sending of two {{commissions}} to Spain, to enumerate foreign volunteer forces, and to bring about their withdraw. It was estimated to cost £1,750,000 to £2,250,000, borne by member countries of the Committee. The Nationalists wished to prevent {{the fall of the}} favourable Chamberlain government in the United Kingdom, and so were seen to accept the plan. With much bemoaning, the Republicans also accepted the plan. The Nationalists demanded belligerent rights first, then withdrawals of 10,000 from each side after, which amounted to a rejection of the plan. Following the Munich Agreement – judged by Chamberlain to have been a success – Britain would host similar mediation in Spain. Negrín would propose the removal of the International Brigades, a majority of whom were now Spaniards, at the last meeting of the League of Nations, thereby <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> contempt for the Non-Intervention Committee. Similarly, Italians would leave Spain under the Anglo-Italian agreement, not through the Committee.|$|E

5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> {{concern for the}} practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia. Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, {{is a symbol of}} the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand. The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008. It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E

5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, <b>showing</b> <b>his</b> status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E
