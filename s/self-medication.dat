40|$|The role of {{pharmacist}} has {{not only}} advanced from traditional medication dispensing but also to direct patient care and pharmaceutical interventions aiming at enhancing the populace wellbeing. Objective: The objective {{of this research was}} {{to assess the impact of}} rural community pharmacist on drug <b>self-medications</b> and disease prevalence among rural settings in the Kwara State Central, Nigeria [...] Method: This study was conducted between September, 2011 and February, 2013 in eight rural communities on 730 respondents, following a six-week pilot study on 50 respondents. Respondents aged 30 years and over and regular clients of the community pharmacy were included into the study. <b>Self-medications</b> were assessed using pre-tested and validated questionnaire. Pharmaceutical interventions were carried out on the respondents by the clinical pharmacist at every two months for eighteen months. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were for the computation of the data. Results: Male respondents were one third of the population studied, while female had the highest percentage of 69. 9 %. Respondents between the age of 40 and 50 years dominated with 42. 3 % and majority (88. 1 %) of the rural residents were illiterates. Farming was the core livelihood of the respondents and survived on less than ten thousand naira Nigeria money ($ 63) per month. Among the combinations of drugs abused by the respondents, the regimen containing combination of (prednisolone, diclofenac and paracetamol) had the highest users.

40|$|Background: The {{epidemiological}} data based on intensive monitoring studies are limited for the cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) {{in terms of}} incidence. Most of earlier Indian studies focused only on types and causative drugs of CADRs. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the CADRs with reference to the incidence, its subgroup analysis, causative drugs, and other clinical characteristics in Indian population. Methodology: Intensive monitoring study was carried out over a period of 3 years in the dermatology outpatient and inpatient department. CADRs due to only systematically administered drugs were considered. The WHO definition for CADR, the WHO causality definitions, modified Schumock and Thornton's criteria for preventability, and International Conference on Harmonisation E 2 A guidelines for seriousness were considered. Incidence was expressed in percentage and its 95 % confidence interval. The incidence was analyzed on basis of characteristics of study population and CADRs. Results: A total of 171 CADRs were observed from 37, 623 patients. The CADR incidence was 0. 45 % (95 % CI: 0. 39 – 0. 53). The incidence did not significantly differ in different age groups and gender. Commonly observed CADRs were maculopapular rash (23. 98 %), urticaria (21. 64 %), and fixed drug eruptions (FDEs) (18. 13 %). Antimicrobials (35. 18 %) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were suspected in all common CADRs. Anti-infective and NSAIDs were most commonly suspected drugs in overall CADRs, maculopapular rash, urticaria, FDEs, and erythema multiforme. The exact nature of drugs remained inaccessible in one-fourth cases due to use of the over-the-counter <b>self-medications.</b> The incidence of preventable and serious and fatal CADRs was 0. 08 % (95 % CI: 0. 05 – 0. 11), 0. 04 % (95 % CI: 0. 02 – 0. 06), and 0. 003 % (95 % CI: 0. 000 – 0. 001), respectively. Conclusion: Ethnic characteristics should be considered while interpreting incidence from the international studies. The demographic characteristics of study population do not affect the incidence of CADRs. Indian patients should be sensitized about hazards of <b>self-medications...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Many mothers still rely on {{palpation}} {{to determine}} if their children have fever at home before deciding to seek medical attention or administer <b>self-medications.</b> This study was carried out to determine the accuracy of subjective assessment of fever by Nigerian mothers in Under- 5 Children. Patients and Methods: Each eligible child had a tactile assessment of fever by the mother after which the axillary temperature was measured. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 19 (IBM Inc. Chicago Illinois, USA, 2010). Result: A total of 113 mother/child pairs participated in the study. Palpation overestimates fever by 24. 6 %. Irrespective of {{the surface of the}} hand used for palpation, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of tactile assessment were 82. 4 %, 37. 1 %, 51. 9 % and 71. 9 %, respectively. The use of the palmer surface of the hand had a better sensitivity (95. 2 %) than the dorsum of the hand (69. 2 %). The use of multiple sites had better sensitivity (86. 7 %) than the use of single site (76. 2 %). Conclusion: Tactile assessment of childhood fevers by mothers is still a relevant screening tool for the presence or absence fever. Palpation with the palmer surface of the hand using multiple sites improves the reliability of tactile assessment of fever...|$|R

The authors found that compared to healthy controls, therapeutic alcohol and sedative use was greater for non-clinical participants who experienced panic attacks. These {{findings are consistent with}} the suggestion made by Cox, Norton, Dorward, and Fergusson (1989) that panic disorder patients self-medicate if they believe that certain substances will be successful in alleviating their symptoms. If panic disorder patients are indeed self-medicating, there may be a portion of the population with undiagnosed panic disorder who will not seek professional help {{as a result of their}} own <b>self-medication.</b> In fact, for some patients panic disorder is only diagnosed after they seek treatment for their <b>self-medication</b> habit.|$|E

This project is based on reviewing related literatures, newspapers articles and online searches using Pubmed and Google. Combinations of key words related {{to each of the}} subject areas were used. Websites of relevant institutions, government and non-government organisations were also searched. The obtained literatures were categorized and reviewed carefully. Most of the medications are prescribed inappropriately and polypharmacy is very common. Antibiotics are often prescribed irrationally without standard guidelines. Virtually, all the drugs are available without prescriptions and <b>self-medications</b> are highly common. Access to essential medicines is significantly less than that mentioned in the official documents. Price of essential medicines is not consistent and the drugs regulating authority does not have any control over pricing of drugs. Counterfeit medicines have deluged Bangladesh market with an estimated worth of US$ 100 -US$ 150. Smaller drug manufacturers are engaged in the production substandard or fake drugs. Information on monitoring and reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADR) of the marketed drugs were not available. Management and utilisations of therapeutic drugs in Bangladesh is extremely vulnerable. The drug controlling authority should be more vigilant to ensure appropriate use and availability of medicines.

40|$|The growing rate of {{risky sexual}} {{behaviour}} among young adults contributes {{significantly to the}} spread of Sexually Transmitted Infections epidemic in Nigeria. As a result of which this study explores STIs knowledge and treatment seeking behaviour among University of Ilorin students aged between 18 - 25 years. An in-depth interview was conducted among forty students. The study reveals that young adults have a good knowledge of HIV/AIDS but few of them have little knowledge of only gonorrhoea. It was noted that the informants {{still have a lot of}} ambiguous information that relates to STIs. They also perceived risky sexual behaviour is common among their peers. When they had STIs, most of them prefer to get <b>self-medications</b> from traditional healers or patronize road side pharmacy. Also, they do not like to go to medical practitioners because of stigmatization by medical practitioners, lack of confidentiality, slow service and low cost. It is recommended that a multi-sectoral effort of young peoples’ families,Non-Governmental Organisations, traditional medical practitioners, media practitioners and health professionals towards improving STIs knowledge as well as promoting and encouraging preventive as well as effective treatment practices must be made available for this population. The study concludes that there is a need for the implementation of an all-encompassing integrated multi-sectoral approach which will utilise all the various stakeholders in providing a comprehensive abstinence sexuality education for young adults...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} a rural health {{district}} in the Dominican Republic found relatively high levels of public and out-of-pocket primary health expenditures and poor quality of care. The inefficient use of public resources and low efficacy were attributed to: (1) underutilization of health services, (2) low productivity of human and physical resources, which in turn were caused by poor managerial practices, shortages of medicines, dispersion {{of the population and}} the compulsory 1 -year rural social service required from all graduating physicians (known as pasantia in some Latin American countries and medicatura rural in others). Out-of-pocket health expenditures responded to unnecessary self-referrals and excessive <b>self-medications.</b> The findings suggest that the quality of care can be improved and the public and out-of-pocket expenditures reduced by: (1) the replacement of the social service (pasantia) by permanent physicians, (2) the organization of communal pharmacies and (3) the establishment of outreach health posts. It is argued that today in the Dominican Republic as in many other Latin American countries unemployed or underemployed physicians are willing to take permanent positions in rural areas. The study suggests that rural physicians need and will be willing {{to accept the fact that}} much of their medical training has no applicability to the rural setting.

25|$|A {{very large}} {{percentage}} of schizophrenics smoke tobacco {{as a form of}} <b>self-medication.</b> The high rate of tobacco use by the mentally ill is a major factor in their decreased life expectancy, which is about 25 years shorter than the general population. Following the observation that smoking improves condition of people with schizophrenia, in particular working memory deficit, nicotine patches had been proposed as a way to treat schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that a link exists between smoking and mental illness, citing the high incidence of smoking amongst those suffering from schizophrenia and the possibility that smoking may alleviate some of the symptoms of mental illness, but these have not been conclusive. In 2015, a meta-analysis found that smokers were at greater risk of developing psychotic illness.|$|E
25|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that genetic factors along with social and psychological factors are contributors to addiction. A common theory along these lines is the <b>self-medication</b> hypothesis. Epidemiological studies estimate that genetic factors account for 40–60% of the risk factors for alcoholism. Similar rates of heritability for other types of drug addiction have been indicated by other studies. Knestler hypothesized in 1964 that a gene or group of genes might contribute to predisposition to addiction in several ways. For example, altered levels of a normal protein due to environmental factors could then change the structure or functioning of specific brain neurons during development. These altered brain neurons could change the susceptibility of an individual to an initial drug use experience. In support of this hypothesis, animal {{studies have shown that}} environmental factors such as stress can affect an animal's genotype.|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{antibiotic}} resistant Staphylococcus aureus {{is one of}} {{the common}} causes of severe nosocomial infections, and the gastrointestinal tract is an important source of its transmission. This study assessed the previous usage of antibiotics by healthy adults (university students and villagers) in Amassoma, Nigeria, and investigated the antimicrobial resistance patterns of their intestinal S. aureus isolates. A questionnaire was used for evaluating the previous usage of antibiotics by the volunteers. Stool samples were collected and cultured, and S. aureus isolates were confirmed using standard microbiological protocols. Their antimicrobial resistance patterns were determined using disc-diffusion and agar dilution techniques. In total, 54 (45. 0 %) volunteers used antibiotics on <b>self-medications,</b> and the practice was significantly higher (p= 0. 01) among the villagers than among the students. The level of judicious use of prescribed antibiotics was significantly higher (p= 0. 003) among the students than among the villagers. Thirty-eight (31. 7 %) healthy adults were colonized with intestinal S. aureus. The percentages of resistance of the isolates to some antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin– 68. 4 %, doxycycline– 60. 5 %, cefoxitin– 34. 2 %, vancomycin– 36. 8 %, erythromycin– 34. 2 %, and gentamicin– 5. 3 %. Twenty-five (65. 8 %) of the isolates were multidrug-resistant. The need for sound education on the appropriate use of antibiotics and the importance of proper personal hygiene as means of controlling the spread of bacterial antibiotic resistance are highlighted. Thus, effective strategies in these areas are strongly recommended...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pain {{is reality}} from womb to tomb as the {{specific}} personalized articulated feeling {{of human beings}} whether they need respite or not. Objective: To find an optimum primary care approach to pain management. Methods: The investigators pursued a sincere effort to unearth an answer to pain management through their internalized clinical experience of managing the commonest presentation of symptoms at their clinics by hundreds of ailing citizens. Results: Since ancient times, thousands of interventions have been practiced for relief of pain including an array of <b>self-medications</b> and traditional practices. In the era of "Evidence Based Medicine" in this new millennium, all forms of pain managements need scientific evaluation by the application of highest research integrity {{before they can be}} adapted as a standard treatment protocol. As the severity of the pain is a grossly subjective, the treatment/drug of choice and/or the methods/dosage should depend on the judgments of objective severity by the health care providers, depending on the objective clinical/ radiological/ pathological/ biochemical criteria and if possible by formulating scoring systems. Rather than managing the pain based on the expressed perception of the severity of pain by the patient as mild, moderate or severe, we have to be innovative in the new paradigm of this nascent pain management scenario. Conclusions: We have to help the budding doctors to grow up not only as a sensible doctor, but also as a great human being, who will give due attention to pain through a holistic tailor-made approach...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was carried out to {{determine}} the most potent available antimicrobials {{in the treatment of}} pathogens of reproductive health importance in Nigeria. "nMaterial and methods: Using the agar disc-diffusion and modified agar well-diffusion methods, bacterial and fungal pathogens obtained from clinical specimens of female patients presenting at the University College Hospital, Nigeria were screened in vitro against the most commonly-available routine antibiotics and antifungals in Nigeria. "nResults: The Gram-negative bacterial pathogens were mostly susceptible to azthromycin, fortum, ceftriazone, ofloxacin, perfloxacin, rocephine and zinnat. The Gram-positive bacterial pathogens were mostly susceptible to ceftriazone, perfloxacin, rocephine, ciprofloxacin, azthromycin, zinnat and erythromycin. High overall phenotypic antibiotic resistance was displayed towards ampicillin, septrin, gentamicin, penicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline. The Gram-positive bacterial pathogens were mostly resistant to ampicillin (66. 7 &ndash; 94. 4 %); streptomycin (53. 8 &ndash; 100 %); chloramphenicol (77. 8 &ndash; 100 %), penicillin (72. 2 &ndash; 100 %) and septrin (50. 0 &ndash; 91. 4 %). The most generally resisted antibiotics among the Gram-negative bacteria were gentamicin (40. 0 - 75. 0 %); tetracycline (57. 1 - 100 %); ampicillin (75. 5 - 100 %); streptomycin (79. 4 - 100 %); penicillin (91. 4 - 100 %) and septrin (76. 5 - 91. 4 %).
