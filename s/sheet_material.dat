25|$|Flat, circular, and unusually shaped walls can {{be covered}} with copper cladding. Most are field-formed from <b>sheet</b> <b>material.</b> They can also be pre-manufactured. In addition, {{engineered}} systems such as insulated panels, non-insulated honeycomb panels, copper screen panels, and structural wall claddings are available. Horizontal copper siding provides a relatively flat appearance with fine horizontal lines. Beveled copper panels have depth for heavy-shadowed effects. Flat siding has minimal shadows. Structural panels {{are designed to be}} attached directly to a wall structure without the use of a continuous substrate. Diagonal flat lock panels are used on curved surfaces, such as domes, spires and vaults. Horizontal flat lock panels are basically identical to flat seam roofing applied on a vertical surface. Copper screen panels are a lightweight finish screen that can be perforated or have shaped openings to function as sun or decorative screens. A copper alloy curtain wall is a non-structural outer building covering that keeps out weather. Composite copper cladding is made by attaching copper sheeting to both sides of rigid thermoplastic sheet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bending and {{subsequent}} stretching of <b>sheet</b> <b>materials</b> {{is typical of}} many sheet forming operations. Bending and bend-stretching characteristics and limit strain of monolithic AA 2024 and laminated tri-layer Alclad 2024 aluminum <b>sheet</b> <b>materials</b> are studied by modeling and experimentation. A computationally efficient analytical model based on advanced bending theory is developed for the laminated <b>sheet</b> <b>materials</b> and utilized to predict the bending characteristics of the above <b>sheet</b> <b>materials.</b> The effects of cladding thickness ratio on the bending characteristics of laminated sheet are compared with the monolithic constituent. Also, predictions from the above analytical bending model are compared with 2 D and 3 D FE-based bending models. In addition, bend-stretching experiments are conducted using a specialized test jig while continuously recording images using dual-camera set-up from tensile surface and edge of the specimen. A stochastic pattern {{is applied to the}} specimen prior to the test and the images are later processed to analyze the development and localization of strains based on digital image correlation (or DIC) method. Strain maps from DIC analysis are utilized to determine the limit strain {{in the vicinity of the}} bend line, as well as from FE modeling of bend-stretching tests, using maximum major strain acceleration criterion for localized necking proposed by one of the authors. The results from experimental and modeling work indicate higher limit strains in bend-stretching for Alclad 2024 compared to monolithic AA 2024 sheet...|$|R
