50|$|Most microbolometers {{contain a}} {{temperature}} sensitive resistor {{which makes them}} a passive electronic device. In 1994 one company, Electro-Optic <b>Sensor</b> <b>Design</b> (EOSD), began looking into producing microbolometers that used a thin film transistor (TFT), which is {{a special kind of}} field effect transistor. The main change in these devices would be the addition of a gate electrode. Although the main concepts of the devices are similar, using this design allows for the advantages of the TFT to be utilized. Some benefits include tuning of the resistance and activation energy and the reduction of periodic noise patterns. As of 2004 this device was still being tested and was not used in commercial IR imaging.|$|E
