40|$|We {{report on}} a further {{investigation}} of a new method {{that can be used}} to address vibrational dynamics and propagation of <b>stress</b> <b>waves</b> in liquids. The method is based on the decomposition of the macroscopic Green-Kubo stress correlation function into the atomic level stress correlation functions. This decomposition, as was demonstrated previously for a model liquid studied in molecular dynamics simulations, reveals the presence of <b>stress</b> <b>waves</b> propagating over large distances and a structure that resembles the pair density function. In this paper, by performing the Fourier transforms of the atomic level stress correlation functions, we elucidate how the lifetimes of the <b>stress</b> <b>waves</b> and the ranges of their propagation depend on their frequency, wavevector, and temperature. These results relate frequency and wavevector dependence of the generalized viscosity to the character of propagation of the shear <b>stress</b> <b>waves.</b> In particular, the results suggest that an increase in the value of the frequency dependent viscosity at low frequencies with decrease of temperature is related to the increase in the ranges of propagation of the <b>stress</b> <b>waves</b> of the corresponding low frequencies. We found that the ranges of propagation of the shear <b>stress</b> <b>waves</b> of frequencies less than half of the Einstein frequency, extend well beyond the nearest neighbor shell even above the melting temperature.
