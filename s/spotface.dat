50|$|For a <b>spotface,</b> {{material}} {{is removed from}} a surface to make it flat and smooth, usually for a fastener or a bearing. Spotfacing is usually required on workpieces that are forged or cast. A tool {{referred to as a}} counterbore is typically used to cut the <b>spotface,</b> although an endmill may also be used. Only enough {{material is}} removed to make the surface flat.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas a {{counterbore}} is a flat-bottomed enlargement of a smaller coaxial hole, a countersink is a conical enlargement of such. A <b>spotface</b> often {{takes the form}} of a very shallow counterbore.|$|E
50|$|Standards {{exist for}} the sizes of counterbores, {{especially}} for fastener head seating areas. These standards can vary between corporations and between standards organizations. For example, in Boeing Design Manual BDM-1327 section 3.5, the nominal diameter of the spotfaced surface {{is the same as}} the nominal size of the cutter, and is equal to the flat seat diameter plus twice the fillet radius. This is in contrast to the ASME Y14.5-2009 definition of a <b>spotface,</b> which is equal to the flat seat diameter.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spotfacing</b> is {{the facing}} of spots (localized areas), {{such as the}} bearing {{surfaces}} on which bolt heads or washers will sit.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{fastener}} designs can obviate <b>spotfacing</b> {{for some}} applications. For example, a self-aligning nut allows the nut {{to find its}} own perpendicularity to the thread axis by floating via a pair of spherical bearing surfaces (a ball-in-cup arrangement).|$|R
5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are {{counterbore}} cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat <b>spotface</b> is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>spotface</b> or {{spot face}} is a {{machined}} feature in which a certain region of the workpiece (a spot) is faced, providing a smooth, flat, accurately located surface. This is especially relevant on workpieces cast or forged, where the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose roughness, flatness, and location are subject to wider tolerances and thus not assured with a machining level of precision. The most common application of spotfacing (spot facing) is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done by cutting a shallow counterbore, just deep enough [...] "to clean up"—that is, only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat. Other common applications of spotfacing involve facing a pad onto a boss, creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots, {{without the need for}} finishing all over (FAO).|$|E
40|$|Three tools {{designed}} used {{together to}} prepare honeycomb panels for insertion of hardware to support structural members or electronic packages. Tools speed up and simplify time-consuming operation of manually pushing honeycomb material aside {{to make room}} for spool-shaped mounting insert.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the field of printed boards, and more specifically a printed circuit with a multi-layer structure. According to the invention, the printed circuit (100) with a multi-layer structure comprises: - a first layer (1) machined to form a <b>spotface</b> passing through the layer, - a second layer (2) comprising a first cavity (23) passing through the layer, - a third layer (3) comprising, on one face, an electronic component (33) such that it is in the first cavity, - a fourth layer (4) comprising a second cavity (43), - a heat conducting element with two parts: o one (13) made from metal called a thermal cover, inserted into the <b>spotface</b> (18) of the first layer so as to mechanically and electrically close the first cavity, o the other (14) made from a dielectric material with heat conduction > 30 W/(m. K), placed in the first cavity so as to be in contact with the electronic component...|$|E
40|$|Innovation, {{leading to}} weight and cost reduction, {{is a key}} word {{concerning}} the design of steel auto body for auto makers that aim to keep and improve their market share worldwide. On the other hand, auto body life, which {{is related to the}} corrosion resistance of the materials employed, should always be considered. The latter has led the auto makers to team up with suppliers to find the best solutions concerning the materials selection. The end result always points towards different sets of steels either zinc-coated or zinc alloyed-coated. Taking all these aspects into consideration, the overall challenge the auto makers face is to mitigate the time required for selection and narrow down the options available. This paper studies the corrosion resistance of several materials applied on steel auto bodies using the technique named <b>spotface,</b> which main advantage is reducing the time required by the traditional scribe to evaluate and compare different materials, when they are submitted either to accelerated or field corrosion testing. Concerning the accelerated corrosion testing, they were performed according to the General Motors do Brasil’s requirements...|$|E
