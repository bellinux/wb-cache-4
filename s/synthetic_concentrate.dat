40|$|International audienceThe primary {{limitations}} to inland brackish water reverse osmosis (RO) desalination are {{the cost and}} technical feasibility of concentrate disposal. To decrease concentrate volume, a side-stream process {{can be used to}} precipitate problematic scaling salts and remove the precipitate with a solid/liquid separation step.

Antiscalants are used in an RO system to prevent salt precipitation but might affect side-stream concentrate treatment. Precipitation experiments were performed on a <b>synthetic</b> RO <b>concentrate</b> with and without antiscalant; of particular interest was the precipitation of calcium carbonate.

Poor long term patency of prosthetic materials is due to distal anastomotic intimal hyperplasia. Intimal hyperplasia is directly linked to shear stress abnormalities at the vessel wall. Compliance and calibre mismatch between native vessel and graft, as well as anastomotic line stress concentration contribute towards unnatural wall shear stress. High porosity reduces graft compliance by causing fibrovascular infiltration, whereas low porosity discourages {{the development of an}} endothelial lining and hence effective antithrombogenicity.

40|$|Co-precipitation and {{absorption}} {{methods were}} investigated for removal of boron from produced water, which is groundwater {{brought to the}} surface during {{oil and natural gas}} extraction. Boron can be toxic to many crops and often needs to be controlled to low levels in irrigation water. The present research focused on synthetic reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate modeled on concentrate expected from a future treatment facility at the Arroyo Grande Oil Field on the central coast of California. The produced water at this site is brackish with a boron concentration of 8 mg/L and an expected temperature of 80 °C. The future overall produced water treatment process will include lime softening, micro-filtration, cooling, ion exchange, and finally RO. Projected boron concentrations in the RO concentrate are 20 to 25 mg/L. Concentrate temperature will be near ambient. This RO concentrate will be injected back into the formation. To prevent an accumulation of boron in the formation, it is desired to reduce boron concentrations in this concentrate and partition the boron into a solid sludge that could be transported out of the area. The primary method explored for boron removal during this study was adsorption and co-precipitation by magnesium chloride. Some magnesium oxide tests were also conducted. Jar testing was used to determine the degree of boron removal as a function of initial concentration, pH, temperature, and reaction time. <b>Synthetic</b> RO <b>concentrate</b> was used to control background water quality factors that could potentially influence boron removal. The standard <b>synthetic</b> RO <b>concentrate</b> contained 8 g NaCl/L, 150 mg Si/L and 30 mg B/L. After <b>synthetic</b> RO <b>concentrate</b> was prepared, amendments (e. g. sulfate, sodium chloride) were added and the pH adjusted to the desired value. Each solution was then carried through a mixing and settling protocol (5 min at 200 RPM, 10 min at 20 RPM, followed by 30 min settling and filtration). Boron concentrations from the jar tests were determined using the Carmine colorimetric method. Boron removal with magnesium chloride was greatest at a pH of 11. 0. At this pH 87 % of boron was removed using 5. 0 g/L MgCl 2 ◦ 6 H 2 O at 20 °C. Mixing time did not greatly affect boron removal for mixing periods of 5 to 1321 minutes. This result indicates equilibrium was achieved during the 45 -min experimental protocol. Maximum boron removal was observed in the temperature range of 29 °C to 41 °C. At 68 °C boron removal decreased five-fold compared to the reduction observed at 29 °C to 41 °C. For treatment of the cool concentrate, this relatively low optimal temperature range gives magnesium chloride an advantage over magnesium oxide, which is effective only at high temperatures. Neither sodium chloride nor sodium sulfate affected boron removal by magnesium chloride for the chloride and sulfate concentrations expected in the produced water at this site. In contrast, silica did inhibit boron removal, with removal decreasing from 30 % to 5 % when silica concentration was increased from 0 to 100 mmols/L. This result was unexpected because other researchers have reported silica is necessary for effective removal of boron by magnesium chloride. To investigate the reasons for the differing boron removal results for magnesium chloride and magnesium oxide, solids produced by the two reagents were compared using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). Solids from magnesium chloride contained 30 % amorphous material versus 10 % for magnesium oxide. The crystalline components from the magnesium oxide treatment were for the most part magnesium oxide, whereas magnesium chloride crystalline solids were a combination of brucite (Mg(OH) 2) and magnesium chloride hydroxide. The greater boron adsorption observed with magnesium chloride could thus either be attributed to the greater surface area of the amorphous precipitate and/or the higher boron affinity of brucite and magnesium chloride hydroxide. Adsorption isotherms were plotted for boron removal by magnesium compounds formed during precipitation. Boron adsorption followed a linear isotherm (r 2 = 0. 92) for boron concentrations up to 37. 8 mg B/L. While the data also fit Langmuir and Freundlich models the data fell in the linear range of those models. The linearity of the adsorption curves indicates that adsorption sites for boron were not saturated at these concentrations. The linearity means that higher boron concentrations in the RO concentrate will lead to greater mass removal, up to concentrations of at least 37. 8 mg/L boron. Using magnesium chloride, boron removal by co-precipitation was more effective than by adsorption to pre-formed precipitate. Removal approximately doubled for a given dose of magnesium chloride. The effectiveness of co-precipitation presumably occurs due to entrapment of boron as the precipitate forms. This study has shown the potential of magnesium chloride as an agent for boron removal by determining those conditions most effective for boron co-precipitation and adsorption. Magnesium chloride {{has been shown to be}} more effective than magnesium oxide. Magnesium chloride also out-performed treatment with slaked quicklime, which was tested previously by others. Two important limitations of boron removal with magnesium chloride are the high chemical requirements (5 g/L MgCl 2) and sludge production (1 g/g MgCl 2 used). These are greatly mitigated by treatment of RO concentrate rather than the full produced water flow. In addition, reagent use and sludge production might be decreased by recycling sludge from the up-front lime softening process. Compared to magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride removes greater quantities of boron per mole of magnesium added (20 mg B/g MgCl 2). The magnesium chloride isotherm demonstrated that treatment of RO concentrate required less reagent and produced less sludge per mass of boron removed than treatment of the more dilute feed water...|$|R

Experiments involving phosphate starvation and restoration showed that basic amino acid content was almost wholly independent of polyphosphate pools. Moreover, the normal high degree of compartmentation of arginine in vesicles was maintained despite polyphosphate depletion, and arginine was still exchanged across the vesicular membrane. We conclude that N. crassa, like yeasts, can regulate polyphosphates and basic amino acids independently, and that the accumulation of basic amino acids in vesicles may depend upon an energy-requiring mechanism in addition to the demonstrated charge interaction with polyphosphate...|$|R

Fibrinogen <b>concentrate</b> {{has emerged as a}} promising strategy to treat coagulopathy, and factor XIII (FXIII) works synergistically with fibrinogen to correct coagulopathy following haemodilution with crystalloids. Our objectives were to examine the ability of fibrinogen and FXIII concentrates to reverse albumin-induced dilutional coagulopathy. Methods. High and low concentrations of both fibrinogen and FXIII were used to reverse coagulopathy induced by 1 : 1 dilution in vitro with 5 % albumin of blood samples from healthy volunteers, monitored by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM(®)). Results. Haemodilution with albumin significantly attenuated EXTEM maximum clot firmness (MCF), alpha angle (AA), clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT), and FIBTEM MCF (p < 0. 001). Following haemodilution, both doses of fibrinogen significantly corrected all ROTEM parameters (p ≤ 0. 02), except the lower dose did not correct AA. Compared to the lower dose, the higher dose of fibrinogen significantly improved FIBTEM MCF and EXTEM MCF, AA and CFT (p < 0. 001). The lower dose of FXIII did not significantly correct any of the ROTEM parameters, and the high dose only improved EXTEM CT (p = 0. 004). All combinations of high/low concentrations of fibrinogen/FXIII significantly improved all ROTEM parameters examined (p ≤ 0. 001). Fibrinogen concentration generally had a greater effect on each parameter than did FXIII concentration; the best correction of ROTEM parameters was achieved with high-dose fibrinogen concentrate and either low- or high-dose FXIII.

The present research aims to develop a concept for metals removal and recovery using stabilized colloidal suspensions of activated silica sol, which acts as a neutralizing agent and an adsorption medium. Silica sol was prepared by firstly acidifying a sodium silicate solution to initiate polymerization, which would ultimately yield a gel. Polymerization was then arrested before gelation by water dilution giving a stabilized, negatively charged sol. Adsorption and precipitation were distinguished by comparing the coloured products from adding silica sol, lime or sodium hydroxide to cobaltous sulphate solution. Studies of dissolved copper/silica sol interactions showed copper adsorption/desorption to be a reversible pH-controlled process, which was monitored 'in-situ' using a cupric specific ion electrode. Dissolved copper values determined by the electrode were identical to those measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) for solutions at below pH 7. At above pH 7, the electrode showed zero dissolved cupric, but AAS reported some dissolved copper, attributed to desorbed colloidal cupric hydroxide. A copper/sol underflow sharply divided from a clear overflow were the adsorption products. Addition of concentrated sulphuric acid to centrifuged underflow produced a concentrated copper solution and regenerated sol. The separation of two metals (cupric and ferric) using pH control was also demonstrated.

40|$|Anaerobic {{membrane}} bioreactors (AnMBRs) physically ensure biomass retention by {{the application}} of a membrane filtration process. With growing application experiences from aerobic membrane bioreactors (MBRs), the combination of membrane and anaerobic processes has received much attention and become more attractive and feasible, due to advantages provided by the combination with regard to developments for energy-efficient wastewater treatment. The major drawbacks of MBR technology are related with membrane costs, especially for the full-scale applications, fouling and low flux. Dynamic membrane (DM) technology may be a promising approach to resolve the drawbacks encountered in MBR processes. One of the most important potential benefits of DMs is that the membrane itself may be no longer necessary, because solids rejection is accomplished by the secondary membrane layer that can be formed and re-formed as a self-forming DM in situ. Different kinds of materials such as mesh, woven or nonwoven fabric instead of microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes can be used as the support layer for creating DM. In this way, the replacement of the membrane by a low cost filter material is possible. By decreasing membrane cost and generating energy, dynamic AnMBRs (AnDMBRs) would be attractive for waste(water) treatment. The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the applicability of DM technology for the treatment of concentrated wastewaters in AnMBRs. Moreover, this thesis provides additional information and understanding of DM technology, including assessment of DM formation and filtration characteristics under different conditions. Submerged and external membrane module configurations were used in order to determine the effect of the configuration on removal efficiency and DM filterability. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>concentrated</b> wastewater with an average COD concentration of 20 g/L was used as the substrate. Determination of an optimal support material and investigations about its structure were achieved by testing various types of support materials including monofilament, multifilament and staple yarn types. Besides, different operating conditions were tested at low fluxes under mesophilic conditions to determine the optimal operation conditions enabling the optimal removal efficiency and permeate quality. Moreover, cost estimation in terms of support material acquisition was also presented. The results show that support material properties were critical for the formation of an effective dynamic membrane (cake) layer over the filter surface. The critical fluxes obtained with the staple and monofilament filter cloths were higher than those obtained with multifilament material. The results indicate that staple filter cloth was more suitable for depth 8 filtration, whereas mono-monofilament filter was more suitable for surface (cake) filtration. Thus, mono-monofilament filter was considered more appropriate for DM technology. The results presented in this thesis show that the DM filtration concept can turn one of the most important disadvantages of MBRs, membrane fouling, into an advantage. Polypropylene mono-monofilament filter cloth was used to form a dynamic membrane (cake) layer and to provide filtration by this self-forming layer as an alternative to microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes. The AnDMBR achieved over 99 % organic matter removal and particulate matter retention. Moreover, over 60 % soluble COD removal and over 50 % VFA removal were obtained by the DM layer. Considering the results of this research, it was shown that a stable operation with AnDMBRs could be possible for a long period. Sludge retention time (SRT) was found an important factor in AnDMBRs that had a significant effect on soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production, protein/carbohydrate ratio, particle size of the sludge, DM layer formation and bulk sludge filterability. Bound EPS is mainly composed of cell surface materials, including proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids and humic acids. EPS keeps the sludge flocs together on the membrane surface by surrounding them. EPS had a significant positive effect on particle flocculation and thus, particle size distribution in the bulk sludge. Prolonged SRT resulted in lower EPS concentrations in the bulk sludge compared to short SRTs. A combination of backwashing and biogas sparging enabled the control of DM layer thickness, which is of great importance to obtain a stable operation and high quality permeate. A combined effect of biomass activity and physical retention capacity through the cake layer might be responsible for the removal of organic matter and retention of particulate matter by the DM layer. Pyrosequencing analyses showed that diversity and richness of the microbial communities including bacteria and archaea in the DM layer were high and microbial population composition in the DM layer was different compared to the bulk sludge in the AnDMBR. Following the DM layer morphological analyses results, the DM layer was formed by both organic and inorganic materials, such as sludge particles, SMP, EPS, Ca, N, P, and Mg precipitates. Moreover, a partial gel layer formation under the cake layer was detected. Accumulation of SMP and bound EPS in the DM layer in high amounts led the formation of a dense cake layer and effective retention. Accumulation of organic matters is also related with operating conditions such as SRT. This research also showed that although slightly better permeate quality in terms of COD concentration was obtained by submerged AnDMBR, high COD removal efficiencies were achieved in both submerged and external AnDMBR configurations. Comparison of the effects of membrane configuration on treatment and filterability performance showed that more time was needed in the external AnDMBR in order to form an effective DM layer enabling a stable removal efficiency and low soluble COD concentration in the permeate. Therefore, submerged AnDMBR configuration appears more suitable when a short start-up period is 9 necessary. Higher methane production rate and methane yield were obtained in the submerged configuration compared to the external configuration reflecting the negative effect of sludge recirculation in the external DM configuration. Conversely, sludge recirculation in the external configuration was more effective in decreasing DM thickness, thus transmembrane pressure, than the bottom biogas sparging in the submerged configuration. Considering the tested different gas sparging velocities (GSVs), over 99 % organic removal was obtained with the external AnDMBR configuration for high strength wastewater treatment irrespective of the GSV, although total filtration resistance increased with decreasing GSV. Total filtration resistance mainly consisted of the resistance by the DM layer that provided effective and stable treatment. Following the organic loading rate study, the AnDMBR achieved high COD removal efficiency at 3. 6 kg COD/m 3. d. In conclusion, following the results obtained in this study, DM technology achieved a stable and high quality permeate. Thus, AnDMBRs can be used as a reliable and satisfactory treatment technology for treatment of high strength wastewaters. Low capital costs of support material and energy generation can make AnDMBRs feasible for those situations in which a high flux is not necessary, such as sludge and slurry treatment or highly concentrated industrial wastewater treatment. However, research on AnDMBRs is still very limited. Longterm applicability and reliability of the DM applications need further research, focusing on cake layer control methods to allow satisfactory DM layer formation as well as on the effect of sludge properties on DM filtration characteristics for large-scale applications.

40|$|Reverse osmosis (RO) {{desalination}} of inland {{brackish water}} can replenish dwindling water supplies in various regions around the world. However, {{successful implementation of}} RO technology requires high product water recovery (> 85 %) {{in order to minimize}} the volume of generated concentrate brine. Therefore, brine management is a critical aspect of inland water desalination. At high water recovery, dissolved mineral salts (e. g. CaSO 4, CaCO 3) may concentrate above their solubility limits and may crystallize, potentially blocking or damaging RO membrane surfaces, reduce water permeate flux, and shorten membrane life. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the propensity for mineral scaling in order to increase the potential for high product water recovery. Attaining high recovery for inland water desalination, while avoiding membrane mineral scaling, can be achieved via an intermediate concentrate demineralization (ICD) method that utilizes two-step chemically-enhanced seeded precipitation (CESP) process. In the CESP approach, primary RO concentrate is first treated via partial lime softening in which residual antiscalant in the PRO concentrate is scavenged by precipitating calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). The filtered lime treated PRO concentrate is then treated in a seeded gypsum (CaSO 4 • 2 H 2 O) precipitation step whereby, gypsum crystal seeds promote rapid crystal growth. As a consequence, the treated PRO stream is desupersaturated with respect to gypsum and upon filtration step; a secondary RO desalting step is carried out to increase the overall product water recovery. 	Development of the ICD approach as a continuous process suitable for deployment in RO desalting is the focus of the present study. Accordingly, a novel system for continuous chemically enhanced seeded precipitation (CCESP) pilot was developed and constructed consisting of an alkaline chemical softening flocculation tank followed by a vertical static mixing bed reactor for seeded precipitation. The overall feasible feed slow rate for the pilot CCESP system was 0. 026 – 0. 25 gpm. Evaluation of the continuous ICD process performance was undertaken with a range of solutions that mimic PRO concentrate produced from desalination of San Joaquin Valley brackish water at a recovery of 63 %. The major salts in the PRO concentrate feed to the CCESP included CaCl 2 (30. 7 mM), Na 2 SO 4 (145. 4 mM), MgSO 4 (31. 2 mM), NaHCO 3 (11. 4 mM), and NaCl (20. 3 mM). Antiscalant (Flocon 260, 5 mg/L) was introduced to the PRO concentrate in order to assess the feasibility for residual antiscalant (typically present in PRO concentrate) removal so as to avoid retardation of the subsequent gypsum desupersaturation step. The CCESP system enabled continuous gypsum desupersaturation by purging spent gypsum seeds and recycling a portion of the seeds or introducing fresh seeds to the fluidized bed. Various gypsum seeds were tested, with a focus on industrial sources for gypsum (e. g. mining, drywall, food, agriculture) due to their availability and low cost. The purity of the gypsum seeds was found to be a key factor, where gypsum seeds with > 98 % purity were found to be most effective. Using the <b>synthetic</b> PRO <b>concentrate,</b> each of the two steps of the process were first evaluated individually to determine the optimal operating conditions and subsequently combined to evaluate the complete continuous operation. In the CCESP, lime softening occurs in a flocculation tank with recirculation, solids removal from the lime treated stream is via an inline centrifugal separator, and the gypsum seeded precipitation takes place in a fluidized bed. It was found that CCESP treatment of the PRO concentrate with 5. 75 mM lime enabled up to 68 % removal of the residual antiscalant. Subsequent gypsum seeded precipitation (initial seed loading of 240 g/L gypsum) reduced the PRO concentrate gypsum supersaturation index (SIg) level from 2. 36 to nearly unity. The above level of gypsum desupersaturation was assessed to be sufficient for carrying out a secondary RO desalting that would enable increased recovery from 63 % at the PRO step to an overall recovery of about 85 % and possibly higher. 	The present study successfully developed a continuous ICD process and demonstrated its technical feasibility. The present results are encouraging and support the merit of evaluating the process under field conditions. Overall, it is expected that deployment of the CCESP process will enable high recovery desalting of challenging inland water of high mineral scaling propensity...|$|R
40|$|Various regions {{around the}} world are confronted with dwindling water {{supplies}} and thus the need for exploiting non-traditional inland brackish water resource, as well as reclamation and reuse of municipal wastewater and agricultural drainage (AD) water. Reverse osmosis (RO) membrane desalination is the primary technology for inland brackish water desalting. However, successful implementation of RO technology requires operation at high product water recovery (> 85 %) in order to minimize the volume of generated concentrate (i. e., brine). Brine management is a key factor governing the economics of inland water desalination. Therefore, brine volume reduction is critical to enabling various brine residual management options. At high water recovery, dissolved mineral salts (e. g., CaSO 4, BaSO 4, CaCO 3) may become concentrated above their solubility limits and may crystallize in the bulk and onto the surface of the RO membranes. Mineral crystallization leads to membrane scaling and hence leads to flux decline, increased process costs, and shortening of membrane life. Therefore, the attainable desalination water recovery is limited by mineral scaling. Many inland brackish water sources contain high concentrations of sparingly soluble mineral salts. In certain areas, such as in California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV), brackish water is near saturation with respect to calcium sulfate and barium sulfate. Based on the current work, single-stage RO desalination in SJV would generally be limited to ~ 50 - 70 %. In order to desalt brackish water of high mineral scaling propensity at a high recovery level (> 85 %), the feasibility of intermediate concentrate demineralization (ICD) of primary RO (PRO) concentrate, as a means of enabling secondary RO (SRO) desalting, was investigated with a focus on brackish water having high concentrations of gypsum salt precursor ions (i. e., calcium and sulfate). Accordingly, a two-step chemically-enhanced seeded precipitation (CESP) ICD process was developed in which the PRO concentrate is treated prior to further SRO desalting. The first step is lime precipitation softening (PS) which serves to induce sufficient CaCO 3 crystallization in order to remove residual antiscalant (AS), a PRO feed treatment additive (generally polymeric) used for scale control, that would otherwise inhibit precipitation (in the ICD) of the target mineral salt scalants. Subsequently, gypsum seeded precipitation (GSP) is carried out to reduce the level of calcium sulfate saturation. The CESP process was evaluated experimentally, in a batch crystallizer, using <b>synthetic</b> PRO <b>concentrate</b> and also PRO concentrate generated in the field, from AD water, using a spiral-wound RO pilot plant. The effect of residual AS (from the PRO stage) on retardation of mineral salt precipitation (in the ICD) was evaluated using both a generic (polyacrylic acid) and a commercial AS. Laboratory batch CESP studies were carried out in which the CESP process conditions were first optimized with respect to the required lime and gypsum seed doses. For raw brackish water that was about 98 % saturated with respect to gypsum, PRO desalination at 52 %- 62 % recovery yielded a brine stream 70 - 150 % above saturation. CESP treatment, at lime doses of 0. 25 - 0. 35 mg/L and gypsum seeding of 4 - 5 g/L, enabled reduction of gypsum concentration to only 10 - 15 % above its saturation. In general, the sequential processes of lime treatment for 10 - 20 minutes followed by ~ 1 hr of GSP were sufficient to achieve the above level of gypsum desupersaturation. GSP alone reduced gypsum saturation by only ~ 5 %. PRO brine desupersaturation via CESP was feasible due to the effectiveness of AS removal (up to 90 % for AS content of up to 10 mg/L in the PRO brine). Analysis of AS removal using a fundamental AS adsorption model, along with measurements of the size distribution of precipitating CaCO 3 crystals, indicated that the area for AS adsorption provided by lime-induced nucleation of CaCO 3 crystals is the key factor governing AS removal. In order to establish the feasibility of deploying CESP as a continuous process, a numerical model was developed for a fluidized bed reactor for the GSP stage. Model simulations indicated that the required level of calcium sulfate desupersaturation could be maintained by solids recycling leading to a steady-state particle size distribution. Process simulations and economic analysis were carried out for the integrated process of PRO, CESP and SRO (PRO-CESP-SRO) demonstrating the existence of an optimal recovery (with respect to product water treatment cost). For the evaluated SJV brackish AD water source, the optimal recovery was about 93 %. Overall brackish water treatment cost, when considering the disposal cost of high salinity AD water, was lower for PRO-CESP-SRO relative to a similar process based on conventional PS or utilizing a single stage RO which would be of limited recovery (< 62 %). The current work suggests that, at inland areas with limited options for management of high salinity water, high recovery desalination can be economically attractive when considering the reduction in brine disposal cost and the value of the product water produced by the PRO-CESP-SRO process...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLarge class B fires [...] i. e. polar or non polar burning liquids [...] {{can occur}} in places like refineries, {{airports}} or chemical plants. Such fires can be put out {{with the help of}} fire fighting foams prepared from specific aqueous formulations, called foam concentrates diluted in water to 1 - 6 % and applied with a nozzle under the form of foam. Foam concentrates usually contain hydrocarbon surfactants or protein hydrolysates (<b>synthetic</b> or proteinic <b>concentrate),</b> and one or several fluorinated surfactants in case of high performance foam concentrates. During industrial solvent fires large amounts of water and foam are used: several cubic meters per minute during several days. Resulting water consists of either water from the foam and water used to protect equipment and persons from the heat of the fire. Therefore its composition is expected to be somehow close to diluted foaming solution. Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules able to lower interfacial tension. These compounds have the particularity to self-aggregate when their concentration reaches the critical micelle concentration. Fluorinated surfactants are a particular class of surfactants which can dramatically lower the water surface tension. This ability {{plays a key role in}} the efficiency of firefighting waters. In addition, fluorinated surfactants are highly resistant to thermal and chemical attacks. The current treatment for firefighting waters is therefore incineration in halogen resistant incinerators, which is not economically viable and not convenient on a logistical point of view. A previous paper aimed at proposing a process for purifying firefighting water containing fluorinated surfactants [1]. Experimental results indicated that electrocoagulation and filtration followed by reverse osmosis efficiently treated the water from fire extinguishment. In this work we focused on the reverse osmosis step. Polyamide and cellulose acetate membrane materials were screened in a flat sheet cell. with model solutions representative of synthetic fire fighting foams. The most appropriate membrane considering rejection was a smooth anti foulant thin film polyamide SG membrane, designed for brackish water. However, because of membrane fouling, there was a trade-off between high rejection and low flux decline. The SG membrane showed even better rejection properties in spiral-wound module with both real and model pretreated firefighting waters. Though the flux decline was high, it seemed to tend to an asymptote with the increasing concentration. The stabilities of rejection and flux decline were confirmed during longer tests on an industrial pilot with another fouling resistant thin film polyamide membrane for brackish water, a RE 2540 -FE membrane. The flux decline caused by the surfactant mixtures was found linked to adsorption. The flux decline seemed mainly due to the adsorption of the anionic surfactant which showed the highest adsorption density in concentrated solutions (figure 1). This surfactant also showed lowest rejection properties. However, selective removal of this compound for purpose of flux enhancement, if desired, should be carefully studied. Indeed, with little or no anionic surfactant in the solutions, there would be more "free room" for the hydrophobic adsorption of the other surfactants on the membrane, which could decrease their rejections. A model was proposed to describe the flux decline as function of the fluorinated surfactant concentration, somehow representing the global surfactant concentration. This model combined the resistance-in-series model to a Langmuir adsorption model by expressing the adsorption resistance as function of the retentate concentration (figure 2). Though this model would require to be tuned on the basis of extended experimental data, it adequately described the flux decline with retentate concentration of the model pretreated firefighting water. Further work could be done on the subject via membrane surface characterization, and study of mixed adsorption as well as mixed micellization of surfactant mixtures. In this work, solid data was gathered, such as the average rejection of the fluorinated surfactant in the industrial pilot which was 99. 95 %, and the permeability of the membrane of 0. 5 L h m − 2 bar − 1 with model solution representing pretreated firefighting water concentrated by a factor 20. This could allow the calculation of the area required for the mobile unit...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) as a concentration method for improving the lateral-flow immunoassay (LFA) detection of proteins and bacteria at the point-of-care (POC). In the first portion of the thesis, the polyethylene glycol (PEG) -potassium phosphate (salt) ATPS was used to concentrate transferrin (Tf), a model protein for C-reactive protein (CRP), to the interfacial region between the two bulk phases of the ATPS. In the second portion of the thesis, the PEG-salt ATPS was used to concentrate the bacterium Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) into the bottom PEG-poor, salt-rich phase of the ATPS. For both studies, the ATPS concentration step was integrated with LFA {{in order to improve}} the detection of protein and bacterial targets. Our technologies therefore have the potential to improve POC solutions that require target concentration, such as detecting CRP and S. mutans in the respective oral disease diagnostic tests for periodontal disease and dental caries. The detection of proteins at the POC allows for the chairside detection of diseases such as periodontal disease, which is associated with the presence of CRP in the body. A detection assay that is rapid, inexpensive, portable, and easy to use is ideal for this application, whereby the LFA is one such assay that fulfills these requirements. However, the sensitivity of LFA is inferior to laboratory-based assays, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and needs to be improved. In order to improve the protein sensitivity of LFA, we utilized the PEG-salt ATPS to concentrate our model protein Tf prior to detection. Due to the size of proteins and other small biomolecules, these biomolecules will partition evenly between the two phases of the ATPS. To address this issue, we developed a novel approach that utilized larger colloidal gold nanoparticles decorated with anti-Tf antibodies that partitioned preferentially to the interfacial region between the two phases due to a delicate balance of the components comprising the nanoparticles. These nanoparticles bound to Tf and aided its transport to the interfacial region where Tf was consequently concentrated. Since the interfacial region represents a very small volume region that forms irrespective of the volume ratio, the volume ratio that reached equilibrium in the shortest time was chosen, reducing the sample extraction time to 10 min for phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and to within 15 - 25 min for the complex solutions of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and <b>synthetic</b> urine. By <b>concentrating</b> Tf prior to LFA detection, the detection limit of LFA was improved by 100 -fold from 1 ng/?L to 0. 01 ng/?L in PBS, FBS, and synthetic urine. Thus, the ability to concentrate Tf bound to colloidal gold nanoparticles in a shorter duration of time provides a novel approach for improving LFA detection of small biomolecules. POC detection of bacteria also allows for the chairside detection of diseases such as dental caries, which is caused by the presence of S. mutans. As in protein detection, the rapid time to result, low cost, portability, and ease of use make LFA an appropriate detection assay for the detection of bacteria. However, the bacterial sensitivity of LFA is inferior to laboratory-based methods, {{such as the use of}} cell culture with subsequent colony counts, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and ELISA. Thus, we utilized the PEG-salt ATPS with an extreme volume ratio to concentrate S. mutans prior to LFA detection. Unlike proteins, S. mutans and other bacterial cells are larger in size and will experience greater steric, excluded-volume interactions with the PEG polymers present at higher concentrations in the PEG-rich, salt-poor phase of the ATPS, causing extreme partitioning to the PEG-poor, salt-rich phase. The S. mutans bacteria concentrated in the PEG-poor, salt-rich phase was extracted, mixed with colloidal gold nanoparticles decorated with anti-S. mutans antibodies, and applied to an LFA test strip. When S. mutans was concentrated prior to LFA detection, the detection limit of LFA was improved by slightly less than 10 -fold from approximately 107 colony forming units (CFU) /mL to approximately 106 CFU/mL in PBS. The results of this study confirmed the applicability of using a PEG-salt ATPS to concentrate bacteria into one phase prior to extracting that phase for subsequent addition to an LFA test strip. Therefore, these results form the basis for future studies in which the longer phase separation time associated with extreme volume ratios will be addressed to allow for improved bacterial detection assay sensitivity within a shorter period of time...|$|R
