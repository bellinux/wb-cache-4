40|$|Pineal {{melatonin}} release {{exhibits a}} circadian rhythm {{with a tight}} nocturnal pattern. Melatonin synthesis is regulated by the master circadian clock within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and is also directly inhibited by light. The SCN is necessary for both circadian regulation and light inhibition of melatonin synthesis and thus it {{has been difficult to}} isolate these two regulatory limbs to define the output pathways by which the SCN conveys circadian and light phase information to the pineal. A 22 -h light-dark (LD) cycle forced desynchrony protocol leads to the stable dissociation of rhythmic clock gene expression within the ventrolateral SCN (vlSCN) and the dorsomedial SCN (dmSCN). In the present study, we have used this protocol to assess the pattern of melatonin release under forced desynchronization of these SCN subregions. In light of our reported patterns of clock gene expression in the forced desynchronized rat, we propose that the vlSCN oscillator entrains to the 22 -h LD cycle whereas the dmSCN shows relative coordination to the light-entrained vlSCN, and that this dual-oscillator configuration accounts for the pattern of melatonin release. We present a simple mathematical model in which the relative coordination of a single oscillator within the dmSCN to a single light-entrained oscillator within the vlSCN faithfully portrays the circadian phase, duration and amplitude of melatonin release under forced desynchronization. Our results underscore the importance of the SCN`s <b>subregional</b> <b>organization</b> to both photic input processing and rhythmic output control.

The partners in the organization of this meeting were ECLAC, the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the Organization of American States (OAS), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Fifty-four participants, representing governments from the region at the senior policy-making level, regional and <b>subregional</b> intergovernmental <b>organizations,</b> financial institutions, key United Nations regional entities and selected non-governmental organizations active in the region, attended the meeting. The meeting proved to be an excellent forum for exchange of experiences in the area of national strategies and regional/subregional cooperation in sustainable development. It proposed mechanisms for more effective inter-agency coordination, taking into consideration the complexities of economic globalization. This exchange of experiences has been instrumental in building momentum for the ten-year review of UNCED in 2002. It is the objective of the organizers of the Consultative Meeting as well as the participants, that the cooperative process and valuable exchange of experiences initiated in Santiago continue. Many of the useful and practical recommendations resulting from the meeting will also provide tangible guidelines for relevant regional and <b>subregional</b> <b>organizations</b> in their follow up to the meeting. In this way, we wish to encourage further regional cooperation to support sustainable development initiatives at the national level. We wish to express our appreciation to all who have contributed their time and effort to produce this publication. It {{would not have been possible}} without the collaboration between ECLAC and DESA, and even more so without the valuable written contributions of the participants...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how {{supranational}} collaboration in agricultural research in Sub-Saharan Africa {{has evolved over}} the past 10 years. It focuses primarily on the various institutional developments, but also presents some quantitative data on investments in the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa, the <b>subregional</b> <b>organizations,</b> and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. Institutional reforms introduced in recent years (such as a programmatic approach at the SRO level, multi-donor trust funds, competitive grant mechanisms, and centers of excellence) are reviewed and assessed, and suggestions are made for further improvements. The principal conclusion is that the overall institutional architecture for supranational collaboration in agricultural research is now in place, and that for the coming years the focus should be more on mastering and further fine tuning the various internal decisionmaking and implementation processes. Despite all efforts to increase African ownership of the supranational agricultural research agenda, high donor dependency remains a factor that limits such ownership. The only way to change this is by introducing an African funding base for supranational agricultural research. Unfortunately very little {{progress has been made}} on this front to date.

The team {{had access to the}} report of the Synthesis Group and the CBC/CDC retreat report. Their paper was transmitted by FARA Chair Joseph K. Mukiibi and distributed at CGIAR International Centers Week 2000 as background to the discussion of structure and governance [...] The paper suggests changes to make the CGIAR and its IARCs more responsive to the needs of African agricultural research, to improve collaborative research between IARCs and African NARS, and to align their priorities more effectively. It asks that the CGIAR simplify its relationships with African NARS, complement them, and be more selective. It suggests two integrated regional centers for Africa, dealing with export crops as well as crops to meet regional and national food needs. These should evolve into permanent not for profit centers to do research that cannot be done economically at the national level. Work with the private sector is important. The African NARS see a need for a limited continuing global centers operating on the principal of subsidiarity, and for a continuing CGIAR central structure, international in character.

5000|$|Considering {{the second}} point, the {{analysis}} of the panel identified [...] "a key institutional gap: there is no place in the United Nations system explicitly designed to avoid State collapse and the slide to war or to assist countries in their transition from war to peace" [...] (reference: report, paragraph 261). Since the United Nations should be able to act coherently and effectively from preventive action through post-conflict peace-building, the panel recommended to establish a Peacebuilding Commission as a subsidiary body of the Security Council itself. As it is stated in the report, [...] "the core functions of the Peacebuilding Commission should be to identify countries which are under stress and risk sliding towards State collapse; to organize, in partnership with the national Government, proactive assistance in preventing that process from developing further; to assist in the planning for transitions between conflict and post-conflict peacebuilding; and in particular to marshal and sustain the efforts of the international community in post-conflict peacebuilding over whatever period may be necessary".For what concern more practical and in-depth aspects of this new body, the panel just recommends that the Commission should be reasonably small, meet in different configurations in order to consider both general policy issues and country-by-country situations and strategies, involve the main relevant actors in different fields (UN organs such as ECOSOC and representative from UN agencies, International Financial and Economic Institutions, representatives of regional and <b>subregional</b> <b>organizations)</b> and it should be assisted by Peacebuilding Support Office established in the Secretariat.|$|R
40|$|The {{views and}} interpretations {{in this paper}} {{are those of the}} authors and not {{necessarily}} of the affiliated institutions. Mali possesses a significant comparative advantage in rice production and commercialization within its national territory as well as in Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Senegal. This comparative advantage is basically the result of government efforts during the last eight years (1990 - 1998) in the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and the creation of conditions that favor rice production in the Office du Niger river basin. Mali's surplus rice production, combined with devaluation of the CFA franc make Mali a potential rice exporter to West Africa. Despite Mali's comparative advantage, its rice exports have not done well because of the protectionist policies of neighboring countries with respect to rice, the stringent requirements of international markets, cumbersome banking and money transfer mechanisms, and the lack of viable market information systems for both internal and international markets. To secure a much larger share of the West African market, Mali needs to undertake several steps including the following: encourage <b>subregional</b> <b>organizations</b> to include rice on their list of primary agricultural products that are exempt from duties and taxes; specialize in the production and export of high-quality rice and import of low-quality rice; reduce entry duties and taxes levied on transport vehicles, spare parts, and fuel for rice production and consumption areas; promote subregional and international investments in the Office du Niger in order to increase exportable surplus; and encourage the collection and analysis of market information and the transfer of useful market information between national market information systems.

The documents consists of {{an excerpt from the}} report of the 2001 CGIAR Annual General Meeting, a transmittal letter from the TAC Chairman and CGIAR Director, TAC comments, IITA's response, and a transmittal letter from the panel chair. The panel supported the programmatic changes set down in IITA's draft strategic plan for 2001 - 2010, which entailed widened partnerships with national programs and <b>subregional</b> <b>organizations,</b> demand-driven identification of research needs, and an agro-ecological approach to agricultural development. Recommendations included the development of methods for agenda and priority setting, and relatedly, recruitment of a deputy director general for research to be accountable for the management and evaluation of IITA's research program. The Crop Improvement Division was urged to define its priorities and objectives explicitly in terms of target environments and users and prospective impacts, and to orient yam breeding towards reduced labor intensity. The Resource and Crop Management Division was encouraged to make greater use of geographic information systems and modeling applications. Appointment of an agricultural economist and senior economist were suggested as ways to strengthen and guide socioeconomic research. Closer collaboration with other Centers and advanced institutes was recommended to improve understanding of the factors constraining the adoption and performance of improved varieties in humid and subhumid Africa. The panel suggested that IITA's Board undertake a number of reforms to clarify its division of responsibilities with IITA management and to keep board members abreast of developments between board meetings.

40|$|Dolphinfish in the Caribbean {{are fast}} growing and short-lived, living for about 12 to 18 {{months in the}} {{southern}} Caribbean and a maximum of 2 - 3 years {{in the north of}} the region. They are believed to be highly migratory, are seasonally abundant, and likely to have a more complex stock structure than the larger oceanic epipelagic species. Most of the information on dolphinfish in the western central Atlantic comes from studies in the waters of the USA and the eastern Caribbean, and there is a general paucity of information particularly for stock-based management of this species. No Caribbean country undertakes regular assessment of dolphinfish, or has put in place any species-specific management program. Yield-per-recruit analyses for this species in the eastern Caribbean suggest that maximization of Y/R is likely to lead to very low levels of mature stock biomass. A stock recruitment analysis does not show any dependency of recruitment on stock size within the observed stock size range. This suggests that recruitment failure could be sudden at some threshold below the minimum observed stock size, probably at about one third of the average observed stock size. Given the trends observed in landings of dolphinfish, a precautionary approach to management is needed for this species in the western central Atlantic. Given the migratory, shared nature of the dolphinfish resource, a regional approach to assessment and management is required. However, the institutional basis for this approach does not currently exist within the region in a form that is functional. The membership of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) does not include any of the small island states where dolphinfish is of primary importance. ICCAT would need to establish a regional presence in order to serve the needs of Caribbean states. The FAO Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC) does not operate in a mode which would allow it to address this issue. The Association of Caribbean States is too new to address it within the near future. <b>Subregional</b> <b>organizations</b> with fisheries programs, such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), represent only a subset of states. However, given the ratification of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the recent International Agreement on Highly Migratory Stocks and Straddling Stocks, these organisations could take the initiative to establish a regional management programme for dolphinfish...|$|R
40|$|Wydział Nauk Politycznych i DziennikarstwaCross-border and {{regional}} {{cooperation in the}} Baltic Sea area in the years 1989 - 2007. Political changes, accomplished after the year 1989 in the Baltic Sea area, allowed to raise relationship between countries, regions and enabled easier contact between people living in that area. The collapse of artificial partitions existing after the Second World War in the Baltic Europe became the crucial factor {{in the development of}} multilateral connection between governments, organizations, regions and all types of local governments and no governments` organizations in the 1990 s. Nowadays the term of the hibernation of the region is a part of history and a warning in creating partnership between countries which now belong to the European Union and Russia. The subject is not the accidental one. The Baltic Sea area its potential on the field of cooperation and development in the extended European Union and relationships between European Union and Russia are the main author’s interests. The foundation of this is the analysis of the regional partnership on the field of social, economical and political cooperation. Looking back at the history of the region, understanding the international relationship and partnership and the cooperation between the European Union and Russia can allow us to find the way the Baltic Europe is getting at. You can also find here the analysis of the relationship, way of development and vision of the future connections between the European Union and Russia. The richness of different forms of cooperation between government and no government’s organizations in the Baltic Sea region, as nowhere else in Europe, should be consolidated by the considered schedule of social, economical and political development. The answer for this postulate, in my opinion, is the strategy of “Northern Dimension” Which creates a bridge for cooperation in the region between the countries which belong to the European Union and those which are not able to join it in the nearest future, for instance, Russia. The Baltic Europe has at its disposal a huge potential. Nowadays the Baltic Sea is the “internal sea” of the European Union. We can estimate that in the nearest decade this area will become one of the fastest developing regions all over the world. It is worth emphasizing this region has highly developing economy, stable and well-educated society and its countries have at their disposal rich natural resources, especially energetic ones. In this area there are magnificent conditions for investment and business development. Therefore, the Baltic Sea region consolidates all these elements in its possibility of cooperation. The Baltic partnership is a cooperation of countries, regions and international {{and regional}} organizations. Besides Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, which are the European Union members, there is Norway in the region as an economic partner of the European Union in the project of the European Economic Area. Iceland is another country being outside the Baltic Sea Region but it has its influence on international cooperation development in this area. The whole cooperation is complemented by Russia, which is an important partner for the countries of the region and the whole European Union. Organizations are also an important element of the Baltic cooperation. The leading role in the region is performed by Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) – the main forum of the Baltic countries` cooperation. Therefore, some other government organizations have their influence on the Baltic cooperation, for instance, Nordic Council of Minister (NCM), Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC), Arctic Council. In the region there are some <b>subregional</b> <b>organizations,</b> which act dynamically, for instance, Baltic Sea States` Sub-regional Cooperation (BSSSC), Union of the Baltic Cities (UBC) and Helsinki Commission (HELCOM). Euroregions like Pomerania, Baltic, Niemen, perform a very important role in Baltic cooperation building and also some other cross-border cooperation Baltic organizations. The Baltic Sea Region, despite its complicated past, is able to show its unity and identity. A lot of possibilities are also given by the rich net of decentralized organizations and institutions which complement and support official government structures and strong political involvement of the European Union noticeable in European Commission membership in Council of the Baltic Sea States. Russia – European Union partnership, which is connected with this region, should be seen as an opportunity to consolidate our multilateral relations...|$|R
