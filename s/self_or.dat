5|$|Ancient India, {{particularly}} the centuries {{in which the}} Mahavira and the Buddha lived, were one of intense intellectual debates, especially {{on the nature of}} reality and <b>self</b> <b>or</b> soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about jiva and ajiva (self, matter) utilizes anekantavada.|$|E
5|$|Methods on {{objects are}} {{functions}} {{attached to the}} object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, {{in contrast to the}} implicit <b>self</b> (<b>or</b> this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).|$|E
5|$|The Temple {{teaches that}} the true <b>self,</b> <b>or</b> essence, is immortal, and Xeper {{is the ability to}} align {{consciousness}} with this essence. Aquino taught that there is an afterlife for those who have reached the necessary level of individual development. This afterlife could occur in the individual's subjective universe. Those unable to reach this level dissolve into non-existence when the physical body dies. Self-initiation is knowledge understood as a conjunction of intellect and intuition. In keeping with its emphasis on the individual, the Temple encourages their members to celebrate their own birthday, and does not prescribe any other calendar of religious festivities.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to <b>self</b> <b>or</b> others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E
5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of <b>self</b> <b>or</b> environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E

50|$|Plants {{also have}} vestigial parts, {{including}} functionless stipules and carpels, leaf reduction of Equisetum, paraphyses of Fungi. Well known examples are the reductions in floral display, leading to smaller and/or paler flowers, in plants that reproduce without outcrossing, for example via <b>selfing</b> <b>or</b> obligate clonal reproduction.|$|R
25|$|Advaita Vedanta {{believes}} that the knowledge of one's true <b>self</b> <b>or</b> Atman is liberating. Along with self-knowledge, it teaches that moksha {{can be achieved by}} the correct understanding of one's true identity as Ātman, the dispassionate and unmoveable observer, and the identity of Ātman and Brahman.|$|E
25|$|Unlike saints who {{recognized}} and preached {{a diversity of}} doctrines for self / God realisation and offered multiple paths to attain them, Nigamananda suggested the realisation of the oneness of self and the supreme universal <b>self</b> (<b>or</b> Parabrahman-परंब्रह्म) as the true and the highest goal of human life.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people who}} {{experience}} the traumatic stress of abandonment {{go on to}} develop post traumatic symptoms. Post traumatic symptoms associated with abandonment include a sequela of heightened emotional reactions (ranging from mild to severe) and habituated defense mechanisms (many of which have become maladaptive) to perceived threats or disruptions to one’s sense of <b>self</b> <b>or</b> to one’s connections.|$|E

40|$|The Deng-Lynch {{method was}} {{developed}} to estimate the rate and effects of deleterious genomic mutations (DGM) in natural populations {{under the assumption that}} populations are either completely outcrossing <b>or</b> completely <b>selfing</b> and that populations are at mutation-selection (M-S) balance. However, in many plant and animal populations, <b>selfing</b> <b>or</b> outcrossing is often incomplete in that a proportion of populations undergo inbreeding while the rest are outcrossing. In addition, the degrees of deviation of populations from M-S balance are often not known. Through computer simulations, we investigated the robustness and the applicability of the Deng-Lynch method under different degrees of partial <b>selfing</b> <b>or</b> partial outcrossing and for nonequilibrium populations approaching M-S balance at different stages. The investigation was implemented under constant, variable, and epistatic mutation effects. We found that, generally, the estimation by the Deng-Lynch method is fairly robust if the selfing rate (S) is 0. 8 in selfing populations. The estimation may be unbiased under partial selfing with variable and epistatic mutation effects in predominantly outcrossing populations. The estimation is fairly robust in nonequilibrium populations at different stages approaching M-S balance. The dynamics of populations approaching M-S balance under various parameters are also studied. Under mutation and selection, populations approach balance at a rapid pace. Generally, it takes 400 - 2000 generations to reach M-S balance even when starting from homogeneous individuals free of DGM. Our investigation here provides a basis for characterizing DGM in partial <b>selfing</b> <b>or</b> outcrossing populations and for nonequilibrium populations...|$|R

25|$|Some pacifists follow {{principles}} of nonviolence, believing that nonviolent action is morally superior and/or most effective. Some however, support physical violence for emergency defence of <b>self</b> <b>or</b> others.

25|$|Command {{hallucinations}} are hallucinations in {{the form}} of commands; they can be auditory or inside of the person's mind and/or consciousness. The contents of the hallucinations can range from the innocuous to commands to cause harm to the <b>self</b> <b>or</b> others. Command hallucinations are often associated with schizophrenia. People experiencing command hallucinations may or may not comply with the hallucinated commands, depending on the circumstances. Compliance is more common for non-violent commands.|$|E
25|$|In a cell, protein {{molecules}} of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each MHC molecule {{on the cell}} surface displays a molecular fraction of a protein, called an epitope. The presented antigen can be either <b>self</b> <b>or</b> non-self, thus preventing an organism's immune system targeting its own cells. In its entirety, the MHC population is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell.|$|E

25|$|In the {{writings}} of Muslim scholars, the term Nafs (<b>self</b> <b>or</b> soul) was used to denote individual personality and the term fitrah for human nature. Nafs encompassed {{a broad range of}} faculties including the qalb (heart), the ruh (spirit), the aql (intellect) and irada (will). Muslim scholarship was strongly influenced by Greek and Indian philosophy {{as well as by the}} study of scripture, drawing particularly from Galen' understanding of the four humors of the body.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} state {{there are}} differences between the teachings in the Yoga Sutras and those in Buddhist texts. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras for example, states Michele Desmarias, accept the concept of a <b>Self</b> <b>or</b> soul behind the operational mind, while Buddhists do not accept such a Self exists. The role of Self is central to the idea of Saṃyoga, Citta, Self-awareness and other concepts in Chapters 2 through 4 of the Yoga sutras, according to Desmarias.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} and outcomes of psychological trauma {{can be assessed}} {{in a number of}} ways. Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk for imminent danger to the <b>self</b> <b>or</b> others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will not be necessary to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual's social support network are much more critical.|$|E

25|$|In pre-modern and {{traditional}} Hindu religions, Yoga and Dhyana are done to realize union of one's eternal <b>self</b> <b>or</b> soul, one's ātman. In some Hindu traditions, such as Advaita Vedanta this is equated with the omnipresent and non-dual Brahman. In others, {{such as the}} dualistic the Yoga school and Samkhya, the Self {{is referred to as}} Purusha, a pure consciousness which is separate from matter. Depending on the tradition, this liberative event is referred to as moksha, vimukti or kaivalya.|$|E
25|$|The Brahmajāla Sutta {{mentions}} many śramaṇas {{with whom}} Buddha disagreed. For example, {{in contrast to}} Sramanic Jains whose philosophical premise includes {{the existence of an}} Atman (self, soul) in every being, Buddhist philosophy denies that there is any <b>self</b> <b>or</b> soul. This concept called Anatta (or Anatman) is a part of Three Marks of existence in Buddhist philosophy, the other two being Dukkha (suffering) and Anicca (impermanence). According to Buddha, states Laumakis, everything lacks inherent existence. Buddhism is a non-theistic philosophy, which is especially concerned with pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination) and śūnyatā (emptiness or nothingness).|$|E
25|$|An open {{question}} is if other animals besides humans have a genetic endowment and social environment {{that allows them}} to acquire a theory of mind {{in the same way that}} human children do. This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from animal behavior the existence of thinking or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of <b>self</b> <b>or</b> self-awareness, consciousness and qualia. One difficulty with non-human studies of ToM is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.|$|E
