2500|$|The above {{assumption}} {{may seem}} non-intuitive at first: {{how can an}} ensemble which is time-invariant have a non-uniform temporal correlation function? Temporal correlations remain relevant to talk about in equilibrium systems because a time-invariant, macroscopic ensemble can still have non-trivial temporal dynamics microscopically. One example is in diffusion. A <b>single-phase</b> <b>system</b> at equilibrium has a homogeneous composition macroscopically. However, if one watches the microscopic movement of each atom, fluctuations in composition are constantly occurring due to the quasi-random walks taken by the individual atoms. Statistical mechanics allows one to make insightful statements about the temporal behavior of such fluctuations of equilibrium systems.

40|$|The {{stability}} {{issue of}} a single-phase two-stage grid-connected photovoltaic system is complicated due to the nonlinear v-i characteristic of the photovoltaic array {{as well as the}} interaction between power converters. Besides, even though linear system theory is widely used in stability analysis of balanced three-phase systems, the application of the same theory to <b>single-phase</b> <b>systems</b> meets serious challenges, since <b>single-phase</b> <b>systems</b> cannot be transformed into linear time-invariant systems simply using Park transformation as balanced three-phase systems. In this paper, (1) the integrated mathematical model of a single-phase two-stage grid-connected photovoltaic system is established, in which both DC-DC converter and DC-AC converter are included also the characteristic of the PV array is considered; (2) an observer-pattern modeling method is used to eliminate the time-varying variables; and (3) the stability of the system is studied using eigenvalue sensitivity and eigenvalue loci plots.

In this paper, the mechanism of the harmonic current injection from grid-connected <b>single-phase</b> inverter <b>systems</b> is thus explored, and the analysis is conducted on <b>single-phase</b> PV <b>systems.</b> In particular, the analysis is focused on the impacts of the power factor and the feed-in grid current level {{on the quality of the}} feed-in grid current from single-phase inverters. As a consequence, an internal model principle based high performance current control solution is tailor-made and developed for <b>single-phase</b> grid-connected <b>systems</b> to produce high quality currents in different operation conditions, where a design procedure is also provided.

40|$|Distributed {{renewable}} energy systems play an increasing role in today’s energy paradigm. Thus, intensive research activities have been centered on improving {{the performance of}} {{renewable energy}} systems, including photovoltaic (PV) systems, which should be of multiple-functionality. That is, the PV systems should be more intelligent in the consideration of grid stability, reliability, and fault protection. Therefore, in this paper, the performance of <b>single-phase</b> grid-connected PV <b>systems</b> under an extreme grid fault (i. e., when the grid voltage dips to zero) is explored. It has been revealed that combining a fast and accurate synchronization mechanism with appropriate control strategies for the zero-voltage ride-through (ZVRT) operation is mandatory. Accordingly, the representative synchronization techniques (i. e., the phase-locked loop (PLL) methods) in the ZVRT operation are compared in terms of detection precision and dynamic response. It shows that the second-order generalized integrator (SOGI-PLL) is a promising solution for <b>single-phase</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the case of}} fault ride-through. A control strategy by modifying the SOGI-PLL scheme is then introduced to <b>single-phase</b> grid-connected PV <b>systems</b> for ZVRT operation. Simulations are performed to verify the discussions.

Thus, the ratio of capacity to conductor material is doubled. The same ratio of capacity to conductor material can also be attained with a center-grounded <b>single-phase</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Three-phase {{system has}} {{numerous}} advantages over the <b>single-phase</b> <b>system</b> {{in terms of}} instantaneous power, stability, and cost. Three-phase systems are not available in every location particularly in remote rural areas, hill stations, low voltage distribution homes, and so forth. Having {{a system that is}} capable of converting directly the readily available <b>single-phase</b> <b>system</b> to three phases will have greater usability in various applications. The routine techniques adopted in the direct ac-ac single-phase-to-three-phase converters do not yield the best desired outputs because of their complexity in the segregation process and bidirectional nature of the input signal.

Further, none of these systems provide a convincing result in producing the standard three-phase output voltages that are 120 ° away from each other. This paper proposes an effective direct ac-ac single-phase-to-three-phase conversion technique based on space vector pulse width modulation based matrix converter system that produces a convincing three-phase output signals from a single-phase source with balanced modulation index characteristics.
