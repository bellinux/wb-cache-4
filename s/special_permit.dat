This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E

5|$|While {{owned by}} Weston, the brig Smyrna, {{launched}} in 1825, {{was the first}} United States vessel to enter the Black Sea under a <b>special</b> <b>permit</b> from the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The ship Lagoda, launched in 1826 and sold by Weston to a whaling merchant, {{became one of the}} most successful in the New Bedford, Massachusetts whaling fleet. A half-scale model of the Lagoda is today featured in the New Bedford Whaling Museum. The brig Messenger, launched in 1834, was also sold to a whaling merchant and, in 1862, became part of the infamous Stone Fleet sunk in Charleston Harbor by the United States Navy in hopes of obstructing the Confederate port during the Civil War. The ship Oneco, Weston's second largest vessel launched in 1839 became the only Weston ship to circumnavigate the globe from 1850–1852. The ship Hope, launched in 1841, was at the time the largest merchant vessel built in New England and on her maiden voyage shipped a record-breaking cargo of cotton from New Orleans to Liverpool, England.|$|E

5|$|On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest {{issued an}} order closing the {{majority}} of the burn area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, and uneven ground. The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom. The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up the burn areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month. Some mushroom hunters stated that {{they would be willing to}} sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area. Extensive harvesting of morels in the Rim Fire area nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by <b>special</b> <b>permit,</b> but in most cases through illegal harvesting. The closure of the burn area was also criticized by the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.|$|E
