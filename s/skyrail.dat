25|$|The Ngong Ping 360 is a gondola lift on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. Intended {{to improve}} tourism to the area, the aerial lift was {{previously}} known as Tung Chung Cable Car Project before acquiring the Ngong Ping 360 brand in April 2005. It {{consists of the}} Ngong Ping Cable Car, {{formerly known as the}} Ngong Ping 360 <b>Skyrail,</b> and the Ngong Ping Village, a retail and entertainment centre adjacent to the cable car's upper station. Ngong Ping 360 connects Tung Chung, on the north coast of Lantau and itself linked to central Hong Kong by the Tung Chung Line, with the Ngong Ping area in the hills above. This is home to the Po Lin Monastery and the Tian Tan Buddha, both already significant tourist attractions in their own right. Before Ngong Ping 360's opening, the only access was via a mountain road and bus service.|$|E
2500|$|After {{two months}} of {{improvement}} works and repair for the damages made by Typhoon Prapiroon in August 2006, Ngong Ping 360 resumed a trial-run of 7 days from 30 August 2006. [...] The project director at MTR Corp and senior executives of <b>Skyrail</b> were at the soft opening of the facility on 18 September. In keeping with feng shui traditions, Skyrail-ITM sold just 1,688 tickets for the maiden day's run on 18 September at HK$88 each, the numbers being considered lucky. Henry Tang officiated at the grand opening of the attraction on 9 November 2006.|$|E

50|$|The {{integration}} of biological data, including protein structures, interactions etc. {{can be generated}} through automated technology. The importance of such data can often be lost without proper visualisation of the data. The Systems Biology Initiative {{is currently working on}} an adaptation of the <b>Skyrails</b> Visualisation System. This system, called the interactonium uses a virtual cell for the visualisation of the interaction network, protein complexes and protein 3-D structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The tool can display complex networks of up to 40 000 proteins or 6000 multiprotein complexes. The Interactorium permits multi-level viewing of the molecular biology of the cell. The Interactorium is available for download.|$|R

5000|$|The forests, {{together}} with the Great Barrier Reef, have been identified and promoted as a major tourist attraction of Tropical North Queensland, one of five within the state. [...] One {{of the most significant}} tourist attractions in the rain forests is the <b>Skyrail</b> Rainforest Cableway.|$|E
50|$|The cableway, which travels {{over the}} McAlister Range between Smithfield and Kuranda, {{includes}} six-person gondola cabins that travel metres above the treetops. A one-way trip takes about 1.5 hours {{and a return}} trip is about 2.5 hours. Two rainforest stations, Red Peak Station and Barron Falls Station, allow exploration of the forest floor on boardwalks, interaction with the environment and education of the World Heritage area. A Rainforest Interpretation Centre, developed {{in conjunction with the}} Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), is located at the Barron Falls Station. In 2012, <b>Skyrail,</b> in conjunction with Djabugay Native Title Aboriginal Corporation (DNTAC) developed walking tours with aboriginal guides on a rainforest trail on traditional Djabugay lands, departing from the <b>Skyrail</b> Rainforest Cableway Barron Falls Station.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Skyrail</b> {{concept was}} put forward in 1987, with {{construction}} beginning in June 1994. Pre-construction included consultation with and approval from 23 local, {{state and federal}} government agencies and local communities along with numerous assessments including an Environmental Impact Study. It also established {{an agreement with the}} Djabugay Tribal Aboriginal Corporation for the protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage. <b>Skyrail</b> is owned and operated by the Chapman Group, led by George Chapman, AO, who was named one of Queensland Government’s 2011 Queensland Greats. His son, Dr Ken Chapman, is Skyrail’s managing director and daughter, Karen Hawkins, is a director. The $35 (AUD) million cableway opened to the public on August 31, 1995 with 47 gondolas. A $2.5 (AUD) million upgrade in May 1997 increased the number of gondolas to 114, enabling it to carry over 600 passengers an hour in each direction. In 2006, it underwent a $2.5 (AUD) million upgrade which included a replacement café, expanded ticketing services and larger retail store. In November 2013, it introduced 11 Diamond View glass floor gondolas, and in April 2014, the Canopy Glider, a ranger-escorted, open-air gondola, was added. Special guests at <b>Skyrail</b> include Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip on March, 2002, former Australian politician Julia Gillard in 2004, and Australian tennis player Pat Rafter in 2013.|$|E
