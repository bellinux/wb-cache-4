5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 Dred Scott decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), Precious finally {{learns to}} read and write. She meets {{sporadically}} with social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about incest in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. Upon returning home, her mother carelessly drops 3-day-old Abdul and hits her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the incest has resulted in their being cut off from welfare. Precious fights back and runs away from her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, imagining {{that she and her}} fantasy boyfriend are together and singing the song. Precious breaks into her school classroom seeking shelter. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> Precious to stay. Later that night, Precious stays with Blu and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Blu takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them. She tells Precious that she will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a halfway house.|$|E
25|$|One study, of first-year {{students}} {{in medical school}} writing in dialogue journals with their professors, found that the interactive journal writing “provided a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> students to describe their experiences and relationships and to question their own values and beliefs.” The process of writing in this way with their teachers broke down barriers between them, through a mutual sharing of thoughts and feelings, which led to enhanced rapport and communication, and thus facilitated students’ personal and reflective perspectives and initiated and encouraged self-awareness.|$|E

25|$|Moving from a tourist-based queer {{culture to}} more of a bar-based community, The Black Cat bar {{specifically}} received much recognition for its creation of a protected, <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> gay patrons. Jose Sarria, a drag entertainer at The Black Cat, staged satirical operas that would collect a crowd of more than three-hundred people. Audiences enjoyed watching him because his performances were spontaneous. They included outrageous female attire, political commentary, and gay humor, which inherently created a cultural pride between the bar-based gay and transgender community.|$|E
25|$|Newman {{believed}} {{in a middle}} way between free thinking and moral authority – one that would respect the rights of knowledge {{as well as the}} rights of revelation. His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in a world where the major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English-speaking world were Protestant. For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would have to support research and publication free from church censorship; however, for a university to be a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the education of Catholic youth, {{it would have to be}} a place in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted.|$|E
25|$|The Women’s House in Robe St is an {{open access}} centre {{offering}} a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> women in need. Staff offer general case management, of usually 13 weeks, and intensive case management with the Women’s Housing Complex Needs Program (WHCN), which is usually between six and 12 months. Staff members provide support and referrals for issues such as counselling, housing, drug and alcohol support and parenting. Women who use these programs often need support having experienced family violence. The Women’s House open access operates from Monday to Friday, 11:30am – 3.00pm, providing women with a lunch, shower and laundry facilities. There is a sleeping room available for women to take a rest during opening hours. Health and wellbeing activities are also organised, such as ceramics and yoga classes, provided by volunteers.|$|E

25|$|More and more, architects are {{investigating}} ways that courtyards {{can play a}} role in the development of today's homes and cities. In densely populated areas, a courtyard in a home can provide privacy for a family, a break from the frantic pace of everyday life, and a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> children to play. With space at a premium, architects are experimenting with courtyards as a way to provide outdoor space for small communities of people at a time. A courtyard surrounded by 12 houses, for example, would provide a shared park-like space for those families, who could take pride in ownership of the space. Though this might sound like a modern-day solution to an inner city problem, the grouping of houses around a shared courtyard was common practice among the Incas as far back as the 13th century.|$|E

Besides the opposition, Kuwait is a small country, {{and it would be}} difficult to find a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the nuclear waste the reactors would produce.

2500|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, YMCAs in the United States were built with hotel-like rooms called residences or dormitories.

Crowley examined the reports of visitors in the early 20th century, noting that [...] "many visitors to Adelaide admired the foresighted planning of its founders", as well as pondering on the riches of the young city. Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom, entering a time of relative prosperity. Its population grew, and it became the 3rd most populous metropolitan area in the country—after Sydney and Melbourne. Its prosperity was short lived, {{with the return of}} droughts, having endured the Great Depression of the 1930s, and later returning to fortune under strong government leadership. Secondary industries helped reduce the state's dependence on primary industries. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the Playford Government, which advocated Adelaide as a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location. Shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of Whyalla.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the victory}} at Edington and {{resultant}} peace treaty, Alfred set about transforming his Kingdom of Wessex into a society on a full-time war footing. He built a navy, reorganised the army, {{and set up}} a system of fortified towns known as burhs. He mainly used old Roman cities for his burhs, as he was able to rebuild and reinforce their existing fortifications. To maintain the burhs, and the standing army, he set up a taxation system known as the Burghal Hidage. These burhs (or burghs) operated as defensive structures. The Vikings were thereafter unable to cross large sections of Wessex: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that a Danish raiding party was defeated when it tried to attack the burh of Chichester. The burhs, although primarily designed as defensive structures, were also commercial centres, attracting traders and markets to a safe haven, and they provided a <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the king's moneyers and mints. [...] A new wave of Danish invasions commenced in the year 891, beginning a war that lasted over three years. Alfred's new system of defence worked, however, and ultimately it wore the Danes down: they gave up and dispersed in the summer of 896.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, with Bianca's rape {{having left}} her {{subsequently}} pregnant with Michael's child, {{and the baby}} switch storyline having robbed her of her daughter, viewers were infuriated by what they felt was the pain the character had endured within the year. They additionally found the Bianca and Babe friendship unappealing, specifically due to Babe knowingly keeping Bianca from her own child. Within the story, Babe is initially unaware that her child has been switched with Bianca's and that Bianca's child, the one she is caring for, is still alive and not dead {{as she had been}} led to believe. However, once convinced by Krystal to keep Bianca's child as her own in order to save JR from heartbreak, she does as advised. Due to her guilt, she goes as far as to name Bianca godmother of the child. Angered by these events, viewers campaigned for Bianca to discover the truth. The amount of mail sent to the ABC studios requesting and demanding that Bianca's baby be returned to her was cited as astounding for a fictional character, especially one of daytime [...] and who is also gay: [...] "Bianca's sexuality did not seem to matter to the thousands of fans who wrote letters, e-mail messages, and blog entries insisting that the only <b>safe</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> the baby was back in the arms of Pine Valley's one known lesbian." ...|$|E
