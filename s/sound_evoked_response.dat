40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that sodium {{salicylate}} (SS) activates not only central auditory structures, but also nonauditory regions associated with emotion and memory. To identify electrophysiological changes in the nonauditory regions, we recorded sound-evoked local field potentials and multiunit discharges from the striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex after SS-treatment. The SS-treatment produced behavioral evidence of tinnitus and hyperacusis. Physiologically, the treatment significantly enhanced sound-evoked neural activity in the striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus, but not in the cingulate. The enhanced <b>sound</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> could be linked to the hyperacusis-like behavior. Further analysis showed that the enhancement of sound-evoked activity occurred predominantly at the midfrequencies, likely reflecting shifts of neurons towards the midfrequency range after SS-treatment as observed in our previous studies in the auditory cortex and amygdala. The increased number of midfrequency neurons would lead to a relative higher number of total spontaneous discharges in the midfrequency region, even though the mean discharge rate of each neuron may not increase. The tonotopical overactivity in the midfrequency region in quiet may potentially lead to tonal sensation of midfrequency (the tinnitus). The neural changes in the amygdala and hippocampus may also contribute to the negative effect that patients associate with their tinnitus...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) can rebuild the tonotopic representation in the primary auditory cortex (A 1), but the cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the firing patterns and membrane potential dynamics of neurons in A 1 {{under the influence of}} VTA activation using in-vivo intracellular recording. We found that VTA activation can significantly reduce the variability of <b>sound</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> and promote the firing precision and strength of A 1 neurons. Furthermore, the compressed response window was caused by an early hyperpolarization as a result of enhanced circuit inhibition. Our study suggested a possible mechanism of how the reward system affects information processing in sensory cortex: VTA activation strengthens cortical inhibition, which shortens the response window of post-synaptic cortical neurons and further promotes the precision and strength of neuronal activity...|$|R
40|$|Drumming is an {{activity}} practiced across all human cultures. Its origin, however, remains unknown. Drumming behavior is also displayed by non-human primates, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, {{suggesting that the}} underlying neural substrate has propagated through primate evolution. Here we describe a similar behavior in captive macaque monkeys: these animals use artificial objects in their environment to produce loud and repetitive sounds. Although these drumming sounds deviate in their acoustic properties much from typical vocal sounds, behavioral tests demonstrate that they serve as acoustic communication signals. First, in a preferential orienting task, naive subjects orient towards drumming sounds as frequently as to conspecific vocalizations but more than to other environmental sounds. Second, when drumming sounds are accompanied by a video of a conspecific animal, subjects clearly attempt to communicate with this individual, and when passively listening to such sounds individuals often show increased hea rt rate, suggesting that these <b>sounds</b> <b>evoke</b> emotional <b>responses.</b> Third, on investigating the neural networks underlying the perception of these drumming sounds using fMRI, we find that drumming sounds activate the same networks that are otherwise specialized for processing vocal communication sounds. Together, our results suggest that drumming originated in non-human primates {{as a form of}} non-vocal acoustic communication...|$|R
40|$|Repetitious {{patterns}} {{enable the}} auditory system to form prediction models specifying {{the most likely}} characteristics of subsequent sounds. Pattern deviations elicit mismatch negativity (MMN), the amplitude of which is modulated {{by the size of}} the deviation and confidence in the model. Todd et al. (2001; 2013) demonstrated that a multi-timescale sequence reveals a bias that profoundly distorts the impact of local sound statistics on the MMN amplitude. Two sounds alternate roles as repetitious “standard” and rare “deviant” rapidly (every 0. 8 minutes) or slowly (every 2. 4 minutes). The bias manifests as larger MMN to the sound first encountered as deviant in slow compared to fast changing sequences, but no difference for the sound first encountered as a standard. We propose that the bias is due to how Bayesian priors shape filters of sound relevance. By examining the time-course of change in MMN amplitude we show that the bias manifests immediately after roles change but rapidly disappears thereafter. The bias was reflected in the response to deviant sounds only (not in response to standards), consistent with precision estimates extracted from second order patterns modulating gain differentially for the two <b>sounds</b> [...] <b>Evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to deviants suggest that pattern extraction and reactivation of priors can operate over tens of minutes or longer. Both MMN and deviant responses establish that: (1) priors are defined by the most proximally encountered probability distribution when one exists but; (2) when no prior exists, one is instantiated by sequence onset characteristics; and (3) priors require context interruption to be updated...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of auditory brainstem <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> and middle latency <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> may improve {{the evaluation of}} diabetic neuropathy. Twenty diabetic patients were studied (12 males, 8 females), aged 21 to 63 years with normal hearing, together with 20 age- and sex-matched normal subjects (10 males, 10 females). Auditory brainstem <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were induced by rarefaction clicks of 0. 1 ms at a repetition rate of 21. 1 CPS and an intensity of 75 dB hearing level. Middle latency <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were induced with clicks of 0. 1 ms, a repetition rate of 7. 7 CPS and an intensity of 75 dB hearing level. Diagnostic criteria were: a I-V interval latency shift greater than 2 SD of the control group for the auditory brainstem <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> test or the interval difference of wave V greater than 0. 2 ms. Middle latency <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> was diagnostic if the latency of the Pa component was greater than 2 SD of normals. Twenty-five per cent of subjects had retrocochlear impairment (absence of I wave) {{even in the absence}} of symptoms. The combined technique of auditory brainstem <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> and middle latency <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> improved the detection rate of central nervous system dysfunction. Auditory brainstem response is important for detecting desynchronization of the auditory response, whereas middle latency <b>evoked</b> <b>response</b> detects abnormalities in the more rostral regions of the central nervous system.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA receptors to auditory {{responses in the}} rat 2 ̆ 7 s inferior colliculus was examined by recording single-unit activity before, during, and after local iontophoretic application of receptor-specific antagonists. Tone bursts and sinusoidal amplitude modulated sounds were presented to one ear, and recordings were made from the contralateral central nucleus of inferior colliculus (ICC). The receptor specific antagonists, (±) - 3 -(2 -carboxypiperazin- 4 -yl) -propyl- 1 -phosphonic acid (CPP) for NMDA receptors and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 6 -nitro- 2, 3 -dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline- 7 -sulfonamide (NBQX) for AMPA receptors, were released at the recording site through a multi-barreled pipette. For most neurons, either CPP or NBQX alone resulted in a reversible {{reduction in the number}} of action potentials evoked by tonal stimulation. For neurons with an onset response pattern, NBQX either completely eliminated or greatly reduced the number of action potentials. CPP also reduced the number of action potentials but had a less pronounced effect than NBQX. For neurons with a sustained firing pattern, NBQX reduced the total number of action potentials, but had a preferential effect on the early part (first 10 - 20 ms) of the response. CPP also resulted in a reduction in the total number of action potentials, but had a more pronounced effect on the later part (3 ̆e 20 ms) of the response. These results indicate that both AMPA and NMDA receptors contribute to <b>sound</b> <b>evoked</b> excitatory <b>responses</b> in the ICC. They have a selective influence on early and late components of tone-evoked responses. Both receptor types are involved in generating excitatory responses across a wide range of sound pressure levels as indicated by rate level functions obtained before and during drug application. In addition, both CPP and NBQX reduced responses to sinusoidal amplitude modulated sounds. The synchrony of firing to the modulation envelope as measured by vector strength at different rates of modulation was not greatly affected by either CPP or NBQX in spite of the decrease in firing rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} assumption {{in human}} cognitive electrophysiology using EEG and MEG {{is that the}} presentation of a particular event such as visual or auditory stimuli evokes a "turning on" of additional brain activity that adds to the ongoing background activity.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} work {{was to investigate the}} development of the S-cone colour-opponent pathway in human infants aged 4 weeks to 6 months. This was achieved by recording transient visual <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to pattern-onset stimuli along a tritanopic confusion axis (tritan stimuli) at and around the adult isoluminant match. For comparison, visual <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to red-green and luminance-modulated stimuli were recorded from the same infants at the same ages. <b>Evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were also recorded from colour-normal adults for comparison with those of the infants. The transient VEP allowed observation of response morphology as luminance differences were introduced to the chromatic stimuli. In this way, an estimate of isoluminance was possible in infants. Estimated isoluminant points for a group of six infants aged 6 to 10 weeks closely approximated the adult isoluminant match. This finding has implications for the use of photometric isoluminance in infant work, and suggests that photopic spectral sensitivity is similar in infants and adults. Abnormalities of the visual <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to tritan, red-green and luminance-modulated stimuli in an infant with cystic fibrosis are reported. The results suggest abnormal function of the retino-striate visual pathway in this infant, and it is argued that these may be secondary to his illness, although data from more infants with cystic fibrosis are needed to clarify this further. A group of nine healthy infants demonstrated <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to tritan stimuli by 4 to 10 weeks and to red-green stimuli by 6 to 11 weeks post-term age. Responses to luminance-modulated stimuli were present in all nine infants at the earliest age tested, namely 4 weeks post-term. The slightly earlier age of onset of <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> to tritan stimuli than for red-green may be explained by the relatively lower cone contrast afforded by red-green stimuli.

Sheets of fetal retina with RPE were transplanted into the subretinal space of Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats at 37 to 69 days of age. Sixty-three days to 10 months after transplantation, multiunit visual responses were recorded in the superior colliculus (SC) of transplanted rats, age-matched untransplanted rats, and rats with sham surgery. RESULTS. In 19 of 29 RCS rats with transplants, visually <b>evoked</b> <b>responses</b> were recorded from and restricted to a small area of the SC that corresponds topographically to {{the portion of the}} retina in which the transplant was placed.
