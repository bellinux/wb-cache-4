40|$|Male coleoid {{cephalopods}} produce spermatophores {{that can}} attach autonomously on the female's body during {{a complex process}} of evagination called the spermatophoric reaction, during which the ejaculatory apparatus and <b>spiral</b> <b>filament</b> of the spermatophore are everted and exposed to the external milieu. In some deepwater cephalopods, the reaction leads to the intradermal implantation of the spermatophore, a hitherto enigmatic phenomenon. The present study builds upon several lines of evidence to propose that spermatophore implantation is probably achieved through the combination of (1) an evaginating-tube mechanism performed by the everting ejaculatory apparatus and (2) the anchorage provided by the spiral filament's stellate particles. The proposed theoretical model assumes that, as it is exposed to the external milieu, each whorl of the <b>spiral</b> <b>filament</b> anchors to the surrounding tissue by means of its sharp stellate particles. As the ejaculatory apparatus tip continues evaginating, it grows in diameter and stretches lengthwise, enlarging {{the diameter of the}} whorl and propelling it, consequently tearing and pushing the anchored tissue outward and backward, and opening space for the next whorl to attach. After the ejaculatory apparatus has been everted and has perforated tissue, the cement body is extruded, possibly aiding in final attachment, and the sperm mass comes to lie inside the female tissue, encompassed by the everted ejaculatory apparatus tube. It is proposed that this unique, efficient spermatophore attachment mechanism possibly evolved in intimate relationship with the adoption of an active mode of life by coleoids. The possible roles of predation pressure and sperm competition in the evolution of this mechanism are also discussed.

In {{use of a}} newly developed, purely Lagrangian, vortex method, the evolution {{of each of the}} two vortices becomes obtainable. Remarkable similarities between the asymmetric and symmetric mergers are found. In either case, the merger arises from the defeat of the self-rotation of one vortex by the background straining.

This species is characterized by having an overlapping dorsal bar and short copulatory organ. The life cycle of the gill monogenean is also described. One mature parasite lays at least 10 - 22 eggs/day. Eggs are oval (0. 021 - 0. 120 mm) with a <b>spiral</b> <b>filament</b> attached to one end. Eggs hatch into free-swimming larvae (oncomiracidia) within 2 - 6 d at 30 Â°C and 30 ppt.

40|$|During copulation, spermatophores {{produced}} by male coleoid cephalopods undergo the spermatophoric reaction, {{a complex process}} of evagination that culminates in the attachment of the spermatangium (everted spermatophore containing the sperm mass) on the female's body. To better understand this complicated phenomenon, {{the present study investigated}} the functional morphology of the spermatophore of the squid Doryteuthis plei applying in vitro analysis of the reaction, as well as light and electron microscopy investigation of spermatangia obtained either in vitro, or naturally attached on females. Hitherto unnoticed functional features of the loliginid spermatophore require a reappraisal of some important processes involved in the spermatophoric reaction. The most striking findings concern the attachment mechanism, which is not carried out solely by cement adhesive material, as previously believed, but rather by an autonomous, complex process performed by multiple structures during the spermatophoric reaction. During evagination, the ejaculatory apparatus provides anchorage on the targeted tissue, presumably due to the minute stellate particles present in the exposed <b>spiral</b> <b>filament.</b> Consequently, the ejaculatory apparatus maintains the attachment of the tip of the evaginating spermatophore until the cement body is extruded. Subsequently, the cement body passes through a complex structural rearrangement, which leads to the injection of both its viscid contents and pointed oral region onto the targeted tissue. The inner membrane at the oral region of the cement body contains numerous stellate particles attached at its inner side; eversion of this membrane exposes these sharp structures, which presumably adhere to the tissue and augment attachment. Several naturally attached spermatangia were found with their bases implanted at the deposition sites, and the possible mechanisms of perforation are discussed based on present evidence. The function of the complex squid spermatophore and its spermatophoric reaction is revisited in light of these findings. J. Morphol. 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In M 33 the polarized intensity is highest between the spiral arms, similar to most spiral galaxies, while in M 31 total and polarized emission both emerge from the ring. Star formation in M 31 is probably too weak to tangle the regular field. The high regularity of {{the field in the}} M 31 ring allows fast cosmic-ray propagation.

Faraday rotation of polarized background sources shows that the regular field and thermal gas in M 31 extend to at least 25 kpc radius. The regular field in M 33 forms an open spiral, a mixture of axisymmetric and higher modes, with the largest pitch angle (≃ 60 degr) observed in any spiral galaxy so far.

Solar UVR broke the <b>spiral</b> <b>filaments</b> of A. platensis exposed to full solar radiation in short-term low-cell-density cultures. This breakage was observed after 2 h for the indoor strain but after 4 to 6 h for the outdoor strain. Filament breakage also occurred in the cultures exposed to PAR alone; however, the extent of breakage was less than that observed for filaments exposed to full solar radiation. The <b>spiral</b> <b>filaments</b> broke and compressed when high-cell-density cultures were exposed to full solar radiation during long-term experiments. When UV-B was screened off, the filaments initially broke, but they elongated and became loosely arranged later (i. e., there were fewer spirals per unit of filament length). When UVR was filtered out, the spiral structure hardly broke or became looser. Photosynthetic 0, evolution {{in the presence of}} UVR was significantly suppressed in the indoor strain compared to the outdoor strain. UVR-induced inhibition increased with exposure time, and it was significantly lower in the outdoor strain. The concentration of UV-absorbing compounds was low in both strains, and there was no significant change in the amount regardless of the radiation treatment, suggesting that these compounds were not effectively used as protection against solar UVR. Self-shading, on the other hand, produced by compression of the spirals over adaptive time scales, seems {{to play an important role}} in protecting this species against deleterious UVR.

When the flow is varying rapidly, high accuracy requires a high density of interpolation points while smooth regions require a lower density of points. A method that can adaptively allocate more grid points to where the fronts develop and fewer grid points to where the flow is smooth is of great value in fluid simulation on the surface of a sphere. In this thesis, a method that combines the meshfree nature of RBF interpolation and the Lagrangian particle method is developed. On the one hand, the particles serving as fluid elements are advected by the velocity field such that rapidly varying regions are densely populated; on the other hand, the particles serving as RBF centers provide higher density of interpolation points and therefore give a better resolution of the regions...|$|R
40|$|A miniature, {{low-power}} broadband {{light source}} {{has been developed}} for aerospace applications, including calibrating spectrometers and powering miniature optical sensors. The initial motivation for this research was based on flight tests of a Fabry-Perot fiberoptic temperature sensor system used to detect aircraft engine exhaust gas temperature. Although the feasibility of the sensor system was proven, the commercial light source optically powering the device {{was identified as a}} critical component requiring improvement. Problems with the light source included a long stabilization time (approximately 1 hr), a large amount of heat generation, and a large input electrical power (6. 5 W). Thus, we developed a new light source to enable the use of broadband optical sensors in aerospace applications. Semiconductor chip-based light sources, such as lasers and light-emitting diodes, have a relatively narrow range of emission wavelengths in comparison to incandescent sources. Incandescent light sources emit broadband radiation from visible to infrared wavelengths; the intensity at each wavelength is determined by the filament temperature and the materials chosen for the filament and the lamp window. However, present commercial incandescent light sources are large in size and inefficient, requiring several watts of electrical power to obtain the desired optical power, and they emit {{a large percentage of the}} input power as heat that must be dissipated. The miniature light source, developed jointly by the NASA Glenn Research Center, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Lighting Innovations Institute, requires one-fifth the electrical input power of some commercial light sources, while providing similar output light power that is easily coupled to an optical fiber. Furthermore, it is small, rugged, and lightweight. Microfabrication technology was used to reduce the size, weight, power consumption, and potential cost-parameters critical to future aerospace applications. This chip-based light source has the potential for monolithic fabrication with on-chip drive electronics. Other uses for these light sources are in systems for vehicle navigation, remote sensing applications such as monitoring bridges for stress, calibration sources for spectrometers, light sources for space sensors, display lighting, addressable arrays, and industrial plant monitoring. Two methods for filament fabrication are being developed: wet-chemical etching and laser ablation. Both yield a 25 -mm-thick tungsten <b>spiral</b> <b>filament.</b> The proof-of-concept filament shown was fabricated with the wet etch method. Then it was tested by heating it in a vacuum chamber using about 1. 25 W of electrical power; it generated bright, blackbody radiation at approximately 2650 K. The filament was packaged in Glenn's clean-room facilities. This design uses three chips vacuum-sealed with glass tape. The bottom chip consists of a reflective film deposited on silicon, the middle chip contains a tungsten filament bonded to silicon, and the top layer is a transparent window. Lifetime testing on the package will begin shortly. The emitted optical power is expected to be approximately 1. 0 W with the spectral peak at 1. 1 mm...|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} economical {{method of}} {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) has been developed for synthesizing diamond crystals and films. Unlike prior CVD methods for synthesizing diamond, this method does not require precisely proportioned flows of compressed gas feedstocks {{or the use of}} electrical discharges to decompose the feedstocks to obtain free radicals needed for deposition chemical reactions. Instead, the feedstocks used in this method are mixtures of common organic liquids that can be prepared in advance, and decomposition of feedstock vapors is effected simply by heating. The feedstock used in this method is a solution comprising between 90 and 99 weight percent of methanol and the balance of one or more other oxyhydrocarbons that could include ethanol, isopropanol, and/or acetone. This mixture of compounds is chosen so that dissociation of molecules results in the desired proportions of carbon-containing radicals (principally, CH 3) and of OH, H, and O radicals. Undesirably, the CVD temperature and pressure conditions thermodynamically favor the growth of graphite over the growth of diamond. The H radicals are desirable because they help to stabilize the growing surface of diamond by shifting the thermodynamic balance toward favoring the growth of diamond. The OH and O radicals are desirable because they preferentially etch graphite and other non-diamond carbon, thereby helping to ensure the net deposition of pure diamond. The non-methanol compounds are included in the solution because (1) methanol contains equal numbers of C and O atoms; (2) an excess of C over O is needed to obtain net deposition of diamond; and (3) the non-methanol molecules contain multiple carbon atoms for each oxygen atom and thus supply the needed excess carbon A typical apparatus used in this method includes a reservoir containing the feedstock liquid and a partially evacuated stainless-steel reaction chamber. The reservoir is connected to the chamber via tubing and a needle valve or other suitable flow controller. When the liquid enters the low-pressure environment inside the chamber, it evaporates to form a vapor mixture of the same chemical composition. In addition to the inlet for the feedstock liquid, the chamber is fitted with an outlet connected to a vacuum pump (not shown) through a throttle valve (also not shown) that is automatically controlled to keep the pressure at or near the required value throughout the deposition process. Inside the chamber, a <b>spiral</b> <b>filament</b> made of tungsten, tantalum, graphite, or other high-melting-temperature material is electrically heated to a temperature > 2, 000 C high enough to cause dissociation of vapor molecules into the aforementioned radicals. A deposition substrate typically, a diamond-polished silicon wafer about 2. 5 cm square is positioned about 2 cm away from the filament. The exact location of the substrate is chosen so that the substrate becomes heated by the filament to a deposition temperature in the approximate range of 800 to 1, 000 C...|$|E
40|$|Octopus, are {{marine organisms}} {{belonging}} to the Filo Mollusca and are distributed {{around the world and}} are important to the marine ecosystem acting as opportunists and predators of great economic importance because it is part of several fishing. Although not yet know {{the extent to which these}} animals are able to withstand fishing pressure. In regard reproduction these organisms are dioecious with only playback (semelpareous), with high fertility with copulations. The paralavaes of O. insularis are planktonic, giving the species a high dispersal capacity. However, reproductive biology studies of O. insularis are still scarce, being restricted primarily to females and reproductive tract structures and size that these animals reach maturity. There is an absence of any information about the complex structure responsible for the fertilization of the oocytes in the case, the spermatophores. This work aims to analyze the influence of environmental variables in the population structure and reproductive biology focused on the spermatophores octopus, Octopus insularis. For this, we need to analyze the parameters of population biology, describe the spermatophore and describe the spermatophoric reaction. This thesis is divided in three chapters that discuss: 1) Population structure of Octopus insularis caught using longline pots related with environmental variables that had a significant body size variations in the rainy season, possibly related to the breeding period and was observed synchronism between the environmental variables and the life cycle of these animals. 2) Morphological description and functional anatomy from spermatophore of the Octopus insularis, which is divided into two structures sperm mass on aboral region being covered by the outer and middle layer and the ejaculatory apparatus that is separated by the granular liquid and the apparatus is covered by domestic and inner membrane coat, protecting the <b>spiral</b> <b>filament.</b> 3) Spermatophoric reaction in vitro octopus, Octopus insularis which lasts about 15 minutes starts with the outgrowth of ejaculatory apparatus and consequent release of sperm mass in the middle.

40|$|Star-forming {{regions that}} are visible at 3. 6 microns and Halpha {{but not in}} the u,g,r,i,z bands of the Sloan Digital Sky survey (SDSS), are {{measured}} in five nearby spiral galaxies to find extinctions averaging ~ 3. 8 mag and stellar masses averaging ~ 5 x 10 ^ 4 Msun. These regions are apparently young star complexes embedded in dark filamentary shock fronts connected with spiral arms. The associated cloud masses are ~ 10 ^ 7 Msun. The conditions required to make such complexes are explored, including gravitational instabilities in spiral shocked gas and compression of incident clouds. We find that instabilities are too slow for a complete collapse of the observed <b>spiral</b> <b>filaments,</b> but they could lead to star formation in the denser parts. Compression of incident clouds can produce a faster collapse but has difficulty explaining the semi-regular spacing of some regions along the arms. If gravitational instabilities are involved, then the condensations have the local Jeans mass. Also in this case, the near-simultaneous appearance of equally spaced complexes suggests that the dust lanes, and perhaps the arms too, are relatively young.

40|$|Purified {{and crude}} flagellar {{isolates}} from cells of Bacillus pumilus NRS 236 {{were treated with}} acid, alcohol, acid-alcohol, or heat, and were examined electron microscopically in negatively stained and shadow-cast preparations. Under certain conditions, each of these agents causes the flagella to break between the proximal hooks and the <b>spiral</b> <b>filaments.</b> In such preparations, filaments are seen {{in various stages of}} disintegration, whereas hooks of fairly constant length retain their integrity and morphological identity. When crude isolates of flagella are treated under these conditions, the hooks remain attached to membrane fragments or bear basal material. These findings substantiate previous structural observations that led to the view that the proximal hook is a distinct part of the bacterial flagellum and further confirm that the hook is tightly associated with basal material and the cytoplasmic membrane. It appears that the hook is a polarly oriented structure, and that the interactions between the hook and the basal material or the cytoplasmic membrane are different from those between the hook and the filamentous portion of the organelle. Moreover, both types of interaction apparently differ still from those by which the flagellin subunits are held together in the flagellar filament. Hooks were isolated by exploiting the differences in relative stability shown by the various morphological regions of the bacterial flagellum...|$|R
40|$|A {{mud volcano}} field was {{recently}} discovered within the Malta Plateau in the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea). Box-core sediments and associated authigenic carbonates {{have been collected}} in water depths of 140 – 170 m from two distinctive sectors of the area, and analyzed for major, trace and rare earth elements, stable isotopes, and mineralogy. Relative homogeneity in the mineralogy and geochemistry of bulk sediments, and 210 Pb activity distributions, argue against an active mud ejection activity. In the Malta Plateau western sector, the sediments show high concentrations of Fe, As, Sb, and Mo, exceeding the background values estimated for the Strait of Sicily. Active fluid seepage {{in this area is}} thought to be responsible for these enrichments and for the formation of authigenic carbonate crusts. Evidence of bacterial involvement in carbonate (mainly aragonite) formation is recorded in the authigenic crusts, which contain flat and <b>spiralled</b> <b>filaments</b> resembling Beggiatoa-like sulphide oxidising bacteria and biofilm-like remains which occur inside the interspaces. Carbonate crusts consistently show extremely negative ? 13 C values (down to ? 49 ‰) that suggest contribution of carbon originating from anaerobic methane oxidation. Heavy oxygen isotopic compositions of the authigenic carbonates (2 ? 3 ‰ higher than those in box-core sediments) are interpreted as due to precipitation from fluids enriched in 18 O due to seepage of deep, isotopically-heavy, relict Messinian brines...|$|R
