40|$|The aim {{of present}} paper was {{to study the}} {{influence}} ofthe planting material (forced and unforced tuberous roots), and of the cultivar on the average <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> content (%) from Dahlia tuberous roots at harvest. Also, there were determined a series of relationships between <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> content and main plant characteristics, like average shoots per plant and average weight of the tuberous roots at harvesting. The study was conducted for two years at University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca on seven cultivars of Dahlia variabilis ‘cactus’ type: 'Kennemerland', 'TsukiYori No Sisha', 'Hayley Jane', 'Purple Gem', 'Star Favourite', 'Park Princess' and 'Friquolet'. Based on the results obtained {{it can be concluded}} that the forcing of the tuberous roots affected the accumulation of <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> content at dahlia tubers, but it also depends on the cultivar. The highest content of <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> was at following cultivars 'Star Favourite'/forced tubers (25. 47 %), 'TsukiYori No Sisha'/unforced tubers (24. 80 %), ‘Kennemerland’/unforced tubers (24. 27 %), 'Hayley Jane'/forced tubers (23. 97 %), and 'TsukiYori No Sisha'/forced tubers (22. 57 %).

Results showed that cassava and yam have different cooking quality. Dry matter content does not influence the cooking quality of yam and cassava. Mealy cooking quality of yam absorbs less water (6. 6 %) during cooking but looses more <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> (9. 5 %) during the same process. Hard cooking quality of yam absorbs much water (23. 5 %), but looses less <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> (3. 9 %). The <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> is the main parameter to determine the quality of D. alata. It stands at 9. 5 % ± 2. 9 for mealy cooking quality and 3. 9 ± 0. 73 for hard cooking quality cultivars of D. alata. Water absorbed by mealy cooking cassava (27. 6 %) is significantly (p < 0. 05) higher compared to water absorbed of hard cooking cassava (12. 4 %). Water absorbed during cooking is the main parameter in determining the quality of cassava cultivars.

Study Design: Thirty-six coconut saps from thirty-six healthy coconut trees inflorescences, replicated two times. Trees were randomly selected; cultivars were the most widespread coconut types in Côte d'Ivoire. The whole coconut saps consists of three batches of three samples per cultivar. Place and Duration of the Study: Station Marc Delorme for the coconut Research at Port Bouet, National Centre of Agronomic Research (CNRA) of Côte d'Ivoire during 2012 and 2013. Methodology: Inflorescences saps from four coconut cultivars namely Malayan Yellow Dwarf, West African Tall, and PB 121 + and PB 113 + hybrids were investigated according to their carbohydrate content. Nine coconut trees were randomly selected per cultivar on experimental fields and their unopened inflorescences (spathes) of rank 8 have undergone the production of sap. The sap was harvested twice a day and samples from both harvestings were stored at - 20 ºC. Even quantities of the daily samples were mixed and a slight volume was taken from this mixture for analysis. Five traits (pH, contents of total <b>soluble</b> solids, <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> total <b>soluble</b> sugars and reducing sugars) related to glucidic richness of the coconut sap were assessed. Then the main carbohydrates components (sucrose, glucose, fructose, mannose and glycerol) were elucidated using a high performance ionic chromatography {{and led to the}} evaluation of the sweet index. Results: The effect of coconut cultivars on the pH and contents of total <b>soluble</b> solids, <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> total <b>soluble</b> sugars, sucrose, mannose, glycerol and sweet index was significant at P =. 05. The sap of MYD recorded highest means of pH (7. 32). This type of sap contained also highest contents of total soluble solids (16. 31 %), <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> (16. 47 g/ 100 ml), total soluble sugars (16. 08 g/ 100 ml), mannose (0. 019 g/ 100 ml) and glycerol (0. 094 g/ 100) contents and provided the greatest sweet index (16. 00). Sucrose was the main carbohydrate of coconut sap. The MYD obtained higher sucrose content (12. 24 g/ 100 ml) than the WAT (9. 40 g/ 100 ml). Hundred (100 ml) of saps from PB 121 + and PB 113 + provided respectively 10. 31 g and 10. 38 g of sucrose, which intermediate both means above. The contents of reducing sugars, glucose and fructose were respectively between 2. 41 and 3. 73 g/ 100 ml; 1. 63 and 1. 84 g/ 100 ml and from 1. 24 to 1. 52 g/ 100 ml, but didn't differentiate saps originating with MYD, WAT, PB 121 + and PB 113 + cultivars. Reducing sugars were significantly composed of glucose (r = 0. 83) and fructose (r = 0. 91). Conclusion: The richness in glucides of coconut inflorescence sap is {{related to the}} contents of total <b>soluble</b> solids, <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and the whole carbohydrates. Thanks to their higher sucrose, glucose and fructose contents, the saps of the MYD, PB 121 + and PB 113 + cultivars could be suitable for the production of syrup, sugar and alcohol in order to improve benefits derived from the coconut. - See more at: [URL] (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

One of the possible approach for proper irrigation scheduling is measuring the soil water potential, simple and easy to manage. The purpose {{of this research was}} {{to examine the effects of}} two different irrigation regimes (obtained by the use of tensiometers connected to a relay controller) on yield, fruit quality and water consumption of greenhouse tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Naxos) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L., cv Sarig, in the first cropping cycle, and the local landrace ‘Mezzo lungo di Polignano’, in the second one) grown on a silty-clay soil in Mediterranean conditions. For each species, two tests (August-February and February-July cycle) were carried out in a plastic greenhouse-tunnel. Drip irrigation was adopted, with automated schedule based on tensiometer readings. Two water potential irrigation set-points were compared: - 100 and - 400 hPa for tomato and - 100 and - 300 hPa for cucumber, in both cycles. Yield (marketable and unmarketable) and quality traits of fruits (<b>soluble</b> solids, <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and titratable acidity) were determined. Water consumption was calculated at the end of each crop cycle. In the first cycle, the two water regimes did not affect the yield of tomato and cucumber. The cucumber irrigated at the lowest soil water potential set-point produced fruits with 8 % higher <b>dry</b> <b>matter.</b> In the second cycle, the tomato irrigated at the potential of - 400 hPa showed a 40 % lower yield (mainly due to the lower fruit size) compared to that of plants irrigated at - 100 hPa. However, the fruits of tomato plants irrigated at - 400 hPa showed total <b>soluble</b> solids, <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and titratable acidity, respectively 41, 45 and 59 % higher than plants irrigated at - 100 hPa. In both crop cycles, a water saving of 35 % and 46 %, on average, for tomato and cucumber, respectively, was obtained using the lowest potential as irrigation set-point. Proper use of tensiometer could allow a better use of water resource. Selection of proper water potential set-points according to the cultivation season is crucial for satisfactory results.

40|$|A {{proposal}} is presented for a model programme of ecological horticulture which {{could contribute to}} improved vegetable crop production and biodiversity in tropical agroecosystems. Each step of the model “Aurora Tropical” was successfully applied for producing pesticide-free onions and shallots in semiarid conditions of Venezuela and for comparing simultaneously growth and productivity of 11 cultivars. The model steps include a good knowledge of the vegetable crop, market, soil/substrate, irrigation water, climate, microclimate, companion crops and the current and indigenous horticultural technologies. Also, the proposal recognizes the distinction between agriculture and horticulture in tropical environments. Growth and yield {{results indicate that the}} onion cultivars Americana, Cimarron and H 10020 were the top performers for leaf area, bulb diameter and yield. Furthermore, the red shallot 10026 showed the highest total <b>soluble</b> solids and <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> content, and also a good relative yield.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of the}} phenological {{characteristics}} (flowering and ripening time), fruit characteristics (fruit mass, fruit length, fruit width, fruit hardness, length of fruit stalk and number of seeds in fruit) and chemical characteristics of fruits (<b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> total sugar and total acids) of a traditional pear variety ‘Karamanka’. For this study, a survey was undertaken in different ecological regions of Macedonia i. e. Skopje, Kumanovo, Kratovo, Kriva Palanka and Resen. The ‘Karamanka’ pear flowers {{in the first half of}} April. The period of fruit ripening starts in the second half of August and lasts until the first half of September. The earliest time of flowering and ripening was found to be in the regions of Skopje and Kumanovo. The pear ‘Karamanka’ has medium-sized fruits and the largest fruits were detected in the regions of Kumanovo and Resen. These differences in reference to the fruit mass were statistically significant. It was found that fruits contained 14. 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} fermentability, ruminal degradability and digestibility of 48 maize silages {{were determined}} using in vitro gas production (GP), in situ degradability and in vitro digestibility procedures. The silages were produced from forage maize harvested {{throughout the summer}} of 1998, and represent {{a wide range of}} physiological maturities. Large variations among samples were observed for all biological parameters, with the exception of in vitro digestibility and the asymptote of in vitro GP. The potential of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict the biological parameters measured was determined by regression of the biological data against the respective spectral profile. NIRS demonstrated only a moderate ability (R- 2 > 0. 60 - 0. 80) to predict in vitro digestibility, modelled kinetics of gas production (excluding the asymptote of gas production) and the modelled ruminally <b>soluble</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> (DM) fraction. Calibration statistics for remaining biological parameters were unacceptably poor (R- 2 = 0. 60). (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Maize {{diseases}} {{caused by}} mollicutes (Phytoplasma and Spiroplasma) areimportant for the crop because its high incidence causes losses in grain production. Plants phloem are infected by mollicutes, which may alter sugar synthesis and proteins levels. The {{objective of this}} study was to verify the mollicutes effect on total soluble sugar andproteins synthesis in two maize cultivars. The experiment was carried out in pots of 30 Kg, with soil previously analyzed and fertilized. After thinning two plants were left perpot. The experimental design was a fully randomized 3 x 2 factorial with 6 replications;being 3 inoculations (phytoplasma, spiroplasma and healthy plants) and 2 cultivars (Dina 766 and BR 201). Thirty days after inoculating maize plants, it was analyzed theparameters: leaf temperature, relative humidity, stomatal resistance and transpiration. Atmilky growth stage the maize plants were harvested and cut into 3 parts, in order toanalyze total soluble sugars, nutrients and <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> accumulation. The internode belowmain ear and the flag leaf were sampled to determine the peroxidase activity and proteincontent, respectively. The other plant was left up to end of the crop cycle in order toevaluate ear number, grain and ear weight and grain <b>dry</b> <b>matter.</b> The analysis of variancefor all characteristics evaluated did not show significance on interactions of genotypes xinoculation. Some parameters resulted in significance for genotypes, inoculation or forboth. <b>Soluble</b> sugars, <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> peroxidase activity and protein were similar in bothgenotypes and inoculations. Stomatal resistance was higher in Dina 766 and in maizeplants inoculated by phytoplasma. Ear number was higher in plants inoculated bymollicutes than in healthy plants. Ear and grain weights were higher in healthy plantsand in the ones infected by phytoplasma, when compared to the ones infected byspiroplasma. Nutrient concentration and the amounts taken up were similar, except forP and Zn. The mollicutes interfered neither on soluble sugar synthesis nor on proteincontent. However, the yield data suggested a higher susceptibility to the Spiroplasmarather than to the Phytoplasma...|$|R
40|$|Short wave near {{infrared}} (interactance geometry) spectroscopy {{is used in}} assessment of various attributes of intact fruit. As sample temperature impacts the water peak, the performance of fruit Brix (<b>soluble</b> sugar) and <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> models is perturbed. Addition of {{a relatively small number}} of spectra of the same set of samples at different temperatures can create a model robust to temperature. However continued addition of samples at a uniform temperature can overwhelm this compensation effect, resulting in a model that is not robust to temperature. The aim of the current exercise is to document this effect, in order to propose population structures to ensure that a model remains robust to temperature. Use of orthogonal scatter correction (method of removal of a small number of factors which account for large variation in spectra and are orthogonal to the reference value; Fearn, 2000) and of a repeatability file (Westerhaus, 1990) was also considered. Models were developed using spectra of tomato fruit collected at 15 °C, and tested on spectra of an independent set of fruit at a sample temperature of 35 °C...|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{diversity}} {{was assessed}} for {{quantitative and qualitative}} traits {{in a collection of}} pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) germplasm from different areas of Turkey. A total of 48 genotypes, including germplasm lines and com-mercial cultivars, were studied under field conditions at Izmir over two consecutive summers (2004 and 2005). All accessions were characterized for 67 agro-morphological traits from seedling emergence to crop maturity. Morpholog-ical data were subjected to principal components analysis followed by hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This pro-vided seven groups based on morphological and agronomic properties. The first six principal components axes accounted for 54. 29 % of the variance among the 48 accessions and their lines. The greater part of variance was accounted for by traits such as fruit diameter, fruit weight, volume, fruit wall thickness, fruit productivity, and fruit <b>soluble</b> solid and <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> content. The high diversity found in the collection showed its great potential for improv-ing agronomic traits in pepper.
