5|$|The overweighting of the {{stressed}} syllables {{strengthens the}} humour of the lines. Busch also uses dactyls, where one accented syllable {{is followed by}} two unaccented syllables, as in his Plisch und Plum, where they underline the pedantic and solemn words with which teacher Bokelmann educates his pupils. They create tension in the Sourdough chapter from Adventures of a Bachelor, through the alternation of trochees and dactyls. Busch often synchronizes format and content in his poems, as in Fips the Monkey, where he uses the epic hexameter in a <b>speech</b> <b>about</b> wisdom.|$|E
5|$|Lewis' {{presence}} on the Street infuriates Gail, who still holds a grudge {{for the way he}} treated Audrey. Gail hopes Lewis may have left for good when he attends court on charges of fraud.

The animosity between Gail and Lewis, reaches a peak at The Bisto; and as Audrey defends Lewis, a food critic from the Weatherfield Gazette walks in. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Lewis turns on the charm and quickly wins the reviewer over. Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who owns The Bistro, realises Lewis' communication skills could be good for his business and he employs Lewis for a trial period at the restaurant.|$|E

5|$|On the April 11, 2011 {{episode of}} Raw, Edge gave an {{emotional}} <b>speech</b> <b>about</b> {{his career and}} the realities of wrestling. He said he took further tests to his basic-strength tests, and an MRI result forced him to retire. Leading up to this announcement, he had reflected upon his previous neck injury and cervical vertebral fusion, and felt numbness in his arms. This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis, and doctors would not clear him to compete, for risk of neck-down paralysis or even death should he take a hard enough fall. Later that same week on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship, retiring as the World Champion {{in the process of}} recapping his announcement and expressing gratitude over this happening now rather than it being too late.|$|E
5|$|Roark {{is arrested}} and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides {{to use his}} papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the {{circulation}} of his newspapers, and Wynand's employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced {{with the prospect of}} closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a <b>speech</b> <b>about</b> the value of ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{many of the}} revolutionaries {{attended}} a theatre production {{on the theme of}} tyranny, called Rome Saved. The lead actor was Morante, playing Cicero. The police chief requested Morante to feign illness and not appear, so that the play could be replaced with Misanthropy and Repentance by the German novelist and playwright August von Kotzebue. Rumors of police censorship spread quickly; Morante ignored the request and performed the play as planned. In the fourth act, Morante made a patriotic <b>speech,</b> <b>about</b> the Gaul threat to Rome (the Gauls are ancestors of the French people) and the need for strong leadership to resist the danger. This scene lifted the revolutionaries' spirits and led to frenzied applause. Juan José Paso stood up and cried out for the freedom of Buenos Aires, and a small fight ensued.|$|E

5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public <b>speech</b> <b>about</b> the rights of gay men and lesbians by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of gay men and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men and lesbians.|$|E
