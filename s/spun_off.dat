5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (<b>spun</b> <b>off</b> from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (<b>spun</b> <b>off</b> from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (<b>spun</b> <b>off</b> from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (<b>spun</b> <b>off</b> from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E

In this paper a case study is presented to gain more insight in <b>spin</b> <b>offs</b> of these types of universities, and their effect on the regional economy. For this purpose a database of 152 <b>spin</b> <b>offs</b> has been developed and a first survey was analysed. Most <b>spin</b> <b>offs</b> are active in the ICT and business services sectors. We have compared the results with the <b>spin</b> <b>offs</b> University of Twente. We observed that the percentage of <b>spin</b> <b>offs,</b> which was located outside the surrounding region of Saxion (33 %) was significantly higher, than the percentage of <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> of the University of Twente (22 %). The <b>spin</b> <b>offs</b> outside the region also have employees than Saxion <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> in the region. There is however no difference in the way the <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> perceive the business climate of their location. Stimulating entrepreneurship at universities of applied seems a good strategy to support the development of the promising knowledge intensive service sector {{in the eastern part of}} the |Netherlands. On the other hand this strategy should be accompanied with policy instruments aiming at convincing alumni entrepreneurs to stay in the region...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the commercialization}} of {{research}} has become an increasingly important issue for academics as well as policy makers, much less is known about <b>spinning</b> <b>off</b> firms {{as a tool for}} technology transfer from universities and research organizations, especially from a process perspective.

The investigation of the most probably thriving Greek university <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> has as an objective goal the awakening of the Greek academic community and the potential researchers entrepreneurs, in order to set the bases for further development of the <b>spin</b> <b>off</b> market.
