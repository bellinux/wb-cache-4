5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o'clock to fit in work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> at the same rate paid male <b>student</b> <b>teachers.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Our {{investigation}} explored a pedagogy for supervision {{through a}} case study of one prospective middle school mathematics <b>teacher</b> during her <b>student</b> teaching semester. Classroom observations by the university supervisor, teaching episode interviews between the supervisor and <b>student</b> <b>teacher,</b> and focused journal reflections by the <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> were coordinated to challenge the <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> existing models of teaching. The emerging pedagogy of the teaching episodes, a central focus of this study, was characterized by (a) the use of open-ended questions that centered the <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> in the process of sense making; (b) a shift away from the supervisor’s direct, authoritative evaluations of the <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> practice; (c) a sustained focus throughout supervision derived from the <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> classroom experiences; and (d) an effort to maintain sensitivity to the <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> zone of proximal development. We found our approach to be coincident with the notion of instructional conversation (IC) advanced by Gallimore and Goldenberg (1992). The nature of the teaching episodes seemed to open the <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> zone of proximal development so that her practice of teaching could be mediated with the assistance of a more knowing other...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{evolving}} event-structured knowledge of one <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> in a second grade classroom containing a diverse population of students. His understandings, interpretations, and reflections were documented before, during, and after enactment of units of content in the classroom. Weekly interviews designed to elicit the <b>student</b> <b>teacher's</b> "well-remembered events" provided the primary data for the study. In addition, daily observations by the researcher supplemented analysis of the <b>student</b> <b>teacher's</b> interpretations. Interviews with the cooperating teacher to establish an understanding of the context in which the <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> was learning to teach completed data collection. Findings indicated that the <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> faced major difficulties in the areas of instructional time and unit context. Based on the demands of the curriculum, <b>students,</b> and cooperating <b>teacher</b> and his interpretations of difficulties encountered, the <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> concluded that the second grade curriculum was above grade level, that it was constraining on planning and teaching, and that it contained discrepancies. The <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> resolved these difficulties by moving students back in the curriculum or by condensing or eliminating portions of the curriculum before and during the enactment of content. Analysis of the data suggests that other factors may have contributed to the problems faced by the <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> in learning to teach. For example, he reported having limited knowledge of the curriculum as well as teaching methods. These limitations may have affected the struggles he experienced as he learned, represented, and enacted the curriculum with a group of students in a complex environment...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find out the impact of <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> ratio, class size and per student expenditure on the academic achievement of students at secondary stage in Punjab (Pakistan). <b>Student</b> <b>teacher</b> ratio, class size and per student expenditure are very important school resource inputs. The lesser <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> ratio and class size, and the higher per student expenditure are very effective for producing higher level of academic achievement; however, it depends upon their proper allocation among schools. Population of the study comprised all secondary and higher secondary schools, secondary <b>teachers</b> and secondary <b>students</b> in Punjab. Overall, a total of 288 schools, then 20 <b>students</b> and 10 <b>teachers</b> from each school were randomly selected as the sample of the study.

The longitudinal data of academic achievement in the form of aggregate marks of the annual examinations of the Classes VI, VII, & VIII as prior achievement and that of the Class X as academic achievement of the same students through “Result Sheet”. The data were summarized at school level and then analyzed collectively. Stepwise Regression analysis with linear function was used to find out the differential impact of <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> ratio and class size on the academic achievement. The study found that there is much variation and misallocation in <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> ratio, class size and per student expenditure among schools. The study found that misallocation of <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> ratio, class size and per student expenditure leads to the wastage of resources and lower level of academic achievement. Reduction in <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> ratio and class size, and addition in per student expenditure are very expensive; therefore, policy can be decided considering the funds constraints. However, allocation of <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> ratio, class size and per student expenditure can be equalized within the scarce funds. This equal allocation of these resource inputs may lead to the effective use of school resource inputs and produce higher level of academic achievement. ...|$|R
