His mother {{said he had been}} watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to the auction together.|$|E
5|$|Vaduz's {{success in}} their nation's cup ensured they {{gained access to}} the UEFA Cup, and in August 2002, Burgmeier scored his first European goal during a 1–1 with Livingston, the Scottish side's first game in Europe. In the second leg, Vaduz had a late goal {{disallowed}} during a 0–0, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> out in the qualifying round for the third successive year, losing on the away goals rule. Vaduz topped the Fall Season table that season, but failed to win promotion to the Swiss Super League after finishing fourth in the Final League. Their failure was offset with another victory in the Liechtenstein Cup, this time defeating Balzers in the final.|$|E

Not having much gold the Pirates are unable to pay for the boat, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on an adventure to find 6,000 dubloons.|$|R

The appointed person thus agreed and the people bestowed upon him the title : 'Maha Sammata' meaning: The People's Choice. Then, they bestowed also the second title: 'Khattiya' meaning the 'Lord of the Rice Field', and finally the third title: 'Raja' which means 'Who gladdens people with Dhamma (or Truth)'.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Giovanni Falcone {{signed an}} arrest warrant in Italy for the three {{brothers}} on drug trafficking charges. The brothers didn't go back to Italy and the United States did not grant extradition, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on trial and were convicted of drug trafficking in absentia. In March 1980, Rosario and his brother Joseph were arrested by American authorities for alleged participation {{in an attempt to}} import 91 pounds of heroin from Milan, Italy. They were both acquitted of those charges.|$|E

25|$|Assault Guard Captain Fernando Condés {{was a close}} {{personal}} friend of Castillo. The next day, he led his squad to arrest José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, founder of CEDA, as a reprisal for Castillo's murder. But he was not at home, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> {{to the house of}} José Calvo Sotelo, a leading Spanish monarchist and a prominent parliamentary conservative. Luis Cuenca, a member of the arresting group and a Socialist, summarily executed Calvo Sotelo by shooting him {{in the back of the}} neck. Hugh Thomas concludes that Condés intended to arrest Sotelo and that Cuenca acted on his own initiative, although he acknowledges other sources that dispute this finding.|$|E
25|$|Fascist {{governments in}} both Italy and Germany privatized {{state-owned}} enterprises at certain times. These privatizations {{were carried out}} {{in the early stages of}} both regimes (1922-25 for Italy and 1934-37 for Germany), and represented a reversal of the policies of the democratic governments which had preceded them. The democratic governments had brought a number of industries under state ownership, and the fascists decided to return them to private ownership. In doing <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> against the mainstream economic trends of their time, when most Western governments were increasing state ownership. Fascist privatization policies were driven by a desire to secure the support of wealthy industrialists, as well as by the need to increase government revenues in order to balance budgets. Significantly, fascist governments were among the first to undertake large-scale privatizations in modern times.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April, after {{receiving}} news of Hitler's suicide, orders were issued {{that those who}} could do so were to break out. The plan was to escape from Berlin to the Allies {{on the western side}} of the Elbe or to the German Army to the North. Prior to the breakout, Mohnke briefed all commanders (who could be reached) within the Zitadelle sector about the events as to Hitler's death and the planned break out. They split up into ten main groups on 1 May 1945. Mohnke's group included: secretary Traudl Junge, secretary Gerda Christian, secretary Else Krüger, Hitler's dietician, Constanze Manziarly, Ernst-Günther Schenck, Walther Hewel and various others. Mohnke planned to break out towards the German Army which was positioned in Prinzenallee. The group headed along the subway but their route was blocked <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> aboveground and later joined hundreds of other Germans civilians and military personnel who had sought refuge at the Schultheiss-Patzenhofer Brewery on Prinzenallee. On 2 May 1945, General Weidling issued an order calling for the complete surrender of all German forces still in Berlin. Knowing they could not get through the Soviet rings, Mohnke decided to surrender to the Red Army. However, several of Mohnke's group (including some of the SS personnel) opted to commit suicide.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{interpreted}} the Telmarines, including Caspian, as being Spanish {{because of their}} pirate origins, which producer Mark Johnson noted made Caspian [...] "a contrast to the lily-white [...] ". Production designer Roger Ford originally wanted the Telmarines to be French, as they had a confrontational history with the English, who are represented by the Pevensies. This was scrapped as the crew were unable to shoot at Pierrefonds Castle, for Miraz's lair, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> for the Spanish feel. Weta Workshop created masked helmets for their army, and faceplates for the live horses on set. The stunt soldiers wield two-hundred polearms in two different styles, two-hundred rapiers of varying design, over a hundred falchions, two-hundred and fifty shields and fifty-five crossbows. Caspian's own sword is {{a variation of the}} Royal Guard's weapons. Costume designer Isis Mussenden looked to the paintings of El Greco to inspire the Telmarines' costumes. She wanted to use colours that looked [...] "acidic and hot and cool at the same time", unlike the red and gold seen in the Narnian soldiers. Their masked helmets are based on conquistadors and samurai. She visited the armour archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration. An eagle emblem was incorporated into the characters' lairs to make them feel fascist.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{originally}} wanted American actor Sheldon Leonard {{to voice}} Fat Tony, {{but they were}} unable to get him, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> with Joe Mantegna instead. Mantegna was offered the role during the show's second season, and since he had seen the show before and thought it was [...] "funny", he decided to give it a shot. He felt honored that they asked him to do a voice for the show. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Mantegna said he thinks the reason he got the role was partly due to his performance in the 1990 Mafia film The Godfather Part III, which opened just prior to when he received the role. He thought the script was smart and clever and that he enjoyed recording it. Mantegna has since appeared many times on the show as Fat Tony, who became a recurring character; it is Mantegna's longest-running role in his acting career. Mantegna commented: [...] "Who knew that Fat Tony was gonna resonate in {{the hearts and minds of}} the [...] out there? Apparently [...] got enough feedback as to how the character was liked that they wrote it in again and again, and I was kind of a recurring guy that they’d tap into at least a couple episodes a season." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the domain}} of King James' England, King James (a {{variation}} of Wolverine) was its ruler until he was discovered to be a Witchbreed (this domain's version of Mutants) who killed various redhaired girls. King James was seemingly killed by Sister Angela of the Holy Order who drowned him. He was succeeded is King Charles the First (who is secretly a Witchbreed leader and a variation of Professor X). With the population of Witchbreed diminished, the Witch Hunters Sister Angela of the Holy Order and her partner Lady Serah Anchorton went on to hunt Faustians, people who made deals with Demons, but, before doing <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to the Mermaid Tavern to drink with some friends of theirs. There they attacked Captain James Barnes of Clan Buchanan whom they believed was a Witchbreed, but it revealed itself to be a Faustian after being cut in half by Angela and reanimating its two halves as hideous monsters. Lady Serah killed the upper half. As Angela killed the bottom half, it summoned its [...] "maker" [...] the Enchantress. Angela tried to hit her, but she couldn't do her harm. The Enchantress threatened that Serah would die when three of her Faustians {{had been killed by}} Angela before vanishing in the air, leaving a worried Angela behind.|$|E
500|$|Denning {{was noted}} for his {{excellent}} memory, repeating notes almost verbatim in his exams at Oxford {{and on one}} occasion identifying the exact book, page and paragraph of text in a judgment that covered a particular situation. As a judge he attempted to make his decisions and the law publicly understandable, believing that the public {{would not want to}} follow the law unless they believed and understood that it was just. In his cases he referred to the parties by name in his judgments rather than as [...] "plaintiff" [...] and [...] "defendant" [...] and used short sentences and a [...] "storytelling" [...] style of speech shown in the case Beswick v Beswick where his judgment started:Old Peter Beswick was a coal merchant in Eccles, Lancashire. He had no business premises. All he had was a lorry, scales, and weights. He used to take the lorry to the yard of the National Coal Board, where he bagged coal and took it round to his customers in the neighbourhood. His nephew, John Joseph Beswick, helped him in his business. In March 1962, old Peter Beswick and his wife were both over 70. He had had his leg amputated and was not in good health. The nephew was anxious to get hold of the business before the old man died. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to a solicitor, Mr. Ashcroft, who drew up an agreement for them.|$|E

But they couldn't support themselves there either, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came {{to the land of the}} Greeks (i.e. the Byzantine empire). They asked leave of the Greek king to stay there while the moon waxed and waned. The king granted that, thinking it was just for one month. Then after a month, he wanted to send them away, but they answered that the moon waxed and waned for ever and always, and so they said they were allowed to stay. Word of this dispute of theirs reached the queen. She said, [...] "My lord king, you granted them permission to dwell while the moon waxed and waned; now that's for ever and always, so you can't take it off them." [...] So they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language.|$|E
