5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E

Simon did not want to work on either series, both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled, which put a <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pair's relationship.|$|E

Montag increasingly spent more time with Pratt and neglected her friendship with Conrad, which placed a <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pair's friendship.

5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar fasciitis by placing excess <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E
5|$|Hood {{was laid}} down at Chatham Dockyard on 12 August 1889 and was {{launched}} on 30 July 1891, the Viscountess Hood christening her. She finished her sea trials in May 1893 and was commissioned on 1 June 1893 {{at the cost}} of £926,396. Her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet was delayed when she sprang a leak in her forward compartments on 7 June as a result of faulty riveting and excessive <b>strain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hull when she had been docked. Repairs took only two days, and the ship left Sheerness for the Mediterranean on 18 June.|$|E

40|$|A coating {{method for}} {{measuring}} large surface strains of three-dimensional bodies using the scattered-ligt technique was proposed {{associated with an}} investigation of photoviscoplastic bhavior of properly mixed polyester resin. A major advantage of this method is that interference fringes at the boundary between a real specimen and coatings can be observed directly. Two components of shearing <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of the real specimen in axi-symmetrical torsion problems could be calculated using two kinds of scattered-light fringe patterns obtained by two different incidences of polarized light. For the demonstration of effectiveness of the proposed method, this method was applied to analyses of surface strains of solid and circumferentially notched cylindrical specimens made of aluminum alloy with polyester coatings under torsion. Shearing <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of solid specimens were estimated, which were well consistent with ones calculated from twisting angles. For the notched specimen, shearing <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> notch surface were estimated and the distributions were well consistent with FEM analyses...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{stress and}} strain {{analysis}} considering the effect of <b>strain</b> rate <b>on</b> polyester under uniaxial tension and torsion was investigated by the scattered-light method. The difference in principal <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> symmetrical section in tension problems could be calculated using two kinds of scattered fringe patterns obtained by two different incidences of polarized light. <b>The</b> shearing <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> symmetrical section in torsion problems could be calculated using scattered fringe patterns obtained by one directional incidence. Finally, a new method was proposed for the estimation of the equivalent shearing {{stress and strain}}, the deviatoric stresses and <b>strains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> symmetrical section in a three-dimensional model under uniaxial tension from the measurement of only the fringe gradient and its rate of increase. The method could estimate the equivalent shearing stress and strain in the model under torsion, too. This method was applied to a viscoelasto-plastic problem of a cylindrical specimen with a semi-circular notch under uniaxial tension and torsion. The distributions of strain rate, <b>strain</b> and stress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> notched section were estimated. The results were consistent with those calculated using the finite element method...|$|R
