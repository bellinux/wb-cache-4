5|$|In February {{after one}} round of drink service, three men were denied further service at Sixteen {{due to their}} {{apparent}} intoxication and as a payback, the three pulled what {{was intended to be}} a prank. They set off fire alarms and opened a fifth-floor stairwell Chicago Fire Department <b>standpipe</b> valve and flooded elevator shafts with thousands of gallons of water and damaged woodwork, electrical circuitry and marble. The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.|$|E
25|$|Retail water tariffs. The same retail tariff {{structure}} {{applies to the}} entire country. Water and sewer tariffs in Morocco follow an increasing-block {{tariff structure}}, under which the tariff per cubic meter rises as consumption increases. The residential tariff has four blocks, the lowest applying to consumption of less than 6 m³ per month and the highest to consumption above 40 m³ per month. However, the level of retail tariffs varies from one locality to another. <b>Standpipe</b> services, which are common for the urban poor, are typically free. Utilities send bills to local governments. In a few cases, <b>standpipe</b> management has been entrusted to a gardien/gérant, who operates the faucet and charges users. According to a World Bank report, free <b>standpipe</b> services are pro-poor. But they are also increasingly unsustainable for operators, {{both in terms of}} wasted water (up to 40 percent) and in terms of lack of revenues. Operators are in favor of promoting individual connections in order to strengthen their revenue base.|$|E
25|$|Access to safe {{drinking}} water is indicated by safe water sources. These improved drinking water sources include household connection, public <b>standpipe,</b> borehole condition, protected dug well, protected spring, and rain water collection. Sources that do not encourage improved drinking water {{to the same extent}} as previously mentioned include: unprotected wells, unprotected springs, rivers or ponds, vender-provided water, bottled water (consequential of limitations in quantity, not quality of water), and tanker truck water. Access to sanitary water comes hand in hand with access to improved sanitation facilities for excreta, such as connection to public sewer, connection to septic system, or a pit latrine with a slab or water seal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Standpipes.</b> <b>Standpipes</b> are an {{effective}} option {{to supply the}} urban poor with clean water, {{in the absence of}} house connections to the piped network. However, in 1997 there were only 170 <b>standpipes</b> in Conakry, some of which were not working. The municipality of Conakry managed the <b>standpipes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The local government, {{which did}} not receive any {{significant}} revenues from the <b>standpipes,</b> did not pay the water company for the water supply to the <b>standpipes.</b> As a result, the operator cut off water supply to <b>standpipes.</b> Neither the municipality nor the operator was interested in seeing more <b>standpipes</b> being built under this dysfunctional arrangement. The number of <b>standpipes</b> thus remained limited, although they could potentially have provided {{a large number of}} poor with clean water at lower costs than house connections.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Standpipes</b> are {{connections}} for firehoses {{within a}} building {{and serve the}} same purpose as fire hydrants in larger structures. <b>Standpipes</b> may be [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet" [...] (permanently filled with water).|$|R
25|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2006–2007, the NWSC tariff for {{domestic}} use was US$0.64 per cubic metre. Taken {{from a public}} <b>standpipe,</b> the tariff was US$0.42 per cubic metre or less than US$0.01 per jerrycan. The average commercial tariff was US$1.00 per cubic metre. For commercial users, a rising block tariff structure was used. A customer who {{was connected to the}} sewerage system would pay an additional charge of 75-100 percent. Although water is cheapest at standpipes, UN-Water reports that in this case users usually have to pay the costs of operating a stand tap and thus in the end pay more. A cross subsidy arrangement enables NWSC to keep in operation systems that do not cover operation and maintenance costs.|$|E
25|$|The reactor {{operates}} in a helium–nitrogen atmosphere (70–90% He, 10–30% N2). The gas circuit {{is composed of}} a compressor, aerosol and iodine filters, adsorber for carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ammonia, a holding tank for allowing the gaseous radioactive products to decay before being discharged, an aerosol filter to remove solid decay products, and a ventilator stack, the iconic chimney above the plant building. The gas is injected to the stack from the bottom in a low flow rate, and exits from the <b>standpipe</b> of each channel via an individual pipe. The moisture and temperature of the outlet gas is monitored; an increase of them is an indicator of a coolant leak.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War, the {{infrastructure}} of St. Louis had suffered from neglect; another cholera epidemic struck in 1866, and typhoid fever raged in certain quarters. One of the earliest changes to come about due to the 1866 cholera epidemic (which killed more than 3500) was {{the establishment of the}} St. Louis Board of Health, which was given power to create and enforce sanitary regulations and monitor the activities of certain polluting industries. To rectify some of the problems with the water system, a new waterworks was built in north St. Louis in 1871, accompanied by a large reservoir at Compton Hill and a <b>standpipe</b> at Grand Avenue. However, water quality problems continued due to high demand and the dumping of waste upriver from the waterworks. The gas light system also saw improvements during the 1870s, when the Laclede Gaslight Company was formed to serve {{the south side of the}} city.|$|E

Water would be via a <b>standpipe</b> {{which had to}} be within [...] and sanitation provided by a dedicated toilet block, usually with an earth closet. There would generally be a dedicated cookhouse which the hop-pickers would use to prepare their meals. It was generally discouraged by the farmers for the pickers to have fires in their huts. A few brick built huts were provided with custom built fireplaces and chimneys. The interior of the huts was generally limewashed or distempered.|$|E
2500|$|Detroit Avenue, {{along the}} edge of <b>Standpipe</b> Hill, {{contained}} a number of expensive houses belonging to doctors, lawyers and business owners. The buildings on Greenwood Avenue housed the offices of almost all of Tulsa's black lawyers, realtors, doctors, and other professionals. In Tulsa {{at the time of the}} riot, there were fifteen well-known black American physicians, one of whom, Dr. A.C. Jackson, was considered the [...] "most able Negro surgeon in America" [...] by one of the Mayo brothers. Dr. Jackson was shot to death as he left his house during the unrest. Greenwood published two newspapers, the Tulsa Star and the Oklahoma Sun, which covered not only Tulsa, but also state and national news and elections. [...] The buildings that housed the newspapers were destroyed during the destruction of Greenwood.|$|E
2500|$|A four-story {{corrugated}} steel [...] "ladder tower" [...] building was constructed as the academy's high rise prop. There are {{internal and external}} stairways with a <b>standpipe</b> and sprinkler system throughout, only fed with water by an engine during training. It also features trapdoors creating an internal column for rope rescue training. For {{a period of time}} there was a SCBA maze located in a lower room of the building until it was converted into a live burn room after the smokehouse was closed. Vehicle extrication as well as car and fuel fires are fought on the [...] "burn pad" [...] which is an open concrete area next to the smokehouse. Donated vehicles are brought in from various sources. Typically they are used first for extrication by a first aid or fire company and then later get burned for car fire training by another. Fuels fires are contained in drums or tanks that have been cut open.|$|E
50|$|<b>Standpipes</b> go in {{a direct}} up and down {{direction}} rather than looping around the stairwell, greatly reducing the length and thus the loss of water pressure due to friction loss. Additionally, <b>standpipes</b> are rigid and do not kink, which can occur when a firehose is improperly laid on a stairwell.|$|R

50|$|Laying a firehose up a {{stairwell}} takes time, {{and this}} time is saved by having fixed hose outlets already in place. There is also a tendency for heavy wet hoses to slide downward when placed on an incline (such as the incline seen in a stairwell), whereas <b>standpipes</b> do not move. The use of <b>standpipes</b> keeps stairwells clear and is safer for exiting occupants.|$|R
2500|$|Tariffs. Tariffs are {{identical}} {{for the entire}} service area of ONEA, {{with the objective of}} cross subsidies between localities. The ONEA water tariffs are among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, reaching on average CFA franc 440/m3 (US$0.87/m3). The tariff structure is based on an increasing block rate system, with a social block including a basic consumption of 8 cubic meter per household and month at CFAF 209/m3 (US$0.41/m3) including the sanitation surcharge. However, taking into account the fixed monthly fee of CFAF 1,000 (US$2), a household consuming 6 m3 per month actually pays the equivalent of CFAF 375/m3 (US$0.75/m3). Commercial users, public buildings and residential users with a consumption of more than 30m3/month pay CFAF 1,040 per m3 (US$ 2.05/m3). Consumers using standpipes should pay CFAF 5 (US$0.01) for a 20-liter bucket, CFAF 10 [...] (US$0.02) for a 40-liter bucket and CFAF 60 (US$0.12) for a 220-liter barrel. The price per bucket corresponds to CFAF 250/m3 (US$0.50/m3). However, this official rate is not well enforced and in practice users pay between CFAF 350 and 600/m3 (US$0.75/m3 - US$1.20/m3). <b>Standpipe</b> caretakers pay CFAF 188/m3 (US$0.37/m3) to the utility and earn a living based on the margin they charge. Consumers using vendors pay much higher rates, around CFAF 1,000-1,500/m3 (US$2–3/m3). Under a social connection program, connection fees charged by the national utility for household connections, which were set at CFAF 120,000 (US$240) in 2005, corresponding to the full cost of establishing the connection, were first reduced to CFAF 50,000 (US$lOO) and then to CFAF 30,000 (US$60) ...|$|E

50|$|Although {{the use of}} {{elevated}} {{water storage}} tanks has existed since ancient times in various forms, the modern use of water towers for pressurized public water systems developed during the mid-19th century, as steam-pumping became more common, and better pipes that could handle higher pressures were developed. In the United Kingdom, <b>standpipes</b> consisted of tall, exposed, n-shaped pipes, used for pressure relief {{and to provide a}} fixed elevation for steam-driven pumping engines which tended to produce a pulsing flow, while the pressurized water distribution system required constant pressure. <b>Standpipes</b> also provided a convenient fixed location to measure flow rates. Designers typically enclosed the riser pipes in decorative masonry or wooden structures. By the late 19th-Century, <b>standpipes</b> grew to include storage tanks to meet the ever-increasing demands of growing cities.|$|R
25|$|Since fast {{demographic}} growth {{reveals itself}} in expanding peri-urban areas and slum areas - rarely served by water networks or sewers – {{the share of}} the urban households connected to piped water has been steadily decreasing from 50% in 1990 to 39% in 2005. The unconnected households need to rely on alternatives –formal or informal– such as: shared <b>standpipes</b> or boreholes, water tankers and household resellers. Usually, <b>standpipes</b> are the main source of water for unconnected urban households.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Standpipe</b> {{was a large}} watertower in Derry, {{very similar}} to the Thomas Hill <b>Standpipe.</b> In its earlier days, it {{remained}} unlocked so that patrons of an adjoining park could climb a spiral staircase around the tank to look out over Derry from the top. The <b>Standpipe</b> was closed to the public after several children drowned in the tank, most likely the fault of It. The <b>Standpipe</b> is where Stan Uris first encounters It, which takes the form of drowned children.|$|E

50|$|<b>Standpipes</b> and {{sanitation}} {{are provided in}} most developing areas, but the death rates are not significantly reduced. One {{of the reasons that}} water-related diseases are still occurring is because water supplies can be contacted by contaminated surface water. To effectively decrease the morbidity and mortality of diseases, the population should get access to water from home instead from outside. Therefore, in addition to the installation of <b>standpipes,</b> water supplies {{and sanitation}} should be provided within houses.|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} study done during 1994 - 1995 {{in a section}} of a large, low socio-economic urban development with limited sanitary facilities and drinking-water provision indicated that the community was exposed to water-related health risks when consuming the water supplied. The study indicated that, although the public supplied water was of a good quality, the stored water, once fetched from the <b>standpipes,</b> deteriorated to a quality often not safe for human consumption. Based {{on the findings of}} this {{previous study}}, the local authority decided to install <b>standpipes</b> for each individual family in the area concerned and these were placed in the house yards. The closer proximity of the <b>standpipes</b> immediately altered the water-fetching and storing patterns of the community. The consequent study, on which this abstract is based, assessed the potential risk of infection posed to health by the altered water-use pattern. Weekly water samples were collected from <b>standpipes</b> outside as well as from containers kept inside houses of selected families. Total coliforms, faecal coliforms, heterotrophic plate counts, Clostridium perfringens and somatic coliphages were used as microbiological indicators. Although the improvement of water accessibility enhanced the microbiological quality of stored water, the results indicated that hygienic quality still deteriorated. This situation indicated that a suitable education and information programme to enhance the quality gains of such engineering interventions should accompany engineering improvement of water accessibility...|$|R
