40|$|It is {{very good}} news for Italian {{participation}} at this year’s EUPHA meeting, which {{will be held in}} Lodz (Poland). From 25 to 28 November the joint annual conference EUPHA-ASPHER will see a peaceful “invasion” from Italy. Out of the 63 Italian <b>abstracts</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> the <b>conference</b> organisers, only 5 (7. 9 %) were rejected. Overall, 11. 6 % of all of the accepted abstracts are Italian, 9. 8 % of the oral presentations and 13 % of the poster presentations. These results pay testimony to the high quality of European public health research and practice reached in several fields and settings (academic, public health regional agencies, and local health units). Highlights from Italy include the ongoing work in the field of infectious disease control, Stefania Bruno (Catholic University) will present the Roman experience of Tubercolosis surveillance in the homeless.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the reproducibility of assessments made by independent reviewers of papers submitted for publication to clinical neuroscience journals and <b>abstracts</b> <b>submitted</b> for presentation at clinical neuroscience conferences. We studied two journals in which manuscripts were routinely assessed by two reviewers, and two conferences in which abstracts were routinely scored by multiple reviewers. Agreement between the reviewers as to whether manuscripts should be accepted, revised or rejected was not significantly greater than that expected by chance [kappa = 0. 08, 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 04 to - 0. 20] for 179 consecutive papers submitted to Journal A, and was poor (kappa = 0. 28, 0. 12 to 0. 40) for 116 papers submitted to Journal B. However, editors were very {{much more likely to}} publish papers when both reviewers recommended acceptance than when they disagreed or recommended rejection (Journal A, odds ratio = 73, 95 % CI = 27 to 200; Journal B, 51, 17 to 155). There was little or no agreement between the reviewers as to the priority (low, medium, or high) for publication (Journal A, kappa = - 0. 12, 95 % CI - 0. 30 to - 0. 11; Journal B, kappa = 0. 27, 0. 01 <b>to</b> 0. 53). <b>Abstracts</b> <b>submitted</b> for presentation at the conferences were given a score of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent) by multiple independent reviewers. For each conference, analysis of variance of the scores given <b>to</b> <b>abstracts</b> revealed that differences between individual abstracts accounted for only 10 - 20 % of the total variance of the scores. Thus, although recommendations made by reviewers have considerable influence on the fate of both papers <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> journals and <b>abstracts</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>conferences,</b> agreement between reviewers in clinical neuroscience was little greater than would be expected by chance alone...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the {{compositions}} of asteroids, {{especially their}} metal content, are relevant {{not only to}} investigations of their nature, but also to estimations of their potential to wreak devastation on impacting the Earth. In this respect it is informative to compare the airburst of a stony object, such as the Tunguska event, which destroyed a forest but left no crater, {{with the impact of}} a similarly sized metallic object, which produced the 1. 2 km diameter Barringer Crater in Arizona. In view of the evident link between metal content and the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM; Harris 1998) fitting parameter, eta, which carries information on thermal inertia (Harris and Drube, 2014; see <b>abstract</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> this <b>conference),</b> we are carrying out a re-analysis of Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) data (Tedesco et al., 2002) with NEATM to further explore the dependence of eta and thermal inertia on metal content. In addition to calculating best-fit values of eta, we are calculating the angle between the spin vector and the solar direction, theta, for all IRAS sightings of each asteroid for which a spin vector is available. The eta values of objects with high thermal inertia and moderate to high spin rates should depend strongly on theta, whereas those with low thermal inertia and/or low spin rates should not. By studying the relationships between theta and eta, we aim to further explore the potential of the results of Harris and Drube (2014) and provide insight into relationships between asteroid thermal properties, taxonomic type, albedo, spin rate, etc. We will present the first results of our work and provide a demonstration of its potential. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under grant agreement no. 282703 (NEOShield Project). Harris, A.

40|$|The {{rationale}} for the seminar was primarily that there are links between language testing and assessment {{on one hand and}} applied linguistics on the other which could be mutually beneficial, but are not necessarily perceived as such. Secondly, it was suggested that research in language assessment and applied linguistics have been perceived as distinct, with the roles of language testing and assessment in applied linguistics relatively unexplored, an artificial divide that Bachman 2 ̆ 6 Cohen (1998), for example, argue should be bridged (see also Bachman 2 ̆ 6 Palmer 1996; Shohamy 2001). An additional motivation for proposing this <b>conference</b> was <b>to</b> build on the growing presence of assessment and testing concerns within applied linguistics, not merely to address issues of visibility but, importantly, to contribute to a research agenda between different research communities within our (wider) applied linguistics community. To this end, we asked our keynote speakers and those who <b>submitted</b> <b>abstracts</b> <b>to</b> focus explicitly on reciprocity between the fields...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Conference abstracts {{often lack}} {{rigorous}} peer review, but potentially influence clinical thinking and practice. To evaluate {{the quality of}} <b>abstracts</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> a large surgical conference, presentation and publication rates were investigated to assess scientific impact. METHODS: A Cross-sectional study of <b>abstracts</b> <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> Dutch Surgical Society meetings from 2007 to 2012 was conducted. Presentation rates, publication rates in MEDLINE-indexed journals using PubMed Central database, and actuarial times to subsequent publication were investigated. RESULTS: Of 2, 174 <b>submitted</b> <b>abstracts,</b> 1, 305 (60 %) abstracts were accepted for presentation. Actuarial 1, 3, and 5 -year publication rates were 22. 4 %, 62. 2 %, and 68. 6 % for presented abstracts, compared with 20. 9 %, 50. 3 %, and 57. 7 % for rejected abstracts, respectively (log-rank x(2) 23. 728, df 1, P <. 001). Publications resulting from abstracts presented at the conference had a significantly higher mean (±standard error) impact factor (4. 4 ±. 2 vs 3. 4 ±. 1, P <. 001), compared with publications from previously rejected abstracts. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate critical appraisal {{of the use of}} findings of scientific abstracts and conference presentations.
