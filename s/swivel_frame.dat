The firm of Hagans in Erfurt developed this design with a split locomotive frame {{in order to achieve}} better curve running qualities. In the main frame were located the two front driving axles, whilst the rear two, were housed in a <b>swivelling</b> <b>frame</b> and driven via a specially developed arrangement of levers by the front axles. The Hagans T 13 was built as a smaller version of the Prussian T 15 by the firm of Henschel from 1899to 1902. It was delivered to the railway divisions of Erfurt, Saarbr√ºcken, Magdeburg and Frankfurt am Main. Unfortunately its complicated construction proved to be very maintenance-intensive, which had a negative impact on its economy. As a result, the locomotives were retired as early as 1923. Two similar engines had been supplied by Henschel to the Baden state railways as the Class VIII d.|$|R
