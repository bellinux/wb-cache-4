50|$|On April 4, 2001, the European Council {{approved}} the Protocol on Heavy Metals {{in order to}} reduce emissions of heavy metals that are subject to long-range transboundary atmospheric transport and are likely to have adverse effects on human health and the environment.

With the application of the European Directives 96/61/CE (Integrated pollution prevention and control) and 96/62/CE (Ambient air quality assessment and management) in which emission limits for toxic trace elements, such as mercury, are clearly established, energy production plants using coal must control mercury emissions. In January 2005, the European Commission adopted a mercury strategy for reducing mercury levels in the environment.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: This action proposes {{national}} {{emission standards}} for {{hazardous air pollutants}} (NESHAP) for <b>stationary</b> <b>combustion</b> turbines. We have identified <b>stationary</b> <b>combustion</b> turbines as major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions such as formaldehyde, toluene, benzene, and acetaldehyde. The proposed NESHAP would implement section 112 (d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) by requiring all major sources to meet HAP emission standards reflecting {{the application of the}} maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for combustion turbines. We estimate that 20 percent of the <b>stationary</b> <b>combustion</b> turbines affected by the proposed rule will be located at major sources. As a result, the environmental, energy, and economic impacts presented in this preamble reflect these estimates. The proposed standards would protect public health by reducing exposure to air pollution, by reducing total national HAP emissions by an estimated 81 tons/year in the 5 th year after the standards are promulgated. This action also proposes to add Method 323 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A for the measurement of formaldehyde emissions from natural gas-fired stationary sources. DATES: Comments.

40|$|The UN Global Mercury Assessment (GMA) {{estimates}} that atmospheric emissions of mercury from Australian <b>stationary</b> <b>combustion</b> sources were 97. 0 tonnes {{for the year}} of 1995.

It is also significantly larger than previous estimates of mercury emissions from Australian sources. New estimates of Australian mercury emissions from stationary energy sources, based on both a top down and bottom up approach, are presented. These estimates can be reconciled for black coal fired power stations, but suggest that the bottom up approach (the Australian National Pollutant Inventory) significantly under-estimates emissions from brown coal fired plant, if mercury capture efficiencies in these plants are low, as observed for lignite-fired plant. The major uncertainties in these estimates are the coal mercury content in coals burnt in Australian power stations, and the mercury capture efficiency in particulate control devices used at these stations. Based on these estimates, Australian emissions of mercury from stationary energy are currently 2 – 8 tonnes/year, significantly lower than the GMA estimate. 8 page(s...|$|E
