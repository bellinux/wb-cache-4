This is complicated by various structural faults and fold axes traversing the region in a north-eastern direction. Maximum development occurs in the Ain Dalla basin, a downthrown <b>structural</b> <b>block</b> south-west of the Bahariya oasis. Basement features present a dominant control on the complex's structural and sedimentological form. Despite many structural complications, Nubian sandstone likely constitutes a single hydrogeological system west of the Suez Gulf. To the east, on the Sinai peninsula, a second system might exist with some connection to the primary western system in the north. The main western system, extending into Libya and Sudan, consists of a multi-layered artesian basin where massive groundwater reserves accumulated, principally during pluvials of the Quaternary. Locally, carbonate rocks overlying the complex display karst features and are recharged by upwards leaks from the underlying major aquifer. Fluvial and structural interpretations from 2007 show the desert in western Egypt was induced by fluvial action, including recently mapped alluvial fans. In central areas, braided channels are spatially aligned to a north-east structural trend, suggesting preferential water flow paths. Alluvial fans and structurally enclosed channels coincided to gentle slopes and optimal recharge conditions between 1 and 5%, indicating high groundwater potential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interpretations correlated with anomalies from groundwater in 383 wells, suggesting {{a connection between the}} spatial organization of fluvial and structural features with low-salinity groundwater, which exists adjacent to alluvial fans and the south-west reaches of structurally enclosed channels.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{adsorption}} isotherm of methylene blue (MB) on sepiolite gels {{is of the}} Langmuir type, indicating a great affinity of the MB towards the sepiolite; the adsorption is quantitative up to adsorption of MB of 0. 1 mmol/g sepiolite. The differences observed in the absorption spectrum inthe region 500 - 650 nm for different MB Ioadings are interpreted in terms of aggregation f MB molecules on the sepiolite surface {{with the formation of}} MB dimers, trimers and higher aggregates. The progressive coverage of the sepiolite surface by MB produces a sharp decrease in the viscosity of the gels, and the suspension becomes peptized for an MB loading of 0. 21 mmol/g which corresponds tothe adsorption of MB dimers. These results indicate that MB avoids particle-to-particle nt ractions.

A first problem to deal with is that of representing <b>structural</b> <b>blocks.</b> A proposal is to exploit the Extended Gaussian Image (EGI) which maps on the unitary sphere the histogram of the orientations of the object surface.

The discordance may be explained by tilt down-to-the-northeast of the <b>structural</b> <b>block</b> that contains the intrusive suite of about 40 ° about a NW-SE trending axis, or perhaps more likely and based on additional geological evidence, by a combination of ∼ 20 ° of counterclockwise rotation about a vertical axis and a smaller amount of tilt.

This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Laramide structures of the Guerrero-Morelos platform were reactivated by a younger deformation event, {{and that there is a}} deformation event superimposed that involves lateral slip. The contrasting orientation of NW-SE trending structures within the Mezcala mining district affecting the plutons, and N-S trending Laramide structures, suggests that the discordant paleomagnetic directions are best explained by a combination of tilt and rotation.|$|E
