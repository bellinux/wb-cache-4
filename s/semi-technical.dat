Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like Acrocanthosaurus and Yangchuanosaurus, are members of closely related families.|$|E

5000|$|Allosaurus was an allosaurid, {{a member}} of a family of large theropods within the larger group Carnosauria. The family name Allosauridae was created for this genus in 1878 by Othniel Charles Marsh, but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of Megalosauridae, another family of large theropods that {{eventually}} became a wastebasket taxon. This, along with the use of Antrodemus for Allosaurus during the same period, is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on Allosaurus in publications that predate James Madsen's 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name [...] "Megalosauridae" [...] instead of [...] "Allosauridae" [...] include Gilmore, 1920, von Huene, 1926, Romer, 1956 and 1966, Steel, 1970, and Walker, 1964.Following the publication of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. <b>Semi-technical</b> works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids.

40|$|This study, set in {{the field}} of English for {{academic}} legal purposes (EALP), sets out to first identify a <b>semi-technical</b> word list in post-graduate academic legal written texts and then to examine the rhetorical functions such a wordlist enables as an indicator of the epistemology of the disciplinary community. This field was chosen because access to student assignments is hindered {{by the fact that they}} are not in published form; yet numerically, they most likely outnumber published academic material. In a post-graduate context, where {{in the field of}} law there is an influx of non-native speakers who have had their legal education in systems other than the English language dominated Common Law, the need to quickly understand how information is to be organised and communicated in student academic texts is a very pressing one indeed. The thesis adopts a corpus linguistics approach to the identification of <b>semi-technical</b> language. The corpus is comprised of texts written by post-graduate students studying Masters in Law (LLM) courses at three universities in Ireland; the corpus is just under one million words. The approach relies on quantitative methods to arrive at a vocabulary list and beyond the initial setting of parameters for data organisation and filtering, the researcher only becomes more active in the role of interpreter of the list’s rhetorical functions. The rhetorical functions themselves illustrate the positioning of post-graduate student writing between observing academic conventions, such as citation, and professional conventions, such as the use of binomial or multinomial constructions. However, a clear line dividing academic from professional practices does not exist and elements of both can be found to varying degrees in the three main rhetorical fields addressed by <b>semi-technical</b> language: citation, the use of bi- and multinomial constructions and finally, the reliance on nominal forms. The study, which is based on texts that were deemed successful by the disciplinary community gatekeepers (course lecturers), effectively sheds light on what fundamental legal discourse principles have to be adhered to by students whenever they write in their Master level courses...|$|E
