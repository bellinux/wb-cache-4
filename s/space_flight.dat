5|$|Administrator Webb {{realized}} {{that in order}} to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned <b>Space</b> <b>Flight,</b> to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) Marshall <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.|$|E

5|$|Once the Space Telescope {{project had}} been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. Marshall <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.|$|E

5|$|Just {{past the}} Capital Beltway, the route {{heads into the}} heart of the city of Greenbelt, having an {{interchange}} with MD193 (Greenbelt Road). The headquarters of the U.S. Park Police, which patrol this portion of the parkway, is located off this exit along MD193. MD193 provides access to College Park, which is home to the College Park Airport, a 1909 airport where the Wright Brothers taught the U.S. Army how to fly an airplane, and the University of Maryland, College Park, a public educational institution established in 1862. At the northern edge of the town, the route has employee-only access to the Goddard <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center, the first NASA <b>space</b> <b>flight</b> center opened in 1958 that contributed majorly to many space missions; from here, the route then enters the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the largest agricultural research center in the world owned by the United States Department of Agriculture.

5|$|Seamans' {{establishment}} of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle {{to be used in}} the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned <b>Space</b> <b>Flight,</b> Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall <b>Space</b> <b>Flight</b> Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Space Center Houston is the {{official}} visitors' center of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.

5|$|The Space Shuttle {{became the}} {{major focus of}} NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a {{frequently}} launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985.
