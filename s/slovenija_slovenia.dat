5000|$|... == Name == Since the {{beginning}} of the 8th century AD (c. 720), Slavic people settled in this area and in the Middle Ages they would have been called Sclavons. In the early 16th century, the Venetian authorities dubbed this border region of their Republic as Schiavonia Veneta, meaning [...] "Venetian Slav-land". The Venetian words Schiavoni and Schiavonia were general terms used for all South Slavic peoples with which they came in direct contact, Slovenes as well as for Croats and Serbs from Dalmatia. In 1884 the local historian Carlo Podrecca named the area Slavia Italiana, as well as Slovene nationalists in 1875 started to use the toponym Beneška <b>Slovenija</b> (Venetian <b>Slovenia)</b> or Benečija (which means Veneto). After World War I, as soon as the Italian kingdom expanded its borders eastwards (including vast slavophone territories in Istria and in the so-called Habsburgic Illyrian kingdom), the region started to be commonly called Slavia Friulana instead of a generic Slavia Italiana.|$|R

Based in the country's capital, Ljubljana, it has regional broadcasting centres in Koper and Maribor and correspondents around Slovenia, Europe and the world. RTV Slovenija's national radio services {{operate under the}} name , while the television division carries the name [...] or [...] The names are sometimes Anglicized as [...] and , respectively.

40|$|Transplantation {{medicine}} {{is a rather}} young medical field. As a method of treatment human organs are used. These organs are donated with the aim to help fellow humans plagued by disease or in desperate situation. First condition for a successful treatment is developing a program that {{will take care of}} procuring the necessary organs. This should be an independent activity which requires appropriate addressing of professional, juridical, organizational and ethical aspects. In 1970, Slovenia started kidney transplantation from living related donors. As long as the transplantation activity covered only kidney transplants of the living donors, all the activities were conducted by nephrologists. Act on removal and transplantation of human body parts for medical purposes issued in 1985, and Rules on detailed medical criteria and the methods for determining occurrence of brain death of the person from whom it is permitted to take body parts for transplantation for treatment in 1986, made it possible to transplant organs from deceased donors. With the transition to deceased donor organs and the possibility of transplanting other organs (heart, liver, lungs, pancreas), it became necessary to organize these activities on national level. In 1992 Extended expert council for transplantation was established. The council planned all the necessary procedures for the construction of National transplantation network, the establishment of 24 -hour coordination and the fastest way of passing of a transplantation law which enabled the establishment of Slovenia-transplant in 2000. After the establishment of 24 -hour central coordination the number of organs procured from deceased donors has increased substantially. Slovenia has reached a similar number of organs obtained from deceased donors per million inhabitants, as member countries of the Eurotransplant association. At the same time the system was safe, reliable, transparent and properly regulated. Slovenia could therefore start negotiations for joining Eurotransplant. Even before the formal establishment of <b>Slovenija</b> Transplant, <b>Slovenia</b> became full member of the association. </span...|$|R
40|$|Nationalism, {{national}} identity and national feeling are definitely alive nowadays. They are still {{an important part of}} temporal world and often they are the source of predjudice, discriminations and intergroup conflicts. On the other hand they must have some functional meaning for individual and society, otherwise we would abandom them. In my diploma I was interested in young people, who found {{national identity}} and belonging important for their lives. I was {{trying to find out what}} meaning the nationality has for them, why is it important for them and how they express their patriotism. However, during the research process some other issues connected with young patriots were exposed, for example masculinity and interwee's opinion about violence. The theoretical introduction presents characteristics of youth period and question of identity, which is in that period very important. It is continued with teoretical aspects of identity, social identity and integroup relationships, which can have both positive (for example solidarity) and negative (for example predjudice and discminations) consequences. The theoretical part is concluded with theorising about nationalism and its different manifestations. In the empirical part I present results of qualitative research, based on six interviews with six young patriots. They are all somehow connected with Tukaj je <b>Slovenija</b> (Here is <b>Slovenia)</b> movement. During my reaserch I discovered that patriotic youth is very heterogenous group and patriotism is very complex phenomena, including different (also subtle) aspects. ...|$|R
