This research had purpose to determine response of seed explant of gaharu by giving different cosentration 2, 4 -D and to measure growth and developtment result of seed explant of gaharu.

Observation made explants fourty two days after planting. The parameter observed were the emergence of callus, callus color and texture of the callus.

40|$|CD 1 d-restricted {{lymphocytes}} {{recognize a}} broad lipid range. However, how CD 1 d-restricted lymphocytes translate T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of lipids with similar group heads into distinct biological responses remains unclear. Using a soluble invariant NKT (iNKT) TCR and a newly engineered antibody specific for alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) -human CD 1 d (hCD 1 d) complexes, we measured the affinity of binding of iNKT TCR to hCD 1 d molecules loaded with {{a panel of}} alpha-GalCer analogues and assessed the rate of dissociation of alpha-GalCer and alpha-GalCer analogues from hCD 1 d molecules. We extended this analysis by studying iNKT cell synapse formation and iNKT cell activation by the same panel of alpha-GalCer analogues. Our results indicate the unique role of the lipid chain occupying the hCD 1 d F' channel in modulating TCR binding affinity to hCD 1 d-lipid complexes, the formation of stable immunological synapse, and cell activation. These data are consistent with previously described conformational changes between empty and loaded hCD 1 d molecules (Koch, M., V. <b>S.</b> Stronge, D. <b>Shepherd,</b> <b>S.</b> D. Gadola, B. Mathew, G. Ritter, A. R. Fersht, G. S. Besra, R. R. Schmidt, E. Y. Jones, and V. Cerundolo. 2005. Nat. Immunol 6 : 819 - 826), suggesting that incomplete occupation of the hCD 1 d F' channel results in conformational differences at the TCR recognition surface. This indirect effect provides a general mechanism by which lipid-specific lymphocytes are capable of recognizing both the group head {{and the length of}} lipid antigens, ensuring greater specificity of antigen recognition...|$|R
40|$|The {{foraging}} behaviour, territory {{size and}} diet of the scalyfin, Parma victoriae, were studied at three sites in South Australia. Two sites were in Ecklonia habitat on an exposed coast, one of them, Site 1, in a marine reserve at West I., and the other, Site 2, in an intensely fished area at The Bluff, Victor Harbor. The third, Site 3, was sheltered, in a fucoid community in Groper Bay, Flinders I., {{in the eastern}} Great Australian Bight. The algal food supply was highest at the reserve site (1), and lowest at the sheltered site (3). The scalyfin spent {{a greater proportion of}} time foraging, and a lower proportion of time sheltering, at the reserve site (1), than at the Bluff site (2). At Site 3, territories were about seven times larger than at the other two sites, and fish spent a higher proportion of time in defence and aggressive interactions than at the other sites. The diet at all sites was predominantly browsed rhodophytes, but at Site 3 the rhodophytes eaten were almost entirely epiphytic on fucoid algae and in low abundance. At the exposed sites (1, 2), where food algae were patchy, scalyfin removed Ecklonia sporophytes experimentally placed in their territories, but not at Site 3, dominated by fucoids. At the exposed sites they employed a saltatory foraging mode, whereas at Site 3 they adopted a cruise search foraging behaviour over their larger territories. Both modes seem optimal in their respective habitats. <b>Shepherd,</b> <b>S.</b> A.; Clark, M. and Ferguson, G. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} brief but {{repeated}} bouts of micro- and hypergravity on cerebrovascular responses to head-up tilt (HUT) {{were examined in}} 13 individuals after (compared to before) parabolic flight. Middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity (MCA MFV; transcranial Doppler ultrasound), eye level blood pressure (BP) and end tidal CO(2) (P(ET) CO(2)) were measured while supine and during 80 degrees HUT for 30 min or until presyncope. In the postflight tests subjects were classified as being orthostatically tolerant (OT) (n = 7) or intolerant (OI) (n = 6). BP was diminished with HUT in the OT group in both tests (p < 0. 05) whereas postflight BP was not different from supine in the OI group. Postflight compared to preflight, the reduction in P(ET) CO(2) with HUT (p < 0. 05) increased in both groups, although significantly so only in the OI group (p < 0. 05). The OI group also had {{a significant decrease in}} supine MCA MFV postflight (p < 0. 05) that was unaccompanied by a change in supine P(ET) CO(2). The decrease in MCA MFV that occurred during HUT in both groups preflight (p < 0. 05) was accentuated only in the OI group postflight, particularly during the final 30 <b>s</b> of <b>HUT</b> (p < 0. 05). However, this accentuated decrease in MCA MFV was not correlated to the greater decrease in P(ET) CO(2) during the same period (R = 0. 20, p = 0. 42). Although cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) also increased in the OI group during the last 30 <b>s</b> of <b>HUT</b> postflight (p < 0. 05), the dynamic autoregulatory gain was not simultaneously changed. Therefore, we conclude that in the OI individuals, parabolic flight was associated with cerebral hypoperfusion following a paradoxical augmentation of CVR by a mechanism that was not related to changes in autoregulation nor strictly to changes in P(ET) CO(2) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} report on {{preliminary}} findings from an ongoing empirical doctoral study examining {{the implications of}} recent change to the way Pro Vice Chancellors (PVCs) are appointed. As {{key members of the}} university top team, PVCs perform a distinctive and vital role as facilitators of the Vice Chancellor’s vision and as catalysts for action (Smith, Adams & Mount 2007). Attracting the best people to these jobs is fundamental to an institution’s effectiveness. Nevertheless, the recruitment and selection of top team members remains a relatively under-researched and under-theorised area of enquiry (Kennie & Woodfield 2008) that warrants further investigation, not least because of an enduring public perception of “leadership deficit” in HE (Watson 2008). Earlier research by the author has established that many pre- 1992 universities are moving away from the traditional internal, fixed-term secondment model of PVC appointment to one of external advertisement, often utilising the services of recruitment consultants (Shepherd 2011 unpublished). This paper presents findings from a census of PVCs in pre- 1992 universities designed to examine the impact of this changed practice on the profile of current post holders. Are they now a more diverse group than hitherto in terms of gender, ethnicity and professional background? Emanating from a practitioner perspective, this study reflects my belief that the role of HE researchers is to undertake work that has ‘real world,’ as well as theoretical, significance. Accordingly, the paper will discuss the practical and policy implications of these findings for the career progression and ambitions of aspiring PVCs and, more broadly, for leadership capacity building in the sector. At a theoretical level, it will consider whether recent developments in PVC appointments can be seen as evidence of managerialism, taken to mean a set of beliefs as well as management practice (Pollitt 1990). Participant feedback will be invited on the significance of findings to date and their role in shaping the future direction of the research. Kennie, T. and Woodfield, S. (2008).
