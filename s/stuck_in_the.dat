5|$|In October 1941, The Christian Science Monitor {{reported}} that Pan Gulf had become <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mud off Governors Island after her crew misjudged {{how far to}} back out of her berth at the Army base there. The first, unsuccessful attempt to free Pan Gulf from her predicament involved eight tugs, but the ship did not budge. The newspaper, which had also {{reported that}} there was no apparent damage to Pan Gulf in the grounding, carried no further reports on the ship.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the regiment supported first the 6th, {{and then the}} 5th Brigades in their attacks on Orsogna, {{as part of the}} Moro River Campaign. The tanks struggled to break into Orsogna and although the infantry made some gains, the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into a stalemate, with a number of back and forth actions as winter set in. These movements saw many of the regiment's tanks become <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sodden ground. Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December and the New Zealanders withdrew from the area on 13 January 1944.|$|E

5|$|On the way, the car gets <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> muddy {{driveway}} in {{the middle}} of farm country. Homer and Marge rush into the nearest barn to avoid a sudden storm. A farmer discovers the barn door is open and suspects trespassers. He enters the barn, nearly catching Homer and Marge, who are hiding in the hay loft, but leaves after failing to locate them. When the coast is clear, Homer and Marge have inspired sexual intercourse in the hay loft.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{damage from}} the storm totaled {{approximately}} $7 million, of which about $4 million {{can be attributed to}} the destruction of crops, notably rice and cotton. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941. The exercise was designed to test US troop training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II. The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mud as a result. Hundreds of military aircraft were forced to move inland for shelter.|$|E
5|$|When Cleomenes {{heard about}} the revolt at Argos, he sent his {{stepfather}} with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resistance. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthmus {{for fear of being}} encircled and left Corinth to {{fall into the hands of}} Antigonus. Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced his way into the city, rescuing the men <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army on the plain outside the city.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> 2007, <b>the</b> {{brothers}} {{spoke to}} director Stephen Hopkins about {{moving forward with}} an adaptation again, but it became <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> development hell. <b>The</b> Lunas were still in talks for an Ultra television project in 2011.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the digital}} {{television}} transition saw the government devise several switchover plans, {{none of which}} <b>stuck.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, <b>the</b> government adopted the same ATSC standard as the United States and sought to end analog television by December 31, 2021. In major markets, particularly in central Mexico and along the US border, digital television stations began to come on air.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, Mafune turned towards {{works of}} comedy, {{starting}} with Nakahashi kokan (“Nakahashi Household”, 1948), about a Japanese family <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> China after <b>the</b> {{end of the}} war. He also became very active in creating scripts for radio dramas.|$|R
5|$|A family {{goes to a}} {{hotel with}} their gran, (which would have been played by Helen Mirren.) Gran hates the family {{so much that she}} wants them to {{disappear}} as they then do. She's <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hotel until the Doctor appears in a lift. Russell T Davies thought of this idea to pick for a potential Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} Native American groups {{inhabited}} {{the area from}} as early as 7000BC, most recently the Timbisha around 1000AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European-Americans that became <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the gold fields of California gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable ore to be mined was borax, which was transported out of the valley with twenty-mule teams. The valley later {{became the subject of}} books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism blossomed in the 1920s, when resorts were built around Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Adult Swim aired a {{night of}} {{unfinished}} sneak peeks, pilots and stealth episode premieres of future upcoming shows in place of its regularly scheduled programming, featuring Fat Guy <b>Stuck</b> <b>in</b> Internet, <b>The</b> Venture Bros., Delocated, Superjail!, Young Person's Guide to History, Metalocalypse, Robot Chicken, and Moral Orel. The repeat block did air the scheduled ATHF movie, with bumps teasing the viewer about missing the premieres.|$|R
50|$|Hudson Heights is {{generally}} considered to extend as far east as Broadway, although others shrink it to the blocks between Fort Washington Avenue and the Hudson River.

5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May a valve in Ises No. 2 engine room <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open position and flooded the engine room. While under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time}} that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E

25|$|Instead of bow {{thrusters}} {{the ships}} {{are equipped with}} Wärtsilä Air Bubbling System (WABS). Pressurized air released from nozzles located below the waterline lubricates the hull and, by reducing friction between steel and ice, improves the ship's ability to operate in difficult ice conditions such as pressure ridges and {{reduces the risk of}} becoming <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> ice. <b>The</b> system {{can also be used to}} steer the ship at low speeds.|$|R
5|$|Hudner begged {{superiors}} {{to allow}} him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown, but he was not allowed, as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting in additional casualties. In order to prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands, the U.S. Navy bombed the crash site with napalm two days later, reciting the Lord's Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown's body consumed by flames. The pilots observed that his body looked to have been disturbed and his clothes stolen, but he was still <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered. Brown was the first African American U.S. Navy officer killed in the war.|$|E

5|$|Northumberland {{failed to}} engage, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what {{came to be known as}} Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.|$|E

5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mud and then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Only Phoronis ovalis {{naturally}} builds colonies by budding or by splitting into top {{and bottom}} sections which then grow into full bodies. In experiments, other species have split successfully, but only when both parts have enough gonadal (reproductive) tissue. All phoronids breed sexually from spring to autumn. Some species are hermaphroditic (have {{both male and female}} reproductive organs) but cross-fertilize (fertilize the eggs of other members), while others are dioecious (have separate sexes). The gametes (sperms and ova) are produced in the swollen gonads, around the stomach. The gametes swim through the metacoelom to the metanephridia. Sperm exit by the nephridiopores and some are captured by the lophophores of individuals of the same species. Species that lay small fertilized eggs release them into the water as plankton, while species with larger eggs brood them either in the body's tube or <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the lophophore by adhesive. The brooded eggs are released to feed on plankton when they develop into larvae.|$|E
5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E
