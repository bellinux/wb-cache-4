In the present, BSAA head Clive R. O'Brian sends out BSAA agents Jill Valentine and Parker to search for BSAA agents Chris Redfield and Jessica at their last known location, the cruise ship Queen Zenobia in the Mediterranean Sea.

The ninth main installment of the Resident Evil series, it was first released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 2 October 2012, and for Microsoft Windows on 22 March 2013. It was re-released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with all downloadable content on 29 March 2016. The story is told {{from the perspectives of}} Chris Redfield, a former member and founder of the Bio-terrorism <b>Security</b> <b>Assessment</b> Alliance (BSAA) traumatised by a failed operation; Leon S. Kennedy, a Raccoon City survivor and agent for the US government; Jake Muller, an illegitimate son of Albert Wesker and associate of Sherry Birkin; and Ada Wong, a freelance agent framed for the bio-terrorist attacks by the antagonistic corporation Neo-Umbrella. They must all confront the force behind a massive bio-terrorist attack with the newly developed C-virus in cities across the world. Gameplay is centred around their four interwoven storylines, in which each player-character has unique abilities and styles.|$|E
5|$|Alomar {{made her}} {{first and only}} {{appearance}} in Resident Evil 5. According to the character's backstory, her parents {{died when she was}} eight years old in an apparent factory accident and she was taken in by her uncle. Eventually, Alomar ran away and was found by a truck driver who was part of a rebel militia group. She later joined the group and soon learned that the factory accident her parents had died in was actually a test of a bio-organic weapon (BOW) by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. With the help of the local government, Umbrella destroyed Alomar's village and its inhabitants after the test was complete. When Alomar was 15, she was contacted by U.S. operatives to sabotage Umbrella's attempt to sell a BOW. With Alomar's help, the deal was stopped and she was offered a chance {{to start a new life}} in America. Alomar accepted, was speaking fluent English within months and enrolled at a university two years later. After graduation, her benefactor recruited her to join the Bioterrorism <b>Security</b> <b>Assessment</b> Alliance (BSAA). While Umbrella had dissolved years before this, Alomar's hatred of Umbrella and others like them led her to join. She was assigned to a unit for eight months of training, in which she excelled and was chosen to become an agent assigned to the BSAA's West African department. When BSAA agent Chris Redfield is sent to intercept a black market BOW sale in the fictional African country Kijuju, Alomar is assigned to be his partner and guide.|$|E
