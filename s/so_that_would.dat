25|$|The plan as at early 1982 was for all 54 {{carriages}} (not yet 57) to be {{in service}} {{by the end of}} 1983, running services to Warrnambool, Horsham, Shepparton, Geelong and some Bendigo services. All other services were to be provided by the existing S, Z and airconditioned E carriages, plus interurban Comeng type trains running to Traralgon. All carriages were to be formed into semi-fixed 3 or 4-car sets, with schedules built around standard consists to keep runs fast and simple. Additionally, all sets were to include only one conductor/guard van, rather than one each end, to maximise capacity for length and weight of each train set. The roster at the time worked with fourteen interurban trains (plus four on the electrified eastern region), <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow enough N sets spare and in rostered maintenance.|$|E

Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil {{would sit in}} the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got along very well and had a nice rapport… But he had his way of working that was very slow, and the Ramones had their way of working which was very fast. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E

Leakey turned to fellow conservationist Kuki Gallmann, who described their discussions and experiments in her memoir I Dreamed of Africa. She asked Hollywood special effects professional Robin Hollister what he would recommend, and introduced him to Leakey. Hollister understood Leakey's intention to create a spectacle, and the importance of producing an immediate dramatic flare-up. He suggested a combination of flammable glue to coat the tusks, and a hidden system of pipes to spray them with fuel. His plans were adopted, and when the Kenyan President held a torch to the waiting pile, [...] "Flames flared up in a scalding blaze. [...] The ivory blackened and started burning, crackling.

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{completing}} {{the program in}} 1967 he entered active duty in the United States Army, serving in the Vietnam War during its height until 1969. Davis saw time on the battlefield during his time in Vietnam. Davis returned home as a captain with a Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service. Friends who knew {{him at the time}} said Davis—like many war veterans—came back a changed man, interested in politics and more intense, according to the Sacramento Bee. He returned from Vietnam more [...] "serious and directed." [...] Davis was surprised to discover that many of those serving in Vietnam were Latinos, African Americans and southern whites with very few from schools like Stanford and Columbia; Davis believed that the burden of the war should be felt equally and he resolved early on to go about changing America <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> change.

Woods said, [...] "She's fun to play, I love Deb Scott, she's a well-rounded character. I can't say I'm {{a lot like}} her, but I think our desires are the same. I {{think we want to}} be career women and good moms– I hope I'm a bit more {{successful}} than she is." [...] Explaining their differences, Woods added, [...] "I've never done any drugs in my whole life, I've never even smoked a cigarette– that's where I'd start– lay off the drugs. I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. <b>So,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be a good start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband." [...] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him. Deb battles an addiction to pills in season 2 and again in season 4, but overcomes it permanently the second time.|$|E
2500|$|An {{official}} {{close to}} the presidency said the dilution of Mugabe's powers promised in the agreement was [...] "illusory", and described the MDC as merely a [...] "junior partner" [...] whose only role would be [...] "to gain legitimacy and international funds". ZANU-PF planned to take the ministries of defence, justice, home affairs, farming, information, and mines. The mining sector is the last occasionally functioning {{part of the economy}} given the country's wealth of natural resources and this carries huge opportunities for corruption. The MDC would be offered the finance ministry, in an effort to persuade donors that real reform was taking place <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> trigger billions in aid and reconstruction. The presidential official said [...] "It's a tricky situation for the MDC...Nonetheless we now have the opposition in government and they have to fix the economy, just as they told the electorate." [...] A ministerial post involving kick starting foreign aid is seen by some as a poison chalice for the MDC. If the party were to succeed it would help shore up support for the ZANU-PF and make it harder to oust in the future, while a failure would cause the MDC to be branded as incompetent and would undermine its own support. MDC officials were said {{to be aware of the}} risk of being manipulated and refused to sign up for a ministry that lacks real authority. According to an MDC spokesman, [...] "It would appear that Zanu-PF does not understand power-sharing. We are still poles apart, with them insisting on taking all the key ministries, literally rendering the (opposition) peripheral in government – in fact, a situation where we would be in but out of government." ...|$|E

Such were the ideas which presented themselves to him as hour after hour {{he sat in the}} book-room with his eyes fixed on the volume of Jeremy Taylor's sermons. He had done nothing wrong,--so he told himself,--had not even coveted anything that did not belong to him. It was in accordance with his uncle's expressed desire that he had come to Llanfeare, and been introduced to the tenants as their future landlord, and had taken upon himself the place of the heir.

60|$|Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball {{as big as}} your fist, {{which had}} been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, {{and he used to}} do magic with it.

It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> tell on it every time.

He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.|$|E
60|$|Pepton first {{hung his}} bow in the hall, {{but after he}} had {{arranged}} it symmetrically upon two long nails (bound with green worsted, lest they should scratch the bow through its woollen cover), he reflected that the front door would frequently be open, and that damp drafts must often go through the hall. He was sorry to give up this place for his bow, for it was convenient and appropriate, {{and for an instant}} he thought that it might remain, if the front door could be kept shut, and visitors admitted through a little side door which the family generally used, and which was almost as convenient as the other--except, indeed, on wash-days, when a wet sheet or some article of wearing apparel was apt to be hung in front of it. But although wash-day occurred but once a week, and although it was comparatively easy, after a little practice, to bob under a high-propped sheet, Pepton's heart was too kind to allow his mind to dwell upon this plan. So he drew the nails from the wall of the hall, and put them up in various places about the house. His own room had to be aired a great deal in all weathers, and <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not do at all. The wall above the kitchen fireplace would be a good location, for the chimney was nearly always warm. But Pepton could not bring himself to keep his bow in the kitchen. There would be nothing esthetic about such a disposition of it, and, besides, the girl might be tempted to string and bend it. The old ladies really did not want it in the parlor, for its length and its green baize cover would make it an encroaching and unbecoming neighbor to the little engravings and the big samplers, the picture-frames of acorns and pine-cones, the fancifully patterned ornaments of clean wheat straw, and all the quaint adornments which had hung upon those walls for so many years. But they did not say so. If it had been necessary, {{to make room for the}} bow, they would have taken down the pencilled profiles of their grandfather, their grandmother, and their father when a little boy, which hung in a row over the mantelpiece.|$|E
