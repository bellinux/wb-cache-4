25|$|US {{regulations}} require large North American {{vehicles to}} {{be equipped with}} left and right amber <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> and reflectors mounted midway between {{the front and rear}} side markers.|$|E
25|$|Pontiacs {{built in}} the late 1960s {{conformed}} to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as steering columns, steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, shoulder belts, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> and headrests.|$|E
25|$|Like all 1968 {{passenger}} vehicles {{sold in the}} United States, GTOs now featured front outboard shoulder belts (cars built after January 1, 1968) and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b> To comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards, the GTO was now equipped with emissions controls.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Festiva {{continued to be}} sold in Australia until 2000 when it {{was replaced by the}} Ford Ka. Australian second-generation Festivas have U.S. <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> cut-outs {{on each side of the}} vehicle (driver-side and passenger-side) at the front and rear. Instead of housing orange reflectors/lights at the front sides and red reflectors/lights at the rear sides, there are non-lit orange reflectors at all four locations. These redundant reflectors, coupled with the orange side indicator repeater (which is not required in the U.S., and was not included on the Aspire) make for a unique side profile.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968: As federal {{regulations}} required all automotive manufacturers to add <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> reflectors or <b>lights,</b> Ford redesigned the hood emblems to incorporate reflectors {{as well as}} added reflectors {{to the rear of}} the bed. Interior fittings changed due to new safety standards. New versions of the FE-Series engine added (360 truck and 390). First year of factory-installed air-conditioning (previously, air-conditioning was dealer-installed).|$|R
5000|$|The European (E-spec) and Asian (JDM) models {{had many}} {{differences}} versus the North American (A-spec) models. These include: raised turn signal <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> vs the A-Spec flush mounted <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> small fog <b>lights</b> with silver bezels vs the A-Spec full fitting fog lights, different interior cloth patterns, projector headlamps (glass lenses), a 1.8-liter FP engine, and a hatchback model. Europe {{also received a}} diesel-engined version, using the [...] "Comprex" [...] pressure-wave supercharged RF engine seen in the previous generation JDM Capella. Power in Europe is [...] ECE at 4000 rpm, while the Japanese model claims [...] JIS at the same engine speed.|$|R
25|$|In 1966, Cadillac had {{its best}} annual sales yet, over 192,000 units (142,190 of them de Villes), an {{increase}} of more than 60%. This was exceeded in 1968, when Cadillac topped 200,000 units for the first time. 1967 and 1968 saw {{the introduction of a}} host of federally mandated safety features, including energy-absorbing steering columns and wheels, soft interior and instrument panel knobs and surfaces, front shoulder belts, and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Aura {{was a new}} styling {{direction}} for Saturn, with styling that resembled its cousin, the European Opel Vectra. All Aura models came standard with folding side mirrors and <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> lending to its European stylings. The design of the Aura Special appearance pieces included an integrated radio antenna in the rear window, a chrome appearance package available on XR models, standard 17inch wheels with five-spoke wheel covers and P225/50R17 all-season tires on XE models, and standard 18inch machined aluminum 14-spoke wheels on the XR with high-performance Goodyear Eagle LS2 P225/50R18 T tires.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, cars must be {{equipped}} with side-mounted turn signal repeaters to make the turn indication visible laterally (i.e. {{to the sides of}} the vehicle) rather than just to the front and rear of the vehicle. These are permitted, but not required in the US. As an alternative in both the United States and Canada, the front amber <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> may be wired to flash with the turn signals, but this also is not mandatory. In recent years, many automakers have been incorporating side turn signal devices into the side view mirror housings, rather than mounting them on the vehicle's fenders. Some evidence suggests these mirror-mounted turn signals may be more effective than fender-mounted items.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, federal {{regulations}} required all automotive manufacturers to add <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> reflectors or <b>lights,</b> which Ford {{was able to}} add to the new cowl insignia used on the F-Series since 1967. That same year, Ford decided to add this insignia on the doors of the C-Series, as well. Unlike the Ford F-Series, which removed them for 1973, the C-Series would retain them until the end of production in 1990. After 1972, the Canadian Mercury version of the C-Series was discontinued, becoming the last Mercury truck until the 1993 Mercury Villager.|$|R
2500|$|Differences {{between the}} North American Camry and the Scepter were few. While the North American {{versions}} received a revised V6 engine (1MZ-FE) in 1993, the Scepter {{used the same}} 3VZ-FE V6 over the entire model cycle. The Scepter headlamps were a wraparound design (1992–1994 models), utilising a dual-filament bulb along with integrated fog lights. Unlike the North American Camry, the 1992–1994 model taillamps did not include red reflectors or <b>side</b> <b>markers.</b> The Scepter also included an updated climate control unit with an LCD display in some models. Other differences include the [...] "Scepter" [...] trunk garnish, fender <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> some options, and interior trim.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of small amber lamps mounted near {{the front and rear}} on each side of a passenger car-so called <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps-on visual detection and recognition of passenger cars in complex nighttime environments. It was determined whether cars equipped with <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps are detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than cars without <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps. Subjects were presented with slides of natural nighttime scenes in which a car, either with or without <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps, viewed from its side, approaching from a side street, was either present or not. Subjects determined as fast as possible whether a car was present or not. Reaction time measures (speed and accuracy) indicated that both under clear and fog visibility conditions, a car equipped with <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps was detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than a car without <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps. The results indicate that <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps increase both lateral conspicuity and recognizability suggesting that <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps may be effective i...|$|R
25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights)</b> to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|E
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
2500|$|Regular Chevelle engines {{started with}} a [...] Turbo-Thrift six or the new [...] Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a [...] version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual {{transmission}} cars got GM's [...] "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" [...] smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.|$|E
50|$|Originally, a {{permanently}} illuminated white <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> {{was positioned}} beneath the main colour light head {{in lieu of}} the red <b>marker</b> <b>light.</b> The caution turnout indication was a single yellow in the main head over three white lights at an angle of 45 degrees. The red <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was introduced from 1965. The majority of early single light colour light signals had either been replaced or retrofitted with red <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> by 2000.|$|R
50|$|Two {{headlights}} {{are mounted}} {{at the top}} of the car in the centre on driver's cab ends. There are no <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> at the front; however, there are red <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> for the rear located on the upper corners.|$|R
50|$|While Norfolk Southern {{removed the}} <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> from the 17 SD80MACs they {{acquired}} during the Conrail split, CSX did not remove {{them from their}} 12 units. Norfolk Southern has removed the red <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> from the former CSX SD80MACs.|$|R
2500|$|... "Front {{position}} lamps", {{known as}} [...] "parking lamps" [...] or [...] "parking lights" [...] in the US, Canada and Australia and [...] "front sidelights" [...] in the UK provide nighttime standing-vehicle conspicuity. They {{were designed to}} use little electricity, {{so they could be}} left on for periods of time while parked. Despite the UK term, these {{are not the same as}} the <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> described below.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{incorporated}} several safety innovations including interior windshield posts {{that were}} [...] "the first industry use of fiberglass safety padding", and the flush-mounted paddle-style door handles. To comply with National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety standards there were exterior <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> and three-point seat belts and headrests {{for the front}} seats, while the interior was devoid of bright trim to help reduce glare.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{also used}} 1968 Chargers (which {{shared the same}} sheet metal) by {{changing}} the grille and taillight panel to the 1969 style, and removing the round <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights.</b> These Chargers performed many record-breaking jumps throughout the show, {{almost all of them}} resulting in a completely destroyed car. [...] The 1970 Chargers were modified by removing the chrome bumper and changing the taillights.|$|E

2500|$|The 1968 models {{featured}} additional safety features, including <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> {{and shoulder}} belts on cars built after December 1, 1967. The 1967 model's large {{steering wheel hub}} {{was replaced by a}} soft [...] "bar" [...] spoke that ran though the diameter of the wheel (and like the 1967 style, was used throughout the Ford Motor Company line). A plastic horn ring was also featured.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 Oldsmobile {{continued}} to produce five well appointed 98 body styles. Standard equipment included: dual master cylinder, four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up lights, <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> seat belts, cross-flow radiator, rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, electric clock, special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, carpeted trunk and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14inches. Engine displacement was increased to the Rocket [...] V8 with 365 horsepower. Ninety-Eight production was in Lansing.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1968 model, the {{horizontal}} division bar {{was removed from}} the grille. A fine cross hatched insert was framed by a segmented chrome surround. Model nameplates were moved from the rear fender to the front fender. The , [...] V8 was a Valiant option for the first time. [...] All North American Chrysler products got front and rear <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights,</b> amber in front, red in the rear. [...] These were round in shape, surrounded by an attractive chrome bezel. [...] Valiants built after January 1, 1968, also got new front shoulder belts as standard.|$|E

25|$|In the US, amber {{front and}} red rear <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> lamps and retroreflectors are required. The law {{initially}} required lights or retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1968. This was amended to require lights and retroreflectors on vehicles made after 1 January 1970. These side-facing devices make the vehicle's presence, position {{and direction of}} travel clearly visible from oblique angles. The lights are wired so as to illuminate whenever the vehicles' parking and taillamps are on, including when the headlamps are being used. Front amber <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> in the United States may be wired so as to flash in synchronous phase or opposite-phase with the turn signals, but {{are not required to}} flash at all. <b>Side</b> <b>markers</b> are permitted but not required on cars and light passenger vehicles outside the US and Canada. If installed, they are required to be brighter and visible through a larger horizontal angle than US <b>side</b> <b>markers,</b> may flash only in synchronous phase with the turn signals (but are not required to flash), and they must be amber at the front and rear, except rear <b>side</b> <b>markers</b> may be red if they are grouped, combined, or reciprocally incorporated with another rear lighting function that is required to be red.|$|R
2500|$|Styling was all new for the 1968 Fairlane/Torino, {{and it was}} {{drastically}} {{changed from}} the 1967 models. The new intermediate had grown in size and weight, and a new fastback model was added. The front fascia featured a full width recessed grille, with horizontal quad headlights placed at the outer edges. Horizontal dividing bars were featured in the grille depending on the model. Parking lights were placed at {{the outer edge of}} the front fenders and wrapped around the corner to also act as <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> (a new requirement in 1968). The body sides were smooth with one horizontal body crease running just below the beltline from front to back. The taillights were rectangular in shape and vertically situated in the rear panel above [...] rear bumper. Reverse lights were located in the middle of the taillights, and small <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> were located on the rear edge of the quarter panel. Fastback models, which Ford called [...] "SportsRoof," [...] featured a slightly concaved rear taillight panel unique to that body style. The new SportsRoof body style featured a gently sloped long roof line that extended to the edge of the trunk lid. This new fastback body style gave the Fairlane and the Torino excellent aerodynamics that would later prove to be advantageous on the race track.|$|E
2500|$|... 1968 models had {{reshaped}} loop-type bumpers {{that surrounded}} both the vehicle's recessed crosshatch front grille and tail lamps. Hidden wiper arms made their debut. Federally mandated <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> appeared, as inverted trapezoids {{on the lower}} leading edges of the front fenders, and circular in the rear. The interior was restyled {{and for the first}} time shared its instrument panel with the other full-size Buick models. Shoulder belts for front outboard occupants were made standard on all cars built from January 1, 1968. [...] Mechanically, the transmission lost its variable pitch torque converter. A tilt steering wheel was standard. Sales set another new record in 1968, as 49,284 units were sold.|$|E
2500|$|Turn {{signals are}} {{required}} to blink on and off, or [...] "flash", at a steady rate of between 60 and 120 blinks per minute (1–2Hz). International UN Regulations require that all turn signals flash in simultaneous phase; US regulations permit <b>side</b> <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> wired for side turn signal functionality to flash in opposite-phase. An audio and/or visual tell-tale indicator is required, to advise the driver when the turn signals are activated and operating. This usually {{takes the form of}} one or two green indicator lights on the vehicle's instrument cluster, and a cyclical [...] "tick-tock" [...] noise generated electromechanically or electronically. It is also required that the vehicle operator be alerted by much faster- or slower-than-normal flashing in the event a turn signal light fails.|$|E
