40|$|Objectives: Treating a carious tooth in {{children}} with high caries experience by providing a restoration does not cure the disease. If the unfavorable oral environment that caused the cavity persists so will the disease and more restorations will be required in future. Treating the oral infection by {{reducing the number of}} cariogenic microorganisms and establishing a favorable oral environment to promote predominantly remineralization of tooth structure over time will stop the caries process. The present study was conducted: (1) To evaluate the efficacy of povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> on plaque Streptococcus mutans when used as an adjunct to restoration. (2) To compare the anti-microbial effect of 1 &#x 0025; povidone-iodine and 0. 2 &#x 0025; chlorhexidine <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> on plaque S. mutans count. Study Design: Forty-five study participants in the age group of 6 - 12 years with dmft (decay component) of three or four were selected from one government school in Bangalore city.

Materials and methods: Samples of the tongues from 10 subjects with and 10 subjects without halitosis were inoculated on blood agar plates. The agar was perforated, and the cylindrical holes were filled either with <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> MR 1 or with <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> MR 2. After incubation, inhibition zones of the whole tongue microbiota and Fusobacterium nucleatum were measured. In addition, MR 1 and MR 2 were applied in a short interval killing test (SIKT) on four oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, F. nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Total viable cell counts were made after two minutes of incubation with increasing concentrations of MR 1 and MR 2.

40|$|Introduction: C. tropicalis and C. krusei {{have emerged}} as virulent species causing oral infections. Both have {{developed}} resistance to commonly prescribed azole antifungal agents. Objective: The study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> containing chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and their combination (CHX-CPC) on the growth of these strains. Methods: The minimal inhibition concentrations (MIC) of the <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> were determined. The growth curves of the strains produced under the mouth rinse-treated and untreated conditions, as well as alterations to the morphology of the growth colonies and cells following the treatments were compared and analysed. Results: The MICs of CPC compared to CHX <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> were found to be lower for both Candida sp. In the mixed formulation, CPC doubled the inhibitory effect of CHX towards both Candida sp., while CHX quadrupled the activity of CPC towards C. tropicalis. The growth colonies also appeared coarse, wrinkled and dried. Conclusion: The profound effects shown may suggest the fungicidal activities of the <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> incorporated with CHX, CPC or their combination on both C. tropicalis and C. krusei. Gargling using <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> with such fungicidal activity would enhance a rapid reduction in the candidal population of patients with fungal infection...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a tin-containing fluoride (Sn/F) <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> on microtensile bond strength (μTBS) between resin composite and erosively demineralised dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS Dentin of 120 human molars was erosively demineralised using a 10 -day cyclic de- and remineralisation model. For 40 molars, the model comprised erosive demineralisation only; for another 40, the model included treatment with a NaF solution; and for yet another 40, the model included treatment with a Sn/F <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse.</b> In half of these molars (n[*]=[*] 20), the demineralised organic matrix was continuously removed by collagenase. Silicon carbide paper-ground, non-erosively demineralised molars served as control (n[*]=[*] 20). Subsequently, μTBS of Clearfil SE/Filtek Z 250 to the dentin was measured, and failure mode was determined. Additionally, surfaces were evaluated using SEM and EDX. RESULTS Compared to the non-erosively demineralised control, erosive demineralisation resulted in significantly lower μTBS regardless of the removal of demineralised organic matrix. Treatment with NaF increased μTBS, but the level of μTBS obtained by the non-erosively demineralised control was only reached when the demineralised organic matrix had been removed. The Sn/F <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> together with removal of demineralised organic matrix led to significantly higher µTBS than did the non-erosively demineralised control. The Sn/F <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> yielded higher μTBS than did the NaF solution. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of erosively demineralised dentin with a NaF solution or a Sn/F <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> increased the bond strength of resin composite.

40|$|It is {{presently}} {{unclear whether the}} reported ergogenic effect of a carbohydrate (CHO) <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> on cycling time-trial performance {{is affected by the}} acute nutritional status of an individual. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of a CHO <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> on a 60 -min simulated cycling time-trial performance commenced in a fed or fasted state. Twelve competitive male cyclists each completed 4 experimental trials using a double-blinded Latin square design. Two trials were commenced 2 h after a meal that contained 2. 5 g·kg- 1 body mass of CHO (FED) and 2 after an overnight fast (FST). Prior to and after every 12. 5 % of total time during a performance ride, either a 10 % maltodextrin (CHO) or a taste-matched placebo (PLB) solution was <b>mouth</b> <b>rinsed</b> for 10 s then immediately expectorated. There were significant main effects for both pre-ride nutritional status (FED vs. FST; p < 0. 01) and CHO <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> (CHO vs. PLB; p < 0. 01) on power output with an interaction evident between the interventions (p < 0. 05).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This double-blind, 6 -month, parallel group, positively controlled study involved 151 subjects balanced and randomly assigned to either positive control (EO) or experimental (CPC) <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> treatment groups. At baseline, subjects received a dental prophylaxis procedure and began unsupervised rinsing twice a day with 20 ml of their assigned mouthwash for 30 s after brushing their teeth for 1 min. Subjects were assessed for gingivitis and gingival bleeding by the Gingival index (GI) of Löe; Silness (1963) and plaque by the Silness; Löe (1964) Plaque index at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of rinsing. At 3 and 6 months, oral soft tissue health was assessed. Microbiological samples were also taken for community profiling by the DNA checkerboard method. RESULTS: Results show that after 3 and 6 months of rinsing, {{there were no significant}} differences (p= 0. 05) between the experimental (CPC) and the positive control <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> treatment groups for overall gingivitis status, gingival bleeding, and plaque accumulation. At 6 months, the covariant (baseline) adjusted mean GI and bleeding sites percentages for the CPC and the EO rinses were 0. 52 and 0. 53 and 8. 7 and 9. 3, respectively. Both <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> were well tolerated by the subjects. Microbiological community profiles were similar for the two treatment groups. Statistically, a significant greater reduction in bleeding sites was observed for the CPC rinse versus the EO rinse.

40|$|Context: Mouthrinses are used, {{by many of}} our patients, as a {{complement}} to daily dental hygiene routine. The use of a toothbrush and an interproximal cleaning method {{may not be enough}} to control dental plaque. Essential oils and delmopinol <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> are effective for the prevention of dental caries and gingivitis. To study the effect of an essential oil and a delmopinol <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> on dental plaque bacteria, an in vitro study was developed. Aims: The objective of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of an essential oil and a delmopinol <b>mouth</b> <b>rinse</b> on Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacilli, and aerobic and anaerobic dental plaque nonspecific bacteria. Design: Samples of human dental plaque were collected from consenting participants and bacteria isolated. Disk-diffusion tests were performed to obtain the minimum concentration of the <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> necessary to inhibit bacterial growth. The ability of the commercial <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> to inhibit bacterial growth was studied in comparison to a positive control (0. 2 % chlorhexidine) and a negative laboratorial control (sterilized water). Results: The minimum inhibitory concentration was found to be inferior to the commercial essential oils and delmopinol <b>mouth</b> <b>rinses</b> concentrations. Delmopinol and essential oils have significant antibacterial properties shown in vitro only for aerobic bacteria, and for S. mutans, Lactobacillus, and anaerobic bacteria, the results were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Essential oils and chlorhexidine are statistically similar and better than delmopinol for aerobic bacteria growth inhibition. For the other bacteria, essential oils and delmopinol are not statistically promising.
