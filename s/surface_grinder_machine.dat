50|$|Capacitive {{displacement}} sensors {{are often}} used in metrology applications. In many cases, sensors are used “to measure shape errors in the part being produced. But they also can measure the errors arising in the equipment used to manufacture the part, a practice known as machine tool metrology”. In many cases, the sensors are used to analyze and optimize the rotation of spindles in various machine tools, examples include <b>surface</b> <b>grinders,</b> lathes, milling <b>machines,</b> and air bearing spindles. By measuring errors in the machines themselves, rather than simply measuring errors in the final products, problems {{can be dealt with}} and fixed earlier in the manufacturing process.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>grinder,</b> {{which has}} a head that is lowered to a workpiece, which is moved back and forth under the {{grinding}} wheel on a table that typically has a controllable permanent magnet (magnetic chuck) for use with magnetic stock (especially ferrous stock) but can have a vacuum chuck or other fixturing means. The most common <b>surface</b> <b>grinders</b> have a grinding wheel rotating on a horizontal axis cutting around the circumference of the grinding wheel. Rotary <b>surface</b> <b>grinders,</b> commonly known as [...] "Blanchard" [...] style grinders, have a grinding head which rotates the grinding wheel on a vertical axis cutting on the end face of the grinding wheel, while a table rotates the workpiece {{in the opposite direction}} underneath.

40|$|Background: Human {{error is}} the most {{important}} cause of occupational and non-occupational accidents. Because, it seems necessary to identify, predict and analyze human errors, and also offer appropriate control strategies to reduce errors which cause adverse consequences, the present study was carried out with the aim of identifying human errors while operating meat grinder and offer suggestions in order to reduce human errors in this human-machine system. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive study. In this ergonomic study the “Task Analysis for Error Identification (TAFEI) ” technique was used in order to identify human errors while operating a meat <b>grinder</b> <b>machine.</b> According to this technique, firstly, tasks of human side of the interaction were described by Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and then the State-Space Diagrams (SSDs) were drawn. Finally, after forming the TAFEI diagrams, the transition matrix table was prepared in order to identify human errors. Results: After completing all the steps of TAFEI technique, the transition matrix table was formed. Results showed 49 illegal transition states; therefore, 49 human errors were identified and described while operating the meat <b>grinder</b> <b>machine.</b> Conclusion: The results of this study showed how and under which conditions may meat grinder users do error in the human-machine interaction. In this regard, possible human errors resulting from non-ergonomic design of Iranian meat <b>grinder</b> <b>machine</b> were identified...|$|R

40|$|The general {{error model}} of high {{precision}} <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> is presented by using rigid body kinematics theory and coordinate transformation. To meet the machining requirement of large axisymmetry aspheric lens, the grating parallel grinding method is adopted. Considering high precision <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> {{structure and the}} main error factors affect the machining accuracy of large aspheric, a large axisymmetric aspheric error model is proposed, {{which can be used}} to predict surface accuracy and compensation grinding. The main error factors are discussed and it is shown that the straightness error, positioning error and arc radii error are main errors that effect surface error distribution, meanwhile, surface error value is the mixed result of each individual error. The experiments are carried out and in agreement with the theoretical results. The grinding experiment shows that the model can well predict surface accuracy and surface accuracy is improved after compensation grinding. ? 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|R

40|$|ELID-grinding of cermets {{has been}} carried out on a {{retrofitted}} Jung <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> with different cast iron-bonded (CIB) diamond wheels. In case of rough grinding, with a wheel of 46 µm abrasives, ELID-grinding is preferable compared to grinding with a conventional resin-bonded wheel or a CIB wheel without ELID. Resin-bonded wheels are characterized by low G-ratios and are prone to chattering effects. Metal-bonded wheels are very durable, and especially for avoiding glazing effects during longer grinding cycles, ELID-grinding is the best choice. The maximal MRR in ‘ELID-roughing’ on the used <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> is measured to be 1 mm³/s, leading to a roughness of about 0. 4 µm Ra. The ‘ELID-finishing’ steps are implemented on the same grinding machine, so the workpiece {{does not need to be}} dismounted. Several sets of experiments based on the Design of Experiments method show that lower axial feeds and higher duty ratios of the power supply improve the surface quality effectively. With the wheel of 10 µm grit size, chattering can be avoided by limiting the theoretical MRR to 0. 05 mm³/s. To obtain a final Sa roughness below 10 nm, the last finishing wheel should remove less than 0. 3 10 - 3 mm³/s. The total processing time of the finishing steps is less than 30 minutes for a workpiece area of 375 mm³. status: publishe...|$|R
