40|$|This {{submission}} provides {{legal evidence}} in support of a positive evaluation of <b>Scotland’s</b> EU membership, {{in the form of an}} assessment of the EU’s regime for sustainable agriculture and an assessment of the possible impacts of ‘Brexit’ on the agro environment.

However, with farmers acting as custodians to around 80 % of <b>Scotland’s</b> land surface, their management decisions are of great significance to the state and future of <b>Scotland’s</b> natural heritage. Questions regarding the role of law in fostering and impeding agro environmental stewardship should thus be a part of <b>Scotland’s</b> debates on Brexit and its impacts...|$|R

40|$|This paper applies <b>Scotland’s</b> health {{allocation}} formula to Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England, Health Boards in Wales, and Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland {{in order to}} assess the relative health care expenditure needs of the countries. According to the Scottish formula, England’s per capita health care expenditure need is around 10 % lower than <b>Scotland’s,</b> while Wales’ per capita expenditure need is around 2 % lower than <b>Scotland’s,</b> and Northern Ireland’s is around 7 % lower than <b>Scotland’s.</b> <b>Scotland’s</b> relative expenditure need over England is largely a function of higher rates of mortality and long-term illness, rather than its relative sparsity. Northern Ireland’s relatively lower need is largely due to it having a relatively young population. We also compare the results of <b>Scotland’s</b> {{allocation formula}} with the equivalent English formula and find that the two approaches differ in their view of what constitutes an equitable distribution of resources between PCTs...|$|R
