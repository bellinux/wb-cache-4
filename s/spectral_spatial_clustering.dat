40|$|In {{this work}} we develop {{semi-automatic}} road extraction system for updating and storage road network data bases. Combination {{of some of}} the existing road extraction techniques such as <b>spectral</b> and <b>spatial</b> data <b>clustering,</b> morphological functions and graph theory is used in this proposed system. Input data of the proposed road extraction system are multi-spectral and pan-sharpened IKONOS images of Lavasan city in Iran (with respectively 4 and 1 meters spatial resolution). The proposed system investigates capability and amount of system success in extraction of different shaped roads such as straight, spiral, junction and square. In the proposed method, primarily the input image is spectrally classified by use of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering technique and road class binary image is obtained by definition of threshold value. Afterwards, quality of detected road features is improved using morphological operators like dilation, erosion, opening, closing, bridge and etc. Our approach proceeds by performing <b>spatial</b> <b>cluster</b> analysis using C-Means technique and hence, road centerline nodes are attained. Finally by use of graph theory and minimum spanning tree (MST) and defining an appropriate cost function, these key points are connected and vector road centerline is obtained. The only drawback of this system is limitation in completely extraction of road centerline in place of squares and closed loops. Attaining mean overall accuracy (OA) of 98. 2 % and Kappa coefficient of 86. 26 % in classification of image to road and non-road classes, and also mean RMS error of 0. 64 pixel in comparing automatic extracted road centerline with manual extracted one, are a good criterion of proposed system success in semi-automatic extraction of roads. 1...|$|R

In what sense does <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> promote localised processes of learning and innovation?

It proves to be a rather complicated matter to measure the impact of <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> on firm performance.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{many of the}} European {{countries}} {{affected by}} Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), case clustering patterns have been observed. Most of these patterns have been interpreted in terms of heterogeneities in exposure of cattle to the BSE agent. Here we investigate whether <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> {{is present in the}} Dutch BSE case data. Results We have found three <b>spatial</b> case <b>clusters</b> in the Dutch BSE epidemic. The clusters are geographically distinct and each cluster appears in a different birth cohort. When testing all birth cohorts together, only one significant cluster was detected. The fact that we found stronger <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> when using a cohort-based analysis, is consistent with the evidence that most BSE infections occur in animals less than 12 or 18 months old. Conclusion Significant <b>spatial</b> case <b>clustering</b> is present in the Dutch BSE epidemic.

In this research we conducted a scoping review to systematically search peer-reviewed journal databases for research that has employed <b>spatial</b> <b>cluster</b> analysis methods on individual-level, address location, or x and y coordinate derived data. To illustrate the thematic issues raised by our results, methods were tested using a dataset where known clusters existed. Point pattern methods, <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> and cluster detection tests, and a locally weighted spatial regression model were most commonly used for individual-level, address location data (n = 29).

The analysis is based on data from eight different national household surveys that used a two-stage sampling design (households within <b>clusters).</b> <b>Spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> was assessed using the intracluster correlation coefficient (r), which may be interpreted as the proportion of the total variance in a variable that is associated with the cluster to which it belongs. In general, per capita expenditures and the share of the household budget spent on food showed a high level of <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> across the seven cities, but the magnitude of this clustering varied markedly from city to city. <b>Spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> in the provision of basic services also varied greatly. There was consistently little evidence of <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> of infectious disease, childhood mortality, or the weight-based nutrition indicators. Age-standardized height, on the other hand, showed slightly more <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering,</b> with a median intracluster correlation of r = 0. 12. Some cities showed relatively higher levels of <b>spatial</b> <b>clustering</b> on several measures of deprivation simultaneously, while other cities showed consistently lower levels of clustering. Many nutrition interventions are intrinsically geographically targeted. While geographical targeting tends to be administratively simpler than individual targeting and can be politically convenient, the current analysis suggests that where nutrition interventions are focused on stunting (low height-for-age), targeting by iv neighborhood may often lead to unacceptably high rates of undercoverage and leakage of benefits to the nonneedy.

In areas of {{seasonal}} malaria transmission, the incidence rate of malaria infection {{is presumed to}} be near zero {{at the end of}} the dry season.

We conducted a longitudinal analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of clinical malaria and asymptomatic parasitemia over time in a Malian town to highlight these malaria transmission dynamics. For a cohort of 300 rural children followed over 2009 – 2014, periodicity and phase shift between malaria and rainfall were determined by <b>spectral</b> analysis. <b>Spatial</b> risk <b>clusters</b> of clinical episodes or carriage were identified. A nested-case-control study was conducted to assess the parasite carriage factors. Malaria infection persisted over the entire year with seasonal peaks. High transmission periods began 2 – 3 months after the rains began. A cluster with a low risk of clinical malaria in the town center persisted in high and low transmission periods. Throughout 2009 – 2014, cluster locations did not vary from year to year. Asymptomatic and gametocyte carriage were persistent, even during low transmission periods. For high transmission periods, the ratio of asymptomatic to clinical cases was approximately 0. 5, but was five times higher during low transmission periods. Clinical episodes at previous high transmission periods were a protective factor for asymptomatic carriage, but carrying parasites without symptoms at a previous high transmission period was a risk factor for asymptomatic carriage. Stable malaria transmission was associated with sustained asymptomatic carriage during dry seasons. Control strategies should target persistent low-level parasitemia clusters to interrupt transmission...|$|R
