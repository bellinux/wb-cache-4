5|$|A Supply Bill, <b>Supplementary</b> Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any {{financial}} year if, in the President's opinion, {{the estimates of}} revenue and expenditure for that year, the <b>supplementary</b> estimates or the statement of excess, {{as the case may}} be, are likely to lead to a drawing on the reserves that were not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential <b>supplementary</b> reproductives. These <b>supplementary</b> reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single <b>supplementary</b> within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Language School of Palau, {{a weekend}} <b>supplementary</b> programme, is in {{operation}} in Koror.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the <b>supplementary</b> feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, {{primarily}} Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable <b>supplementary</b> foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|All NCHS {{students}} {{expect a}} 2-week based timetable, with <b>supplementary</b> lessons {{for four days}} allocated to individual subjects according to their academic needs (with the exception for Wednesdays).|$|E

5|$|Periodically, Dungeons & Dragons has {{returned}} to its wargaming roots with <b>supplementary</b> rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as Battlesystem (1985 & 1989) and a new edition of Chainmail (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.|$|E
5|$|Prolactinomas {{may respond}} to {{dopamine}} agonist treatment–medication that mimics {{the action of}} dopamine on the lactrotrope cells, usually bromocriptine or cabergoline. This approach may improve pituitary hormone secretion {{in more than half}} the cases, and make <b>supplementary</b> treatment unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Sallekhana {{is treated}} as a <b>supplementary</b> to these twelve vows. However, some Jain {{teachers}} such as Kundakunda, Devasena, Padmanandin, and Vasunandin have included it under Shikshavratas.|$|E

5|$|The powerfully {{rising and}} sinking air in {{mountain}} waves {{was discovered by}} glider pilot, Wolf Hirth, in 1933. Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, although pilots must use <b>supplementary</b> oxygen to avoid hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study indicated that}} yoga may improve psychological health during cancer treatment, although more complete clinical evidence is needed to confirm this possible effect. Other preliminary research indicated that yoga could be a useful <b>supplementary</b> treatment to reduce the general psychopathology of schizophrenia, and may have positive effects on mental health, although the quality of research to define these effects is low.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month after}} the Russo-Japanese War began in February 1904, the Japanese Diet {{authorized}} a temporary special budget of ¥48,465,631 that would last {{until the end of the}} war. It included the 1904 War Naval <b>Supplementary</b> Program which authorized construction of two battleships and four armored cruisers, among other ships. Two of the latter became the Tsukuba-class cruisers which were ordered on 23 June.|$|E
5|$|All {{stations}} except Chester {{connect to}} surface TTC bus and/or streetcar routes during regular operating hours.

5|$|Despite his federal pardon {{for being}} a Confederate general, Ross was disqualified from voting and serving as a juror by the first Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867. This act, and the <b>Supplementary</b> Reconstruction Act passed three weeks later, disenfranchised anyone who had held a federal or state office before {{supporting}} the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of appropriation bills into the Parliament, the expenditure proposed in those bills is referred to Senate legislation committees for inquiry. Such referrals result in what are generally known as budget estimates hearings. Senate standing committees will usually conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (<b>supplementary</b> budget estimates).|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time all four Canadian {{divisions}} were assembled to participate in a battle. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and <b>supplementary</b> artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions. This brought the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū {{was one of}} {{two large}} {{carriers}} approved for construction under the 1931–32 <b>Supplementary</b> Program. Originally designed as the sister ship of Sōryū, her design was enlarged and modified in light of the Tomozuru and Fourth Fleet Incidents in 1934–35 that revealed many IJN ships were top-heavy, unstable and structurally weak. Her forecastle was raised and her hull strengthened. Other changes involved increasing her beam, displacement, and armor protection.|$|E
5|$|His staff {{searched for}} volunteers in the Unteroffiziersschulen (non-commissioned {{officers}} schools) and <b>supplementary</b> units. They {{were able to}} bring together roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from the threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E
5|$|If 30 {{days have}} passed after a Supply Bill, <b>Supplementary</b> Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill has been {{presented}} to the President for assent and her or she has not signified the withholding of assent, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the expiration of the 30-day period.|$|E

5|$|On that day, {{before the}} hearing, {{prosecutors}} filed a bail report and <b>supplementary</b> document under seal. (Such reports are often filed under seal because they include financial {{information about a}} defendant and sometimes unreleased details relating to the investigation). Before the arraignment, Hastert arrived at The Loop offices of Sidley Austin, his attorney's law firm, and at the courthouse met with the pretrial services office.|$|E
5|$|The 2016 London mayoral {{election}} {{was held on}} 5 May 2016 to elect the Mayor of London, {{on the same day}} as the London Assembly election.

5|$|The Diet had {{legislative}} powers. The {{legislative initiative}} was {{possessed by the}} Emperor, along with the Diet executive (six deputies and the Marshal), and all individual deputies. It could debate and pass laws related to many issues {{in the field of}} education, culture, welfare, justice, public works, administration, religion and military. It could also impose <b>supplementary</b> taxes, up to 10% of the direct tax.|$|E
5|$|The Tales series, {{known in}} Japan as the , is a {{franchise}} of fantasy role-playing video games published by Bandai Namco Entertainment (formerly Namco), and developed by its subsidiary, Namco Tales Studio until 2011 and presently by Bandai Namco.

5|$|The {{following}} is a <b>supplementary</b> list of recurring guest stars, which includes characters that appear briefly in multiple episodes, like a regularly appearing doctor, but have little to no real world content to justify an entire section covering their in-universe histories. The characters {{are listed in the}} order in which they first appeared on Smallville.|$|E
5|$|The game's success, {{which went}} against what Square Enix assumed would happen {{due to the}} title's {{identity}} as a traditional role-playing game, prompted them to reconsider their strategy for game making, which {{up to that point}} had been geared towards developing titles tailored for western markets rather than focusing on the Japanese market. According to the developers, none of them believed that the game would be released overseas, and were overwhelmed by the positive fan feedback they had received. A manga titled Bravely Default: Flying Fairy began serialization online through Famitsu. Two compilation volumes were released in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Two <b>supplementary</b> books, released under the title Bravely Default: The Pocketbook of R, were released in December 2013. In addition to this, two drama CDs containing <b>supplementary</b> stories were released through 2013 and 2014. Music from the game was featured Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as DLC.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} a {{significant}} breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), 400 pairs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus), 2pairs of great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) and varying numbers of common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopodidae). The feeding habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that <b>supplementary</b> feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominence}} of Little Logic and Logic Return in the pedigrees of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and <b>supplementary</b> breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe.
