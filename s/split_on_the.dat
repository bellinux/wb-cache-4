5|$|Despite the loss, Weaver still {{believed}} the Populist cause would triumph. He {{agreed to be}} nominated one last time for his old 6th district House seat on a Democratic-Populist fusion ticket. As he had ten years earlier, Republican John Lacey defeated Weaver. In 1900, Weaver attended a convention of fusionist Populists in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the party having <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of cooperation with the Democrats. The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office {{for the last time}} as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Labor's leader, Don Dunstan, also {{introduced}} a bill for reform of the Legislative Council, which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage. Hall himself stated he would approve the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the Legislative Council could only be abolished through a referendum. Dunstan agreed, but Hall's own party <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue. The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E
5|$|Libyan {{activism}} began generating {{concerns in}} the strongest faction into which the FROLINAT had split, the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (CCFAN). The insurgents <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of Libyan support in October 1976, with a minority leaving the militia and forming the Armed Forces of the North (FAN), led by the anti-Libyan Hissène Habré. The majority, willing to accept an alliance with Gaddafi, was commanded by Goukouni Oueddei. The latter group soon renamed itself People's Armed Forces (FAP).|$|E

5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mode of inheritance {{of white and}} whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|The Exopterygota likely are paraphyletic {{in regard}} to the Endopterygota. Matters that have {{incurred}} controversy include Strepsiptera and Diptera grouped together as Halteria based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs – a position not well-supported in the entomological community. The Neuropterida are often lumped or <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whims of the taxonomist. Fleas are now thought to be closely related to boreid mecopterans. Many questions remain in the basal relationships among endopterygote orders, particularly the Hymenoptera.|$|E
5|$|Willis renewed {{his call}} for an income tax repeal in the 1946 {{legislative}} session, but Democrats opposed the repeal and Republicans were <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue. The proposal failed {{by a vote of}} 36–60. Accomplishments of the session included better mine safety laws and stronger concealed weapons laws, and increased funding for black education. The war's end had brought additional revenue sources, and even with an expanded budget, the state experienced an $18 million surplus by the end of Willis's term.|$|E

5|$|Dissatisfied {{with city}} politics, and in {{financial}} difficulty {{due to his}} failing restaurant business and low annual salary of $9,600, former police officer and Supervisor Dan White resigned from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on November 10, 1978. However, after {{a meeting with the}} Police Officers' association and the Board of Realtors, White announced that he wanted his seat back. Liberal Supervisors saw {{this as an opportunity to}} end the 6-5 <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Board that blocked progressive initiatives they wanted to introduce. After intense lobbying by Supervisors Milk and Silver, as well as State Assemblyman Willie Brown, Moscone announced on November 26, 1978, that he would not be reappointing Dan White to the seat he had vacated.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{practice}} session was 17minutes {{shorter than the}} scheduled 60minutes, due to Kovalainen's Renault having a suspected engine failure. The failure caused oil to be <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track, this failure persisted during the race weekend. This resulted in a red flag period, from 10:33am until 10:50am local time. Hamilton led the practice with the fastest lap; with Räikkönen, Alonso and Massa posting the second, third and fourth fastest laps respectively. Sato finished the session with the fifth fastest lap in the Super Aguri car, outpacing the Honda works team {{for the second time}} during the race weekend. Toyota continued a disappointing race weekend, with the 14th and 16th fastest laps. Their suspension problems from the day before had not been resolved, and the two drivers were given instructions to avoid the kerbs at turn 8 to minimise further damage to the suspension. Red Bull came back with both of the two repaired cars entering the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The colony's small Afrikaner {{community}} was <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of war. Some supported the United Kingdom out {{of loyalty to}} Rhodesia, but others were still bitter about the Anglo-Boer War and showed little interest in fighting the Germans. In the rural areas, where Afrikaner nationalism was strongest, the Germans were perceived by some Boer farmers as potential liberators from British domination. Southern Rhodesian Afrikaners were often accused of undermining the British war effort. While some leaders of the community publicly came out {{in support of the}} war and offered to provide troops, others put pressure on Afrikaans-speakers not to volunteer. When recruitment for the Rhodesia Native Regiment began in 1916, there were reports of potential black recruits being urged not to join up by their Afrikaans-speaking employers.|$|E

5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was heavily}} involved in World WarII, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members; {{by the end of}} the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served—and fourteen had died—in the U.S. military. As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of Zionism. It is likely that a majority were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of antisemitism inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the local chapter of the Zionist United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple.|$|E

In the event that the Senate failed to pass the treaty, Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution. Tyler's cabinet was <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> administration's handling of the Texas agreement. Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly, touting the economic and geostrategic benefits with relation to Great Britain. Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler's application of military force without congressional approval, a violation of the separation of powers. Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization, he resigned.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry did {{not live}} to see the film's release, dying of heart failure on October 24, 1991. Before the film's release he viewed a near-final version of The Undiscovered Country, and {{according}} to the film's producer and Kelley's biographer, approved a final version of the film. In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused, and within 48 hours he was dead. Paramount considered spending close to $240,000 to send Roddenberry's ashes into space—a move that had the backing of fans—but decided against it; his remains would make it into space along with 22 others in 1997. The film's opening included a note to Roddenberry's memory; at early showings, the crowds of Star Trek fans applauded loudly. While the producers had begun work on the film anticipating it as the last film, by the premiere it was obvious the film would make money and that a Star Trek VII would soon be in the works. The cast was <b>split</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a sequel; Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley said that the film would be their last, while the supporting cast strongly lobbied for another film. The consensus was for the next film to star the cast of The Next Generation. The seventh Star Trek feature, Star Trek Generations (1994), would blend the old and new cast.|$|E

5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to define a k-d tree with points stored solely in leaves. This form of k-d tree allows a variety of split mechanics other than the standard median split. The midpoint <b>splitting</b> rule selects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle of the longest axis of the space being searched, regardless {{of the distribution of}} points.
