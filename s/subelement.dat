40|$|The polyomavirus origin for DNA {{replication}} comprises {{at least}} two essential, but functionally distinct, cis-acting components. One of these, the origin core, is required only for DNA replication. It includes binding sites for large T antigen and the origin of bidirectional DNA replication. The other component is required for both transcription and DNA replication and is represented by two functionally redundant regions, alpha and beta, which are elements of the polyomavirus enhancer. Whereas either enhancer element will activate DNA replication, both enhancer elements are required to constitute a functional enhancer of transcription. To identify the sequences that make up each enhancer element, we have subjected them separately to in vitro mutagenesis and measured their capacity to activate replication in cis of the origin core in MOP- 8 cells, which provide all trans-acting replicative functions including large T antigen. The results reveal that the beta enhancer element is composed of three subelements, two auxiliary subelements, and a core <b>subelement.</b> The core <b>subelement</b> independently activated DNA replication, albeit poorly. The auxiliary subelements, which were inactive on their own, acted synergistically with the core <b>subelement</b> to increase its activity. Interestingly, dimers of the beta core <b>subelement</b> functioned {{as well as the}} combination of a beta auxiliary <b>subelement</b> and a core <b>subelement,</b> suggesting that the subelements are functionally equivalent. The alpha enhancer element is organized similarly; it too comprises an auxiliary <b>subelement</b> and a core <b>subelement.</b> These results lead us to suggest that the polyomavirus enhancer comprises two levels of organization; two or more enhancer elements form an enhancer, and two or more subelements make up an enhancer element. The subelements share few sequences and serve as binding sites for distinct cellular factors. It appears, therefore, that a number of different cellular proteins function cooperatively to activate polyomavirus DNA replication by a common mechanism...|$|E

Through the rolling test characterization, these types of strands {{did not have enough}} bonding between <b>subelements</b> to withstand the deformation.

This greatly improves the bonding. There is no copper cracking in the deformed strands when we scaled up the diameter of the billets. Fermi Lab successfully made cables using one of this improved strands. In their cables, no Cu cracking and no filament bridging occurred. We also successfully made a couple of billets with hex OD and round ID <b>subelements</b> for 61 -subelement restack. Due to the lack of bonding, we could not judge its cabling property properly.

40|$|This paper calculates {{the effect}} of perturbed finite element mass and {{stiffness}} values on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the finite element model. The structure is perturbed in two ways: at the "subelement" level and at the material property level. In the <b>subelement</b> eigenvalue uncertainty analysis the mass and stiffness of each <b>subelement</b> is perturbed by a factor before being assembled into the global matrices. In the property-level eigenvalue uncertainty analysis all material density and stiffness parameters of the structure are perturbed modified prior to the eigenvalue analysis. The eigenvalue and eigenvector dispersions of each analysis (<b>subelement</b> and property-level) are also calculated using an analytical sensitivity approximation. Two structural models are used to compare these methods: a cantilevered beam model, and {{a model of the}} Space Launch System.

50|$|Some FEM sites {{describe}} hp-adaptivity as {{a combination}} of h-adaptivity (splitting elements in space while keeping their polynomial degree fixed) and p-adaptivity (only increasing their polynomial degree). This is not entirely accurate. The hp-adaptivity is significantly different from both h- and p-adaptivity since the hp-refinement of an element {{can be done in}} many different ways. Besides a p-refinement, the element can be subdivided in space (as in h-adaptivity), but there are many combinations for the polynomial degrees on the <b>subelements.</b> This is illustrated in the figure on the right. For example, if a triangular or quadrilateral element is subdivided into four <b>subelements</b> where the polynomial degrees are allowed to vary by at most two, then this yields 3^4 = 81 refinement candidates (not considering polynomially anisotropic candidates). Analogously, splitting a hexahedron into eight <b>subelements</b> and varying their polynomial degrees by at most two yields 3^8 = 6,561 refinement candidates. Clearly, standard FEM error estimates providing one constant number per element are not enough to guide automatic hp-adaptivity.|$|R

The tat response element of HIV- 2 and of SIVmac was more complex than that of HIV- 1. Two structurally similar <b>subelements</b> within the HIV- 2 tat response element could be identified. Both of these <b>subelements</b> were required for optimal transactivation by the HIV- 2 tat gene product. Either of these <b>subelements,</b> however, was sufficient for transactivation by the HIV- 1 tat gene product. These observations provide {{an explanation for the}} poor transactivation of HIV- 1 LTR-directed gene expression by the HIV- 2 tat gene product since the HIV- 1 LTR contains an analog of only one of the HIV- 2 <b>subelements.</b> The HIV- 2 tat gene product also affected the function of the upstream elements, including enhancer activity. The response of these cis elements of HIV- 2 to transactivation by HIV- 2 /SIVmac and HIV- 1 tat gene differed somewhat in virus-infected and tat gene transfected cells, probably related to the differences in the effective concentration of the tat gene products and/or other viral or cellular factors. The steady-state levels of HIV- 2 LTR-linked gene transcripts were much higher in the presence of HIV- 2, SIVmac, and HIV- 1 tat genes than in their absence, suggesting transcriptional modulation as a mechanism for tat gene function...|$|R
