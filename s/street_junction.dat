5|$|The plans {{called for}} a two-track station which would be {{connected}} to the surface via elevators. At ground level, {{there would have been a}} vestibule with traveller facilities and ticket sales. The main entrance was to be from Balchensgate, with a secondary entrance from the <b>street</b> <b>junction</b> Elisenbergveien–Frognerveien.|$|E
5|$|Just to {{the west}} of the station is Parson <b>Street</b> <b>Junction,</b> where the Portishead Branch diverges from the main line, heading north. The South Liberty Lane goods depot is {{adjacent}} to the junction, in the triangle between the main line, the Portishead Branch and the now-disused western connection between the branch and the main line.|$|E
5|$|A crosstown line via Worth Street {{would serve}} as a branch of the IND Eighth Avenue Line's local tracks. The line would have {{branched}} off at Church Street, from where it would run via Worth Street and East Broadway to Lewis Street. This two-tracks segment would have cost $15,200,000. The line would then tunnel under the East River between Lewis Street to Driggs Avenue. This section would have cost $18,500,000. The South Fourth <b>Street</b> <b>junction</b> would be completed.|$|E

5|$|About 40% of {{the subway}} system runs on surface or {{elevated}} tracks, including steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole exceptions of at-grade junctions of two lines in regular service are the 142nd <b>Street</b> <b>junction,</b> the Rogers junction and the Myrtle Avenue junction, whose tracks both intersect at the same level.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, ALDOT {{publicly}} {{unveiled the}} final routing {{of the route}} and presented it at a series of public meetings in August 1977. The selected route resulted in the slight relocation of 35th Street, {{the construction of a}} bridge along 31st Street over the freeway and the construction of a continuous viaduct along the final leg of the freeway through its 15th <b>Street</b> <b>junction.</b> Plans were also unveiled to add an additional travel lane in each direction along I-20/59 between its junction with I-359 and McFarland Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol Area Resignalling Scheme in the 1970s saw the Down Relief line, {{the most}} {{southern}} {{of the four}} running lines, converted to a siding linking Malago Vale carriage sidings to the east with the West Depot carriage sidings to the west. At the same time, Parson <b>Street</b> <b>Junction</b> was reworked, requiring trains to first cross from the Down Main line to the Up Main line before {{they were able to}} access the Portishead Branch. The Down Relief line was removed altogether when West Depot closed sometime after the opening of a new depot at St Philips Marsh to service High Speed Trains.|$|E

5|$|The depot {{was located}} in Sporveisgata, between Bergsliens gate and the <b>street</b> <b>junction</b> Pilestredet–Sporveisgata. The street Sporveisgata was in the {{beginning}} only a branch from Pilestredet, but it became a street {{in its own right}} in 1879, after the tramway installations had been constructed. While it {{was located in}} a branch to Pilestredet, the depot had Pilestredet 75 as its address. After the branch had its name changed to Sporveisgata, the address was renamed Sporveisgata 8.|$|E
5|$|The Down Relief {{line between}} Bristol Temple Meads and Parson Street {{is to be}} {{partially}} reinstated {{as part of the}} MetroWest scheme in order to ease congestion. According to the Great Western Route Utilisation Strategy, in the December 2007 timetable period, the line through Parson Street was running at over 75% capacity in the morning peak between 8 and 9am. It was predicted that by 2019, trains working the line would be completely full during peak hours. While the three tracks could cope with traffic generated by the reopening of the Portishead Line, campaigners note it would leave little room for growth. Parson <b>Street</b> <b>Junction</b> will also be upgraded during the works.|$|E
5|$|The North Circular Road {{forms the}} {{northern}} part of a ring-road around Central London. It has seen substantially more investment than its counterpart, the South Circular Road, and consequently runs on more purpose-built road than urban streets, often coupled with demolition of existing houses and urban infrastructure. Although the route has alternative names at some points, it is generally referred to as the North Circular throughout for route planning purposes. The route is mostly grade-separated dual carriageway from the A40 at Hanger Lane to the A13 in Beckton except for the Drury Way/Brentfield Road junction, the Golders Green Road/Brent <b>Street</b> <b>junction,</b> Henlys Corner and the section from Bounds Green to Green Lanes. In areas where improvements made slowest progress and upgrades are unlikely, the original names such as Gunnersbury Avenue and Bowes Road are used.|$|E
