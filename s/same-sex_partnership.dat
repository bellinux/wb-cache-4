25|$|Legal {{recognition}} of same-sex unions in Australia takes {{a variety of}} forms depending on the jurisdiction. Under Australian federal law, same-sex couples can be recognised as de facto relationships, but have no access to marriage, civil unions or other federal relationship registration. Australian states and territories are entitled to create their own laws with respect to same-sex relationship registers and <b>same-sex</b> <b>partnership</b> schemes, with most offering civil unions or other forms of domestic partnership to same-sex couples. Same-sex couples are prevented from marrying by amendments to the Marriage Act 1961, passed in 2004 by the Howard Government and Mark Latham-led Australian Labor Party. Additionally, same-sex couples who are married in countries where same-sex marriage is legal cannot divorce within Australia when they come back due to the same-sex marriage ban.|$|E

As marriage policy is a congregation matter in the ELCA, <b>same-sex</b> <b>partnership</b> blessings and marriages had been performed by many Lutheran pastors prior to the 2009 actions.
