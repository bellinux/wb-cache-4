500|$|The {{first show}} is called [...] "Victoria Falls High Divers" [...] and usually {{features}} about four trained divers who <b>stand</b> <b>right</b> {{on the edge}} of Victoria Falls. Before the show starts, a pre-recorded voice tells guests the history of diving and explains what the divers will do. Once the voice ends, all the divers walk {{to the edge of the}} waterfall and wait. One by one they perform their dives, performing quick acrobatic moves as they fall, after which the show ends.|$|E
500|$|Like {{other black}} {{players in the}} 1940s and 1950s, Motley faced racist attitudes {{both on and off}} the field. Paul Brown would not {{tolerate}} discrimination within the team; he wanted to win and would not let anything get in his way. Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would just <b>stand</b> <b>right</b> there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and just turn their backs. That kind of crap went on for two or three years until they found out what kind of players we were." [...] Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down.|$|E

The temporary outfield fence arced from the eastern Bill O'Reilly Stand (left field / third base line) and the western Brewongle <b>Stand</b> (<b>right</b> field / first base line). Two bullpens were positioned behind the outfield fence. Seating was restricted in the Victor Trumper Stand and the Clive Churchill Stand due to eye-line restrictions caused by the outfield fence {{and the need for}} a batter's eye space in center field.
