5|$|Unlike fueled {{generating}} plants, {{the capacity}} factor {{is affected by}} several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site {{and the size of}} the generator relative to the turbine's <b>swept</b> <b>area.</b> A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electric power (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40–50% would be aimed for.|$|E

25|$|Phase I of the NorthWind power {{project in}} Bangui Bay {{consists}} of 15 wind turbines, each {{capable of producing}} electricity up to a maximum capacity of 1.65 MW, {{for a total of}} 24.75 MW. The 15 on-shore turbines are spaced 326 metres (1,070ft) apart, each 70 metres (230ft) high, with 41 metres (135ft) long blades, with a rotor diameter of 82 metres (269ft) and a wind <b>swept</b> <b>area</b> of 5,281 square metres (56,840 sq ft).|$|E

50|$|The figure {{illustrates}} {{the effects of}} precession on the northern hemisphere seasons, relative to perihelion and aphelion. Notice that the <b>areas</b> <b>swept</b> during a specific season changes through time. Orbital mechanics require that {{the length of the}} seasons be proportional to the <b>swept</b> <b>areas</b> of the seasonal quadrants, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons {{on the far side of}} the orbit may be substantially longer in duration.|$|R
5000|$|... 21 minesweepers {{and other}} vessels were fitted with Admiralty Outfit QM and, on 5 June 1944, 17 of these ships {{used it to}} {{accurately}} navigate across the English Channel and to sweep the minefields in the planned <b>areas.</b> The <b>swept</b> <b>areas</b> were marked with buoys {{in preparation for the}} Normandy Landings.|$|R
25|$|Any solid object {{produces}} a wake behind it, leading to fatigue failures, so the turbine is usually positioned upwind of its supporting tower. Downwind machines have been built, because they don't need an additional mechanism for keeping them {{in line with}} the wind. In high winds, the blades can also be allowed to bend which reduces their <b>swept</b> <b>area</b> and thus their wind resistance. In upwind designs, turbine blades must be made stiff to prevent the blades from being pushed into the tower by high winds. Additionally, the blades are placed a considerable distance in front of the tower and are sometimes tilted forward into the wind a small amount.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the same}} day, USS Silverstein and USS Maddox, in a <b>swept</b> <b>area</b> south of Yo-do, were {{covering}} {{the withdrawal of}} two friendly sampans from Umi-do, when suddenly enemy batteries opened fire. The sampans received the first salvos, around 30 total so the Silverstein and the Maddox [...] returned the fire and suppressed the batteries. Aircraft from USS Valley Forge were also called in to provide close air support. Silverstein received 110 rounds of estimated 105 millimeter batteries though she was not damaged, Maddox received two rounds. There were no allied casualties in the action.|$|E

40|$|As {{a part of}} an {{approach}} for solving the robot motion planning problem for robot arms, we want {{to decide whether or}} not a link collides with an obstacle for a given range of values for (some of) the joint parameters. We want to use the so called Roider Method for fast collision checking, and want to model the link by enclosing it by a superellips (in 2 dimensional space) or by a superellipsoid (in 3 dimensional space). We show in this paper that it is possible to model these <b>swept</b> <b>areas</b> using some elementary geometrical and trigonometrical tools. We describe for all swept volumes occuring for some robot arm topologies the extreme points needed for the enclosure of solids by a superellips or by a superellipsoid. We also compute the volume of the <b>swept</b> <b>areas</b> and of the enclosing superellips or superellipsoid. The rate between these volumes is a measure for the accuracy of the enclosure...|$|R

2500|$|A {{quantitative}} {{measure of}} [...] wind energy available at any location {{is called the}} Wind Power Density (WPD). It is a calculation of the mean annual power available per square meter of <b>swept</b> <b>area</b> of a turbine, and is tabulated for different heights above ground. Calculation of wind power density includes the effect of wind velocity and air density. Color-coded maps are prepared for a particular area described, for example, as [...] "Mean Annual Power Density at 50 Metres". In the United States, {{the results of the}} above calculation are included in an index developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and referred to as [...] "NREL CLASS". The larger the WPD, the higher it is rated by class. Classes range from Class 1 (200 watts per square meter or less at 50m altitude) to Class 7 (800 to 2000 watts per square m). Commercial wind farms generally are sited in Class 3 or higher areas, although isolated points in an otherwise Class 1 area may be practical to exploit.|$|E
2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were also {{introduced}} in 1965. The brakes had a four-piston design with two-piece calipers and cooling fins for the rotors. Pads were in frequent {{contact with the}} rotors, but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy. Further, the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life, which was, in fact, quite high: a projected [...] for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders. Total <b>swept</b> <b>area</b> for the new system was , a notable advance on the [...] of the previous all-drum system. Per pending federal regulation, {{there was also a}} dual master cylinder with separate fluid reservoirs (only on models with power brakes for 1965) for the front and rear lines. Road testers rightly applauded the all-disc brakes. Testers found that repeated stops from [...] produced no deterioration in braking efficiency, and even the most sudden stops were rock-stable. The drum brakes remained available, however, as a $64.50 credit option, but only 316 of the 23,562 Corvettes built that year came with drums. A side exhaust system appeared as an option as did a telescopic steering wheel. Also available were alloy spinner rims, at US$322 a set.|$|E
