40|$|Interference screw {{fixation}} {{is one of}} the most common methods for ligament reconstruction. Although the advantages and clinical outcomes of this procedure have been widely reported, post-surgical complications often arise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new femoral fixation device, the Endoscrew, for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. We performed a mechanical test in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards and an in vitro biomechanical study. An axial pullout test was conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of the new device and the interference screw when implanted in solid rigid polyurethane foam test blocks. The biomechanical test used porcine femora to evaluate the initial fixation strength between these two implants. The maximum pullout force of the interference <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> [722. 05  ±  130. 49  N (N) ] was significantly greater (p <  0. 01) than the Endoscrew group (440. 79  ±  26. 54  N) when implanted in polyurethane foam 320 kg/m 3 density. With polyurethane foam 160 kg/m 3 density, the maximum pullout forces were (242. 61  ±  37. 36  N) (p <  0. 001) and (99. 33  ±  30. 01  N) for the interference <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> and Endoscrew group, respectively. In the in vitro mechanical study, the Endoscrew (646. 39  ±  72. 38  N) required a significantly greater ultimate load prior to failure (p <  0. 05) when compared with the interference screw (489. 72  ±  138. 64  N). With regard to pullout stiffness, there was no statistically significant difference (p <  0. 13) between the Endoscrew group (99. 15  ±  12. 16  N/mm) and the interference <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> (87. 96  ±  11. 12  N/mm).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{clinical}} outcomes of patients with femoral neck fractures treated with the dynamic hip system blade (DHS-BLADE) or cannulated compression screws. Methods: Eighty-six patients with femoral neck fractures were treated by closed reduction internal fixation with a DHS-BLADE (n =  42; 18 males and 24 females; mean age: 56. 3 years (37 – 87)) or cannulated compression screws (n =  44; 20 males and 24 females; mean age: 53. 8 years (26 – 83)) between March 2011 and August 2013. The groups were compared with Harris hip score, operation time, surgical blood loss, incision size, hospital stay, and related complications. Results: The average follow-up time was 27 months (range, 24 – 36 months). There was no significant difference for the operation time, incision size, hospital stay, and Harris hip score between the groups. Also, no statistically significant differences in the rates of nonunion (4. 5 % vs. 0) and avascular necrosis of the femoral head (9. 1 % vs. 7. 1 %) were observed. However, the <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> experienced significantly less surgical blood loss (32. 4  ±  24. 7  ml) than the blade group (87. 2  ±  46. 6  ml; P =  0. 041). The incidence of femoral neck shortening above 10  mm in the <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> was significantly higher than that in the blade group (15. 9 % vs. 2. 4 %, P =  0. 031). The blade group had a significantly lower incidence of screw migration than the <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> (4. 8 % vs. 22. 7 %, P =  0. 016).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Freeze-dried {{cortical}} bone {{can be used}} as {{a biological}} plate, either alone or in combination with other internal fixation devices, to stabilize fractures. In addition to it conferring mechanical stability, freeze-dried cortical bone may enhance fracture-healing and increase the bone stock. This study examined the effect of a freeze-dried allograft cortical bone plate (FACBP) on the biomechanical properties of an implant site in a canine bone defect model. Twelve adult mongrel dogs (around 4. 8 kg) were used. A segmental critical-size defect (5 mm in length) at ulna diaphysis was created using an oscillating saw. The experimental animals were divided into two groups: eight dogs treated with an absorbable bone plate (FACBP) fixed by metal bone <b>screws</b> (<b>Group</b> A) and four dogs treated with a commercial stainless steel bone plate and metal bone <b>screws</b> (<b>Group</b> B). Bone healing was assessed by radiography, Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and a three-point bending test. The FACBP incorporated in the host bone produced complete remodeling of the cortical bone. There was no significant difference in the bone mineral density and biomechanical tests between the FACBP application site and normal ulna or a stainless steel bone plate of the ulna. These results suggest that FACBP facilitates recovery from a bone fracture by assisting in the induction of new bone formation in a defected fracture...|$|R

Each specimen was loaded to failure, and the mean average load to failure, stiffness, and absorbed energy to failure were compared using unpaired Student's t test. The mean average stiffness of the Ludloff osteotomy fixed with 2 <b>screws</b> (<b>group</b> I) and with the supplementary mini locking plate (group II) was 172. 7 +/- 31. 7 N/mm and 193. 3 +/- 39 N/mm, respectively (p =. 21).

30|$|The {{current study}} {{represents}} a comparative clinically based follow-up study in a consecutive series of patient groups undergoing surgery for severe scoliosis with either hybrid or total PSI. The data presented {{have been collected}} via a prospective systematic data collection system, although the study design was retrospective in nature. Selection between hybrid and total PSI, {{as well as between}} anteroposterior versus posterior-only surgery represents more development in the current surgical techniques, with a tendency to perform as much surgery via the posterior-only approach due to the pulmonary complications. Since {{the findings of this study}} represent a single-surgeon series, it is possible that the results somewhat reflect the learning curve of the senior surgeon during the study period. The etiology of scoliosis was mixed in this population.

40|$|Background: Open {{reduction}} {{with internal}} fixation (ORIF) and percutaneous surgery (PS) {{are the most}} common surgical procedures for the treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the clinical and radiological results of these techniques and to verify the prognostic value of the radiographic measurement tools proposed in the literature. Methods: A consecutive series of 104 calcaneal fractures was included in this analysis. Essex-Lopresti and Sanders classifications were used to evaluate the injuries, and their prognostic correlation was tested. Böhler’s angle was measured pre- and postoperatively and evaluated as radiological outcome. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot scale (AOFAS), Maryland Foot Scale (MFS), 17 -Foot Function Index (FFI), Short Form- 36 (PCS), and a 10 -point visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: A total of 87 fractures (5 bilateral), 54 in males and 28 in females, were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 77. 0 months. Overall mean age was 51. 6 years old. The most frequent cause of trauma was a fall from a height. According to Essex-Lopresti, there were 58 joint depression fractures, 26 tongue, and 3 comminute. According to Sanders: 37 type II, 31 type III, and 19 type IV. Patients were divided into three groups according to surgical treatment: 19 in the ORIF group, 35 in the PS <b>Screw</b> <b>group,</b> and 33 in PS K-wire group. The ORIF group obtained significantly better results (82 AOFAS, 86 MFS, 19. 6 FFI, 46. 2 PCS, 8 VAS) with respect to the PS K-wire group (74 AOFAS, 76 MSF, 26. 4 FFI, 40. 8 PCS, 6 VAS).

Methods: Tagged linkBMP- 2 peptides were used to quantify binding efficiency and release kinetics on 9 mineral-coated BIORCI screws (Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA). Fourteen mature female sheep were used in this study. In each of the 14 sheep, each stifle was randomized to either receive a linkBMP- 2 –coated or uncoated interference screw (n � 14 per treatment). The sheep were euthanized at 6 weeks after surgery. Eight sheep were subjected to biomechanical testing for peak load at failure and stiffness, and six sheep were used for histologic analysis according to a semiquantitative scoring scale.

40|$|Study Design. Comparison of {{feasibility}} {{and safety}} of the placement of short and long iliac screws by anatomic and biomechanical evaluations as they apply to lumbo-iliac fixation construct. Objective. To compare {{the stability of the}} short and long iliac screw fixations for lumbo-iliac reconstruction by anatomic and biomechanical evaluations. Summary of Background Data. Spinopelvic reconstruction remains a challenge to spine surgeons. Despite the advent of many fixation Methods, the use of iliac screws seems most favorable so far. Various lengths of iliac screws are applied in surgical treatments; however, no biomechanical comparison has been reported based on the screw length. Methods. For anatomic observation, CT scan data of 60 Chinese adults were used to measure the details of the iliac spine structures. For biomechanical evaluation, 7 adult human cadavers (L 3 -pelvis) were observed. L 4 -S 1 pedicle screw fixation was performed with posterior spinal fixation system. On the basis of the lengths of iliac screws, 2 groups were tested (short <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> using 70 mm screws and long <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> using 138 mm screws). In this study, short and long iliac screws were placed in the same specimen. Biomechanical testing was performed on a material testing machine under 800 N compression and 7 Nm torsion loading modes for stiffness evaluations. Finally, pullout testing was performed for all the iliac screws to measure the maximum pullout force. Results. The length of the line between posterior superior iliac spine and anterior inferior iliac spine was 140. 6 ± 1. 1 mm, and the distance between this line and the greater sciatic notch was 18. 3 ± 0. 8 mm. The length of the line between posterior superior iliac spine and the second narrowest point was 67. 1 ± 0. 62 mm in men and 70. 1 ± 1. 4 mm in women. Insertion lengths of the short and long iliac screws were 70 ± 2 mm and 138 ± 4 mm, respectively. The lumbo-pelvic reconstruction using short and long iliac screws restored 53. 3 % ± 13. 6 % and 57. 6 % ± 16. 2 % of the initial stiffness in compression testing respectively. In torsion testing, the use of short and long iliac screws harvested 55. 1 % ± 11. 9 % and 62. 5 % ± 9. 2 % of the initial stiffness, respectively. No significant difference was detected between the 2 reconstructions in terms of compressive and torsional stiffness (P > 0. 05). However, the maximum pullout strength of long iliac <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> was significantly higher than the short <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05). Conclusion. The local stability is rather difficult to be restored to the original levels regardless the length of iliac screws. Obviously, long iliac screws resisted significantly greater axial pullout force. However, under physiologic, torsional, and compressive loading conditions, the mechanical stability of lumbo-pelvic fixation construct with short iliac screws was comparable with that of the long ones. Therefore, the use of short iliac screws, which are only about half the length of the long iliac screws, could reduce the implantation risk without significantly compromising on the stability of the construct. © 2009, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Background Tibial head {{depression}} fractures {{demand a}} high level of fracture stabilization to prevent a secondary loss of reduction after surgery. Elderly individuals are at an increased risk of developing these fractures, and biomechanical investigations of the fractures are rare. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} systematically analyze different types of osteosyntheses in combination with two commonly used bone substitutes. Methods Lateral tibial head depression fractures were created in synthetic bones. After reduction, the fractures were stabilized with eight different treatment options of osteosynthesis alone or in combination with a bone substitute. Two screws, 4 screws and a lateral buttress plate were investigated. As a bone substitute, two common clinically used calcium phosphate cements, Norian® Drillable and ChronOS™ Inject, were applied. Displacement of the articular fracture fragment (mm) during cyclic loading, stiffness (N/mm) and maximum load (N) in Load-to-Failure tests were measured. Results The three different osteosyntheses (Group 1 : 2 <b>screws,</b> <b>group</b> 2 : 4 <b>screws,</b> <b>group</b> 3 : plate) alone revealed a significantly higher displacement compared to the control group (Group 7 : ChronOS™ Inject only) (Group 1, 7 [p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01]; group 2, 7 [p[*]=[*] 0. 04]; group 3, 7 [p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01]). However, the osteosyntheses in combination with bone substitute exhibited no differences in displacement compared to the control group. The buttress plate demonstrated a higher normalized maximum load than the 2 and 4 screw osteosynthesis. Comparing the two different bone substitutes to each other, ChronOS™ inject had a significantly higher stiffness and lower displacement than Norian® Drillable. Conclusions The highest biomechanical stability under maximal loading was provided by a buttress plate osteosynthesis. A bone substitute, such as the biomechanically favorable ChronOS™ Inject, is essential to reduce the displacement under lower loading...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: No {{studies have}} {{compared}} monoaxial and polyaxial pedicle screws {{with regard to}} the von Mises stress of the instrumentation, intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment and adjacent segment degeneration. METHODS: Short-segment monoaxial/polyaxial pedicle screw fixation techniques were compared using finite element methods, and the redistributed T 11 -L 1 segment range of motion, largest maximal von Mises stress of the instrumentation, and intradiscal pressures of the adjacent segment under displacement loading were evaluated. Radiographic results of 230 patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures treated with these fixations were reviewed, and the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle, anterior vertebral body height of the fractured vertebrae and adjacent segment degeneration were calculated and evaluated. RESULTS: The largest maximal values of the von Mises stress were 376. 8 MPa for the pedicle screws in the short-segment monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model and 439. 9 MPa for the rods in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the upper adjacent segments were all greater than those of the lower adjacent segments. The maximal intradiscal pressures of the monoaxial pedicle screw fixation model were larger than those in the corresponding segments of the normal model. The radiographic results at the final follow-up evaluation showed that the mean loss of correction of the sagittal Cobb&# 39;s angle, vertebral body angle and anterior vertebral body height were smallest in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> fixation <b>group.</b> Adjacent segment degeneration was less likely to be observed in the intermediate polyaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> fixation <b>group</b> but more likely to be observed in the intermediate monoaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> fixation <b>group.</b> CONCLUSION: Smaller von Mises stress in the pedicle screws and lower intradiscal pressure in the adjacent segment were observed in the polyaxial screw model than in the monoaxial pedicle screw fixation spine models. Fracture-level fixation could significantly correct kyphosis and reduce correction loss, and adjacent segment degeneration was less likely to be observed in the intermediate polyaxial pedicle <b>screw</b> fixation <b>group...</b>|$|R

Methods: After being divided into 4 groups randomly such as No. 1, 2, 3 and 4, 12 AZ 31 magnesium alloy screws need suspending in the vessels containing 35 ml simulated body fluid. No. 1 was control group. Group 1 was under no load condition, experimental group 2, 3, and 4 were discontinuously applied fixed axial compression load of 30 N, 60 N, 90 N respectively on time. The weight loss of magnesium alloy screws {{and the amount}} of gas generated were measured regularly. Results: From the cumulative amount of hydrogen production, group 1 and group 4 were relatively large, whereas group 2 and group 3 were relatively small.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the load to failure of 2 coracoid fixation techniques after transfer of the coracoid to the anterior glenoid neck. Methods: Ten cadavers (mean age, 87 years; range, 74 to 96 years) underwent the Bristow conjoined tendon tenodesis technique as described by Boileau et al. (bioabsorbable interference screw fixation of a coracoid bone plug) in 1 shoulder and the Latarjet-Patte coracoid transfer popularized by Walch (fixation with 2 screws through a larger piece of the coracoid) in the opposite shoulder. The force on the conjoined tendon required to pull the coracoid off of the anterior glenoid was recorded, along with the mode of construct failure. Results: The median ultimate failure load was 110 N (range, 35 to 170 N) in the interference <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> and 202 N (range, 95 to 300 N) in the bicortical <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> (P. 002). The mode of failure of the interference screw technique was complete avulsion of the bone plug from the socket in 6 cases (60 %) and fracture of the bone plug in 4 (40 %). The mode of failure of the bone block technique was a vertical fracture through both screw holes in 7 cases (70 %), a horizontal fracture through the distal screw hole in 2 (20 %), and an intratendinous rupture of the conjoined tendon in 1 (10 %). Conclusions: Fixation of a coracoid bone block to the anterior glenoid neck with 2 bicortical metal screws is stronger than fixation of a coracoid bone plug with an absorbable interference screw. Clinical Relevance: These data may influence surgeons' decisions regarding coracoid fixation as well as postoperative rehabilitation after coracoid transfer...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ligament {{reconstruction}} is {{a common}} procedure in orthopedic surgery. Although several popular techniques are currently in use, new methods are proposed for secure fixation of the tendon graft into the bone tunnel. Purposes: We sought to introduce our new technique of Bashti bone plug for fixation of soft tissue graft in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and to compare its biomechanical features with conventional absorbable interference screw technique in a bovine model. Methods: Twenty pairs of bovine knees were harvested after death. Soft tissue was removed and the Achilles tendon was harvested {{to be used as}} an ACL graft. It was secured into the bone tunnel on the tibial side via two different methods: Bashti Bone Plug technique and conventional screw method. Biomechanical strength was measured using 200 N and 300 N cyclic loading on the graft. Pull out strength was also tested until the graft fails. Results: No graft failure was observed after 200 N and 300 N cyclic loading in either fixation methods. When testing for pull out failure, 21 tendons (53 %) were torn and 19 tendons (48 %) slipped out. No fixation failure occurred, which did not reveal {{a significant difference between the}} bone plug or interference <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> (P= 0. 11). The mean pull out force until failure of the graft was 496 ± 66 N in the <b>screw</b> <b>group</b> and 503 ± 67 N in the bone plug group (P= 0. 76). Conclusions: Our suggested fixation technique of Bashti bone plug is a native, cheap, and feasible method that provides comparable biomechanical strength with interference screw when soft tissue fixation was attempted in bovine model...|$|E

40|$|Background: Proximal {{locking screw}} {{deformation}} and screw fracture is a frequently seen problem for femur interlocking nailing that affects fracture healing. We {{realized that there}} is lack of literature for the right level for the proximal locking screw. We investigated the difference of locking screw bending resistance between the application of screws on different proximal femoral levels. Materials and Methods: We used a total of 80 proximal locking <b>screws</b> for eight <b>groups,</b> 10 <b>screws</b> for each <b>group.</b> Three-point bending tests were performed on four types of screws in two different trochanteric levels (the lesser trochanter and 20 mm proximal). We determined the yield points at three-point bending tests that a permanent deformation started in the locking screws using an axial compression testing machine. Results: The mean yield point value of 5 mm threaded locking screws applied 20 mm proximal of lesser trochanter was 1022 ± 49 (range 986 – 1057) (mean ± standard deviation, 95 % confidence interval). On the other hand, the mean yield point value of {{the same type of}} locking screws applied on the lesser trochanteric level was 2089 ± 249 (range 1911 – 2268). Which means 103 % increase of screw resistance between two levels (P = 0. 000). In all <b>screw</b> <b>groups,</b> on the lesser trochanter line we determined 98 – 174 % higher than the yield point values of the same type of locking screws in comparison with 20 mm proximal to the lesser trochanter (P = 0. 000). Conclusion: According to our findings, there is twice as much difference in locking screw bending resistance between these two application levels. To avoid proximal locking screw deformation, locking screws should be placed in the level of the lesser trochanter in nailing of 1 / 3 middle and distal femur fractures...|$|R

Examples reporting mean values pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at latest follow-up include: (Cotrel–Dubousset to pelvis, 18 patients) scoliosis 70 ° to 38 ° to 41 °; pelvic obliquity 19 ° pre-operatively in 13, 9 improved 22 ° to 11 °, and 4 worsened 13 ° to 16 ° [10]; (Harrington–Luque, most Luque to pelvis with modified Moe fusion, 101) scoliosis 84 ° to 40 ° with mean loss of correction of 7 °; pelvic obliquity 21 ° to 11 ° with mean loss of correction of 3 ° [29]; (Luque rod/Galveston, 31) scoliosis 48 ° to 16.7 ° to 22 °; pelvic obliquity 19.8 ° to 7.2 ° to 11.6 ° [30]; [Luque single unit rod, pedicle screws, 74 (25 to sacrum or pelvis)] scoliosis 53.5 ° to 27.3 ° to 39 °; pelvic obliquity 20 ° to 10.8 ° to 16 ° [35]; (pedicle screws and iliac screws, 20) scoliosis 44 ° to 10 °; pelvic obliquity 14 ° to 3 ° [14]; (Jackson intrasacral fixation, hybrid above, 56) scoliosis 58.5 ° to 22.3 ° to 23.5 °, pelvic obliquity-improved [15]; (sublaminar wires group A, sublaminar wires and pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>group</b> B, pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>group</b> C, 43) scoliosis changes group A: 50 ° to 15.7 ° to 21.6 °, group B: 17.8 ° to 3.6 ° to 6.7 °, and group C: 25.8 ° to 5.5 ° to 8.9 ° [33]; (pedicle screw instrumentation, 27; iliac screws to pelvis, 18) scoliosis (entire 27) 79.8 ° to 30.2 ° to 31.9 °; pelvic obliquity for cases extended to pelvis 22.2 ° to 11.2 ° to 13.4 ° [21]; (Luque–Galveston, 93) scoliosis 72 ° to 33 ° to 36 ° [20]; (new pelvic rod system, 18) scoliosis 82.3 ° to 30.9 ° to 33.4 °; pelvic obliquity 19.3 ° to 5 ° to 5 ° [6].|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{stimulus}} evoked electromyography (EMG) {{is commonly}} used to confirm the accuracy of pedicle screw placement. There are no studies to differentiate between solid screws and hollow screws to the electrical resistance of pedicle screws. We speculate that the electrical resistance of the solid and hollow pedicle screws may be different and then a potential source of error with stimulus-evoked EMG may happen. Materials and Methods: Resistance measurements were obtained from 12 pedicle screw varieties (6 screws of each manufacturer) across the screw shank based on known constant current and measured voltage. The voltage was measured 5 times at each site. Results: Resistance of all solid screws ranged from 0. 084 Omega to 0. 151 Omega (mean = 0. 118 +/- 0. 024 Omega) and hollow screws ranged from 0. 148 Omega to 0. 402 Omega (mean = 0. 285 +/- 0. 081 Omega). There {{was a significant difference}} of resistance between the solid screws and hollow screws (P < 0. 05). The screw with the largest diameter no matter solid screws or hollow screws had lower resistance than screws with other diameters. No matter in solid <b>screws</b> <b>group</b> or hollow <b>screws</b> <b>group,</b> there were significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the 5. 0 mm screws and 6. 0 mm screws, 6. 0 mm screws and 7. 0 mm screws, 5. 0 mm screws and 7. 0 mm screws, 4. 5 mm screws and 5. 5 mm screws, 5. 5 mm screws and 6. 5 mm screws, 4. 5 mm screws and 6. 5 mm screws. The resistance of hollow screws was much larger than the solid screws in the same diameter group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Hollow pedicle screws have the potential for high electrical resistance compared to the solid pedicle screws and therefore may affect the EMG response during stimulus-evoked EMG testing in pedicle screw fixation especially in minimally invasive percutaneous pedical screw fixation surgery.
