5|$|When Linda was {{predicted}} to turn towards the northeast, it was forecast to move ashore in southern California as a weak tropical storm, {{which would have}} made Linda the first to do so since a tropical storm in 1939. The Oxnard, California National Weather Service office issued public information and special weather statements that discussed the possible impact of Linda on southern California. The advisories mentioned forecasting uncertainty, and advised the media not to exaggerate the storm. The office noted a threat for significant rainfall—possibly causing flash flooding—as well as high <b>surf.</b> <b>To</b> prepare for possible flooding, workers cleaned storm drains and prepared sandbags for coastal properties.|$|E

5|$|As Gladys {{strengthened}} in the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters at the United State Weather Bureau {{predicted that}} the storm would bring high <b>surf</b> <b>to</b> areas {{as far north as}} North Carolina. Additionally, it was suggested that Gladys could have threatened northern Florida, as the storm was on a similar path as Hurricane Dora. As a result, residents along the coast of the Southeastern United States were advised to remain alert and small craft advisories were issued. On September20, small craft advisories were issued for The Bahamas. After Gladys turned northwestward on September21, forecasters at the United State Weather Bureau issued hurricane watches for North Carolina, Virginia, and some Mid-Atlantic states. Gale warnings and small craft advisories were issued on September23 from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, ships of the United States Navy were diverted to Narragansett Bay as a precaution. At 0400UTC on September24, the gale warnings for New England were lowered as Gladys turned northeastward away from the coast however, small water craft were advised to remain in port until the seas subsided.|$|E
25|$|The Beach Boys {{began as}} a garage band playing 1950s style rock and roll, {{reassembling}} styles of music such as <b>surf</b> <b>to</b> include vocal jazz harmony, which created their unique sound. In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the pop ballad by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll. Among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys' style were their voices' nasal quality {{and the use of}} falsetto in their harmonies over a run-on melody.|$|E
25|$|From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was {{employed}} as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware. It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural bacteriocides, fungicides, and preservatives. However, following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to conduct research for the United States armed forces. One of his first projects was to develop glue that could withstand the warm salt water of the South Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Navy had gained control of the island of Guadalcanal, and patrolled the sky and sea by day. The only way for U.S. forces to supply the troops stranded on the island was to approach at night by speedboat, and jettison boxes of canned food and other supplies into the <b>surf</b> <b>to</b> wash ashore. The {{problem was that the}} glue holding these containers together disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an adhesive that resisted corrosion, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks included work with camouflage; canteen disinfectants; DDT to control malaria; and insulation for small electronics.|$|E

Rainfall peaked at only [...] in Norfolk, causing no flooding. Minor beach erosion occurred due to tides [...] above normal at Hampton Roads. No significant wind damage occurred, as the strongest sustained wind speed in the area was [...] in Cape Henry.|$|E
500|$|Although Hurricane Marie's center {{remained}} {{well away from}} land throughout its entire existence, its large size brought increased <b>surf</b> <b>to</b> areas from Southwestern Mexico northward to southern California. Off the coast of Los Cabos, three people drowned after their boat capsized in rough seas. In Colima and Oaxaca, heavy rains from outer bands caused flooding, resulting in two fatalities. Similar effects were felt across Baja California Sur. Toward the end of August, Marie brought {{one of the largest}} hurricane-related surf events to southern California in decades. Swells of [...] battered coastal areas, with structural damage occurring on Santa Catalina Island and in the Greater Los Angeles Area. A breakwater near Long Beach sustained $10million worth of damage, with portions gouged out. One person drowned in the surf near Malibu. Hundreds of ocean rescues, including over 100 in Malibu alone, were attributed to the storm, and overall losses reached $20million.|$|E

500|$|After {{reaching}} hurricane intensity {{the following}} day, the tropical cyclone began to rapidly intensify, and late on July19, Emilia reached its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of [...] and a minimum barometric pressure of 926mbar (hPa; 27.34inHg), rating it as a Category5 hurricane. After slight oscillations in strength, an upper-level trough forced the intense hurricane northwest on July21, and Emilia began to weaken thereafter. The tropical cyclone encountered {{an area of}} vertical wind shear and cool sea surface temperatures, which further weakened the system. The following day, Emilia made its closest approach to the Big Island of Hawaii, but subsequently weakened to below hurricane intensity. This weakening trend continued, and the tropical cyclone fully dissipated on July25. Though the hurricane did not make landfall, Emilia brought strong <b>surf</b> <b>to</b> the islands of Hawaii and caused gusty winds, which resulted in some property damage. Precipitation was also reported, but remained under moderate levels.|$|E
500|$|In {{advance of}} Flossie, {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were placed into effect for various Hawaiian Islands. In addition, numerous flash flood watches were issued {{in fear of}} over a foot of precipitation. Ports and numerous facilities were closed to the public, and authorities opened shelters for refuge. Upon approach, Flossie threatened {{to become the first}} tropical storm to make a direct hit on Hawaii in two decades; however, the system weakened prior to doing so. Flossie brought high <b>surf</b> <b>to</b> the state, leading to minor beach erosion. Gusty winds exceeded tropical storm threshold, downing numerous power poles and trees; as a result, several thousand locals were without power for a few days. The storm produced several inches of rainfall across the island, with a peak of [...] on Mount Waialeale. Though one man was injured due to lightnings, no fatalities were reported in association with Flossie. Damage totaled to $24,000 (2013 USD) as a consequence of lightning.|$|E
500|$|As Bond girl Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson in the 2002 {{blockbuster}} Die Another Day, Berry recreated a {{scene from}} Dr. No, emerging from the <b>surf</b> <b>to</b> be greeted by James Bond as Ursula Andress had 40 years earlier. Lindy Hemming, costume designer on Die Another Day, had insisted that Berry wear a bikini and knife as a homage. Berry has said of the scene: [...] "It's splashy", [...] "exciting", [...] "sexy", [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "it will keep me still out there after winning an Oscar". The bikini scene was shot in Cadiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to try to stay warm. According to an ITV news poll, Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time. Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. It was removed in a 30-minute operation. After Berry won the Academy Award, rewrites were commissioned to give her more screentime for X2.|$|E

500|$|Significant {{flooding}} {{also occurred}} {{in and around}} the Port of Long Beach. The Army Corps of Engineers was sent out to inspect significant damage to the middle breakwater at Long Beach. Eleven sections of the breakwater sustained major damage, including three areas which were completely gouged out. Along the [...] breakwater, [...] of it sustained major damage, [...] saw significant damage, and a further [...] experienced moderate damage. Several hundred tons of rock were estimated to have been dislodged by the storm. The nearby San Pedro and Long Beach breakwaters saw substantial damage as well, though not as severe as the middle breakwater. Debris from the Navy Mole breakwater damaged a roadway near the Sea Launch Commander, within Long Beach. The breach resulted in roughly $3million in damage to nearby terminals. Two barges and a pleasure craft were loosed from their anchors by the surging waves and had to be towed back. Two terminals had to close due to dangerous conditions for workers. Less than two weeks after Marie, Hurricane Norbert threatened to bring further increased <b>surf</b> <b>to</b> the area. With the breakwater yet to be repaired, a large sand berm was reinforced along beaches and residents were supplied with sandbags.|$|E
