5|$|It all {{happened}} that night. She {{told us the}} title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to work on the chord myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what chord am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the chord.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make myself very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are nothing unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E

500|$|For most of Bullock's shots, she {{was placed}} inside a giant, {{mechanical}} rig. Getting into the rig took {{a significant amount}} of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset. Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – [...] "no space suit opens up at the front – but we had to do that in order for her to get out. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening." ...|$|E
500|$|A 163-minute {{version of}} the film competed in the main {{competition}} of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The Cannes cut lacked much of the finished film's sound design, and some visual effects were not fully in place. Noé said about the version: [...] "the film was like a baby of three months. I took {{it out of my}} belly to show it, flattered by [...] Thierry Frémaux's invitation, but it was still in gestation. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to put it back into my belly, that is to say to tweak many details." ...|$|E
500|$|Hergé's main assistant, Bob de Moor, {{showed an}} {{interest}} in completing the book following Hergé's death. In de Moor's words, [...] "Personally I {{would have loved to}} finish Alph-Art. It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to finish it." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{demonstration}} for Till {{was held}} in 2000 in Selma, Alabama on the 35th anniversary of the [...] His mother Mamie Till-Mobley attended and later wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I realized that Emmett had achieved the significant impact in death {{that he had been}} denied in life. Even <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never wanted Emmett to be a martyr. I only wanted him to be a good son. Although I realized all the great things that had been accomplished largely because of the sacrifices made by so many people, I found myself wishing that somehow we could have done it another way." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker {{and casting}} {{director}} Juliet Taylor held open casting calls in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, New York City and Philadelphia. Matthew Modine originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Al Columbato, but Parker decided to cast him as Birdy, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "introverted honest quality" [...] that best suited the character. Modine said, [...] "I was flabbergasted because I hadn't auditioned for Birdy. I had never imagined playing the part of Birdy. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to really go through an extraordinary transformation in my mind of trying to bring this remarkable character to life. It was an incredible experience making the film." ...|$|E

I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to go back and redo a lot.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} part of qualifying, Massa set the fastest time, taking pole {{position}} from second placed Alonso {{in the last}} few seconds as rain began to fall, with Räikkönen completing the top three. Massa's lap of 1:35.043 marked tyre company Bridgestone's 100th pole position in Formula One. Hamilton came fourth, over half a second behind the leading three. He conceded inexperience was to blame, saying that there were [...] "some spots of rain on my visor, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to sort of let off". Heidfeld qualified fifth, ahead of Nico Rosberg in sixth and teammate Kubica in seventh. The Toyotas of Trulli and Schumacher were eighth and ninth, with Webber completing the top ten.|$|E
500|$|Shostakovich's musical {{response}} to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece, [...] "To the victims of fascism and war", ostensibly {{in memory of the}} Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram: Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman [...] "I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better write one myself." [...] Several of Shostakovich's colleagues, including Natalya Vovsi-Mikhoels and the cellist Valentin Berlinsky, were also aware of the Eighth Quartet's biographical intent.|$|E
500|$|Beach {{maintained}} that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: [...] "It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt we created, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a field day every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object." [...] To remove trash without surfacing, Triton had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through {{the bottom of the}} ship. [...] However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.|$|E

500|$|For {{several years}} after he had turned 40, Miller {{concentrated}} on composing and playing his own music. He therefore reduced his recording and club appearances, as well as one-day associations. The stimulus for this change had built gradually from Miller's first studio recording in 1981: [...] "my recording activity increased {{and by the time}} that it got into 1986–87 I was on so many records it was unbelievable until eventually it became rather overwhelming and stressful, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to cut back." [...] He did continue to record, often with musicians he had established relationships with: in 1996 he reunited with Williams to appear on what became the drummer's final recording, Young at Heart; further albums led by Kenny Garrett, Nelson, Reeves, and others were made in the period 1997–99.|$|E
500|$|After the 1983–84 season, Olajuwon {{debated whether}} {{to stay in}} college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the NBA Draft Lottery was {{introduced}} in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: [...] "I really believed that Houston {{was going to win}} the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make that decision (to leave early)." [...] His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in time, [...] Morrison was under {{pressure}} by Warner Bros. Records to produce chart singles and two albums within a year. [...] His previous album, His Band and the Street Choir, had been released in November 1970. [...] In an interview with journalist Sean O'Hagan in 1990, he described this period as being {{in contrast to the}} laid back atmosphere pictured on the album cover: [...] "When I went to the West Coast these people [...] weren't that available <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to virtually put a completely new band together overnight to do [...] So it was a very tough period. I didn't want to change my band but if I wanted to get into the studio I had to ring up and get somebody. That was the predicament I was in." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Sanz {{suffered}} a mental breakdown and took two months off {{in the middle of}} a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Mitchel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel. He commented on the situation, saying [...] "You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to pay. A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely." [...] Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which [...] "helped [...] a lot" [...] and gave him [...] "more power" [...] to perform.|$|E
500|$|Mia Wasikowska as Alice Kingsleigh. When {{creating}} the character, screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women {{were expected to}} behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite. Wasikowska read Carroll's books {{as a child and}} re-read them to prepare for her role. She also watched Jan Švankmajer's Alice. She said, [...] "When we were kids, my mum would pop it in the VCR player. We would be disturbed, and wouldn't really understand it, but we couldn't look away because it was too intriguing. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> kept that feeling about Alice, a kind of haunting feeling." [...] Although facing pressures to conform to society's expectations, Alice grows into a stronger-willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path; Independent columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls, describing the character as [...] "stubborn, brave, [...] non-girlie".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} scheduled for release, August 18, 2009, but plans were changed for unknown reasons. Legacy received main production credits on the album. In {{an interview with}} Format Magazine he said, [...] "I started making beats because I didn’t want everybody else’s sound. We wanted our own sound. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{no choice but to}} make my own beats to get that sound." [...] In an interview with Ozone Magazine, when asked about their music and the revival of the [...] "newer west" [...] movement, Ben J stated, [...] "Everything is becoming positive out here. People are growing out of that old mentality. Rapping about gangs ain’t really what it’s about out here now. Everybody is having fun."
