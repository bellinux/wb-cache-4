25|$|Lenard {{observed}} {{the variation in}} electron energy with light frequency using a powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity, and that had sufficient power to enable him to investigate the variation of potential with light frequency. His experiment directly measured potentials, not electron kinetic energy: he found the electron energy by relating it to the maximum stopping potential (voltage) in a phototube. He found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy {{is determined by the}} frequency of the light. For example, an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation – ultraviolet radiation would require a higher applied stopping potential to <b>stop</b> <b>current</b> in a phototube than blue light. However Lenard's results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidised {{in a matter of minutes}} even in the partial vacuums he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light's intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.|$|E

40|$|Midlife {{body weight}} status {{has been found}} to affect late life {{dementia}} outcomes. A cohort projections model was developed {{to assess the impact of}} midlife body mass index (BMI) profile on dementia in older Australians. A baseline projection using age-sex specific dementia prevalence rates was constructed and the results of scenarios that took account of midlife BMI were compared with those from population ageing only. This modelling predicts that if the rising trend in midlife obesity and declining trend in midlife normal weight in Australia are to be taken into account in projecting future numbers of Australians with dementia then the number of people aged 65 or more years with dementia, by 2050, would be 14 % higher than that expected from demographic ageing only. If midlife obesity prevalence was decreased to 20 % and normal weight increased to 40 % over the period of 2015 - 2025, then dementia cases among persons aged 65 - 69 years would be lower by about 10 % in 2050 compared with the "doing nothing to <b>stop</b> <b>current</b> trends in obesity" projection.

Using the Keldysh formalism, we perform the computation of the currents at finite temperature, in an expansion of derivatives of the Higgs fields. Contrary to previous works, we implement a resummation of the Higgs mass insertion effects to all orders in perturbation theory. While the components of the right-handed <b>stop</b> <b>current</b> j µ become ˜tR proportional to the difference H 2 ∂ µ H 1 −H 1 ∂ µ H 2 (suppressed by ∆β), the Higgsino currents, j µ ˜Hi, present contributions proportional to both H 2 ∂ µ H 1 ± H 1 ∂ µ H 2. For large values of the charged Higgs mass and moderate values of tan β the contribution to the source proportional to H 2 ∂ µ H 1 + H 1 ∂ µ H 2 in the diffusion equations become sizeable, although it is suppressed by the Higgsino number violating interaction rate Γ − 1 / 2 µ. For small values of the wall velocity, 0. 04 < ∼ vω < ∼ 0. 1, the total contribution leads to acceptable values of the baryon asymmetry for values of the CP-violating phases ϕCP in the range 0. 04 < ∼ |sin ϕCP | < ∼ 1.

The forces produced by nonaxisymmetric structures in the ITS linac were calculated using 3 -D simulations. The quadrupole magnetic field produced by the drive rods in the accelerating cell was obtained. This force can be corrected by a weak static magnetic quadrupole provided the current in the drive rods is constant. The octopole force produced by a 4 -hole diagnostic section was also obtained. A new recessed cathode design was modeled using PBGUNS. For a 2 mm recess, the electrostatic focusing due to the recess is sufficient to <b>stop</b> <b>current</b> loss on the anode. The emitted and transported currents are in good agreement with the measured values. The LAMDA code was compared in detail to the LLNL code BREAKUP. The codes are in close agreement. To get the results to overlay identically, however, the beam voltages have to differ by about 100 kV (out of 3 MV). The source of this discrepancy has not yet been identified. A plotting utility for LAMDA was written in the IDL{reg_sign} language. This allows LAMDA output to be viewed on any platform supported by IDL. Experiments on the flat-cathode injector were modeled. Beam radius as a function of magnet strength was compared in detail with measurements, and good agreement was obtained. The effect of the trim coil on reducing beam emittance was investigated further. The trim coil allows one to correct emittance growth due to spherical aberration in the focusing magnet and nonlinear self forces. The measured calibrations for the bucking, focus and trim coils are now in good agreement with the calculated values. A code which optimizes the transport magnet settings was developed.

The law of mass action does not force a series of chemical reactions {{to have the same}} current flow everywhere. Interruption of far-away current does not <b>stop</b> <b>current</b> everywhere in a series of chemical reactions, and so does not obey Maxwell equations. An additional constraint and equation is needed to enforce the global continuity of current flow. The additional constraint is introduced in this paper in the special case that the chemical reaction describes spatial movement through narrow channels. In that case, a fully consistent treatment is possible using a variety of models of charge movement. The general case must be dealt with by variational methods that enforce consistency of all the physical laws involved. Variational methods have only recently been developed to ensure that charge flow is conserved globally, along with mass, in dissipative systems like ions in solution or proteins. The Energy Variational Approach EnVarA should allow the development of more robust models of chemical, biochemical, and biological systems, making practical devices more easy to design and build. These difficulties arise away from equilibrium, when current flows, and the law of mass action is applied to a non-equilibrium situation, different from the systems considered when the law was originally derived. Non-equilibrium systems are important. Almost all of biology occurs away from equilibrium. Almost all devices of our technology function away from equilibrium.

40|$|Circuit {{breakers}} are {{an important}} safety feature in most electrical circuits, and they act to prevent excessive currents caused by short circuits, for example. Low-voltage current limiting circuit breakers are activated by a trip solenoid when a critical current is exceeded. The solenoid moves two contacts apart to break the circuit. However, {{as soon as the}} contacts are separated an electric arc forms between them, ionising the air in the gap, increasing the electrical conductivity of air to that of the hot plasma that forms, and current continues to flow. The currents involved may be as large as 80, 000 amperes. Critical {{to the success of the}} circuit breaker is that it is designed to cause the arc to move away from the contacts, into a widening wedge-shaped region. This lengthens the arc, and then moves it onto a series of separator plates called an arc divider or splitter. The arc divider raises the voltage required to sustain the arcs across it, above the voltage that is provided across the breaker, so that the circuit is broken and the arcing dies away. This entire process occurs in milliseconds, and is usually associated with a sound like an explosion and a bright ash from the arc. Parts of the contacts and the arc divider may melt and/or vapourise. The question to be addressed by the Study Group was to mathematically model the arc motion and extinction, with the overall aim of an improved understanding that would help the design of a better circuit breaker. Further discussion indicated that two key mechanisms are believed to contribute to the movement of the arc away from the contacts, one being self-magnetism (where the magnetic field associated with the arc and surrounding circuitry acts to push it towards the arc divider), and the other being air flow (where expansion of air combined with the design of the chamber enclosing the arc causes gas flow towards the arc divider). Further discussion also indicated that a key aspect of circuit breaker design was that it is desirable to have as fast a quenching of the arc as possible, that is, the faster the circuit breaker can act to <b>stop</b> <b>current</b> flow, the better. The relative importance of magnetic and air pressure effects on quenching speed is of central interest to circuit design...|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{forest vegetation}} {{study was conducted}} in 40 stands from Astore, Gilgit and Skardu three districts of Gilgit-Baltistan. The arboreal vegetation was analyzed using point centered quarter method while understory was sampled using circular quadrates. On the basis of phytosociological analysis following 5 communities of mixed tree species and 5 pure stands were recognized on the basis of importance value. 1) Pinus wallichiana-Juniperus community, 2) Pinus wallichiana Betula community, 3) Picea-Juniperus community, 4) Picea-Pinus wallichiana, 5) Pinus wallichiana-Pinus gerardiana community, 1) Picea smithiana pure stands, 2) Pinus wallichiana pure stands, 3) Betula pure stands, 4) Juniperus macropoda pure stand and 5) Abies pindrow pure stand. Eighty three plants species of various herbs, shrubs and seedlings of trees were observed and identified on the forest floor. Among the understory vegetation Thymus serpyllum (2. 8 - 18 %), Fragaria nubicola (3. 8 - 17. 5 %), Leontopodium leontopodinum (3. 7 - 17. 1 %), Bergenia stracheyi (1. 5 - 16. 1 %), Artemisia brevifolia (2. 7 - 15. 3 %), Bistorta affinis (2. 2 - 15. 1 %), Tanacetum artemisioides (1. 2 - 15. 2 %), Thymus linearis (6. 2 - 15. 1 %), Geranium wallichianum (6 - 15 %), Leontopodium himalayanum (3 - 14. 9 %) were abundantly distributed with the range of relative frequency respectively. Dbh size classes of each stand as well as overall size class of four dominant species i. e. Pinus wallichiana, Picea smithiana, Juniperus excelsa and Betula utilis were studied. Size class showed varied distribution patterns in different stands. Most of the deviation from an ideal distribution may be explained in terms of anthropogenic disturbances, i. e. grazing, cutting, sliding, burning and other human induced factors. Therefore, these forests {{do not appear to be}} in stable condition. It is concluded that if prompt action is not taken to <b>stop</b> <b>current</b> damaging practices, these valuable forests will vanish in a few decades. Wardâ€™s cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to investigate the relationships between soil properties and vegetation. Sixteen soil characteristics and Importance value index were taken in case of tree vegetation while in case of understory vegetation frequency of species was used to investigate the distribution pattern of vegetation. Based on Wardâ€™s cluster analysis seven groups were identified from tree vegetation data and six groups were recognized in case of understory flora. These groups clearly showed the distinct species composition and associated environmental (soil) characteristics. Relationship between vegetation and topographic factors was also studied. Wardâ€™s cluster analysis and Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were applied to seek the vegetation distribution and composition. The groups of tree and understory vegetation could be readily superimposed on DCA ordination plane. Classification and ordination showed similar distribution pattern of tree species as well as understory vegetation thereby complementing the results of each other. Modern Dendrochronological methods were applied to analyze growth rates and age estimation of Pinus wallichiana A. B. Jackson (blue pine) from the forest of Ganji valley Himalayan range of Pakistan. Twenty eight cores from 14 trees were obtained to determine age and growth rates. Pinus wallichiana showed mean age of 173 years while highest (363 years) age was recorded from 70 cm Dbh tree. The mean growth rate observed in this species ranged from 3 to 15 year/cm in case of trees while in case of seedlings showed 0. 8 to 2 while correlation between Dbh and age was significant. Correlation between age and growth rate in case of seedling found significant while in case of tree it was not significant. Dbh and age were found significant in both cases. Growth rates in every ten years interval from 1720 to 2010 also estimated. It is concluded that growth rate is gradually not significantly on every 10 year basis, however each period is significantly differs 40 to 50 years. Seedling in the past period also show that the vegetation is deteriorating with the passage of time, therefore a special attention is required to save these forests. These important forests exist under anthropogenic threat and environmental disturbances. Some of them may easily be managed as indicated by the presence of large number of seedling. However stands with paucity of seedlings shall need more serious attention. In addition ring-width chronology of 211 years (AD 1730 - 2010) was developed. Chronology statistics showed that Pinus wallichiana have the past climate signal. Strong correlation has been observed between tree growth and previous November temperature and July indicating that winter warmth is the main factor responsible for tree growth. Correlation analysis between tree ring chronology and grid data also indicates that summer temperature is useful for tree growth. Greater numbers of samples are needed to provide better results in this regard...|$|E
