5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, {{and the world is}} merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a <b>steel</b> <b>casing,</b> which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E
5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>casing),</b> which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{resistance}} tomography (ERT) {{using multiple}} electrodes installed in boreholes {{has been shown}} to be useful for both site characterization and process monitoring. In some cases, however, installing multiple downhole electrodes is too costly (e. g., deep targets) or risky (e. g., contaminated sites). For these cases we have examined the possibility of using the <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> of existing boreholes as electrodes. Several possibilities can be considered. The first case we investigated uses an array of <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> as electrodes. This results in very few data and thus requires additional constraints to limit the domain of possible inverse solutions. Simulations indicate that the spatial resolution and sensitivity are understandably low but it is possible to coarsely map the lateral extent of subsurface processes such as steam floods. The second case uses an array of traditional point borehole electrodes combined with long-conductor electrodes (<b>steel</b> <b>casings).</b> Although this arrangement provides more data, in many cases it results in poor reconstructions of test targets. Results indicate that this method may hold promise for low resolution imaging where <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> can be used as electrodes but the merits depend strongly on details of each application. Field tests using these configurations are currently being conducted...|$|R
50|$|One {{advantage}} of these boilers was the rapidity with which they could be constructed. A factor in this was their pre-fabricated <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> that were bolted together in sections. Although their potential for high pressure was not made use of, they did gain a reputation for reliability and long service between overhaul.|$|R
50|$|Three days later, on 30 March, the US Eighth Air Force {{attacked}} Valentin with Disney bombs. These {{were large}} (4500 lb) weapons with hard <b>steel</b> <b>casings,</b> rocket-assisted {{to increase their}} penetrating power. Sixty were launched but only one hit the target, causing little damage. However, considerable damage was done to installations surrounding the bunker.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers that can be opened to replace motor and pump components.|$|E
25|$|Drawing dies are {{typically}} made of tool steel, tungsten carbide, or diamond, with tungsten carbide and manufactured diamond {{being the most}} common. For drawing very fine wire a single crystal diamond die is used. For hot drawing, cast-steel dies are used. For steel wire drawing, a tungsten carbide die is used. The dies are placed in a <b>steel</b> <b>casing,</b> which backs the die and allow for easy die changes. Die angles usually range from 6–15°, and each die has at least 2 different angles: the entering angle and approach angle.|$|E
25|$|Only about 20 tonnes of caesium compounds, {{with a major}} {{contribution}} from CsCl, were being produced annually around the 1970s and 2000s worldwide. Caesium chloride enriched with caesium-137 for radiation therapy applications is produced at a single facility Mayak in the Ural Region of Russia and is sold internationally through a UK dealer. The salt is synthesized at 200°C because of its hygroscopic nature and sealed in a thimble-shaped steel container which is then enclosed into another <b>steel</b> <b>casing.</b> The sealing is required to protect the salt from moisture.|$|E
5000|$|Martlet 3B : Similar to the Martlet 3A {{but using}} <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> and {{attempting}} to solve some of the 3A model's other problems. The casings survived 5100fps, but the propellant failed at 3400fps. This was solved for later rockets by filling the propellant cavity with liquid, but only after development of the 3B model had ended.|$|R
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> for the boosters. These had been replaced by a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|R

25|$|In 1920 {{the bridge}} deck needed repair. The repairs were {{completed}} and the bridge repainted, marking {{the last time}} Lyndon Bridge was painted. In 1939 the south pier began to settle into the riverbed. The concrete piling {{and some of the}} concrete inside the pier's <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> was deteriorating. The dilapidated concrete in the casing was replaced and a new concrete footing was poured. In 1968 the abutment on which the bridge's south approach rests was repaired and a new deck installed at a cost of $6,800. The deck was again replaced in 1976 for an additional $4,500.|$|E
25|$|The {{device was}} called SHRIMP {{and had the}} same basic {{configuration}} (radiation implosion) as the Ivy Mike wet device, except with {{a different type of}} fusion fuel. SHRIMP used lithium deuteride (LiD), which is solid at room temperature; Ivy Mike used cryogenic liquid deuterium (D2), which required elaborate cooling equipment. Castle Bravo was the first test by the United States of a practical deliverable fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb), even though the TX-21 as proof-tested in the Bravo event was not weaponized. The successful test rendered obsolete the cryogenic design used by Ivy Mike and its weaponized derivative, the JUGHEAD, which was slated to be tested as the initial Castle Yankee. It also used a 7075 aluminium 9.5cm thick ballistic case. Aluminium was used to drastically reduce the bomb's weight and simultaneously to provide sufficient radiation confinement time and to raise yield, a departure from the heavy stainless <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> (304L or MIM 316L) employed by contemporary weapon-projects.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the bombs}} {{penetrated}} both Valentin's concrete roof, and its [...] thick concrete floor, {{coming to rest}} completely buried in the sand under structure's foundations. However, there were problems with the bombs. The reliability of the rocket booster ignition was considered unsatisfactory, with a failure rate of around 37% during the trials. Also, some bombs broke up on impact with the target due to flaws in the <b>steel</b> <b>casing,</b> and bombs struck at an angle, increasing the effective thickness of concrete they had to penetrate. Furthermore, {{it was noted that}} the warhead of the bomb was comparatively small, so a very large bunker complex such as Valentin would have required many penetrating hits to be sure of destroying all the contents.|$|E

25|$|The Graphite-Epoxy Motor (GEM) is a {{solid rocket}} motor {{produced}} by ATK using epoxy composite casing. GEMs are used as boosters for the Delta II, Delta III, and Delta IV launch vehicles. The use of composite materials allows for booster casings several times lighter than the <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> of the Castor 4 solid rocket motors they replaced. The first flight of a GEM occurred in 1990 on a Delta II 7925.|$|R
2500|$|Beach erosion {{threatened}} {{to undermine the}} lighthouse, and records show that a quarter-mile of beach had washed away {{in front of it}} in the 90 years since its construction. Deering had engineers inspect the tower to identify needed restoration work. They discovered that the foundations for the tower were only four feet deep. Deering ordered sandbagging {{at the base of the}} tower and the construction of jetties to try to stop the erosion. The engineers first proposed driving pilings under the lighthouse to bedrock to support the tower, but soon discovered that there was no hard bedrock. The engineers built a concrete foundation with <b>steel</b> <b>casing</b> for the tower. [...] Subsequent to the installation of the new foundation, the tower survived the eyewall of the 1926 Miami Hurricane.|$|E

40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{electrical}} resistance tomography (ERT) work {{performed at the}} Hanford Reservation, 200 East Area Vadose test (Sisson and Lu) site during the period March 23 through May 5, 2001. The purposes of the ERT work were to: (1) Compare and contrast {{the development of the}} highly concentrated sodium thiosulfate plume (FY 01 work) with the fresh river water plume observed during FY 00. (2) Use the resistance images to infer the dynamics of the plume during two or three of the sodium thio-sulfate releases and during the water ''chaser'' release. (3) Determine the influence of the site's <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> on the ability to construct reliable ERT images. (4) Determine if the <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> at the site can be used as long electrodes to provide useful images of at least one release. (5) Develop quantitative estimates of the noise in the data and its effect on reconstructed images. Eleven electrode arrays (nine electrodes arrays available for the FY 00 work), each with 15 electrodes, were installed at the site. These were used to perform 3 D surveys before, during, and after 3 different spills...|$|R

50|$|With a site {{consisting}} of 25 m of reclaimed land {{on top of}} 15 m of alluvial clay, piles were designed to be 40 m long. To prevent the building sinking into the ground if an earthquake caused liquefaction of the ground, the top 10 m of the piles were designed as precast concrete piles with <b>steel</b> <b>casings.</b> In order to prevent the building from rising up due to buoyancy the piles were cast with a ground floor slab 1.6 - 2.5 m thick to provide sufficient weight.|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{flux leakage}} {{measurements}} help identify the position, {{size and shape}} of corrosion-related defects in <b>steel</b> <b>casings</b> used to protect boreholes drilled into oil and gas reservoirs. Images constructed from magnetic flux leakage data contain patterns related to noise inherent in the method. We investigate the patterns and their scaling properties for the case of delta-correlated input noise, and consider the implications for the method's ability to resolve defects. The analytical evaluation of the noise-produced patterns is made possible by model reduction facilitated by large-scale approximation. With appropriate modification, the approach can be employed to analyze noise-produced patterns in other situations where the data of interest are not measured directly, but are related to the measured data by a complex linear transform involving integrations with respect to spatial coordinates.

40|$|A Gamma Spectroscopy Logging System (GSLS) {{has been}} {{developed}} to study sub-surface radionuclide contamination. The absolute counting efficiencies of the GSLS detectors were determined using cylindrical reference sources. More complex borehole geometries were modeled using commercially available shielding software and correction factors were developed based on relative gamma-ray fluence rates. Examination of varying porosity and moisture content showed that as porosity increases, and as the formation saturation ratio decreases, relative gamma-ray fluence rates increase linearly for all energies. Correction factors for iron and water cylindrical shields were found to agree well with correction factors determined during previous studies allowing {{for the development of}} correction factors for type- 304 stainless steel and low-carbon <b>steel</b> <b>casings.</b> Regression analyses of correction factor data produced equations for determining correction factors applicable to spectral gamma-ray well logs acquired under non-standard borehole conditions...|$|R
