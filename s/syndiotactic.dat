25|$|Commercial {{synthesis}} of <b>syndiotactic</b> polypropylene {{is carried out}} {{with the use of}} a special class of metallocene catalysts.

These complexes are converted to polymerization catalysts by activating them with a special organoaluminum cocatalyst, methylaluminoxane (MAO).|$|E
25|$|A Ziegler-Natta {{catalyst}} is able {{to restrict}} linking of monomer molecules to a specific regular orientation, either isotactic, when all methyl groups are positioned at the same side {{with respect to the}} backbone of the polymer chain, or <b>syndiotactic,</b> when the positions of the methyl groups alternate. Commercially available isotactic polypropylene is made with two types of Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The first group of the catalysts encompasses solid (mostly supported) catalysts and certain types of soluble metallocene catalysts. Such isotactic macromolecules coil into a helical shape; these helices then line up next to one another to form the crystals that give commercial isotactic polypropylene many of its desirable properties.|$|E

50|$|Natta {{first used}} {{polymerization}} catalysts based on titanium chlorides to polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes. He discovered that these polymers are crystalline materials and ascribed their crystallinity {{to a special}} feature of the polymer structure called stereoregularity. The concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in {{the picture on the}} left with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be isotactic or <b>syndiotactic</b> depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units −CH2−CHR−, like the CH3 groups in the figure. In the isotactic polymers, all stereogenic centers CHR share the same configuration. The stereogenic centers in <b>syndiotactic</b> polymers alternate their relative configuration. A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called atactic. Both isotactic and <b>syndiotactic</b> polypropylene are crystalline, whereas atactic polypropylene, which can also be prepared with special Ziegler-Natta catalysts, is amorphous. The stereoregularity of the polymer is determined by the catalyst used to prepare it.|$|E

50|$|Atactic {{polymers}} are technologically very important. A {{good example}} is polystyrene (PS). If a special catalyst is used in its synthesis {{it is possible to}} obtain the <b>syndiotactic</b> version of this polymer, but most industrial polystyrene produced is atactic. The two materials have very different properties because the irregular structure of the atactic version makes it impossible for the polymer chains to stack in a regular fashion. The result is that, whereas <b>syndiotactic</b> PS is a semicrystalline material, the more common atactic version cannot crystallize and forms a glass instead. This example is quite general in that many polymers of economic importance are atactic glass formers.|$|E
50|$|Tacticity {{describes}} the relative stereochemistry of chiral centers in neighboring structural units within a macromolecule. There are three types: isotactic (all substituents {{on the same}} side), atactic (random placement of substituents), and <b>syndiotactic</b> (alternating placement of substituents).|$|E
50|$|The {{geometry}} of the metallocene catalyst will determine the sequence of chirality in the chain, as in, atactic, <b>syndiotactic,</b> isotactic, as well as average block length, molecular weight and distribution. These characteristics will in turn govern the microstructure of the blend.|$|E
50|$|Two {{molecules}} of lactic acid can be dehydrated to lactide, a cyclic lactone. A variety of catalysts can polymerise lactide to either heterotactic or <b>syndiotactic</b> polylactide, which as biodegradable polyesters with valuable (inter alia) medical properties are currently attracting much attention.|$|E
50|$|Two {{molecules}} of lactic acid can be dehydrated to the lactone lactide. In {{the presence of}} catalysts lactide polymerize to either atactic or <b>syndiotactic</b> polylactide (PLA), which are biodegradable polyesters. PLA {{is an example of}} a plastic that is not derived from petrochemicals.|$|E
50|$|One {{potential}} {{application of}} ansa-metallocenes is in polymerisation reactions. Specifically, the ansa bridge allows greater {{control of the}} stereochemistry at the metal centre. For example, three distinct ansa-zirconocene dichloride catalysts used in the synthesis of polypropylene {{in the presence of}} methylaluminoxane (MAO) can be used to direct whether the product is <b>syndiotactic,</b> isotactic, or atactic.|$|E
50|$|In eutactic macromolecules, substituents may occupy any {{specific}} (but potentially complex) sequence of positions along the chain. Isotactic and <b>syndiotactic</b> polymers are instances {{of the more}} general class of eutactic polymers, which also includes heterogeneous macromolecules in which the sequence consists of substituents of different kinds (for example, the side-chains in proteins and the bases in nucleic acids).|$|E
50|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of macromolecules can {{be defined}} even more precisely {{with the introduction of}} triads. An isotactic triad (mm) is made up of two adjacent meso diads, a <b>syndiotactic</b> triad {rr} consists of two adjacent racemo diads and a heterotactic triad (rm) is composed of a meso diad adjacent to a racemo diad. The mass fraction of isotactic (mm) triads is a common quantitative measure of tacticity.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{synthesis}} of <b>syndiotactic</b> polypropylene {{is carried out}} {{with the use of}} a special class of metallocene catalysts. They employ bridged bis-metallocene complexes of the type bridge-(Cp1)(Cp2)ZrCl2 where the first Cp ligand is the cyclopentadienyl group, the second Cp ligand is the fluorenyl group, and the bridge between the two Cp ligands is -CH2-CH2-, >SiMe2, or >SiPh2. These complexes are converted to polymerization catalysts by activating them with a special organoaluminum cocatalyst, methylaluminoxane (MAO).|$|E
50|$|After he {{discovered}} the stereo control of polyisoprene, {{he discovered}} the polymerization and stereo control of butadiene {{as well as many}} other alkylbutadienes. The polymerization of butadiene can lead to three basic structures: the cis-1,4- and the trans-1,4-polybutadienes, and the 1,2-polybutadiene with a vinyl side group. From these three basic structures, there are five structurally different polymers: the cis and trans 1,4-polybutadienes, and the isotactic, <b>syndiotactic,</b> and atactic 1,2-polybutadienes. All of these polymers have been isolated in pure form.|$|E
50|$|The {{melting point}} of {{polypropylene}} occurs at a range, so a {{melting point is}} determined by finding the highest temperature of a differential scanning calorimetry chart. Perfectly isotactic PP has a melting point of 171 C. Commercial isotactic PP has a melting point that ranges from 160 to 166 C, depending on atactic material and crystallinity. <b>Syndiotactic</b> PP with a crystallinity of 30% has a melting point of 130 C. Below 0 °C, PP becomes brittle.|$|E
50|$|These {{catalysts}} are metallocenes {{together with}} a cocatalyst, typically MAO, −O−Al(CH3)n−. The idealized metallocene catalysts have the composition Cp2MCl2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) such as titanocene dichloride. Typically, the organic ligands are derivatives of cyclopentadienyl. In some complexes, the two cyclopentadiene (Cp) rings are linked with bridges, like −CH2−CH2− or >SiPh2. Depending {{of the type of}} their cyclopentadienyl ligands, for example by using an ansa-bridge, metallocene catalysts can produce either isotactic or <b>syndiotactic</b> polymers of propylene and other 1-alkenes.|$|E
50|$|Crystalline {{polymers}} {{are usually}} opaque because of light scattering on the numerous boundaries between the crystalline and amorphous regions. The density of such boundaries is lower {{and thus the}} transparency is higher either for low (amorphous polymer) or high (crystalline) degree of crystallinity. For example, atactic polypropylene is usually amorphous and transparent while <b>syndiotactic</b> polypropylene, which has crystallinity ~50%, is opaque. Crystallinity also affects dyeing of polymers: crystalline polymers {{are more difficult to}} stain than amorphous ones because the dye molecules penetrate much easier through amorphous regions.|$|E
50|$|A Ziegler-Natta {{catalyst}} is able {{to restrict}} linking of monomer molecules to a specific regular orientation, either isotactic, when all methyl groups are positioned at the same side {{with respect to the}} backbone of the polymer chain, or <b>syndiotactic,</b> when the positions of the methyl groups alternate. Commercially available isotactic polypropylene is made with two types of Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The first group of the catalysts encompasses solid (mostly supported) catalysts and certain types of soluble metallocene catalysts. Such isotactic macromolecules coil into a helical shape; these helices then line up next to one another to form the crystals that give commercial isotactic polypropylene many of its desirable properties.|$|E
5000|$|Coordination {{polymerisation}} {{is a form}} of {{addition polymerization}} in which monomer adds to a growing macromolecule through an organometallic active center. The development of this polymerization technique started in the 1950s with heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts based on titanium tetrachloride and an aluminium co-catalyst such as methylaluminoxane. Coordination polymerization has a great impact on the physical properties of vinyl polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene compared to the same polymers prepared by other techniques such as free-radical polymerization. The polymers tend to be linear and not branched and have much higher molar mass. Coordination type polymers are also stereoregular and can be isotactic or <b>syndiotactic</b> instead of just atactic. This tacticity introduces crystallinity in otherwise amorphous polymers. From these differences in polymerization type the distinction originates between low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or even ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE).|$|E
