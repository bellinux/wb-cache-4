5|$|Although the old Cleveland Railway had not {{provided}} any passenger services, during the 1870s the NER built {{a number of}} stations at {{the eastern end of}} the line. Passenger services began from Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875, plus Boosbeck in 1878. The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough. It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town, leaving that instead to the M, which provided only a single-platform <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of its line into the town. This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove. After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed, the eastbound line was joined with the M line, leaving Guisborough railway <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of a spur. Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{railways}} in Weymouth was that until 1987 main-line trains ran though the streets and along the Weymouth Harbour Tramway to the Quay <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern end of the harbour, to connect with ferries to mainland Europe. Due to declining business, goods traffic ceased in 1972, but passenger services continued until they ceased in 1987 from lack of use.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 was {{launched}} at 13:57:04 UTC on 8 April 2010. Following a successful launch, CryoSat-2 {{separated from the}} upper stage of the Dnepr into a low Earth orbit. The first signals from the satellite were detected by a ground <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Broglio Space Centre in Malindi, Kenya, seventeen minutes after launch.|$|E

50|$|In 1940, Fort Eben-Emael was {{commanded}} by Major Jottrand. There were around 1,200 Belgian troops <b>stationed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fort, {{divided into three}} groups. The first group was permanently <b>stationed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fort and consisted of 200 technical personnel (e.g. doctors, cooks, weapon maintenance technicians, administration staff). The two other groups consisted of 500 artillerists each. In peace time one group would be <b>stationed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fort for one week. The other group would be in reserve <b>at</b> <b>the</b> village of Wonck, about 5 km away. These two groups would change places every week.|$|R

5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, introduced car parking charges. It was {{noted that this}} resulted in less use of the car parks, more local street parking and caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005.|$|E

5|$|Old Kent Road railway <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} end of the road opened in 1866 and closed in 1917. The London City Fire Brigade opened a fire station on the road around 1868. It was subsumed into the London Fire Brigade from its formation and in 1904 was replaced by a new station which was in turn replaced by another on the corner of Coopers Road. The station was demolished for redevelopment in 2014 and reopened the following year.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment <b>Station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Minnesota has {{introduced}} a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin.

5|$|The {{station was}} {{important}} for transport along the coast until 1944, when {{the completion of the}} Sørland Line made Flekkefjord a branch <b>station.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the line was converted to standard gauge, the number of station tracks was reduced, and the station received an overhaul. The station building was demolished in 1970, but the station was still served until the line closed in 1990. The tracks and depot buildings still exist.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} {{plans to add}} a 4.4 kilometre commuter cable car service to Haifa's public transport system, running from HaMifratz Central Bus <b>Station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of Mount Carmel to the Technion, {{and then to the}} University of Haifa.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the cargo module.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Westside MAX {{project began}} in 1993. In November 1996, Hillsboro and TriMet named the yet-to-be-completed <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{western end of}} the project as the Mark O. Hatfield Government Center Station. Hatfield was {{retiring}} from 30 years as U.S. Senator and previously used his political clout as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure funding for the project. In June 1998, after completion of the station but prior to its opening, government officials held a dedication ceremony at the station. Retired U. S. Senator Mark Hatfield was in attendance as the station was officially dedicated in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Metrorail's 23rd station, Miami Central Station at Miami International Airport, {{began in}} May 2009; service began on July 28, 2012. A new Orange Line was launched, which {{runs from the}} airport and merges with the Green Line at Earlington Heights Station, where the two run {{concurrently}} to Dadeland South <b>Station.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> new Miami Central Station, the Orange Line connects with the new MIA Mover which runs directly into the central terminal of the airport. Miami International Airport has over 35 million annual passengers is the county's largest employer. Thus the Orange Line is believed to create {{a significant increase in}} Metrorail ridership. The new Miami Central Station is expected to eventually attract 7,500 daily passengers to Metrorail. The project was completed on time and under budget.|$|E

5|$|Currently under {{construction}} are dedicated lanes for bus services which will operate {{as part of}} the new urban rapid transit network (bus rapid transit). The system includes high-quality stations and stops; express buses that can carry more than 120 passengers and will run on a three-minute frequency during peak hours along Amman's busiest corridors; terminals and park-n-ride facilities; and an integrated fare collection system allowing passengers to pay the fare at stations before embarking on the bus. The BRT is planned to run along three major corridors. The first one connects Sweileh with Mahatta via Sport City, with a major underground <b>station</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Jordan. The second corridor connects Sport City with Downtown Amman at Ras El-Ain. The third corridor connects Customs Square with Mahatta.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{increase}} in people hit by trains in 2013, in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and strategies to eliminate {{the number of people}} hit by trains. Closed-circuit television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that <b>station.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> unidentified station, tests have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.|$|E
5|$|Following US 30, Route 73 {{passes through}} a small corner of Berlin Boro before it goes under New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line near the Atco <b>station.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{railroad}} crossing, the route enters Berlin Township and meets CR 534 at a crossroad. After the intersection with this route, the road proceeds back into Berlin Boro, where the route runs through a mix of residences and businesses. Route 73 widens to a six-lane highway and comes to the former Berlin Circle, where it meets both CR 689 and CR 708. From here, the road turns north and reenters Berlin Township as a four-lane divided highway, continuing through developed areas and intersecting CR 692. Prior to the junction with CR 693, the route enters Voorhees Township, where it encounters CR 675.|$|E
