25|$|Hulk Elvis {{is a work}} {{series by}} Jeff Koons created between 2004 and 2014. The works range from precision-machined bronze sculptures—inspired by an {{inflatable}} of the popular comic book hero and extruded in three dimensions—to large-scale oil paintings. The work series’ title combines the popular comic book hero Hulk with the pop icon Elvis. The triple image of the Hulk figure recalls Andy Warhol's <b>silk-screen</b> printing Triple Elvis (1963), regarding both the multiplication and the posture of the Hulk figure.|$|E
25|$|He loved celebrities, so {{he painted}} them as well. From these {{beginnings}} he developed his later style and subjects. Instead {{of working on}} a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked {{more and more on}} a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used silk-screening; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his <b>silk-screen</b> multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.|$|E
25|$|The {{paintings}} {{started with}} and still mostly based on traditional designs from pottery {{although there has}} been innovation since then. Painted designs began focusing on birds and flowers on the paper. Experimentation led to landscape painting, especially scenes related to rural life such as farming, fishing, weddings, funerals and religious festivals. It even has included the painting of picture frames. Some painters have become famous in their own right for their work. Painter Nicolás de Jesús, from Ameyaltepec has gained international recognition for his paintings, exhibiting abroad in countries such as France, Germany, England and Italy. His works generally touch on themes such as death, oppression of indigenous peoples and various references to popular culture in his local community. Others have innovated ways to speed up the work, such as using <b>silk-screen</b> techniques to make multiple copies.|$|E

2500|$|His {{most popular}} and {{critically}} successful film was Chelsea Girls (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two 16 mm-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that [...] "story" [...] while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal <b>silk-screen</b> works of the early 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Warhol was {{an early}} adopter of the silk screen printmaking process as a {{technique}} for making paintings. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his [...] "blotted line" [...] technique, [...] applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s <b>silk-screen</b> canvas. In his book , Warhol writes, [...] "When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something." ...|$|E
2500|$|This tour is {{particularly}} notable {{for the two}} concerts performed by the band at the Wembley Empire Pool, Wembley Park, dubbed the [...] "Electric Magic" [...] shows.

The concerts also incorporated supporting acts such as Stone the Crows, which was a rare event for Led Zeppelin {{at this point in}} their career. [...] A colour poster was sold to fans at the concerts for 30p, which is now a rare and highly sought-after collectible. An altered version of the poster was created for a two coloured <b>silk-screen</b> T-shirt print in 2010 for an official Led Zeppelin T-shirt.|$|E
