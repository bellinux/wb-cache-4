5|$|Sarah and Queen Anne {{never made}} up their differences, {{although}} one eyewitness claimed to have heard Anne asking whether the Marlboroughs had reached the shore, leading to rumours that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> them home herself. Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714 at Kensington Palace; the Protestant Whig Privy Councillors had insisted on their right to be present, preventing Henry St. John, the first Viscount Bolingbroke from declaring for the Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart. The Marlboroughs returned home {{on the afternoon of}} Anne's death. The Act of Settlement of 1701 ensured a Protestant succession by passing over more than fifty stronger Roman Catholic claimants and proclaiming Georg Ludwig, Elector of Hanover (the great grandson of James I through Georg's mother Sophia of Hanover), King George I of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Under {{this new}} ownership, Mary Celeste sailed {{mainly in the}} West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, {{regularly}} losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> to seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging {{the idea that the}} ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, in his study of the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{was outside}} her house {{talking with the}} {{neighbor}} to whom she had already complained about Bonie's extortion efforts {{on the evening of}} July 31. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> 9-1-1 about Bonie twice that day. She had been eating a mango, and offered the neighbor one. After the neighbor accepted, Moore returned to her house to get the fruit. She never came out with the mango, and was never seen alive again by anyone who has discussed the sighting publicly.|$|E

5000|$|While this {{stance is}} seen as {{extremely}} liberal in Egypt, Kotb's beliefs about sexuality tend to be conservative by Western standards. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>called</b> homosexuality a [...] "disorder ... an acquired thing", and compared homosexuals to [...] "the alcoholics and the drug-takers". [...] Although <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>called</b> for women to explore their bodies, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> also stated that women {{do not need to}} masturbate, discouraging the practice by saying that [...] "a woman has to remain blank until she gets married and by masturbating she's forming her sexuality." ...|$|R

25|$|During this period, Earhart became {{involved}} with The Ninety-Nines, an organization of female pilots providing moral support and advancing the cause of women in aviation. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> a meeting of female pilots in 1929 following the Women's Air Derby. She suggested the name {{based on the number}} of the charter members; she later became the organization's first president in 1930. Earhart was a vigorous advocate for female pilots and when the 1934 Bendix Trophy Race banned women, she openly refused to fly screen actress Mary Pickford to Cleveland to open the races.|$|E
25|$|Police interviewed Bishop's husband, James Anderson, {{after it}} was {{determined}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> him to pick her up after the shooting; they did not charge him with a crime. In addition, a neighbor revealed, in later interviews, that he saw the couple leaving their home with duffle bags on Friday afternoon, (revealed to be martial arts bags) prior to the shooting. Anderson revealed that his wife had borrowed the gun used in the shooting, and that he had escorted her to an indoor shooting range in the weeks prior to the incident.|$|E
25|$|During {{his stay}} in Italy, he {{received}} a letter from the mother of his fiancée, Camille Moke, informing him that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> off their engagement. Instead her daughter was to marry Camille Pleyel (son of Ignaz Pleyel), a rich piano manufacturer. Enraged, Berlioz decided to return to Paris and take revenge on Pleyel, his fiancée, and her mother by killing all three of them. He created an elaborate plan, {{going so far as to}} purchase a dress, wig and hat with a veil (with which he was to disguise himself as a woman in order to gain entry to their home). He even stole a pair of double-barrelled pistols from the Academy to kill them with, saving a single shot for himself. Planning out his action with great care, Berlioz purchased phials of strychnine and laudanum to use as poisons in the event of a pistol jamming.|$|E

25|$|While Erica {{tries to}} protect her daughters {{throughout}} the trial, she lashes out at them for keeping the truth from her. Bianca gives birth to a daughter named Miranda in 2004, at a cabin which Bianca and Babe became stranded at during a thunderstorm. After a difficult birth for Bianca, Babe Carey goes to get help and ends up going into labor herself. Babe gives birth to a son {{with the help of}} her former husband Paul Cramer, whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> for help. During the commotion, Paul secretly kidnaps Babe's son and gives her Miranda instead, whilst claiming to Bianca that her daughter perished in a helicopter crash, which he had staged. Miranda is renamed Bess. Bianca grieves for her lost child, and even tries to kidnap Bess, not realizing she is her actual daughter. As she mourns, Bianca and Kendall become close with their mother again. When Bianca discovers the truth, she attempts to reclaim her daughter, but falls from a balcony during a scuffle with Miranda's acting father, JR Chandler, and ends up comatose. Miranda is later returned to Bianca, causing her to awake from her coma. Bianca never remembers how she fell, whether or not JR pushed her, but she holds him responsible for her fall. In addition, Bianca cannot forgive Babe, who had previously discovered Miranda/Bess's true maternity, but could not part with the child.|$|E
500|$|Mostly, Bessie was uncompromising in her {{attitude}} towards the council's ruling Conservatives; on one occasion she was ejected from the council chamber by the police, after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> the Housing Committee chairman a liar and refused the mayor's order to withdraw the remark. She justified this behaviour {{on the grounds that}} [...] "if you didn't do something outrageous, nobody would take any notice of you". She had earlier resorted to using a two-foot megaphone in a council meeting, to demand action over housing conditions and slums.|$|E
500|$|Douglas adopted Boddy's [...] "Tricky Dick" [...] {{nickname}} for Nixon, and {{also referred to}} him as [...] "pee wee". Her name-calling {{had an effect on}} Nixon: when told <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> him [...] "a young man with a dark shirt" [...] in an allusion to Nazism, he inquired, [...] "Did she say that? Why, I'll castrate her." [...] Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that {{it would be difficult to}} do, and Nixon replied that he would do it anyway. Nixon returned the attacks; at friendly gatherings and especially at all-male events, he stated that Douglas was [...] "pink right down to her underwear".|$|E

500|$|Alexander's {{parents were}} not so happy about the match. Sophia disapproved of her son marrying a commoner, while Constantine wanted a delay but was {{prepared}} to be his son's best man if Alexander would be patient. Alexander visited Paris {{at the end of}} 1918, raising hopes among his family that {{they would be able to}} contact him once he was outside Greece. When Queen Sophia attempted to telephone her son in his Parisian hotel, a minister intercepted the call and informed her that [...] "His Majesty is sorry, but he cannot respond to the telephone". He was not even informed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called.</b>|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, in her {{review for}} TrekNation, {{said that it}} wasn't {{as good as the}} {{previous}} episode and thought that there were plot holes. She felt that some of the episode featured bad science, such as when Tucker was transferred between the two ships. She also criticised Archer going down to the Klingon base on his own, calling him a [...] "putz" [...] and said of the Klingon attack, [...] "since when do Klingons destroy ships with deadly subroutines rather than, you know, BOMBS?" [...] She thought the characterisation was forced, and wanted a better resolution to the events in [...] "Affliction" [...] which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> [...] "one of the greatest hours of Star Trek ever". Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", gave the episode a score of two out of four, saying that the battle scenes were [...] "painfully routine" [...] and that where the episode [...] "runs off the rails is in these final 10 minutes". He felt that it was a pattern of the final episodes in story arcs not having a [...] "satisfying finish" [...] and that [...] "Divergence" [...] followed in this pattern set by [...] "The Augments" [...] and [...] "The Aenar". The two part story in [...] "Affliction" [...] and [...] "Divergence" [...] were subsequently ranked the fifth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt.|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} of ghostwriter Pamela Cockerill, Mills {{wrote a book about}} her {{experience}} titled Out on a Limb (1995), which was republished in the United States as A Single Step (2002). Extracts from Out on a Limb were serialised in The Daily Mail in March 2000. Mills handed all the proceeds from the book to Adopt-A-Minefield, and stated {{that it was one of}} [...] "the few charities that 100% of their donations goes to clear minefields and survivor assistance". In 1995, Mills got engaged to British media executive Marcus Stapleton, after being together for 16 days, and was then engaged to respected documentary filmmaker Chris Terrill in 1999, after 12 days in Cambodia, where they were making a film about landmines. Mills ended their relationship five days before their planned wedding day, later telling friends in the media that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> the wedding off because Terrill was gay, an MI6 agent, and that his mission was to sabotage her anti-landmine work. Terrill had once told Mills that he had been interviewed by the intelligence services when he was thinking of a career with the Foreign Office, but later said, [...] "I soon realised that Heather [...] had a somewhat elastic relationship with the truth, which she was able to stretch impressively sometimes". Terrill also claims that although Mills said she was a vegetarian at the time, she often cooked her speciality dish, Lancashire hotpot, which contains lamb, for him; and her former sister-in-law, Dianna Karmal, claims that Mills became a vegetarian after meeting McCartney.|$|E

2500|$|Diaghilev {{was known}} as a hard, demanding, even {{frightening}} taskmaster. Ninette de Valois, no shrinking violet, said she was too afraid to ever look him in the face. George Balanchine said he carried around a cane during rehearsals, and banged it angrily when he was displeased. Other dancers said he would shoot them down with one look, or a cold comment. On the other hand, he was capable of great kindness, and when stranded with his bankrupt company in Spain during the 1914–18 war, gave his last bit of cash to Lydia Sokolova to buy medical care for her daughter. Alicia Markova was very young when she joined the Ballet Russes and would later say that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> Diaghilev [...] "Sergypops" [...] and he had said he would take care of her like a daughter.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} that Criswell's body was identified on February 11, 2015. Her estranged aunt and uncle, who at first were hoping she was still alive, eventually turned to online databases, to search through unidentified persons cases after their hope dwindled. Criswell was never reported missing by her family members, which is most likely a major reason why she remained unnamed for decades. Because of her history of running away from home, her family made the assumption that she would [...] "contact them when she wanted to," [...] as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> her sister once after departing. The pair began to search through cases in Arizona, as they eventually learned that Criswell {{had been given a}} bus ticket by Knight to the area that she was later found dead. It is believed that the two were in a romantic relationship, although Knight was considerably older than Criswell. Knight is also believed to have purchased the bus ticket that transported the victim to Tucson, according to her family.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2010, {{the band}} began their five-date {{acoustic}} [...] "An Intimate Evening With" [...] tour in Munich, their first concert tour in eight years. The stripped-down club tour {{was inspired by}} a 2003 special acoustic concert, and saw the band performing songs from all of their five studio albums. Band member Benaissa did not take part in the tour as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> in sick a week before, prompting the remaining trio to re-arrange their set at the last minute. Generally well received by the media, the tour was initially said to be extended in 2011. In September 2010, it was announced that Benaissa had left following her two-year suspended sentence and 300 hours of community service a month before, leaving the band as a trio. Currently pausing, the remaining three members of the band were said to released a live album in 2011. This project and other plans announced for the tenth anniversary of the band failed to materialize in favor of individual solo project however Diakovska confirmed, that the band had dissolved again with no new commercial projects planned.|$|E

2500|$|The then-unidentified woman's {{photograph}} was circulated {{to the public}} in late 2014 after authorities made the connection between it and the reconstruction. Authorities noted that the background scenery appeared to be from somewhere in the Eastern part of the country, most notably at a former camping area in Tyngsboro, Massachusetts. On December 23, 2014, her brother, Bill Gerow, Jr, received a notification from police that the female in the picture could be his sister. Gerow hadn't been seen since 1980 after she left the state voluntarily with Kalhauser, with whom she was in a relationship at the approximate age of 20 years. She had reportedly met her accused killer while at a nightclub. She had never explained the reason for her departure, although her family did believe she had [...] "run off." [...] Her brother stated that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> him around two to three weeks afterward while residing in New Mexico. After this occasion, she was never heard from again, although her family continued efforts to locate her. The victim could not have officially been reported missing due to being over the age of 18 and that she had apparently left on her own accord.|$|E
2500|$|As Matthew tracked {{parallel}} to the Florida coast, it left over one million people without power across the state of Florida. In Jacksonville it caused major sand dune damage and flooding in the St. Johns River. It also destroyed many properties and knocked out power for nearly 250,000 electrical customers. In Indialantic, Florida, firefighters exposed themselves to the storm's winds {{to put out a}} fire, which reportedly destroyed a greenhouse. In Florida, one woman died due to a heart attack; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>called</b> for aid, but medical services were not able to arrive due to Matthew's high winds. Another two women were killed by falling trees. In the Flagler Beach area, a portion of Florida State Road A1A was washed away. At Kennedy Space Center, winds reached [...] at ground level while a gust of [...] was observed atop a [...] tower. The facility suffered several million dollars-worth of damage, though overall impacts were less than anticipated. The roof of Operations Support Building II broke, and rainwater damaged the interior. Air conditioning was lost throughout Launch Complex 39 as well. The planned launches of GOES-R, NOAA's next generation weather satellite, and CYGNSS, a cluster of smaller satellites which study hurricanes, were delayed due to the suspension of operations during Matthew.|$|E
