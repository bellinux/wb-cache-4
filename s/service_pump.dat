50|$|The {{distribution}} system of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) {{is one of}} the largest in the United States. As of June 2003, DWU provided retail water service to just over 1.2 million people within the Dallas city limits. The major {{distribution system}} facilities include 28 pump stations (including the high <b>service</b> <b>pump</b> stations at the three water treatment plants), 11 ground storage reservoirs, 9 elevated tanks, and 78 vault structures separate from the major facilities, in addition to over 4600 mi of distribution and transmission main. The distribution system is divided into 17 pressure zones to maintain adequate water pressures throughout the system. There are four major pressure zones (Central Low,North High, East High, and South High), and five smaller secondary pressure zones (Meandering Way High, Red Bird High, Trinity Heights, Pleasant Grove, and Cedardale) which comprise most of the Dallas service area. Each of the nine major and secondarypressure zones are supplied by one or more pump stations and have elevated or ground storage facilities that establish the static hydraulic gradient for each zone. The remaining eight pressure zones are supplied from an adjacent pressure zone via pressure reducing valve, or single, small booster pump station. These pressure zones do not have storage facilities that establish their static hydraulic gradient.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years Baden's water supply was {{obtained}} from wells and cisterns; the first pumping station was installed about 1830.

This plant went into service in 1895. The third pumping station, in Baden in 1898, was high service and was on a conduit line from Chain of Rocks to Bissell's Point. In 1905 seven foot conduits was built to Chain of Rocks. At that point Baden reservoir was constructed. All the pumping stations were joined by an electric and steam railroad by the water department.|$|R
50|$|The Chestnut Hill Reservoir {{was built}} between 1865 and 1870 to {{supplement}} {{the capacity of the}} Brookline Reservoir, which was then the terminus of the Cochituate Aqueduct. The Sudbury Aqueduct was completed in 1878, providing water to the reservoir from the Sudbury River in Boston's western suburbs. Its terminal chamber, a single-story granite Romanesque structure with a hip roof, stands across Beacon Street from the reservoir, and houses gates for controlling flow into the reservoir from both the Cochituate Aqueduct (now defunct) and the Sudbury Aqueduct (in backup service), and from the reservoir to the Brookline Reservoir.
