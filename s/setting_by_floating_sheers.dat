40|$|The LHC {{will open}} a whole new window on {{supersymmetry}} (SUSY) searches, probing energies where also the Standard Model (SM) behavior is unknown. To find evidence for physics beyond the SM like SUSY, the first challenge is to understand the backgrounds from SM processes at high energy. To this end we present a method that determines the background using as little information from Monte Carlo simulation as possible. We construct three-dimensional models for the three main backgrounds. These models are created such that known and understood physics features, like a top or W mass peak, are incorporated. We parametrize these models, and fit them to our data <b>set.</b> <b>By</b> <b>floating</b> the shape parameters in the models, we minimize our dependence on the Monte Carlo information. We can show that this method can determine {{the composition of the}} background accurately. By fitting to the data in a control (sideband) region, with low S/B, and extrapolating to a region with high S/B, we can reliably predict the expected number of background events in the signal region, and determine the significance when an excess caused by SUSY events would be found. We can show that this method works even when SUSY events contaminate the control region...|$|R
50|$|Born in Santa Lucia, Naples to an Italian father, Salvatore, and an Australian mother, Carolyn, {{he moved}} to Australia {{at the age of}} three, coming back to Italy at six. Rosolino {{declared}} about his beginnings as a swimmer:I learned to <b>float</b> <b>by</b> <b>sheer</b> chance at the age of 4. Instead of the common arm floating bands, they made me swim with a headboard. Unfortunately it had a hole, and by the time I finally got out of the small and deep pool, the headboard had drowned... The first real swimming course I took was when I was 6 years old, and after that, lesson by lesson, I got to the pre-competition level. I always had a hard life, even though I was physically well-built, I always had to fight to become number 1, and even though I won a lot of races, I remember every race with emotion: the first regional championships, the national ones, the Young Europeans, and of course all the stomach aches I had.|$|R
40|$|We derive a {{renormalization}} group formalism for the Randall-Sundrum scenario, {{where the}} renormalization scale is <b>set</b> <b>by</b> a <b>floating</b> compactification radius. While {{inspired by the}} AdS/CFT conjecture, our results are derived concretely within higher-dimensional effective field theory. Matching theories with different radii leads to running hidden brane couplings. The hidden brane Lagrangian consists of four-dimensional local operators constructed from the induced value of the bulk fields on the brane. We find hidden Lagrangians which are non-trivial fixed points of the RG flow. Calculations in RS 1 can be greatly simplified by ``running down'' the effective theory to a small radius. We demonstrate these simplifications by studying the Goldberger-Wise stabilization mechanism. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} classical and tree-level quantum field theory of bulk scalar fields, which demonstrates the essential features of the RG in the simplest context.

50|$|When {{the work}} on bridges began beyond Knights Key, Coe {{outsourced}} {{the setting of the}} steel to various contractors. As this method proved unsuccessful, the operations were put exclusively in the hands of Coes own men. The deck girder spans were brought to the piers on barges, and were then lifted and <b>set</b> in place <b>by</b> <b>floating</b> derricks. The railway gangers completed their tasks in less than half the time taken by the contractors. On one occasion, six spans were placed in position within four hours, while on another the laborers erected a span in twenty minutes. The Bahia Honda bridge was built by means of temporary timber framework and an overhead travelling crane. The precautions taken to ensure the workers safety were such that not a life was lost during the erection of the 32,900 ft. of steel that went to the building of Knights Key and Bahia Honda bridges.|$|R

40|$|This {{data set}} {{describes}} {{the location of}} virtual floats representing turtle hatchlings throughout 60 modeled years. Floats were constrained to remain within depths of 0 - 6 m due to the positive buoyancy of hatchlings. Floats were first {{assigned to one of}} 20, 000 random release locations within a large release area 125 - 400 km offshore from nesting beaches throughout the Republic/Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea spanning latitudes of c. 6 °S to 3. 5 °N. For each month over the 4 -month long hatching season (January-April), each of the 20, 000 floats was assigned a random release day and drift simulations ran every year during the period 1960 - 2007 resulting in drift trajectories of approx. 4 million virtual floats.
