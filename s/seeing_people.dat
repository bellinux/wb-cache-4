5|$|The protagonist {{and player}} {{character}} of Shuffle! is Rin Tsuchimi, a normal seventeen-year-old second-year {{high school student}} and the male protagonist to the series. Since a young age, he has placed the well-being of others before his own and dislikes <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> in sorrow. Since he lost his parents in his childhood, he has been living with Kaede Fuyou, a life envied by many of his classmates. One of the heroines of Shuffle!, Kaede believes it her duty {{in life is to}} take care of Rin, which she takes upon herself in order to atone for her treatment of him in the past and bears a one-sided love towards Rin.

Although contemporary accounts claimed that parents had been witnessed dropping a baby or toddler down, uninjured, to people below from as far up as the ninth or 10th storey, a later investigation by BBC Panorama {{found no evidence that}} these accounts were credible: neither the Metropolitan Police, London Ambulance Service nor any A departments were able to find any record of this happening, and several scientific experts including a paediatric trauma consultant advised the BBC that such an occurrence would have resulted in serious injury.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1847 crisis, invalids {{were placed}} in {{hospitals}} while the healthy carried out their quarantine periods in sheds. However, in 1847 the island was quickly overwhelmed. Tents were set up to house the influx of people, but many new arrivals were left {{lying on the ground}} without shelter. Robert Whyte records seeing 'hundreds... literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land as they could'. The Anglican Bishop of Montreal, Bishop Mountain, recalled <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> lying opposite the church screaming for water, while others lay inside the tents without bedding. One child he saw was covered in vermin; another who had 'been walking with some others, sat down for a moment, and died'. Many children were orphaned.|$|E

Notable cut scenes include Oscar and Creed moving a desk, Phyllis confiding to the camera that her new boyfriend is Bob Vance, Dwight comparing humans opening presents to bears, Kevin singing [...] "Christmas in Hollis" [...] by Run DMC, Angela scolding Kelly, and Michael explaining that Christmas is about <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> envy the gifts that you give to others.|$|E

I thought it was a ridiculous sort of thing... but as I started to do it, the celebration of 50,000 started to be very {{one-on-one}} and very personal. I started <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> I knew... Those were the people that had been around the ballpark all those years, and it was really a wonderful human experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Diefenbaker ran on a {{platform}} which concentrated on changes in domestic policies. He pledged {{to work with the}} provinces to reform the Senate. He proposed a vigorous new agricultural policy, seeking to stabilize income for farmers. He sought to reduce dependence on trade with the United States, and to seek closer ties with the United Kingdom. St. Laurent called the Tory platform [...] "a mere cream-puff of a thingâ€”with more air than substance". Diefenbaker and the PC party used television adroitly, whereas St. Laurent stated that he was more interested in <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> than in talking to cameras. Though the Liberals outspent the Progressive Conservatives three to one, according to Newman, their campaign had little imagination, and was based on telling voters that their only real option was to re-elect St. Laurent.|$|E
5000|$|After {{visiting his}} {{hometown}} of Calabar and <b>seeing</b> <b>people's</b> affection for the Etighi dance, Iyanya decided to do a song that would popularise the dance that originated in Calabar. He teamed up with producer DTunes and recorded [...] "Kukere", a single that achieved global success, particularly in Nigeria, Ghana and the United Kingdom.

500|$|... is Naruto's rival. Designed by Kishimoto, {{to be the}} [...] "cool genius" [...] he {{felt was}} an {{integral}} part of an ideal rivalry. Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family. Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knew, much to his annoyance. When made a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin to consider them precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing less on revenge at the start of the series. Following an encounter and subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from a man named Orochimaru. Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama, and his English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal ...|$|E
500|$|They {{sought to}} make Enterprise more {{character}} driven than the previous series in the Star Trek franchise, and hoped that this would gain viewers who had watched The Next Generation but had lost interest with Deep Space Nine and Voyager. It was intended to link the series directly into The Original Series by having T'Pau as a main character, who had previously appeared in the episode [...] "Amok Time". Instead, this character was developed into an original Vulcan character, T'Pol. Berman explained his vision for the series at launch, saying that [...] "we'll be seeing humanity when they truly are going where no man has gone before. We are <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> who don't take meeting aliens as just {{another part of the}} job. It's not routine. Nothing is routine. Also, by bringing it back 200 years from Voyager, we're making the characters closer to the present, and by doing that they can {{be a little bit more}} accessible and a little bit more flawed and a little bit more familiar to you and me." ...|$|E
500|$|Deeming Azazel to be [...] "an angry soul", actor Fredric Lehne {{believed}} that the character having been [...] "denied Heaven and everything else that's good in the universe" [...] has [...] " [...] into anger and vengeance". A demon {{with a sense of}} humor, Azazel takes pleasure in <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> suffer. [...] "The more painmostly psychological painhe causes, the happier he is ... He gets off on the power of turning people to his will", Lehne explained. This quality suggests to the actor why the demon favored Sam as the potential leader of his army. Being the [...] "most ripe for picking" [...] because he had the [...] "sweetest" [...] heart, Sam was [...] "most desirable for corrupting" [...] of all the children; Lehne described Azazel's thought process as, [...] "If I could turn him, then I had truly won." [...] The character's ultimate motivation, however, is to free Lucifer from his imprisonment in Hell. On this, Supernatural co-executive producer Ben Edlund mentioned his view of Azazel as one of [...] "a little cult of demonic true believers" [...] that encompasses many of the important demon characters in the series.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the tour}} and in {{preparation}} for the album, Hammill invited producer John Anthony to his home, where Hammill played songs intended for the album unaccompanied on acoustic guitar and piano, allowing Anthony to take recording notes. [...] "Man Erg" [...] was written about the conflict between good and evil, represented as [...] "angels" [...] and [...] "killers" [...] in the song. [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] was inspired by Hammill's fascination with the sea, and the narrative is about a lighthouse keeper who keeps <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> die offshore. He feels guilty {{about not being able to}} help, and the song's ending is left open, leaving the listener to decide if the keeper has committed suicide or rationalised events to live in peace. Banton was against putting [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] on the album, wanting more commercial material such as the previous album H to He, Who Am the Only One's [...] "Killer", but after a band meeting he agreed to rehearse the song and worked out an arrangement. The group moved to manager Tony Stratton-Smith's house, Luxford House, Crowborough, Sussex for two months in summer 1971 to rehearse material.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} and DVD set titled , author Laurence Rees {{indicates}} that although GrÃ¶ning had requested to leave Auschwitz after he witnessed the killing, his objection was only {{on the basis of}} its practical implementation, and not on the general militaristic principle of the mass extermination of enemies. GrÃ¶ning said that he thought at the time that it was justified due to all the Nazi propaganda he had been subjected to, in that Germany's enemies were being destroyed, which to him made the tools of their destruction (such as gas chambers) of no particular significance. Because of this, he says his feelings about <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> and knowing that they had hours to live before being gassed were [...] "very ambiguous". He explains that children were murdered because, while the children themselves were not the enemy, the danger was the blood within them, in that they could grow up to become dangerous Jews. Rees points to GrÃ¶ning's ultra-nationalist upbringing as indication of how he was able to justify the extermination of helpless children. GrÃ¶ning says that the horrors in the gas chambers did eventually dawn on him when he heard the screams.|$|E
500|$|U2's manager Paul McGuinness recounted that The Joshua Tree {{originated}} from the band's [...] "great romance" [...] with the United States, {{as the group}} had toured the country {{for up to five}} months per year {{in the first half of}} the 1980s. Leading up to the album sessions, lead vocalist Bono had been reading the works of American writers such as Norman Mailer, Flannery O'Connor, and Raymond Carver so as to understand, in the words of Hot Press editor Niall Stokes, [...] "those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream". Following a Septemberâ€“October 1985 humanitarian visit to Egypt and Ethiopia with his wife Ali, Bono said, [...] "Spending time in Africa and <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> in the pits of poverty, I still saw a very strong spirit in the people, a richness of spirit I didn't see when I came home... I saw the spoiled child of the Western world. I started thinking, 'They may have a physical desert, but we've got other kinds of deserts.' And that's what attracted me to the desert as a symbol of some sort." ...|$|E

After {{the death of his father}} and his wife Soheon, Yi Do (now called King Sejong) employs Kang Chae-yoon as an investigator (unaware he is the same boy whom he spared years before) and is helped by So-yi in the creation of Hangul. He later finds out that Chae-yoon is the same boy who tried to kill him.|$|R
2500|$|Giving [...] "in sadness" [...] (giving out of pity): It {{is thought}} that Maimonides was {{referring}} to giving because of the sad feelings one might have in <b>seeing</b> <b>people</b> in need (as opposed to giving {{because it is a}} religious obligation). Other translations say [...] "Giving unwillingly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Individualized care becomes {{important}} when nurses {{need to get}} to know the patient. To lives this knowledge the psychiatric nurse must see patients as individual people with lives beyond their mental illness. <b>Seeing</b> <b>people</b> as individuals with lives beyond their mental illness is imperative in making patients feel valued and respected [...] In order to accept the patient as an individual, the psychiatric nurse must not be controlled by his or her own values, or by ideas and pre-understanding of mental health patients. Individual needs of patients are met by bending the rules of standard interventions and assessment. Psychiatric/mental health nurses spoke of the potential to 'bend the rules', which required an interpretation of the unit rules and the ability to evaluate the risks associated with bending them.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 February 1923 Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik {{met again}} {{and went for}} several days to Petrograd together. In her 1956 book of memoirs Brik remembered:I came to the railway station and found him on the platform, waiting for me on the wagon steps. As the train started, Volodya, leaning on the door read me the poem About That. Having finished, he burst into tears, immensely relieved. Now, {{in the course of}} those two months I often had pangs of consciousness. Volodya was {{suffering}} there alone, while I lived an ordinary life, was <b>seeing</b> <b>people,</b> visiting places. Now I felt happy. For the poem that I've just heard wouldn't have been written should I have not chosen Volodya as my personal ideal and an impersonation of an ideal human being." ...|$|E
