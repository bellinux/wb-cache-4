This {{is a low}} draft {{body with}} a gently curved and a cross-sectional convex curve from top to bottom, which turns a furrow three parts wide by two parts deep, e.g. 300mm wide by 200mm deep. It turns the furrow slice slowly almost without breaking it, and is normally used for <b>shallow</b> <b>plowing</b> (maximum 200mm depth). It is useful for grassland ploughing and sets up the land for weathering by winter frosts, which reduces the time taken to prepare a seedbed for spring sown crops.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{tractive}} efficiency (TE) of MF 285 and U 650 tractors during moldboard plowing were evaluated and compared. Field experiments were {{conducted at the}} Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, using a randomized complete block design with a 3 * 3 factorial. The soil was sandy clay loam with an average moisture content of 18 % b. d. from zero to 30 cm depth. Test treatments were combinations of three tractor types or conditions (U 650, MF 285 liquid ballasted and MF 285 with no liquid or weight ballast) and three levels of plowing depth (10 - 15 cm, 15 - 20 cm and 20 - 25 cm). Plowing speed was kept constant at about 4 km/h throughout the experiment. The measured or calculated parameters included: tractor drawbar pull and rolling resistance, drive wheel slip and tractor tractive efficiency. Statistical analysis of the test {{results showed that the}} primary difference between the tractor types or conditions was in their wheel slip, such that the average wheel slip of U 650 was lowest (12. 6 %) while that of unballasted MF 285 was highest (27 %) and was reduced to 17. 7 % with liquid ballasting. Also, while growth of unballasted MF 285 wheel slip with increasing plowing depth was drastically high (11 % to 48 %), that of U 650 was quite moderate (9. 7 % to 16. 5 %). Analysis of the calculated values of TE showed that there was no significant changes in the TE of U 650 with increasing plowing depth and that with an average of 73. 8 %, it had a desirable performance. The TE of unballasted MF 285 that was over 75 % at <b>shallow</b> <b>plowing,</b> dropped to 46 % with increasing plowing depth, while water ballasting improved the decreasing trend of TE with plowing depth and raised its minimum value to about 63 %. The overall results of this study showed that unballasted MF 285 tractors had desirable TE only at <b>shallow</b> <b>plowing</b> and that for medium and deep plowing, U 650 or water ballasted MF 285 tractors should be used...|$|E
40|$|Effects of <b>Shallow</b> <b>Plowing</b> Tools on the Soil Structural State and the Potatoes Crop Yield. Effects {{of three}} tillage tools (disc harrow, teeth harrow and rotary cultivator) on two {{physical}} characteristics of silt-sandy soil (resistance to the penetration Rp and voluminous mass Mv) {{and their potential}} influence on fresh matter and total yield of potato were studied at the experimental field of the Horticultural School, Chott-Mariem (Sousse). Results show that the three tools reduce the resistance penetration and the voluminous mass of soil tilled especially using disc harrow at 15 cm depth (Rp= 2. 8 daN/cm 2 and Mv= 1. 03 g/ cm 3) compared with non tilled soil (Rp= 11. 4 daN/cm 2, Mv= 1. 43 g/cm 3). Highest fresh matter yield was obtained (at 130 days) after soil ploughing with disc harrow showing an average increase of 33, 24, 18 and 15 % respectively for leaves, tubercles, stems and roots compared with other tools. Best tubercles yield was also reached using disc harrow showing an increase of 21 % and 24 % compared, respectively, to teeth harrow and rotary cultivator...|$|E

40|$|Article {{considers}} {{results of}} long-term studies of birch undergrowth in subtaiga subzone and forest-steppe zone of Western Siberia, {{the features of}} silver and downy birch seed regeneration under the canopy of parent stands, on logging, burned and abandoned arable lands, and hayfields. The distance of seed dispersal by wind, dynamics of accumulation of self-sown birch after continuous tillage and plough furrows is specified. It was found that seed regeneration under the birch stand canopy is hindered by drying of litter and root competition of the parent stand. A necessary condition for the germination of small seeds and the survival of weak shoots of birches is sufficient rainfall {{during the period of}} seed production and careful soil treatment, which provides removal of litter, total removal of herbaceous vegetation and soil reserve of weed seeds: continuous repeated plowing, bulldozing strips or <b>shallow</b> <b>plow</b> furrow with 0. 7 − 1. 0 m in width, with their additional cultivation. The most effective way of preparing land for seed regeneration of birch trees in arid steppe conditions is to transfer it under temporary cultivation of grain-crops, providing suppression of permanent weeds. Autumn plowing after harvest will provide annual readiness of the site for seed colonization of the birches. When there is an optimum combination of good seed harvest, rainy weather conditions, and appearance of mass self-sown birch, the land is excluded from the agricultural use. Prerequisites: the presence of seed productive walls of birch with preliminary removal of aspen and undesirable forms of birch. In spring of the next year an inventory is done of wintered self-sown birches, at least on 100 evenly spaced accounting plots. If the self-seeding dies, the site continues to be used by agriculture. Less reliable but acceptable is tillage by bulldozer stripes and furrows with 0. 7 − 1. 0 m in width, in a year of abundant seed production, before the start of mass seed fall...|$|R

Currently classic tillage method is decreasing and the only trend has stated as a <b>shallow</b> <b>plowing.</b> Suitable post harvest soil tillage greatly affects yields in the next cycle. The aim of the study is the analysis of abrasive wear of selected construction materials and their subsequent use for DXRV-HD cultivator. The performed tests are focused on monitoring the mechanical properties of the materials and their use for variable cutting tip of cultivator body. Tested materials are divided into four categories. These materials include tool steel (19436), carbon steel (12050), cast iron with globular graphite and welding material supplied as a functional complex on low carbon steel by the Abraweld company. These materials are tested together with the original part of share cultivator. The present experiment is focused on metallorgraphic, mechanical and abrasive analysis. Structural component of the material is identified by metallographic photos and then compared with the impact strength tested on Charpy hammer.

40|$|PosterChestnut groves in the Sierra de Aracena (Huelva, SW Spain) {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} attractive landscapes. The wood, but especially the fruit {{have been involved in the}} economic consolidation of this area. However the current situation is not favorable for production and some of these groves are being abandoned due to the low return. Despite all this, chestnut forests still constitute an important natural tourist resource and also host a great mycological wealth. Wild edible fungi have been collected and consumed by man from time immemorial and today some of them are considered authentic gastronomic delights. Certain fungi form symbiotic associations with the roots of the trees called ectomycorrhizas (ECM) through which the fungus provides minerals and water to the plant and the plant supplies carbohydrates to the fungus. That is why ECM are considered good indicators of forest health. Several ectomycorrhizal mushrooms highly appreciated as edible appear in this area associated with the roots of adult chestnut trees. Among them are Amanita caesarea and Boletus aereus, both thermophilic species fruiting in early autumn. The production of fruiting bodies depends on many factors, so that, depending on the year it may be little or even null which hinders their exploitation. To date the artificial reproduction of these fungi to the fruiting stage continues to elude the efforts of researchers. As a complementary approach, in this work we analyzed the mycelium status of these ectomycorrhizal fungi in a chestnut grove soil. Later, different cultural practices including irrigation and <b>shallow</b> <b>plowing</b> will be performed and the effect on soil mycelium development and subsequent fruiting will be studied. For this, soil samples were taken over time and analyzed by molecular techniques through the restriction analysis of amplified rDNA using as control the DNA extracted from the respective fruiting bodies...|$|E
40|$|Geomembranes {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{geosynthetics}} in various civil engineering applications. Their primary function is as a barrier to liquid or vapour flow. Smooth Geomembranes are frequently used in combination with different soils, and due to their low surface roughness, are challenging to design to ensure adequate shear strength along the smooth geomembrane-soil interface. It is important to use the appropriate values of interface shear strength parameters in the design of slopes incorporating one or more geomembranes in contact with soils. The parameters are determined by conducting direct shear test on the geomembrane-soil interface. Laboratory tests of interface shear strength for geomembranes and soil are typically carried out with no provision for measurement of pore pressures at the soil/geomembrane interface. This thesis deals with study of smooth geomembrane-soil interfaces, particularly under unsaturated conditions. The various factors that affect the interface shear behaviour are also studied. The tests were conducted using a modified direct shear box with a miniature pore pressure transducer installed adjacent to the surface of the geomembrane. Geomembrane–soil interface shear tests were carried out with continuous measurement of suction in close proximity to the interface during the shearing process thus making it possible to analyze test results in terms of effective stresses. The method was found to be suitable for unsaturated soils at low values of matric suction. Results of interface shear tests conducted using this method show that it is quite effective in evaluating interface shear behaviour between a geomembrane and an unsaturated soil. The results suggest that soil suction contributes to shearing resistance at low normal stress values. At lower normal stress values, the interface shear behaviour appears to be governed only by the magnitude of total normal stress. At high normal stresses, the failure mechanism changed from soil particles sliding at the surface of geomembrane to soil particles getting embedded into the geomembrane and plowing trenches along the direction of shear. A plowing failure mechanism resulted in the mobilization of significantly higher shear strength at the geomembrane soil interface. It was found that placement water contents near saturated conditions results in lower effective stresses, a <b>shallower</b> <b>plowing</b> mechanism and lower values of mobilized interface shear strength...|$|R
40|$|Tractive {{efficiency}} and fuel consumption of Massey Ferguson (MF 399) and John Deere (JD 4230) tractors during plowing with moldboard plow were evaluated and compared. The {{tests were conducted}} at the Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, in a field with sandy clay soil at average moisture content of 18 % d. b. from zero to 30 cm depth. A randomized complete block design with a 4 3 factorial was used in three replications. The treatments consisted of two types of tractors, MF 399 and JD 4230, each at two levels of axle load (standard and liquid ballasted) and three levels of <b>plowing</b> depth, <b>shallow</b> (15 - 20 cm), medium (20 - 25 cm) and deep (25 - 30 cm) using a semi-mounted 4 -bottom moldboard plow. In all treatments, the tractor engine speed was set at rated rpm (2000 and 2200 for MF 399 and JD 4230, respectively) and forward speed was kept constant at about 4. 5 ± 5 km/hr. The measured and calculated parameters included: drawbar pull, rolling resistance, wheel slip, tractive {{efficiency and}} fuel consumption. The results indicated that tractive efficiency of MF 399 in deep plowing increased from 36. 5 % to 53 % with ballasting the drive wheels, even though the improved traction was not {{comparable to that of}} JD 4230 (64 %) at the same plowing depth. However, at ballasted condition it is comparable to JD 4230 at shallow and medium depth plowing due to its lower fuel consumption. Using ballasted JD 4230 for <b>shallow</b> depth <b>plowing</b> is not economically justified due to the excessive fuel consumption and may cause soil compaction due to the lower than optimum wheel slippage. Generally, using MF 399 is recommended for lower draft and JD 4230 for higher draft tillage operations. Otherwise, MF 399 will encounter severe reduction in tractive efficiency and excessive increase in fuel consumption and JD 4230 will cause soil compaction...|$|R
