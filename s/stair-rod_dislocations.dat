Structure of the “carrot ” {{defects in}} 4 H-SiC homoepitaxial layers {{deposited}} by CVD {{has been investigated}} by plan-view and cross-sectional transmission x-ray topography, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and KOH etching.

30|$|Similar to {{simulation}} results obtained with cutting direction of { 100 }< 011 >, dislocations moving along { 111 } planes are not initiated {{at the cutting}} direction of { 110 }< 1 - 10 > as shown in Fig.  6 a. However, a shearing boundary on which different kinds of dislocations such as perfect dislocations, Shockley partial, and <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations</b> initiate and move along it during cutting process. The shearing boundary starts {{at the tip of}} the stagnation region to the free surface with a shearing angle of 27 ° as shown in Fig.  6 b. The displacement vectors of atoms on this boundary also change abruptly. Unlike the cutting direction of { 100 }< 011 >, the chip does not transform to polycrystalline.|$|E
30|$|The { 111 }< 1 - 10 > cutting {{direction}} {{which is a}} crystallographic slip direction of single crystal aluminum makes {{a large number of}} Shockley partial dislocations initiate in front of the cutting edge accompanied with ISF, as shown in Fig.  7 a. The dislocations are concentrated on two shearing boundaries: one expands {{from the bottom of the}} cutting edge along the {{cutting direction}} and another starts at the tip of the stagnation region to the free surface, as shown in Fig.  7 a, b. Except for the Shockley partial dislocations, <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations</b> also initiate on the first shearing boundary due to the interaction of Shockley partial dislocations on different crystallographic planes, and a large number of perfect dislocations are also formed on the second shearing boundary causing the materials removed in shearing mechanism. Besides that, a mass of dislocations including Shockley partial and <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations</b> are evolution in the chip in front of the tool rake face. According to Fig.  7 b, the shearing angle is about 40 ° which is the largest compared to the cutting process at other cutting directions. This is because a large stagnation region formed in front of the cutting edge works like a build-up edge sharping the tool edge and making the rake angle of the cutting tool positive. The size of build-up edge tends to increase and attain a stable state with the increase of cutting distance. Therefore, a build-up edge making the cutting tool with positive rake angle and sharp edge increases the shearing angle in the cutting process. After the cutting edge pass through, almost no dislocations and stacking faults are initiated and left in the machined subsurface. It makes the machined surface has a better roughness.|$|E
30|$|At {{the cutting}} {{direction}} of { 100 }< 001 >, {{as shown in}} Fig.  2 a, {{a large number of}} Shockley partial dislocations nucleate in the plastic deformation zone in front of the cutting edge accompanied with ISF and ESF which is along the { 111 } planes. The Shockley dislocations are at the edge of ISF and ESF. <b>Stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations</b> which are the meet and reaction of Shockley partial dislocations on different { 111 } planes are also found in the plastic deformation zone. Besides that, perfect dislocations are generated in the deformation zone which nucleate without stacking fault.

40|$|We have {{systematically}} studied dislocation cross-slip in Al at zero temperature by atomistic simulations, {{focusing on}} the dependence of the transition paths and energy barriers on dislocation length and position. We find that for a short dislocation segment, the cross-slip follows the uniform Fleischer (FL) mechanism. For a longer dislocation segment, we have identified two different cross-slip mechanisms depending on the initial and final positions of the dislocation. If the initial and final positions are symmetric relative to {{the intersection of the}} primary and cross-slip planes, the dislocation cross-slips via the Friedel-Escaig (FE) mechanism. However, when the initial and final positions are asymmetric, the dislocation cross-slips via a combination of the FL and FE mechanisms. The leading partial folds over to the cross-slip plane first, forming a <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocation</b> at the intersection with which the trailing partial then merges via the FL mechanism.

40|$|Stacking fault pyramids, trapezoids, {{tubes and}} tetrahedra have been {{identified}} by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in ZnSe/GaAs(001) epilayers. The { 111 } fault planes of the defects intersect in obtuse and acute <b>stair-rod</b> partial <b>dislocations.</b> Obtuse and acute stair-rod pairs in stacking fault trapezoids and tubes form dislocation dipoles. It has been established by TEM that degradation of devices based on ZnSe epilayers {{is due to the}} formation of threading dislocations from the stacking faults. The dislocation dipoles can act as diffusion channels for pipe diffusion of point defects during the degradation process. A model based on an array of Se dimers on the (001) interface has been proposed as the origin of the intersecting staking faults. High density of stacking fault tetrahedra has also been observed in (SiGe) /Si(001) multilayers. The presence of stacking fault results in enhanced second harmonic generation.

40|$|Materials {{used in the}} {{engineering}} always contain imperfections or defects which significantly affect their performances. Based on the large-scale molecular dynamics simulation and the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the influence from different pre-existing surface defects on the bending properties of Ag nanowires (NWs) is studied in this paper. It is found that the nonlinear-elastic deformation, {{as well as the}} flexural rigidity of the NW is insensitive to different surface defects for the studied defects in this paper. On the contrary, an evident decrease of the yield strength is observed due to the existence of defects. In-depth inspection of the deformation process reveals that, at the onset of plastic deformation, dislocation embryos initiate from the locations of surface defects, and the plastic deformation is dominated by the nucleation and propagation of partial dislocations under the considered temperature. Particularly, the generation of <b>stair-rod</b> partial <b>dislocations</b> and Lomer–Cottrell lock are normally observed for both perfect and defected NWs. The generation of these structures has thwarted attempts of the NW to an early yielding, which leads to the phenomenon that more defects does not necessarily mean a lower critical force...|$|R

30|$|In summary, we perform MD {{simulations}} {{to investigate}} the atomic scale origin of the minimum wear depth of single crystalline Cu(111) during single asperity friction. Simulation results show that scratching impression can only be made under a scratching depth at which there are permanent defects formed.

The specific permanent defects governing the wear phenomena are composed of <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations</b> and prismatic dislocation loops as well as vacancies. While the contact pressure for the nucleation of initial dislocation is independent on probe radius, the minimum wear depth increases with probe radius. Further analysis of the shear strain distribution implies that a larger probe results in more compliant deformation of the material, which leads to larger volume of wear debris and wider extent of defect structures.|$|E

30|$|At {{the cutting}} {{direction}} of { 111 }< 11 - 2 >, stagnation region is also formed {{in front of}} the cutting edge and is larger than cutting on the { 100 } and { 110 } crystallographic plane, as shown in Fig.  8 b. Unlike the cutting direction of { 111 }< 1 - 10 >, an expanded shearing zone is formed starting at the tip of stagnation region. The shearing angle of the shearing zone is about 38 ° which is slight smaller than cutting at { 111 }< 1 - 10 > direction. The large and sharp stagnation region, to a certain extent, increases the shearing angle, but a large number of the dislocations and stacking fault expand the shearing zone, as shown in Fig.  8 a. The displacement vectors of atoms in the zone change gradually compared to the cutting process with other cutting directions. After the cutting process, Shockley partial and <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations</b> move deep into the machined subsurface left ISF and ESF in it, which would influence the generated surface roughness.|$|E
30|$|Large-scale {{molecular}} dynamics simulation is performed to study the nano-cutting process of single crystal copper realized by single-point diamond cutting tool in this paper. The centro-symmetry parameter is adopted to characterize the subsurface deformed layers and the distribution and evolution of the subsurface defect structures. Three-dimensional visualization and measurement technology are {{used to measure the}} depth of the subsurface deformed layers. The influence of cutting speed, cutting depth, cutting direction, and crystallographic orientation on the depth of subsurface deformed layers is systematically investigated. The results show that a lot of defect structures are formed in the subsurface of workpiece during nano-cutting process, for instance, <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations,</b> stacking fault tetrahedron, atomic clusters, vacancy defects, point defects. In the process of nano-cutting, the depth of subsurface deformed layers increases with the cutting distance at the beginning, then decreases at stable cutting process, and basically remains unchanged when the cutting distance reaches up to 24  nm. The depth of subsurface deformed layers decreases with the increase in cutting speed between 50 and 300  m/s. The depth of subsurface deformed layer increases with cutting depth, proportionally, and basically remains unchanged when the cutting depth reaches over 6  nm.|$|E
30|$|When {{the cutting}} {{direction}} is { 100 }< 011 >, the minimum included angle between { 111 } planes and the cutting direction is 54.7 ° which {{is too large}} to initiate the dislocations sliding continuously along { 111 } planes. Therefore, the shearing boundary or the shearing plane {{is not on the}} { 111 } planes, but a dislocation slide plane which is perpendicular to the cutting plane generates in front of the tool edge, including perfect dislocations, Shockley partial, Frank partial, <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations,</b> and other dislocations on it as shown in Fig.  3 a. In the cutting process, dislocation density in the shearing plane increases resulting in dislocation tangle and refining the grain size of the removed workpiece material. It makes the removed chip to be polycrystalline with the grain size in nanometer. After the diamond tool cutting through, stacking faults and the dislocations under the machined surface are not completely recovered causing a large number of point defects, TB, ISF, ESF, as well as different kinds of dislocations left in the machined subsurface. This phenomenon would deteriorate the generated surface roughness. The displacement vector is shown in Fig.  3 b, the displacement vectors change abruptly at the dislocation boundary which is the shearing plane with shearing angle of 29 ° in this figure. The shearing plane also starts at the tip of stagnation region formed in the cutting edge.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  4 a, {{materials}} pile {{up in front}} of the cutting edge while the cutting direction is { 100 }< 012 >. The pile-up zone is bounded by a dislocation slide plane ABC which starts at the bottom of cutting edge and expands along the cutting direction. After several tens of nanometers, the dislocation slide plane expands toward the free surface along line BC with a shearing angle of about 45 °. On the dislocation slide plane, different kinds of dislocations, such as perfect dislocations, Shockley partial, Frank partial, <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations,</b> and other dislocations, nucleate and move during the cutting process. Dislocations move between the dislocation slide plane and the top surface of the pile-up chip and tend to escape from the free surface left micro steps on it. The pile-up materials would finally be removed and become the chip. Displacement vector also displays the motion of atoms under the action of cutting tool, as shown in Fig.  4 b. The displacement vectors of atoms above line AB approximately equal to zero which means this part of atoms stick to the cutting edge and move with it. Above line BC, directions of atom displacement vector abruptly change causing the rotation of the workpiece material lattice. Therefore, the dislocation slide plane AB could also be seen as a grain boundary above which the crystal plane is { 111 } and below which the crystal plane is { 100 }, as shown in Fig.  4 b. If just taking the shearing plane AB into consideration, the shearing angle should be 0 °.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to characterize the evolution of plastic deformation mechanisms in single crystal and nanocrystalline Cu models during shock by atomistic simulations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed {{for a range of}} particle velocities from 0. 5 to 1. 7 km/s and initial temperatures of 5, 300 and 600 K for single crystal models as well as particle velocities from 1. 5 to 3. 4 km/s for nanocrystalline models with grain diameters of 6, 11, 16 and 26 nm. For single crystal models, four different shock directions are selected, 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e, 3 ̆c 1103 ̆e, 3 ̆c 1113 ̆e and 3 ̆c 3213 ̆e, and dislocation density behind the shock wave front generally increases with increasing particle velocity for all shock orientations. Plastic relaxation for shock in the 3 ̆c 1103 ̆e, 3 ̆c 1113 ̆e and 3 ̆c 3213 ̆e directions is primarily due to a reduction in the Shockley partial dislocation density. In contrast, plastic relaxation is limited for shock in the 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e orientation. This is partially due to the emergence of sessile <b>stair-rod</b> <b>dislocations</b> with Burgers vectors of 1 / 33 ̆c 1003 ̆e and 1 / 63 ̆c 1103 ̆e due to the reaction of Shockley partial dislocations with twin boundaries and stacking fault intersections. For 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e shock, FCC Cu is uniaxially compressed towards the BCC structure behind the shock wave front; this process is more favorable at higher shock pressures and temperatures. For particle velocities above 0. 9 km/s, regions of HCP crystal structure nucleate from uniaxially compressed Cu. Free energy calculations proves that the nucleation and growth of these HCP clusters are an artifact of the embedded-atom interatomic potential. In addition, simulated x-ray diffraction line profiles are created for 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e shock models of single crystal Cu at the Hugoniot state. Generally, peak broadening in the x-ray diffraction line profiles increases with increasing particle velocity. For nanocrystalline models, the compression of the FCC lattice towards the BCC structure is more apparent at particle velocity of 2. 4 km/s, and at this particle velocity, the atomic percentage of BCC structure increases with increasing grain size. The observation of BCC structure strongly depends on grain orientation; grains with 3 ̆c 1003 ̆e directions closely aligned with the shock loading direction show a higher percentage of BCC structure...|$|E
