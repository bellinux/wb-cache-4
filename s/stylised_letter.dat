25|$|The party's {{distinctive}} logo {{was designed}} in 1968 by painter and poet Roland Giguère. It {{consists of a}} <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> Q, represented by a blue circle broken by a red arrow. The creator meant it as an allegory of the Parti Québécois breaking the circle of colonialism which he claimed Canada was imposing on Quebec and opening Quebec upon {{the world and the}} future. The PQ has made very few significant modifications to its logo during its history. In 1985 it made the circle and arrow slightly thicker, and placed the tip of the latter at the centre of the circle. The original saw it span the whole diameter. When placed upon a blue background instead of a white one, the circle was commonly turned to white, the single main design variation currently observed.|$|E
25|$|Having {{attended}} art college, Mercury {{also designed}} Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, {{shortly before the}} release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters. The original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the cover of the band's first album, was a simple line drawing. Later sleeves bore more intricate-coloured versions of the logo.|$|E
500|$|In April 1970 Mercury joined guitarist Brian May {{and drummer}} Roger Taylor who had {{previously}} been in a band called Smile. In 1971 {{they were joined by}} bassist John Deacon. Despite reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name [...] "Queen" [...] for the new band. He later said, [...] "It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it." [...] At about the same time, he changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury. Mercury designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix.

2500|$|Broadcasting by Granada Television {{began on}} 3 May 1956 under the North of England weekday franchise. It {{was marked by}} a {{distinctive}} northern identity, and used <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "G" [...] logo forming an arrow pointing north, often with the tagline [...] "Granada: from the north". Granada plc merged with Carlton Communications to form ITV plc in 2004 after a duopoly had developed over the previous decade.

5000|$|The {{division}} was raised on 1 June 1941, at Quetta in Baluchistan. Its badge was a depiction {{in black and}} white of the ranges of mountains above Quetta, surrounded by a <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "Q" [...] in white on a black background. The division had temporary commanders while forming.

5000|$|Wildstyle is a {{complicated}} and intricate form of graffiti. Due to its complexity, it is often very hard to read {{by people who are}} not familiar with it. Usually, this form of graffiti incorporates interwoven and overlapping letters and shapes. It may include arrows, spikes, and other decorative elements depending on the technique used. The numerous layers and shapes make this style extremely difficult to produce homogeneously, which is why developing an original style in this field is seen {{as one of the greatest}} artistic challenges to a graffiti writer. Wildstyle pieces are the most complex form of piece ("masterpiece") lettering, a stage higher than the quick simplified <b>stylised</b> <b>letters</b> known as [...] "burners". Wildstyle is seen as one of the most complicated and difficult masterpiece styles and refers to larger complex letters which have volume as opposed to mere signatures or graffiti art [...] "tags".|$|R
5000|$|The artwork for Blackstar was {{designed}} by Jonathan Barnbrook, who had designed the artwork for Bowie's Heathen, Reality and The Next Day. The star image on the cover is credited to NASA in the CD booklet. The five star segments below the main star form the word BOWIE in <b>stylised</b> <b>letters.</b> The vinyl cover, in black, features the star as a cutout section, revealing the record (with an all-black picture label) beneath it. With the record removed, the black paper behind the cut-out star reveals a hidden picture of a starfield when the foldout sleeve is held up to a light source. It took more than four months before fans first discovered the effect. The designer claimed there were many other surprises hidden in the LP's artwork.Music journalists also noted that a [...] "black star lesion," [...] usually found inside a breast, suggests to medical practitioners evidence of certain types of cancer.|$|R
50|$|This logo {{remained}} {{until the}} merger with MC2 France, when a red/grey logo was used. By {{the time of}} Still Life being released the company was using a logo containing a blocky <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> M and dot below it. In 2005 this had a smooth typeface and no dots above the letter i. By the relaunch of the brand in 2007 the previous design had a diaeresis placed above the letter i and a different typeface. After the Anuman buyout the logo shape was changed slightly and included a new typeface.|$|E
50|$|Back at the house, {{there has}} been another scare; a mysterious symbol like a <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> B has been drawn in chalk {{on one of the}} library windows. Campion and Oates suspect it is a sign used by tramps to {{communicate}} amongst themselves. Great-Aunt Caroline reveals that Andrew had been writing to old girlfriends, and Campion has an idea which could solve the case. He finds Uncle William has an alibi, having been seen in a pub {{at the time of the}} murder, in the midst of an amnesia attack, and the inquest into Andrew's death returns a verdict of murder.|$|E
5000|$|Dilaudid (hydromorphone), a {{powerful}} and very water-soluble narcotic analgesic (Betäubungsmittel) introduced in 1926, as small oral tablets {{of a number of}} strengths, multi-purpose (hypodermic) tablets, compounding powder, ampoules of solution for injection, and dry ampoules for reconstitution. Knoll also produced somewhat similar hydrocodone tablets named Dicodid; this drug which compares to codeine as hydromorphone compares to morphine was first synthesised and announced in Germany in 1920. [...] The obverse sides of the oral tablets bear a <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "K" [...] and the reverse has the relevant imprint code for the medication in the locale of sale and/or number of milligrammes of hydromorphone.|$|E
50|$|In {{creative}} typography, such {{as music}} record covers and other artistic material, all styles are commonly encountered, including all-lowercase letters and special case styles, such as studly caps (see below). For example, in the wordmarks of video games {{it is not}} uncommon to use <b>stylised</b> upper-case <b>letters</b> at the beginning and end of a title, with the intermediate letters in small caps or lower case (e.g., , , and DmC).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{interactive}} generation of <b>stylised</b> <b>letters,</b> curves and motion paths {{that are similar to}} the ones that can be observed in art forms such as graffiti and calligraphy. We define various stylisations of a letter form over a common geometrical structure, which is given by the spatial layout of a sparse sequence of targets. Different stylisations are then generated by optimising the trajectories of a dynamical system that tracks the target sequence. The evolution of the dynamical system is computed with a stochastic formulation of optimal control, in which each target is defined probabilistically as a multivariate Gaussian. The covariance of each Gaussian explicitly defines the variability as well as the curvilinear evolution of trajectory segments. Given this probabilistic formulation, the optimisation procedure results in a trajectory distribution rather than a single path. It is then possible to stochastically sample from the distribution an infinite number of dynamically and aesthetically consistent trajectories which mimic the variability that is typically observed in human drawing or writing. We further demonstrate how this system can be used together with a simple user interface in order to explore different stylisations of interactively or procedurally defined letters...|$|R
50|$|CBBC relaunched {{again on}} Monday 3 September 2007, {{with a new}} logo {{revolving}} around the letters of CBBC, each in a different style. A new set of idents followed these up, revolving around scenes including each of the 4 <b>stylised</b> <b>letters</b> before coming together at the end. These scenes could involve cartoon figures (including Shaun the Sheep and Tracy Beaker), or stars of current CBBC programmes (such as Barney Harwood, James Mackenzie, Daniel Anthony, Dani Harmer, Ed Petrie, Mark Speight and Richard Hammond). Numerous different styles were made involving the different scenes, and were added regularly to reflect programmes. Children could also make their own versions, the so-called Mash Up, on the CBBC website, and indeed some of these {{were added to the}} main set. At the end of this sequence, a two-dimensional cartoon style endboard was added that contained the CBBC logo animating into place, against a white background with the green zig-zag lines of the look animating {{around the edge of the}} screen. This was altered on 10 September 2010, when the CBBC logo was given a 3D glossy look, and as a result the end boards were changed to a fully formed CBBC logo moving around on the green bars on the screen.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{creation}} of Microïds in 1984 the company has {{had a number of}} different logos. During the mid-1980s the company used a logo with white writing and a yellow shape to the left. From around 1986 until 1995 they used a logo showing a curvy <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> M, which may look like a simple drawing of a bird; initially this had a background depicting a 3D scene. Fellow French video game developer with links to Microïds, White Birds, also use similar simple drawings of birds as their logo. In the mid-1990s the company changed their logo slightly to contain the colours of the rainbow, but without a background.|$|E
5000|$|The first club crest was {{designed}} by Mincho Kachulev in 1922. Initially {{in the size of}} a square with a blue background, it was intentionally written in a <b>stylised</b> <b>letter</b> [...] "Л" [...] (Bulgarian letter [...] "L"; shortened for Levski). The inner space of the letter was filled vertically equally in yellow and red colours. In a later period of time, the Cyrillic letters [...] "С" [...] (Sport) and [...] "К" [...] (club) were added {{at the top of the}} square, while the bottom side was inscribed with the name [...] "Sofia". This badge was used by the club until 1949, when it was renamed to Dinamo.|$|E

500|$|The club's {{current crest}} is a shield divided {{vertically}} into halves {{of black and}} white stripes and solid blue, reflecting the club's original and modern kits. On the blue half is the county emblem of Kent, a white horse rampant, albeit slightly altered from its normal form as its mane is <b>stylised</b> into the <b>letters</b> of the word [...] "Gills". This side has been sometimes given a red or pink background, to coordinate with away kits featuring those colours. The club's motto, which appears on a scroll below the crest, is Domus clamantium, the Latin for [...] "the home of the shouting men", a traditional epithet associated with the town of Gillingham. [...] In keeping with the crest, the club's mascot, Tommy Trewblu, {{takes the form of a}} horse. [...] He first appeared at a match against Macclesfield Town in October 1998.|$|R
