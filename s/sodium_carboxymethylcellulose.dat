In all the gels formulated, the concentration of propylene glycol and ethanol was kept constant at 15 % and 40 % respectively. Clobetasol propionate was used in the concentration of 0. 05 % in all the gel formulations. Propylene glycol served as a co-solvent for drug. Triethanolamine was used to neutralize carbopol gel systems. Methyl paraben and propyl paraben were used as preservatives. A total of twenty two formulations were prepared with 6 formulation containing combination of various gelli ng agents. The total concentration of gelling agent in these six formulations was kept constant at 2 %. The Remaining sixteen formulations were prepared with the use of four different gelling agents viz., Carbopol- 934, Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K 4 m, <b>Carboxymethylcellulose</b> <b>Sodium</b> and Sodium Alginate. Four formulations were prepared with each gelling agent in concentration ranging from 0. 5 - 2. 0 %. Formulations were evaluated for pH, homogeneity, grittiness, viscosity, spreadability, drug content and In-Vitro drug release studies. Drug content was high (> 98 %) in gels.

50|$|Hydrocolloids are {{long-chain}} polymers {{that form}} viscous dispersions and gels if dispersed in water. They {{have a number}} of functional properties in food products including emulsifying, thickening, coating, gelling, and stabilization. The main reason hydrocolloids are used in foods is their capability to modify the rheology of food systems. Hydrocolloids impact viscosity through flow behavior and mechanical solid properties like texture. Some common hydrocolloids that are used to stabilize juice products include gellan, <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose,</b> xanthan, guar gum, and gum Arabic. The afore mentioned hydrocolloids are generally used in the production of imitation orange juices and are often referred to as synthetic hydrocolloids.

50|$|Metallurgically the {{concentrate}} {{is likely}} to be relatively complex. It will contain arsenic which could well incur smelter penalties in the early years because of the enargite (Cu3AsS4) {{in the top of the}} deposit. The zinc and antimony are unlikely to be a problem. A more serious problem is the presence of variable quantities of talc which come out with the copper/molybdenum concentrate and tend to depress the copper grade of the concentrate. <b>Sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> (CMC), will suppress the talc in the flotation process but it has the unfortunate side effect of reducing molybdenum recovery. It gives a higher grade copper concentrate but also lower recovery. A high grade copper concentrate is very desirable because smelters generally deduct 1% from the copper content which is a higher percentage of a low grade concentrate than a high one.|$|E

50|$|Lead azide in its pure {{form was}} first {{prepared}} by Theodor Curtius in 1891. Due to sensitivity and stability concerns, the dextrinated form of lead azide (MIL-L-3055) {{was developed in}} the 1920s and 1930s with large scale production by DuPont Co beginning in 1932. Detonator development during World War II resulted in the need for a form of lead azide with a more brisant output. RD-1333 lead azide (MIL-DTL-46225), a version of lead azide with <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> as a precipitating agent, was developed to meet that need. The Vietnam War saw an accelerated need for lead azide and it was during this time that Special Purpose Lead Azide (MIL-L-14758) was developed; the US government also began stockpiling lead azide in large quantities. After the Vietnam War, the use of lead azide dramatically decreased. Due {{to the size of the}} US stockpile, the manufacture of lead azide in the US ceased completely by the early 1990s. In the 2000s, concerns about the age and stability of stockpiled lead azide led the US government to investigate methods to dispose of its stockpiled lead azide and obtain new manufacturers.|$|E

The rheological studies demonstrated that the end-product of the complexation of low viscous methacrylate copolymer and entangled solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> generated a polymer, which exhibited a solid-like behavior with a three-dimensional network. Additionally, the rheological profile of the <b>sodium</b> <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> and methacrylate copolymer with respect to the effect of various concentrations of acetic acid on the synthesis of the IPEC was elucidated using molecular mechanics energy relationships (MMER) by exploring the spatial disposition of carboxymethylcellulose and methacrylate copolymer with respect to each other and acetic acid.
