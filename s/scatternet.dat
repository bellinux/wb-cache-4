5000|$|A <b>scatternet</b> {{is a type}} of ad hoc {{computer}} network consisting of two or more piconets. The terms [...] "scatternet" [...] and [...] "piconet" [...] are typically applied to Bluetooth wireless technology.|$|E
50|$|The Bluetooth Core Specification {{provides}} for the connection {{of two or more}} piconets to form a <b>scatternet,</b> in which certain devices simultaneously play the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another.|$|E
50|$|A <b>scatternet</b> is {{a number}} of {{interconnected}} piconets that supports communication between more than 8 devices. Scatternets can be formed when {{a member of one}} piconet (either the master or one of the slaves) elects to participate as a slave in a second, separate piconet. The device participating in both piconets can relay data between members of both ad hoc networks. However, the basic Bluetooth protocol does not support this relaying - the host software of each device would need to manage it. Using this approach, it is possible to join together numerous piconets into a large <b>scatternet,</b> and to expand the physical size of the network beyond Bluetooth's limited range.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{there are}} very few actual {{implementations}} of <b>scatternets</b> due to limitations of Bluetooth and the MAC address protocol. However, there is {{a growing body of research}} being conducted with the goal of developing algorithms to efficiently form <b>scatternets.</b>|$|R

Although only the basic single-hop star-shaped topology called piconet is currently available, Bluetooth will surely evolve towards multi-hop connectivity {{in the near}} future. These multi-hop networks (called <b>scatternets)</b> offer {{a wide range of}} possible topologies. In this paper it is argued that the overall efficiency of <b>scatternets</b> heavily depends on the specific network topology employed. Furthermore, we introduce a class of network topologies that are efficient with respect to the aggregate bandwidth possible. A distributed algorithm for automatic network establishment is outlined...|$|R

50|$|Scatternets {{have the}} {{potential}} to bring the interconnectivity of the Internet to the physical world through wireless devices. A number of companies have attempted to launch social networking and dating services that leverage early <b>scatternet</b> implementations (see Bluedating).

Initially, Bluetooth {{will be used}} as a replacement for point-to-(multi) point cables. However, in due course of time, solutions for forming multihop ad hoc networks over Bluetooth (referred to as <b>scatternets)</b> will be needed. In this paper, we explore the design space of routing protocols over Bluetooth <b>scatternets.</b> We argue that ad hoc routing protocols for Bluetooth must make a different set of design compromises compared to those being developed by the MANET working group. These differences result primarily from the specific characteristics of the Bluetooth physical and link layer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the issue of}} piconet interconnection for Bluetooth technology.

While the Bluetooth specification permits piconet interconnection, the creation, operation and maintenance of <b>scatternets</b> remains open. In this paper, the research contributions in this arena are brought together, to give an overview of the state-of-the-art. First, operation of the Bluetooth system is explained, followed by the mechanism for link formation. Then, the issue of piconet interconnection is considered in detail. Processes for network formation, routing and intra- and inter-piconet scheduling, are explained and classified. Finally, the research issues arising are outline...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} Bluetooth <b>scatternet</b> {{formation}} is: given N isolated wireless mobile Bluetooth devices, how {{to form a}} <b>scatternet</b> to satisfy a set of general guidelines and performance metrics? The <b>scatternet</b> formation protocol is an open issue in the Bluetooth specification [1]. The topology of a <b>scatternet</b> has a great effect {{on the performance of}} the network. There are many ways to construct a <b>scatternet</b> with a given set of N Bluetooth devices, but so far there are very few papers that discuss the issues related to <b>scatternet</b> formation. This major report focuses on the problem of the <b>scatternet</b> formation in Bluetooth mobile ad hoc networks. We critically summarize the current research on <b>scatternet</b> formation and give the advantages and the disadvantages of each <b>scatternet</b> formation protocol. Then, we describe some general guidelines and performance metrics for <b>scatternet</b> formation. Finally, we propose three new topologies for Bluetooth scatternets called DRT, RFCM, and CMT, and compute various performance metrics for them.

40|$|Intra- and inter-piconet {{scheduling}} are {{two important}} design issues in Bluetooth personal area networks. The performance of asynchronous data traffic in Bluetooth piconets and <b>scatternets</b> {{is very much}} dependent on {{the choice of the}} polling scheme. In this thesis, we compare different polling schemes used in intra-piconet scheduling and argue that the E-limited polling scheme is the best one to use, since it is efficient yet simple enough. We then use the analytical results on evaluating E-limited scheduling, capturing the most representative performance variables, and present three admission control algorithms on Bluetooth Piconets with E-limited scheduling scheme. Bluetooth piconets may be joined to form complex networks called <b>scatternets.</b> In such cases, inter-piconet scheduling becomes a challenging problem. As Slave/Slave bridges {{have been shown to be}} more efficient than Master/Slave bridges, we analyze different SS bridge inter-piconet scheduling algorithms.

Initially Bluetooth {{will be used as}} a replacement for point-to-(multi) point cables. However, in due course, there will be a need for forming multihop ad-hoc networks over Bluetooth, referred to as <b>scatternets.</b> This paper investigates the capacity assignment problem in Bluetooth <b>scatternets.</b> The problem arises primarily from the special characteristics of the network and its solution requires new protocols. We formulate it as a problem of minimizing a convex function over a convex set contained in the matching polytope. We develop an optimal algorithm which is similar to the well-known flow deviation algorithm and that calls for solving a maximum-weight matching problem at each iteration. A centralized heuristic algorithm with a relatively low complexity is also developed. Then, since in an ad-hoc network there is no central authority that is responsible for network optimization, a distributed heuristic algorithm is proposed. Finally, numerical results are presented and it is shown that the heuristic algorithms usually converge to results that are relatively close to the optimal results...|$|R

40|$|Even though home {{automation}} {{is a well-known}} research and development area, recent technological improvements in different areas such as context recognition, sensing, wireless communications or embedded systems have boosted wireless smart homes. This paper focuses {{on some of those}} areas related to {{home automation}}. The paper draws attention to wireless communications issues on embedded systems. Specifically, the paper discusses the multi-hop networking together with Bluetooth technology and latency, as a quality of service (QoS) metric. Bluetooth is a worldwide standard that provides low power multi-hop networking. It is a radio license free technology and establishes point-to-point and point-to-multipoint links, known as piconets, or multi-hop networks, known as <b>scatternets.</b> This way, many Bluetooth nodes can be interconnected to deploy ambient intelligent networks. This paper introduces the research on multi-hop latency done with park and sniff low power modes of Bluetooth over the test platform developed. Besides, an empirical model is obtained to calculate the latency of Bluetooth multi-hop communications over asynchronous links when links in <b>scatternets</b> are always in sniff or the park mode. Smart home devices and networks designers would take advantage of the models and the estimation of the delay they provide in communications along Bluetooth multi-hop networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract– – The {{last few}} years have seen the {{evolution}} of telecommunications from the classic architectures, mainly based on static and wired structures, to the new mobile solutions based on wireless technologies. This trend has led, on the one side, {{to the definition of}} the third–generation mobile telecommunication systems and, on the other, to the development of personal area networks. The standards that are supposed to play a leading role in these two fields in the near future are the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and the Bluetooth (BT) radio technology, respectively. In this paper, we advocate that a hybrid architecture of UMTS and Bluetooth {{can take advantage of the}} complementary characteristics of these two technologies and provide a total solution for an indoor communication environment. We envision a cooperating scenario in which small Bluetooth networks (<b>scatternets)</b> offer basic wireless connectivity to several peripheral units scattered over small areas, while indoor UMTS supports communication among <b>scatternets</b> and provides wireless access to the Internet. We focus our analysis on a centralized topology, in which communication occurs only between the peripheral units and the access point. This topology can be used in many different application scenarios and represents an example of cooperation between 3 G and PAN technologies. In addition to describing the architecture, we address the issue of fair capacity allocation in such a centralized topology and provide some analytic and simulation results for the topology considered. 1...|$|R

Being a master of seven slaves is possible; being a slave {{of more than one}} master is possible. The specification is vague as to required behavior in <b>scatternets.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Bluetooth is a {{promising}} short-range radio technology for wireless personal area networks. There is an interest {{to expand the}} coverage of such networks by interconnecting them to form scatternets. Most of the <b>scatternet</b> formation algorithms recently proposed in the literature do not support dynamic topology changes, and the master or bridge nodes in the resulting <b>scatternet</b> may become the traffic bottleneck and reduce network throughput. In this paper, we propose a Two-Phase <b>Scatternet</b> Formation (TPSF) protocol to support dynamic topology changes while maintaining a high aggregate throughput. In the first phase, a Control <b>Scatternet</b> is constructed to support topology changes and route determination. The second phase creates a separate On-demand <b>Scatternet</b> whenever a node wants to initiate data communications with another node. The On-demand <b>Scatternet</b> is torn down when the data transmissions are finished. Since all the time slots in an On-demand <b>Scatternet</b> are dedicated to a single communication session, a high aggregate throughput is achieved {{at the expense of}} a slightly higher connection setup delay.
