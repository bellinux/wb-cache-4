50|$|The G1/S transition, more {{commonly}} known as the Start checkpoint in budding yeast (the restriction point in other organisms) regulates cell cycle commitment. At this checkpoint, cells either arrest before DNA replication (due to limiting nutrients or a pheromone signal), prolong G1 (size control), or begin replication and progress {{through the rest of the}} cell cycle. The G1/S regulatory network or regulon in budding yeast includes the G1 cyclins Cln1, Cln2 and Cln3, Cdc28 (Cdk1), the transcription factors SBF and MBF, and the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5. Cln3 interacts with Cdk1 to initiate the sequence of events by phosphorylating a large number of targets, including SBF, MBF and Whi5. Phosphorylation of Whi5 causes it to translocate out of the nucleus, preventing it from inhibiting SBF and MBF. Active SBF/MBF drive the G1/S transition by turning on the B-type cyclins and initiating DNA replication, bud formation and <b>spindle</b> <b>body</b> duplication. Moreover, SBF/MBF drives expression of Cln1 and Cln2, which can also interact with Cdk1 to promote phosphorylation of its targets.|$|E
5000|$|The SAC {{monitors}} {{the interaction between}} improperly connected kinetochores and spindle microtubules, and is maintained until kinetochores are properly attached to the spindle. During prometaphase, CDC20 and the SAC proteins concentrate at the kinetochores before attachment to the spindle assembly. These proteins keep the SAC activated until they are removed and the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment is made. Even a single unattached kinetochore can maintain the spindle checkpoint. After attachment of microtubule plus-ends and formation of kinetochore microtubules, MAD1 and MAD2 are depleted from the kinetochore assembly. Another regulator of checkpoint activation is kinetochore tension. When sister kinetochores are properly attached to opposite spindle poles, forces in the mitotic spindle generate tension at the kinetochores. Bi-oriented sister kinetochores stabilize the kinetochore-microtubule assembly whereas weak tension has a destabilizing effect. In response to incorrect kinetochore attachments such as syntelic attachment, where both kinetochores becomes attached to one spindle pole, the weak tension generated destabilizes the incorrect attachment and allows the kinetochore to reattach correctly to the <b>spindle</b> <b>body.</b> During this process, kinetochores that {{are attached to the}} mitotic spindle but that are not under tension trigger the spindle checkpoint. Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase of the chromosomal passenger complex functions as the tensions sensor in improper kinetochore attachments. It detects and destabilizes incorrect attachments through control of the microtubule-severing KINI kinesin MCAK, the DASH complex, and the Ndc80/Hec1 complex [...] at the microtubule-kinetochore interface. The Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase is also critical in correcting merotelic attachments, where one kinetochore is simultaneously attached to both spindle poles. Merotelic attachments generate sufficient tension and are not detected by the SAC, and without correction, may result in chromosome mis-segregation due to slow chromatid migration speed. While microtubule attachment is independently required for SAC activation, it is unclear whether tension is an independent regulator of SAC, although it is clear that differing regulatory behaviors arise with tension.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 The precise {{regulation}} and coordination of the mitotic spindle {{is vital for}} accurate chromosomal segregation within a dividing cell. The centrosome is the microtubule organizing center of the cell, responsible for nucleating and organizing the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. In yeast, the centrosome functional equivalent is called the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body.</b> The studies presented here aimed to understand how microtubules are nucleated at the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> and also studied the {{regulation and}} mechanical strength of the yeast <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> in vitro. In yeast, the γ-tubulin small complex, a highly conserved heterotetramer essential for microtubule nucleation, is composed of two copies of Tub 4, and one copy each of Spc 97 and Spc 98. In this study, a comprehensive mutagenesis technique coupled with high-throughput sequencing was used to identify regions of Spc 97 and Spc 98 that were essential {{for the formation of}} the γ-tubulin small complex and mutations that influenced the organization of the mitotic spindle. Regions essential for structure and function of the complex were mapped onto the protein sequence for both Spc 97 and Spc 98 and temperature sensitive mutants identified by the mutagenic screen were isolated and their unique nucleation phenotypes characterized. Improvements were made to historical <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> purification methods to facilitate a variety of in vitro biochemical and biophysical assays that had previously been hindered by technological constraints. Higher <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> yields, purity, and reproducibility enabled a re-evaluation of the yeast <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> cell cycle phosphoproteome. High confidence phosphorylation assignments were collected and compared to previously published data sets to reduce the ambiguity in the phosphoproteome data set while also expanding the data set to analyze the novel phosphorylation profile of the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> in G 1 /S. In vivo characterization of the high confidence phosphorylation sites revealed a combination of phosphorylation events in Spc 97 that were essential for cell viability. The adaptability of the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> purification methods also allowed for the purification of genetic mutants of the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body,</b> which were studied by biophysical assays. The strength of the microtubule attachment to the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> was probed by a laser trapping technique to determine how mutations in <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> component Spc 110 affected the physical integrity of the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body.</b> It was shown that mutations in Spc 110 decreased the force at which the microtubule was pulled from the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body,</b> providing mechanical evidence for in vivo phenotypes of mitotic spindle failure. Together, these experiments interrogated several aspects of the yeast <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> in vivo and in vitro to better understand the requirements for and regulation of microtubule nucleation...|$|R

40|$|Positioning of the {{mitotic spindle}} {{is crucial for}} proper cell division. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two {{mechanisms}} contribute to spindle positioning. In the Kar 9 pathway, astral microtubules emanating from the daughter-bound <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> interact via the linker protein Kar 9 with the myosin Myo 2, which moves the microtubule along the actin cables towards the neck. In the dynein pathway, astral microtubules off-load dynein onto the cortical anchor protein Num 1, which is followed by dynein pulling on the spindle. Yet, the mechanism by which microtubules target cortical anchor sites is unknown. Here we quantify the pivoting motion of astral microtubules around the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>bodies,</b> which occurs during spindle translocation towards the neck and through the neck. We show that this pivoting is largely driven by the Kar 9 pathway. The microtubules emanating from the daughter-bound <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> pivot faster than those at the mother-bound <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body.</b> The Kar 9 pathway reduces the time needed for an astral microtubule inside the daughter cell to start pulling on the spindle.

40|$|Methyl benzimidazol- 2 -yl-carbamate (MBC), at a {{concentration}} of 100 fiM, has a pronounced effect on the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulting in the accumulation of cells as large doublets. We have determined a specific execution point for the effect of MBC on the yeast cell cycle, and have shown that this execution point is between the cell cycle events of <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> duplication and <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> separation. An ultrastructural examination of the MBC-treated cells revealed the absence of cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules. MBC treatment also produced an altered <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> morphology, causing {{the disappearance of the}} outer component. Nuclear size was also markedly increased in the MBC-induced doublet cells, although septa were completely absent from these doublet cells. It is proposed that MBC inhibits microtubule polymerization, rather than causing the depolymerization of stable microtubules...|$|R
40|$|The FIN 1 gene {{from the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a basic protein with {{putative}} coiled-coil regions. Here {{we show that}} in large-budded cells a green fluorescent protein-Fin 1 fusion protein is visible as a filament between the two <b>spindle</b> pole <b>bodies.</b> In resting cells the protein is undetectable, and in small-budded cells it is localized in the nucleus. During late mitosis it localizes on the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>bodies.</b> Filaments of cyano fluorescent protein-tagged Fin 1 colocalize with filaments of green fluorescent protein-tagged Tub 1 only in large-budded cells. By electron and atomic force microscopy we showed that purified recombinant Fin 1 p self-assembles into filaments with a diameter of ≈ 10 nm. Our {{results indicate that the}} Fin 1 protein forms a cell cycle-specific filament, additional to the microtubules, between the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>bodies</b> of dividing yeast cells...|$|R

40|$|Sporulation in diploid cells {{homozygous}} for the cyr 1 - 2 mutation of {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae was examined. This mutation causes a defect in adenylate cyclase and temperature-sensitive arrest in the G 1 {{phase of the}} mitotic cell cycle. The cyr 1 - 2 /cyr 1 - 2 diploid cells were able to initiate meiotic divisions, but produced predominantly two- spored asci at the restrictive temperature. Temperature-sensitive period for production of two-spored asci was approximately 12 h after the transfer of cells to the sporulation medium. The levels of cAMP increased during this period in the wild type and cyr 1 - 2 /cyr 1 - 2 diploid cells incubated at the permissive temperature, but remained at an extremely low level in the cyr 1 - 2 /cyr 1 - 2 diploid cells incubated at the restrictive temperature. Dyad analysis of the cyr 1 - 2 strain indicated that meiotic products were randomly included into ascospores. Fluorescent microscopy of the cyr 1 - 2 /cyr 1 - 2 diploid cells incubated at the restrictive temperature revealed that individual haploid nuclei were enclosed {{in each of the}} two spores after meiosis. About half of the cyr 1 - 2 /cyr 1 - 2 diploid cells entered normal meiosis 1 producing two normal <b>spindle</b> pole <b>bodies</b> with inner and outer plaques, and the other half entered abnormal meiosis 1 producing one normal <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> and one defective <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> without out plaque. At meiosis II, some cells contained a pair of normal <b>spindle</b> pole <b>bodies</b> and other cells contained pairs of normal and abnormal <b>spindle</b> pole <b>bodies...</b>|$|R
40|$|During meiosis II in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cytoplasmic {{face of the}} <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> changes from a site of {{microtubule}} initiation to a site of de novo membrane formation. These membranes are required to package the haploid meiotic products into spores. This functional change in the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> involves the expansion and modification of its cytoplasmic face, termed the outer plaque. We report here that SPO 21 is required for this modification. The Spo 21 protein localizes to the spindle pole in meiotic cells. In the absence of SPO 21 {{the structure of the}} outer plaque is abnormal, and prospore membranes do not form. Further, decreased dosage of SPO 21 leaves only two of the four <b>spindle</b> pole <b>bodies</b> competent to generate membranes. Mutation of CNM 67, encoding a known component of the mitotic outer plaque, also results in a meiotic outer plaque defect but does not block membrane formation, suggesting that Spo 21 p may play a direct role in initiating membrane formation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> of {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has served as}} a model system for {{understanding}} microtubule organizing centers, yet very {{little is known about the}} molecular structure of its components. We report here the structure of the C-terminal domain of the core component Cnm 67 at 2. 3 Å resolution. The structure determination was aided by a novel approach to crystallization of proteins containing coiled-coils that utilizes globular domains to stabilize the coiled-coils. This enhances their solubility in Escherichia coli and improves their crystallization. The Cnm 67 C-terminal domain (residues Asn- 429 —Lys- 581) exhibits a previously unseen dimeric, interdigitated, all α-helical fold. In vivo studies demonstrate that this domain alone is able to localize to the <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body.</b> In addition, the structure reveals a large functionally indispensable positively charged surface patch that is implicated in <b>spindle</b> pole <b>body</b> localization. Finally, the C-terminal eight residues are disordered but are critical for protein folding and structural stability...|$|R
