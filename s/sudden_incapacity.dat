50|$|The {{basic level}} for track access for Network Rail is the Personal Track Safety {{certificate}} (PTS) {{as defined by}} the railway safety standards NR/L2/CTM/021. These levels of certification only assess the individual’s ability to work safely in the track environment. This means that the individual is able to respond and correctly react to circumstances which may arise in this potentially dangerous environment. Persons therefore should not have any condition or be taking any medication that may lead to <b>sudden</b> <b>incapacity,</b> loss of consciousness, dizziness, impairment of awareness, concentration, balance, coordination, or any significant limitation of mobility or impairment of hearing and vision. Persons with minor medical conditions (e.g. colour blind) may still be issued a PTS - though the card will have an indicator, a blue circle, to inform the Controller of Site Safety (COSS) to that person's ailment. Similarly, those who have only recently got their PTS certificate will have a green square on their card to indicate their 'new' status, as well as a blue hard hat instead of the usual white hard hat.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the incidence of}} fatal traffic accidents caused by <b>sudden</b> <b>incapacity</b> of the driver due to cardiac and other illnesses. The retrospective analysis was gleaned from Finnish traffic accident data files from 1984 - 1989, and police records of traffic accidents, from Canton de Vaud, Switzerland from 1986 - 1989. The annual rates of all traffic fatalities per million inhabitants were 125 in Finland and 212 in Vaud. Sudden driver incapacity due to acute illness caused 1. 8 and 7. 3 automobile driver deaths annually per million inhabitants in Finland and in Vaud, respectively. The corresponding rates for all-cause traffic deaths were 326 and 423, for driver deaths 105 and 167, and for those due to driver incapacity 4. 7 and 15. 6. Sudden driver incapacity caused 1. 5 % of all traffic deaths in Finland, and 3. 4 % in Vaud. Probable cardiac arrest caused 2. 1 % of all drivers' deaths in Finland and 1. 7 % in Vaud, respectively. Deaths caused by professional drivers' <b>sudden</b> <b>incapacity</b> were responsible for 0. 11 % of all traffic deaths in Finland, and for 0 % in Vaud. Old age and short mileage were associated with illness-caused accidents. Accidents caused by <b>sudden</b> <b>incapacity</b> of the driver are rare causes of traffic deaths and hard to foresee. While this report relates to all drivers, we suggest there should be individual risk stratification for professional drivers with heart disease. However, non-professional drivers who are elderly and who have symptomatic cardiac disease should limit their driving to short distances and at low speed...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{equations}} {{have been}} developed to assist in determining fitness for work of people with diseases that may cause rapid loss of control. The four equations calculate the frequency of fatal injury to the person with the disease, the frequency of fatal injury to colleagues in the workplace, and the cost of fatal injury and property damage to the employer, it is suggested that the additional risk of fatal injury to the person with the disease should not exceed the fatal injury rate in high-risk industries such as forestry, fishing and mining. it is also suggested that the additional risk of fatal injury to each colleague should be no more than one-tenth of the fatal injury rate due to motor vehicle accidents in the community. Two hypothetical case examples are given, demonstrating the use of the equations. The equations highlight the need to examine the risks associated with individuals, their specific jobs and their workplaces. They also highlight significant uncertainties in the determination of fitness, which perhaps have been underestimated in the past. Wherever possible, redundant defences should be utilized to prevent accidents in the event of <b>sudden</b> <b>incapacity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Injuries and {{fatalities}} {{occur in}} {{all forms of}} transpor-tation, but numerically, road-traffic accidents ac-count for the great majority worldwide. There is little that the autopsy surgeon {{can contribute to the}} elucidation of factors leading to the accident as it is largely the circumstantial and forensic laboratory evidence which is likely to reveal a non-accidental cause. However, the doctor's role in detecting the compatibility/incompatibility of the injuries with those usually sustained in traffic accidents (to detect any which are 'atypical', e. g. focal depressed fracture of the skull), distinguishing antemortem from post-mortem injuries, demonstrating the presence of any disease capable of creating <b>sudden</b> <b>incapacity</b> and analysing samples for alcohol/drugs, etc., {{can go a long way}} in assigning roles to the human and to some extent vehicular and environmental factors. This warrants that a meticulous autopsy be conducted and not merely a catalogue of injuries. It must be appreciated that a fatal accident is likely to result in litigation and the extent of litigation cannot be anticipated at the time of the autopsy. One must, therefore, aim at the close study of any accident victim and a careful assessment of the case is always rewarding. The present study was undertaken in the Depart...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{concerns}} of older carers {{of an adult}} with disabilities have been well documented. The <b>sudden</b> <b>incapacity</b> or death of the carer {{can result in a}} crisis response rather than a planned transition to a chosen sustainable alternative care arrangement for the person with disability. Building on previous ‘Futures Planning’ projects, the aim of this project was to enrich the lives of people with disabilities and their carers whilst ensuring that their wishes for the future are documented to provide security. Materials and Methods: This article reports on information sessions and workshops that were held for people with disabilities, their carers and staff, and the training sessions for staff for this project. Results: The sessions underlined the fact that people with disabilities want to enjoy the same experiences that most other people enjoy. Drawing on the ideas and suggestions from participants, the ‘Futures Planning’ documents were modified to meet the aims of the Quality Living project, making them suitable for planning for quality living for the carer and the person with a disability for the next 10 years. Conclusions: Findings supported the concept that planning allows people with disabilities and their carers to take steps to achieve their dreams...|$|E
