25|$|The {{execution}} of Saddam Hussein {{took place on}} Saturday, 30 December, 2006. <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> sentenced to death by hanging, after being convicted of crimes against humanity by the Iraqi Special Tribunal {{for the murder of}} 148 Iraqi Shi'ites in the town of Dujail in 1982, in retaliation for an assassination attempt against him.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Saddam {{participated in}} a bloodless coup led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr that overthrew Abdul Rahman Arif. Saddam and Salah Omar al-Ali {{contacted}} Ba'athists {{in the military and}} helped lead them on the ground. Arif was given refuge in London and then Istanbul. Al-Bakr was named president and <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist Revolutionary Command Council. According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability. Although <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician. Al-Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, but by 1969 Saddam clearly had become the moving force behind the party.|$|E

25|$|On 29 January 2006, {{the trial}} was thrown in disarray after a {{courtroom}} session in which Saddam's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was dragged away by guards, the defense team walked out, and <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> ejected following a slanging match with chief judge Rauf Rashid Abd al-Rahman, who had replaced former chief judge Rizgar Amin, who resigned after complaining of government interference.|$|E
25|$|On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein {{was found}} guilty of crimes against {{humanity}} and sentenced to death by hanging.

25|$|British tabloid {{newspaper}} The Sun {{posted a}} picture of Saddam wearing white briefs on the front cover of a newspaper.

25|$|On 13 December 2003, in Operation Red Dawn, Saddam Hussein was {{captured}} by American forces after being found hiding in {{a hole in the}} ground near a farmhouse in ad-Dawr, near Tikrit. Following his capture, <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the American base near Baghdad. On 14 December, U.S. administrator in Iraq L. Paul Bremer confirmed that Saddam Hussein had indeed been captured at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr near Tikrit. Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} {{took place}} at the joint Iraqi-American military base Camp Justice, located in Kazimain, a north-eastern suburb of Baghdad. Contrary to initial reports, <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> executed alone, not {{at the same time as}} his co-defendants Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, who were executed on 15 January 2007. Barzan was decapitated by the rope due to incorrect calculations of his body weight and length of drop. Saddam's cousin and one of his six co-defendants Ali Hassan al-Majid was sentenced to death and was hanged on 25 January 2010.|$|E
25|$|SAD teams also {{conducted}} missions {{behind enemy lines}} to identify leadership targets. These missions led to the initial air strikes against Saddam and his generals. Although the strike against <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful in killing him, it effectively ended his ability to command and control his forces. Strikes against Iraq's generals were more successful and significantly degraded the Iraqi command's ability to react to, and maneuver against, the U.S.-led invasion force. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers into surrendering their units once the fighting started.|$|E

"The {{execution}} of <b>Saddam</b> Hussein <b>is</b> a big crime. <b>Saddam</b> Hussein <b>was</b> {{a prisoner of}} war and was arrested by the U.S. forces, and not by the Iraqi government.

25|$|The Iraqi {{government}} and military collapsed within {{three weeks of}} the beginning of the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq on 20 March. By the beginning of April, U.S.-led forces occupied much of Iraq. The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to guerrilla tactics, and it appeared that Saddam had lost control of Iraq. He was last seen in a video which purported to show him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters. When Baghdad fell to U.S.-led forces on 9 April, marked symbolically by the toppling of his statue by iconoclasts, <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> nowhere to be found.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, a {{coalition}} {{led by the}} U.S. invaded Iraq to depose Saddam, in which U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair falsely accused him of possessing {{weapons of mass destruction}} and having ties to al-Qaeda. Saddam's Ba'ath party was disbanded and elections were held. Following his capture on 13 December 2003, the trial of Saddam took place under the Iraqi Interim Government. On 5 November 2006, <b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> convicted of crimes against humanity related to the 1982 killing of 148 Iraqi Shi'a, and sentenced to death by hanging. His execution was carried out on 30 December 2006.|$|E
25|$|<b>Saddam</b> <b>was</b> {{captured}} by U.S. forces on 13 December 2003. He remained in custody by United States forces at Camp Cropper in Baghdad, along with eleven senior Ba'athist officials.

Saddam asserted in his defense that he had been unlawfully overthrown, and was still the president of Iraq.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in {{an answer}} to a {{parliamentary}} question, that [...] "Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq {{of weapons of mass}} destruction..." [...] In November of that year, Blair further stated that, [...] "So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not rÃ©gime change â€“ that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of <b>Saddam</b> <b>is</b> a very brutal and repressive regime, I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people ... so I have got no doubt <b>Saddam</b> <b>is</b> very bad for Iraq, {{but on the other hand}} I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change." ...|$|R
25|$|In April 2003, Saddam's {{whereabouts}} {{remained in}} question during the weeks following {{the fall of}} Baghdad and {{the conclusion of the}} major fighting of the war. Various sightings of <b>Saddam</b> <b>were</b> reported in the weeks following the war, but none were authenticated. At various times Saddam released audio tapes promoting popular resistance to his ousting.|$|R
