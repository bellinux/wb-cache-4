5|$|Montcalm, before {{agreeing to}} these terms, {{tried to make}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Indian allies {{understood}} them, and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men. This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp, which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present. The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp, and Monro was quartered in the French camp. The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it, butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind. The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out of that area, and it took much effort to prevent plunder and scalping there. Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning, but after seeing the Indian bloodlust, decided to attempt the march that night. When the Indians became aware that the British {{were getting ready to}} move, a large number of them massed around the camp, causing the leaders to call off the march until morning.|$|E

While Garnett did express interest in playing for one more season with the Timberwolves, primarily with the goal in helping the team {{make it to the}} playoffs again with its promising young players and new head coach, he also told the team's owner that he wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> knees would hold up for one more season.|$|E
25|$|With {{an electoral}} college Leadership system in prospect, James Callaghan {{resigned}} as Leader in October 1980 to make <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> successor was elected {{under the old}} system. Heffer regarded such an election as illegitimate and moved to suspend it until the new system was agreed, but the Parliamentary Labour Party rejected it. He considered standing as a candidate himself but eventually deferred to Michael Foot who was eventually elected (against expectations). Due to a resignation, Heffer was briefly promoted {{to be a member}} of the Shadow Cabinet in October–November 1980. Foot made Heffer spokesman on Europe and Community Affairs from November.|$|E

25|$|Out {{of a job}} he {{took the}} post of Professional and coach for Forfarshire in Scottish county cricket. In 1933 he {{finished}} third in the county batting averages and set a club record by taking 104 wickets. A number of times in 1933 and 1934 Somerset asked him to play but the Forforshire committee refused. Andrews was keen to return to first-class cricket and during his two seasons in Scotland he made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> improved performances were well reported in the local newspapers. His success was such that Somerset offered him a contract for the 1935 season.|$|E
25|$|The Liberals {{called a}} general {{election}} for January 1910, and Law {{spent most of the}} preceding months campaigning up and down the country for other Conservative candidates and MPs, <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Dulwich seat was safe. He obtained an increased majority of 2,418. The overall result was more confused: the Conservatives gained 116 seats, bringing their total to 273, but this was still less than the Liberal caucus, and produced a hung parliament, as neither had a majority of the seats (the Irish Parliamentary Party, the Labour Party and the All-for-Ireland League took more than 120 seats in total). The Liberals remained in office {{with the support of the}} Irish Parliamentary Party. The Budget passed through the House of Commons a second time, and – as it now had an electoral mandate – was then approved by the House of Lords without a division.|$|E

In his address to his staff in Qingdao branch, he emphasized that they must appreciate their customers business—whether for one or 100 Chinese dollars—must {{do their best to}} give their customers convenience, and must be friendly to businessmen. He said “the customer’s psychology always favors a busy place,” because the sight of a busy firm will make people trust it and claimed that the aim of The Shanghai Bank was to serve society and not just make a profit. So, even though some services would not be profitable, they still had to be offered.

25|$|Edison's major {{innovation}} was {{the establishment}} of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 {{the early}} {{settlers}} {{found themselves in}} need of a government after the death of pioneer Ewing Young. Young had accumulated much wealth as a successful rancher following the Willamette Cattle Company events of 1837 when he and a group of other settlers herded over 600 head of cattle from California to Oregon. This made him very wealthy and intertwined him economically with many of the other pioneers in the valley. Young had died without a will or heir, thus necessitating a need for a probate court, because otherwise people were <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> estate would have been disposed for the Hudson's Bay Company, the Catholic Jesuit Priests from Canada, or the Protestant Methodist Mission from the United States, as that had been happening in the past. Several meetings occurred over the subsequent months which included François Norbert Blanchet, William J. Bailey, Mr. Charlevon, David Donpierre, Gustavus Hines, William Johnson, Jason Lee, Étienne Lucier, Robert Moore, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, Sidney Smith, and David Leslie.|$|E
25|$|MGR always {{acted as}} a hero and made {{sure that he was}} always portrayed in a good light on screen. With the {{departure}} of Sivaji Ganesan from DMK, MGR's position within the party grew stronger. In contrast to Parasakthi, MGR's movies made less reference to social justice but dwelled more on contemporary political scenarios. The movies typically included references to Dravida and MGR would be clad in red and black (the DMK flag colours). In sharp contrast with earlier DMK movies where the overall theme was used for propaganda, in MGR's movies the protagonist was shown {{as a representative of the}} party ideology, who would fight against evil and support the poor. Thus he played roles that were directly relevant to the filmgoers and displayed himself as a symbol of the fulfilment of their own dreams. MGR, however, made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> social image, which he gained by independent charity and social works, did not get merged with that of DMK.|$|E

25|$|After {{the tragedy}} of his family, Khả decided to give up being a priest and got married. Khả had nine children—six sons and three daughters by his second wife, Phạm Thị Thân, after his first wife died childless. They were: Ngô Đình Khôi, Ngô Đình Thị Giao, Ngô Đình Thục, Ngô Đình Diệm, Ngô Đình Thị Hiệp, Ngô Đình Thị Hoàng, Ngô Đình Nhu, Ngô Đình Cẩn, Ngô Đình Luyện. As a devout Roman Catholic, Khả took his entire family to Mass every morning and {{encouraged}} his sons to study for priesthood. Mastering both Latin and classical Chinese, Khả made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> children were well educated in Christian scriptures and Confucian classics. During his childhood, Diệm laboured in the family's rice fields while studying at a French Catholic primary school (Pellerin School) in Huế, and later entered a private school started by his father, where he studied French, Latin, and classical Chinese. At the age of fifteen he followed his elder brother, Ngô Đình Thục, who would later become Vietnam's highest ranking Catholic bishop, into a monastery. Diệm even swore himself to celibacy to prove his devotion to his faith before {{he decided not to}} pursue clerical career due to finding monastic life too rigorous. According to Moyar, Diệm's personality was too independent to discipline himself in the church. He also inherited his father's antagonism toward the French colonialists who occupied his country.|$|E

500|$|Other leading {{literary}} {{figures who}} admired Wodehouse were A.E. Housman, Max Beerbohm and Hilaire Belloc; {{on the radio}} and in print Belloc called Wodehouse [...] "the best writer of our time: the best living writer of English... the head of my profession". Wodehouse regarded Belloc's plaudit as [...] "a gag, to get a rise out of serious-minded authors whom he disliked". Wodehouse was never <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> books had literary merit as well as popular appeal, and, Donaldson suggests, must have been overwhelmed when the University of Oxford conferred an honorary doctorate of letters on him in June 1939. His visit to England for the awarding ceremony was the last time he set foot in his native land.|$|E

[...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put {{a lot of things}} emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open to looking at her life and figuring out, does she want a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Collins, {{it was noted that}} the series [...] "tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war." [...] Collins replied that this inspiration was from her father, who, when going to war in Vietnam, made <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> children understood the consequences and effects of war. Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor noted that it was [...] "the most brutal of the trilogy" [...] and that [...] "Collins doesn't take war lightly– her characters debate the morality involved in tactics used to try to overthrow the rotting, immoral government, and they pay a high cost for those tactics." [...] Katie Roiphe of The New York Times wrote that [...] "it is the perfect teenage story with its exquisitely refined rage against the cruel and arbitrary power of the adult world." [...] In a review for USA Today, Bob Minzesheimer pointed out that the novel contained optimism: [...] "Hope emerges from despair. Even in a dystopian future, there's a better future." ...|$|E
