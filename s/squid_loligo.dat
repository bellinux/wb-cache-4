5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish offal. It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to mate and deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|The {{angelshark}} is {{an ambush}} predator that feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes, especially flatfishes, though it also preys on skates and invertebrates. Prey reported taken include the hake Merluccius merluccius, the bream Pagellus erythrinus, grunts in the genus Pomadasys, the flatfishes Bothus spp., Citharus linguatula, and Solea solea, the <b>squid</b> <b>Loligo</b> vulgaris, the cuttlefishes Sepia officinalis and Sepiola spp., and the crabs Medorippe lanata, Geryon trispinosus, Dromia personata, Goneplax rhomboides, Liocarcinus corrugatus, and Atelecyclus rotundatus. The stomachs of some examined specimens have also contained seagrass or birds (in one case an entire cormorant). Individual sharks select sites that {{offer the best}} ambush opportunities, and if successful, may remain there for several days.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal in habits, after dusk {{the leopard}} {{catshark}} hunts for small, benthic bony fishes and invertebrates in shallow water. In daytime, it generally rests inside caves and crevices, sometimes in groups. This species {{has been documented}} ambushing spawning chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> vulgaris reynaudi) within their spawning grounds. Reproduction is oviparous and proceeds year-round. Females produce rectangular, light-colored egg capsules two at a time, attaching them to structures on the sea floor. Small and harmless, the leopard catshark adapts well to captivity and is often exhibited in public aquariums. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers as bycatch, and often killed as a pest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; its numbers {{do not seem to}} be declining, but heavy human activity occurs within its native waters. The possibly fragmented nature of its distribution also merits caution for each local population.|$|E

5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is reportedly not highly active, spending much time {{buried in the}} sediment. It is a generalist predator whose diet generally reflects the most available prey in its environment. It mainly captures prey off the bottom, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. A variety of invertebrates, as well as bony fishes such as sand lance and scup, {{are known to be}} consumed. Off Massachusetts, the main prey are crabs (Cancer), bivalves (Mya), gastropods (Polinices), <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo)</b> and annelid worms. In Delaware Bay, most of its diet consists of the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata; the overall dietary composition there is nearly identical to that of bluntnose stingrays (D. say) that share the bay. The shrimp Upogebia affinis is a major food source off Virginia. Off Florida, crustaceans (Rananoides, Ovalipes, Sicyonia brevirostris, and Portunus) and polychaete worms are the most important prey.|$|E
5|$|The slow-swimming leopard {{catshark}} generally {{spends the}} day resting inside caves or crevices, either {{alone or in}} groups. At night, it moves towards the shore to actively forage for small bony fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. In False Bay, fishes {{are the most important}} prey type, followed by cephalopods and then the Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii). This shark has been observed attacking octopus and cuttlefish by seizing and tearing off tentacles with a twisting motion. Like its close relative the pyjama shark, it will temporarily abandon its nocturnal habits {{to take advantage of the}} daytime mass spawnings of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> vulgaris reynaudi), which occur unpredictably year-round with a peak from October to December. The sharks lie motionless amongst the squids' egg masses with their heads hidden, and make sudden lunges at female squid that have descended to the sea floor to attach their eggs.|$|E

5|$|The pyjama shark is {{primarily}} nocturnal, {{spending most of}} the day lying motionless and hidden in a cave or crevice or among vegetation. It often forms groups, particularly during summer. This species is an opportunistic predator that feeds {{on a wide variety of}} fishes and invertebrates; it favors cephalopods and frequents the spawning grounds of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> reynaudi). When threatened, it curls into a circle with its tail covering its head. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying rectangular, dark brown egg cases two at a time year-round. This small and harmless shark adapts well to captivity and is commonly displayed in public aquariums. It is often caught as a bycatch of commercial and recreational fisheries. Many are killed by fishers who regard them as pests. Although there are no data suggesting its numbers have declined, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pyjama shark as Near Threatened because of expanding small shark fishery activities within its limited range.|$|E
5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} forages {{for food}} both {{during the day}} and at night. It feeds primarily on benthic bony fishes and invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted via suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including salps and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> vulgaris reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn. The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these include the copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and the killer whale (Orcinus orca). When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its back like a scorpion. Smaller fishes have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting their own prey. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti, and the monogeneans Heterocotyle tokoloshei and Dendromonocotyle sp.|$|E
25|$|For {{cephalopods}} in general, the hues of {{the pigment}} granules are relatively constant within a species but can vary slightly between species.

25|$|A common predatory {{technique}} {{that has been}} observed among benthic elasmobranchs is ambushing behavior. As it pertains to rays, skates, carpet sharks, and angel sharks, the predator searches for suitable hiding environments such as sand, pebbles, coral, or algae that match its coloration or patterning, which {{is also known as}} aggressive mimicry. Ambushing is a behavior in which a predator relies on its coloring, body structure, or the environment as an advantage in concealing itself while waiting on unsuspecting prey to enter its striking range. There have been recorded occasions where this form of ambushing behavior of stingrays and related benthic sharks has been directed towards a common prey type. One example of this occasion involves the chokka <b>squid,</b> (<b>Loligo</b> vulgaris reynaudii), which spawns in the inshore coastal habitats around South Africa. The diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) frequently relies on aggressive mimicry as it blends into sandy habitats waiting for preoccupied female chokka squids who are busy spawning. Diamond rays then shoot off from the bottom substrates and use suction feeding to ingest the spawning squids and their eggs. Suction feeding works in conjunction and is aided by ram filter feeding, which is demonstrated by pelagic rays including the manta ray (Manta birostris) and the closely related devil rays (Mobula sp.). Many of the pelagic rays have external mouth structures called cephalic lobes that assist in siphoning in water and planktonic organisms as the rays swim in acrobatic patterns in these patches of food. A stingray's diet includes small fish, snails, clams, and shrimp, and some other small sea creatures.|$|E
500|$|Small, benthic {{bony fishes}} {{constitute}} over 90% of the marbled electric ray's diet by weight; these include gobies, hake, sea bass, mullets, jack mackerel, sea breams, goatfish, damselfish, wrasses, conger eels, and flatfish. Cephalopods such as European <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> vulgaris) and elegant cuttlefish (Sepia elegans) are a minor secondary food source. There {{is a single}} record of an individual that had swallowed a penaeid prawn, Penaeus kerathurus, and a study of captive rays found that they reject live Macropodia crabs. Off southern France, {{by far the most}} important prey species is the leaping mullet (Liza saliens). Food items are swallowed whole; there is a record of a ray [...] long that had consumed a three-bearded rockling (Gaidropsarus vulgaris) [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The {{copper shark}} feeds more towards {{the bottom of}} the water column than the top, {{consuming}} cephalopods, including <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> spp.), cuttlefishes, and octopus; bony fishes, including gurnards, flatfishes, hakes, catfishes, jacks, Australian salmon, mullets, sea breams, smelts, tunas, sardines, and anchovies; and cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish sharks (Squalus spp.), stingrays, skates, electric rays, and sawfishes. Cephalopods and cartilaginous fishes become relatively more important food for sharks over [...] long. Young sharks also consume scyphozoan jellyfish and crustaceans, including mud shrimps (Callianassa) and penaeid prawns. It does not attack marine mammals, though has been known rarely to scavenge on dolphins that had succumbed to fishing nets. The predominant prey of this species off South Africa is the southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax), which comprise 69–95% of its diet. Every winter, schools of copper sharks follow the [...] "run" [...] of the pilchard from the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal.

The total monitored production was 21866 kg and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) 35. 4 kg. trip- 1. Considering the number of effective fishing days and the average daily production per fishing gear, the annual production was estimated at 136687 kg (0. 2 % of the state's production in 2004). Predominant resources were: Micropogonias furnieri,Trichiurus lepturus, <b>squids</b> (<b>Loligo</b> spp.), clupeiform fishes (Sardinella brasiliensis, Cetengraulis edentulus, Pellona harrowerii and Harengula clupeola), Eucinostomus spp., Cynoscion spp., Menticirrhus spp., Caranx crysos and Selene setapinnis. The combined analysis using hierarchical and non-hierarchical classification methods, separated four fishing gears and five species groups, based on their similarity patterns, identifying gears that most effectively capture the different fish groups. The beach-seine was less selective and most productive fishery in the summer. The "corvineira" was the second most productive fishery with higher yields in the summer and fall.

50|$|Unlike many genera {{that can}} be {{described}} by commonalities inherited exclusively from their common ancestor, the classification of a species as being in the genus Loligo {{is not based on}} positive discrimination.

Other than this, the grounds for grouping a squid in this taxon is exclusively based on its lacking of characteristics that would put it in another taxon.

500|$|The sharptooth houndshark is {{a highly}} active species, though it can {{sometimes}} be found resting inside rocky crevices. It mainly hunts at night and {{has been known to}} pursue prey almost onto the shore. The pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey, while their broad bases allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. This shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans (crabs, slipper lobsters, and spiny lobsters), bony fishes (including morwongs, sea catfishes, drums, and porgies), and cephalopods (in particular Octopus vulgaris). Sharks and rays (including catsharks and guitarfishes) and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals. Off South Africa, the most important prey species is the crab Plagusia chabrus. Its dietary composition changes with age: young sharks under [...] long subsist almost completely on crabs, while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as a greater variety of prey overall. This shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> reynaudii) during their mass spawnings.

Although it has a predilection for cephalopods, the dietary composition of this opportunistic predator generally reflects the locally available prey types. For example, in False Bay the Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) is the most important food source, followed by cephalopods and then fish. Pyjama sharks have been observed seizing and tearing off tentacles from octopus and cuttlefish with a twisting motion; on one occasion three sharks were seen attacking an octopus simultaneously in this manner. During mass spawnings of the chokka <b>squid</b> (<b>Loligo</b> vulgaris reynaudi), which occur unpredictably year-round but peak from October to December, pyjama sharks deviate from their nocturnal habits and gather in substantial numbers inside the squids' [...] "egg beds" [...] during daytime. The sharks conceal their heads amongst the egg masses, while their stripes break up the outlines of their bodies. As the female squid descend to the sea floor to attach their eggs, guarded by the males, they become vulnerable to the sharks' ambush attacks.|$|E

In particular specific results on the reproductive output of L. vulgaris, showed a potential fecundity of about 4000 eggs (size 0. 30 - 3 mm) and 436 spermatophores (size 7. 25 - 17. 37 mm) according to the few studies so far carried out on the species. The reading of the age from the eye lens, tested {{here for the first time}} on cephalopods decapods, has allowed to estimate for both species a life cycle of about 18 - 20 months.

Macroscopic and single channel ionic currents were recorded using whole-cell voltage and patch clamp. In the whole-cell configuration, depolarisation from negative holding potentials evoked two voltage-dependent currents, an inward current and a delayed outward current. The outward current resembled an outwardly rectifying K+ current and was activated at − 40 mV after a latent period of 5 - 20 ms following a step depolarisation. The current was reduced by externally applied nifedipine, Co 2 + or quinine, was not blocked by addition of apamin or charibdotoxin and was insensitive to externally applied l-glutamate or acetylcholine. The voltage-gated inward current was activated at − 40 mV and was identified as an L-type calcium current sensitive to externally applied nifedipine. Schwann cells were impaled in situ in split-open axons and voltage clamped using discontinuous single electrode voltage clamp. Voltage dependent outward currents were recorded that were kinetically identical to those seen in isolated cells and that had similar current-voltage relations. Single channel currents were recorded from excised inside-out patches. A single channel type was observed with a reversal potential close to the equilibrium potential for K+ (EK) and was therefore identified as a K+ channel.

Gathered data were analyzed using the portofolio mean variance model (Markowitz model) to determine five commodity types with the largest rate of return and the optimal portofolio combination. Using the Winter’s Method time series analysis, forecasting of production, availability and price were conducted on the commodities determined by the previous analysis. The result of the time series analysis becomes the basic information for PIH Mina Ayu Indramayu to produce sales order for the agro-commodity auction in West Java. The five commodities with the highest rate of return were: Eastern little tuna (Euthynus spp), Indo-pacific king mackerell (Scomberomorus guttatus), Black promfet (Formio niger), Common <b>squids</b> (<b>Loligo</b> spp) and Indian mackerell (Restrelliger spp) with an optimal portofolio combination of 99. 4 % return and 25. 7 % risk.
