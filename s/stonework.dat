5|$|By 1958 the castle's {{condition}} {{had deteriorated}} and the Ministry of Works took legal {{custody of the}} site, although it continued to be owned by the Howard family. Conservation work {{took place during the}} 1960s, stabilising the <b>stonework</b> of the keep. Archaeological investigations were then carried out, focusing on the keep in 1970, the church and the earthwork defences during 1971 and 1972, and the inner bailey from 1973 to 1976. This research centred on archaeological excavations and the recording of remains; as with similar castles investigated during this period, the site was then preserved as a monument, and grass lawns laid down around the remaining <b>stonework</b> and foundations. Further excavations were carried out in 1987 during the construction of the ticket office beside the castle.|$|E

5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating {{the basement of the}} keep in 1822 and repairing some of the <b>stonework.</b> The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be dug out and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the excavation work on the castle site after Fulke's death, and restored the <b>stonework</b> of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|The {{dearth of}} {{artefacts}} recovered from Buckton Castle, {{and the lack}} of finely finished <b>stonework,</b> might indicate that the site was never finished, however the re-cutting of the ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy of abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The nave, {{which is}} aisleless, was {{formerly}} known as the Capel Hir (Long Chapel). The pews in the nave are by Seddon and are of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints. The <b>stonework</b> is almost all nineteenth century to the nave south wall, less so elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|A. Glen Rogers wrote a {{book titled}} Forgotten Stories of the Finger Lakes in which {{he added that the}} layout of the <b>stoneworks</b> were not {{suitable}} for a fort. He suggests that Jesuits might have built the <b>stoneworks,</b> but admits that this is inconsistent {{with the fact that the}} Jesuits tended to keep very detailed written records.|$|R
5000|$|By 1985, the {{remnants}} of the <b>Stoneworks</b> were obliterated by [...] "vineyards, drainage ditches, hay fields, farm work roads, and a pine plantation."(David D. Robinson, The Crooked Lake Review, #68, Nov. 1993, 17.) The remnants of the <b>stoneworks,</b> some of which may exist underground, are located about four miles (6 km) south of Keuka Park, just off Route 54-A.|$|R

5|$|Work {{carried out}} in the 20th and 21st centuries {{included}} full cleaning of the <b>stonework</b> and the reconstruction of the pipe organ by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn. The <b>stonework</b> of the west front had been subject to natural erosion therefore a process of lime-based conservation was carried out during the 1990s by Nimbus Conservation under the guidance of Professor Robert Baker who had previously worked on the west front of Wells Cathedral. Some of the damage to sculptures had been made worse by the use of Portland cement by previous work {{carried out in}} the Victorian era. A statue of St Phillip was beyond repair and was removed and replaced with a modern statue by Laurence Tindall.|$|E

The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. The timber ceiling of the Duchess' hall, and the timber floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The upper parts of the <b>stonework</b> are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to <b>stonework</b> are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E

In 1660, visitors' accounts imply that the <b>stonework</b> had all been dismantled, and 18th-century accounts suggest that this was reused for construction work in the town below, which had prospered from the wool and later linen trade.|$|E
5|$|In 1741 Adam {{was forced}} to {{initiate}} legal proceedings against William, Lord Braco, to retrieve unpaid fees arising from his work at Duff House. There was no formal contract, and client and architect disagreed on costs for carved <b>stonework.</b> Adam sued for £5,796 12s 11⅓d, and the matter was initially resolved in his favour. However, Braco was a stubborn opponent, and dragged out the proceedings, which were not resolved until just before Adam's death.|$|E
