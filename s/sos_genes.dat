5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E
50|$|During normal growth, the <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> are {{negatively}} {{regulated by}} LexA repressor protein dimers. Under normal conditions, LexA binds to a 20-bp consensus sequence (the SOS box) in the operator region for those genes. Some of these <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed at certain levels {{even in the}} repressed state, according to the affinity of LexA for their SOS box. Activation of the <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> occurs after DNA damage by the accumulation of single stranded (ssDNA) regions generated at replication forks, where DNA polymerase is blocked. RecA forms a filament around these ssDNA regions in an ATP-dependent fashion, and becomes activated. The activated form of RecA interacts with the LexA repressor to facilitate the LexA repressor's self-cleavage from the operator.|$|E

40|$|The so(mda) (sine oculis-medusa) mutant is {{the result}} of a P element {{insertion}} at position 43 C on the second chromosome. so(mda) causes aberrant development of the larval photoreceptor (Bolwig's) organ and the optic lobe primordium in the embryo. Later in development, adult photoreceptors fail to project axons into the optic ganglion. Consequently optic lobe development is aborted and photoreceptor cells show age-dependent retinal degeneration. The <b>so</b> <b>gene</b> was isolated and characterized. The gene encodes a homeodomain protein expressed in the optic lobe primordium and Bolwig's organ of embryos, in the developing adult visual system of larvae, and in photoreceptor cells and optic lobes of adults. In addition, the SO product is found at invagination sites during embryonic development: at the stomadeal invagination, the cephalic furrow, and at segmental boundaries. The mutant so(mda) allele causes severe reduction of SO embryonic expression but maintains adult visual system expression. Ubiquitous expression of the <b>SO</b> <b>gene</b> product in 4 - 8 -hr embryos rescues all so(mda) mutant abnormalities, including the adult phenotypes. Thus, all deficits in adult visual system development and function result from failure to properly express the <b>so</b> <b>gene</b> during embryonic development.

50|$|Once {{the pool}} of LexA decreases, {{repression}} of the <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> goes down according {{to the level of}} LexA affinity for the SOS boxes. Operators that bind LexA weakly are the first to be fully expressed. In this way LexA can sequentially activate different mechanisms of repair. Genes having a weak SOS box (such as lexA, recA, uvrA, uvrB, and uvrD) are fully induced in response to even weak SOS-inducing treatments. Thus the first SOS repair mechanism to be induced is nucleotide excision repair (NER), whose aim is to fix DNA damage without commitment to a full-fledged SOS response.|$|E

Taking advantage of the operon fusion placing the lac operon (responsible for producing beta-galactosidase, a protein which degrades lactose) under the control of an SOS-related protein, a simple colorimetric assay for genotoxicity is possible. If a genotoxin is present, the resulting DNA damage will result in the production of beta-galactosidase instead of DNA repair as a result of the gene fusion. A lactose analog is added to the media which is degraded by the beta-galactosidase, producing a colored compound which can be measured quantitatively through spectrophotometry. The degree of color development is a direct measure of the amount of beta-galactosidase produce, which itself is directly related to the extent of DNA damage.|$|E

50|$|The SOS {{response}} is {{the changes in}} gene expression in Escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences {{commonly referred to as}} SOS boxes. In Escherichia coli it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The SOS {{response is}} known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes.The most common cellular signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase to separate the two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA-ssDNA filaments.

40|$|The SOS regulon of Escherichia coli {{consists}} {{of more than}} two dozen genes which are induced by damage to the host chromosome. Most of the products of these genes are active in DNA repair and/or DNA replication processes. Expression of the <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> is negatively controlled by a repressor protein encoded by the lexA gene. The present work has used two very different experimental approaches to provide evidence that the SOS regulatory network is larger than previously recognized. The first method employed a novel genetic screening procedure to isolate new <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> as promoter fusions on high copy number plasmids. Three genes, dinG, dinH, and polB (dinA), were isolated and characterized. dinG, dinH, and polB were mapped to 17. 8, 19. 8, and 1. 2 minutes on the E. coli chromosome, respectively. The sequences of the dinH and polB regulatory regions contained typical binding sites for LexA protein and were shown to bind LexA protein specifically in vitro. The LexA-responsive sequence element within the dinG regulatory region was defined experimentally by isolating and characterizing operator-constitutive mutations. Determination of the sequence of a 2, 417 bp DNA fragment yielded the complete coding sequence of the dinG gene. Additional DNA sequencing revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence of DinH is extremely proline- and glutamine-rich and is homologous to a family of eucaryotic DNA damage-inducible proteins that are similarly rich in these amino acids. The second approach to the identification of new <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> employed a combination of mathematical and biochemical analysis methods. Mathematical modeling of the highly conserved 20 bp binding sites for LexA repressor permitted the design of a search method to identify new sites. Six new sites on the E. coli chromosome and four prospective bacteriophage elements were identified in a search of the GenBank database. In vitro binding studies indicated that DNA fragments containing at least six of the ten new sites bound LexA specifically. The locations of several of the putative new operators relative to known genes and large uncharacterized open reading frames strongly suggest roles for most of them in regulation of previously unrecognized <b>SOS</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|E
40|$|Genetically {{programmed}} cell deaths play {{important roles}} in unicellular prokaryotes. In postsegregational killing, loss of a gene complex from a cell leads to its descendants’ deaths. With type II restriction–modification gene complexes, such death is triggered by restriction endonuclease's attacks on under-methylated chromosomes. Here, we examined how the Escherichia coli transcriptome changes after loss of PaeR 7 I gene complex. At earlier time points, activation of <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> and σE-regulon was noticeable. With time, more <b>SOS</b> <b>genes,</b> stress-response genes (including σS-regulon, osmotic-, oxidative- and periplasmic-stress genes), biofilm-related genes, and many hitherto uncharacterized genes were induced, and genes for energy metabolism, motility and outer membrane biogenesis were repressed. As expected from the activation of σE-regulon, the death was accompanied by cell lysis and release of cellular proteins. Expression of several σE-regulon genes indeed led to cell lysis. We hypothesize that some signal was transduced, among multiple genes involved, from the damaged genome to the cell surface and led to its disintegration. These results are discussed in comparison with other forms of programmed deaths in bacteria and eukaryotes...|$|E
40|$|Quinolone {{antibacterial}} {{drugs such}} as nalidixic acid target DNA gyrase in Escherichia coli. These inhibitors bind to and stabilize a normally transient covalent protein-DNA intermediate in the gyrase reaction cycle, {{referred to as the}} cleavage complex. Stabilization of the cleavage complex is necessary but not sufficient for cell killing—cytotoxicity apparently results from the conversion of cleavage complexes into overt DNA breaks by an as-yet-unknown mechanism(s). Quinolone treatment induces the bacterial SOS response in a RecBC-dependent manner, arguing that cleavage complexes are somehow converted into double-stranded breaks. However, the only proteins known to be required for SOS induction by nalidixic acid are RecA and RecBC. In hopes of identifying additional proteins involved in the cytotoxic response to nalidixic acid, we screened for E. coli mutants specifically deficient in SOS induction upon nalidixic acid treatment by using a dinD::lacZ reporter construct. From a collection of SOS partially constitutive mutants with disruptions of 47 different genes, we found that dnaQ insertion mutants are specifically deficient in the SOS response to nalidixic acid. dnaQ encodes DNA polymerase III ɛ subunit, the proofreading subunit of the replicative polymerase. The deficient response to nalidixic acid was rescued by the presence of the wild-type dnaQ gene, confirming involvement of the ɛ subunit. To further characterize the SOS deficiency of dnaQ mutants, we analyzed the expression of several additional <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> in response to nalidixic acid using real-time PCR. A subset of <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> lost their response to nalidixic acid in the dnaQ mutant strain, while two tested <b>SOS</b> <b>genes</b> (recA and recN) continued to exhibit induction.

40|$|The SOS {{response}} in bacteria includes a global transcriptional response to DNA damage. DNA damage is sensed by the highly conserved recombination protein RecA, which facilitates inactivation of the transcriptional repressor LexA. Inactivation of LexA causes induction (derepression) of genes of the LexA regulon, {{many of which}} are involved in DNA repair and survival after DNA damage. To identify potential RecA-LexA-regulated genes in Bacillus subtilis, we searched the genome for putative LexA binding sites within 300 bp upstream of the start codons of all annotated open reading frames. We found 62 genes that could be regulated by putative LexA binding sites. Using mobility shift assays, we found that LexA binds specifically to DNA in the regulatory regions of 54 of these genes, which are organized in 34 putative operons. Using DNA microarray analyses, we found that 33 of the genes with LexA binding sites exhibit RecA-dependent induction by both mitomycin C and UV radiation. Among these 33 <b>SOS</b> <b>genes,</b> there are 22 distinct LexA binding sites preceding 18 putative operons.

Current approaches aim at determining the network structure based on genomic-scale data. However, the network connectivity alone {{is not sufficient to}} define its dynamics; one needs to also specify the kinetic parameters for the regulation reactions. Here, we ask whether effective kinetic parameters can be assigned to a transcriptional network based on expression data. We present a combined experimental and theoretical approach based on accurate high temporal-resolution measurement of promoter activities from living cells by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmids. We present algorithms that use these data to assign effective kinetic parameters within a mathematical model of the network. To demonstrate this, we employ a well defined network, the SOS DNA repair system of Escherichia coli.
