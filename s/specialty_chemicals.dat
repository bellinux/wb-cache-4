40|$|This project {{builds on}} the {{existing}} literature of service quality measurement in a business-to-business (B 2 B) market. A three-part, 30 question customer survey was developed to measure service satisfaction of pulp and paper manufacturers in reference to their preferred <b>specialty</b> <b>chemical</b> supplier. The fundamental question to be answered was: for lower chemical product pricing, would the pulp and paper manufacturers consider a 'pay-for-service' or a 'low-service' business model? This is a non-traditional approach to the B 2 B interaction since <b>specialty</b> <b>chemical</b> suppliers currently offer their services for free with {{the purchase of the}} chemical, albeit at higher prices. A detailed literature review was performed to help structure the survey questions with standard statistical tools used to analyze the data. In general, the services provided by the <b>specialty</b> <b>chemical</b> suppliers were rated highly but most rejected the newly proposed model. The data did, however, highlight areas for improved customer satisfaction and strategic growth. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R

25|$|On July 10, 2008, Dow {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} {{all of the}} common equity interest of Rohm and Haas Co. for $15.4 billion, which equated to $78 per share. The buyout was to be financed with equity investments of $3 billion by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and $1 billion by the Kuwait Investment Authority. The purpose of the deal was to move Dow Chemical further into <b>specialty</b> <b>chemicals,</b> which offer higher profit margins than the commodities market and {{are more difficult to}} enter for the competition. The purchase has been criticized by many on Wall Street who believe Dow Chemical overpaid (about a 75 percent premium on the previous day's market capital) to acquire the company; however, the high bid was needed to ward off competing bids from BASF. The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas closed on April 1, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Phthalocyanine dye CD-Rs {{are usually}} silver, gold or light green. The patents on {{phthalocyanine}} CD-Rs {{are held by}} Mitsui and Ciba <b>Specialty</b> <b>Chemicals.</b> Phthalocyanine is a natively stable dye (has no need for stabilizers) and CD-Rs based on this are often given a rated lifetime of hundreds of years. Unlike cyanine, phthalocyanine is less resistant to UV rays and CD-Rs based on this dye show signs of degradation only {{after two weeks of}} direct sunlight exposure. However, phthalocyanine is more sensitive than cyanine to writing laser power calibration, meaning that the power level used by the writing laser has to be more accurately adjusted for the disc {{in order to get a}} good recording; this may erode the benefits of dye stability, as marginally written discs (with higher correctable error rates) will lose data (i.e. have uncorrectable errors) after less dye degradation than well written discs (with lower correctable error rates).|$|E
