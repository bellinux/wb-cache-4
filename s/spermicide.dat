5|$|Barrier {{contraceptives}} are {{devices that}} attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus. They include male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges with <b>spermicide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Male {{condoms and}} the {{diaphragm}} with <b>spermicide</b> have typical use first-year failure rates of 18% and 12%, respectively. With perfect use condoms {{are more effective}} with a 2% first-year failure rate versus a 6% first-year rate with the diaphragm. Condoms have the additional benefit of helping {{to prevent the spread}} of some sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use <b>spermicide</b> or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} active {{ingredient}} of <b>spermicides</b> is nonoxynol-9. <b>Spermicides</b> containing nonoxynol-9 {{are available in}} many forms, such as jelly (gel), films, and foams. Used alone, <b>spermicides</b> have a perfect use failure rate of 18% per year when used correctly and consistently, and 28% failure rate per year in typical use.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spermicides</b> used {{alone are}} only about 70 to 80 percent effective. [...] When <b>spermicides</b> are used in {{conjunction}} with condoms and other barrier methods there is a 97 percent effective rate for pregnancy prevention.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spermicides</b> are unscented, clear, unflavored, non-staining, and lubricative.|$|R
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the <b>spermicide</b> nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a <b>spermicide.</b> Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>spermicide,</b> it {{attacks the}} acrosomal {{membranes}} of the sperm, causing the sperm to be immobilized.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the knowledge, {{acceptability}} and attitude towards the use of <b>spermicides</b> among students of University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). Methodology: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted over four-month period among UDSM students. A random sample of students was recruited from all three university campus namely University College of Land and Architectural Studies (UCLAS), Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences (MUCHS) and Mlimani Campus (MC). Questionnaires with both closed and open end-questions were used for data collection in which knowledge, attitude, and acceptability of <b>spermicides</b> were determined. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS/PC+ version 10. 0, 1999 computer package. Results: A total of 300 students participated in this study, out of which 154 (51. 3 %) were females and 146 (48. 7 %) males. Majority of the students 276 (92 %) had poor knowledge of spermicidal products, and out of these, 146 (53 %) were absolutely unable to describe the use of <b>spermicides.</b> Ninety-three percent of the students had never used <b>spermicides.</b> Of those who had never used <b>spermicides,</b> 84 (30 %) said because they used other contraceptive means, 50 (17. 8 %) said they are expensive, 29 (10. 3 %) attributed this to unavailability of the products, 3 (1. 1 %) to fear of “contracting ” cancer and 13 (4. 6 %) to the unreliability. Furthermore, a few who had used them didn’t trust the products as ideal means of contraception. Conclusion: The respondents had poor knowledge of <b>spermicides.</b> <b>Spermicides</b> were not accepted by the students because of the presume...|$|R

5000|$|Lactic acid {{preparations}} {{have also}} been shown to have some spermicidal effect, and commercial lactic acid-based <b>spermicides</b> are available. [...] However, no published studies on the effectiveness of lactic acid in preventing pregnancy appear to have been done since 1936. Thomas Moench, a former assistant professor of medicine, has said that research into acids as <b>spermicides</b> has [...] "pretty much been abandoned." ...|$|R

25|$|Gramicidin S {{differs from}} other {{gramicidin}} types {{in that it}} is a cationic cyclic decapeptide and has a structure of an anti-parallel beta-sheet. Gramicidin S molecule is amphiphilic, with hydrophobic amino acids (D-Phe, Val, Leu side chains) and charged aminoacid (L-Orn). It exhibits strong antibiotic activity towards Gram-negative and Gram-positive and even several pathogenic fungi. The mode of action is not entirely agreed upon, but it is generally accepted that it is disruption of the lipid membrane and enhancement of the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Unfortunately, being hemolytic at even low concentrations, gramicidin S is only used as topical applications at present. Additionally, Gramicidin S has been employed as a <b>spermicide</b> and therapeutic for genital ulcers caused by sexually transmitted disease.|$|E
50|$|Urethritis can {{be caused}} by {{mechanical}} injury (from a urinary catheter or a cystoscope), or by an irritating chemical (antiseptics or some <b>spermicides).</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{understand}} whether barrier {{methods of}} contraception (BMC) and/or <b>spermicides</b> {{lower the risk}} of acquiring sexually transmitted disease (STD) and to quantify the protection. DESIGN [...] Review of published experimental studies, in vitro and in vivo evidence on the issue. SUBJECTS [...] We reviewed 22 papers that examined the impermeability of BMC in vitro against STD agents or the effect of <b>spermicides,</b> and 60 papers reporting results of epidemiological studies on the risk of STD in users of BMC. RESULTS [...] There was in vitro evidence that both BMC and <b>spermicides</b> were effective against most sexually transmissible agents. Doubts remain on the effectiveness of BMC and <b>spermicides</b> in normal conditions of use, particularly against human papilloma virus. Natural membrane condoms are not impermeable and pores are seen by electron microscopy. Epidemiological studies show a consistent reduction in the risk for use of condoms against gonococcal (most studies giving relative risk, RR, estimates around 0. 4 to 0. 6) and HIV infection (RRs between 0. 3 and 0. 6 in most studies). <b>Spermicides</b> protect women against gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis; their role against other STDs is less clear and there is some indication of an irritative effect on the vaginal mucosa that is likely to be dose-dependent. CONCLUSIONS [...] A large amount of evidence indicates that BMC reduce the risk of gonorrhoea and HIV transmission, but the results are [...] at least in quantitative terms [...] less consistent for other diseases. Implications for individual choices and public health approaches should relate to frequency of exposure and severity of the disease too...|$|R

500|$|In young {{sexually active}} women, sexual {{activity}} {{is the cause}} of 75–90% of bladder infections, with the risk of infection related to the frequency of sex. The term [...] "honeymoon cystitis" [...] has been applied to this phenomenon of frequent UTIs during early marriage. In post-menopausal women, sexual activity does not affect the risk of developing a UTI. <b>Spermicide</b> use, independent of sexual frequency, increases the risk of UTIs. Diaphragm use is also associated. Condom use without <b>spermicide</b> or use of birth control pills does not increase the risk of uncomplicated urinary tract infection.|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial vaginosis may {{sometimes}} affect women after menopause. [...] Also, subclinical iron deficiency may correlate with bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy. A longitudinal {{study published in}} February 2006, in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, showed a link between psychosocial stress and bacterial vaginosis persisted even when other risk factors were taken into account. Exposure to the <b>spermicide</b> nonoxynol-9 {{does not affect the}} risk of developing bacterial vaginosis.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, the {{diaphragm}} {{has been used}} with <b>spermicide,</b> and {{it is widely believed}} the <b>spermicide</b> significantly increases the effectiveness of {{the diaphragm}}. Insufficient studies have been conducted to determine effectiveness without <b>spermicide.</b>|$|E

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} {{clinical}} need to research novel methods of fertility control {{that are also}} protective against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Chlamydia. The most obvious way to generate such a dual-purpose contraceptive method would be to develop safe, effective <b>spermicides</b> that were also active against {{a wide range of}} pathogenic organisms. The currently available formulations such as nonoxynol- 9, gramicidin and benzalkonium chloride are effective <b>spermicides</b> but are toxic to the vaginal epithelium and do not provide protection against STDs. Over 60 agents are in clinical trials as potentially safer topical <b>spermicides</b> and/or microbicides. Compounds that have reached this stage of development include acid buffers, detergents, dendrimers, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and anionic polymers. In addition, a number of potential spermicides/microbicides are the subject of preclinical investigation, including b-cyclodextrin, cyanovirin, porphyrins, cyclotriazadisulfonamides, dermaseptins, short-interfering RNA (siRNA) and HIV antibodies. The chemical principles underlying these disparate approaches and potential avenues for future investigation are discussed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Spermicide</b> is a {{contraceptive}} {{substance that}} destroys sperm, inserted vaginally prior to intercourse to prevent pregnancy. As a contraceptive, <b>spermicide</b> {{may be used}} alone. However, the pregnancy rate experienced by couples using only <b>spermicide</b> is {{higher than that of}} couples using other methods. Usually, spermicides are combined with contraceptive barrier methods such as diaphragms, condoms, cervical caps, and sponges. Combined methods are believed to result in lower pregnancy rates than either method alone.|$|E
50|$|Some may {{experience}} irritation {{from the use}} of certain lubricants. Some lubricants (as mentioned above under 'Water-based') have been found to damage cells or even increase the replication of the HIV virus. Nonoxynol-9, a <b>spermicide</b> contained in some lubricants, can destroy vaginal and rectum cell membranes which may increase the rate of STI transmission and HPV infection. Spermicidally lubricated condoms do not contain enough <b>spermicide</b> to increase contraceptive effectiveness, but application of separate <b>spermicide</b> is thought to reduce pregnancy rates significantly.|$|E
25|$|Irritant {{vaginitis}} can {{be caused}} by allergies to condoms, <b>spermicides,</b> soaps, perfumes, douches, lubricants, and semen. It can also be caused by hot tubs, abrasion, tissue, tampons, or topical medications.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a {{prevalent}} vaginal {{infection that}} is now regarded as a risk factor in more serious pelvic and obstetric complications. <b>Spermicides</b> {{are known to have}} antimicrobial activity against other sexually transmitted diseases and the aim {{of this study was to}} test whether the causative organisms of BV were also susceptible to <b>spermicides,</b> in vitro. DESIGN [...] Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations of five spermicidal compounds were determined for the organisms associated with BV, in an agar dilution technique. LOCATION [...] The Department of Experimental and Clinical Microbiology, University of Sheffield Medical School, UK. SPERMICIDES AND ORGANISMS [...] Nonoxynol- 9, Nonoxynol- 11, Docusate sodium, Benzalkonium chloride and Menfegol were tested against 20 strains each of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and Mobiluncus organisms, isolated from patients with BV who attended the Department of Genitourinary Medicine, the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The susceptibility of BV-associated organisms to spermicidal compounds, in vitro. RESULTS [...] G vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp, Bacteroides bivius and Bacteroides disiens were all susceptible to the five <b>spermicides</b> tested, with MICs ranging between less than or equal to 19 and 5000 mg/l (0. 0019 %- 0. 5 %). CONCLUSION [...] The concentrations of <b>spermicides</b> incorporated in contraceptive preparations are usually between 3 % and 8 %, which are far in excess of the MICs found for BV organisms. Their usage could exert a significant antimicrobial effect and be a useful prophylactic in preventing the infection...|$|R

5000|$|Laboratory {{testing of}} {{substances}} {{to see if}} they inhibited sperm motility began in the 1800s. Modern <b>spermicides</b> nonoxynol-9 and menfegol were developed from this line of research. However, many other substances of dubious contraceptive value were also promoted. Especially after the prohibition of contraception in the U.S. by the 1873 Comstock Act, spermicides—the most popular of which was Lysol—were marketed only as [...] "feminine hygiene" [...] products and were not held to any standard of effectiveness. Worse, many manufacturers recommended using the products as a douche after intercourse, too late to affect all the sperm. Medical estimates during the 1930s placed the pregnancy rate of women using many over-the-counter <b>spermicides</b> at seventy percent per year.|$|R
40|$|Although sexually {{transmitted}} diseases, including {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), are a major concern for women, few prevention messages are targeted specifically to women. Those that are generally stress abstaining, altering the number or selection of partners, and urging partners to use condoms. But these behaviors may be unrealistic for many women, particularly women who are at highest risk for {{sexually transmitted}} diseases, because they require significant changes in life-style or depend on male-controlled condom use. Recommendation of contraceptives for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases depends largely on how well specific methods perform under controlled conditions, either in the laboratory or in clinical trials. Observational studies, which better reflect day-to-day use, indicate that condoms, barriers, and <b>spermicides,</b> used properly and consistently, can provide substantial protection against various sexually transmitted diseases. Condoms can similarly help protect against HIV, but studies of barriers and <b>spermicides</b> are scant and currently inconclusive. Finally, those methods that are controlled by women are consistently more effective in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, although condoms used well are still the best choice, the imperative for female-controlled methods indicates that diaphragms and <b>spermicides</b> should receive greater emphasis in prevention messages...|$|R
50|$|Barrier {{methods have}} {{a risk of}} {{allergic}} reaction. Users sensitive to latex may use barriers made of less allergenic materials - polyurethane condoms, or silicone diaphragms, for example. Barrier methods are also often combined with <b>spermicides,</b> which have possible side effects of genital irritation, vaginal infection, and urinary tract infection.|$|R
