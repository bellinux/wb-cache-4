50|$|Synthetic schlieren is {{a process}} that is used to {{visualize}} the flow of a fluid of variable refractive index. Named after the <b>schlieren</b> <b>method</b> of visualization, it consists of a digital camera or video camera pointing at the flow in question, with an illuminated target pattern behind. The method was first proposed in 1999.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{synthetic}} schlieren {{can be used}} to observe any flow which has variations in refractive index. Commonly these are caused by variations in concentration of a solute in an aqueous solution, or variations in the density of a compressible flow, caused by temperature or pressure variations. As with the optical <b>schlieren</b> <b>method,</b> the clearest results are obtained from flows which are largely two-dimensional.|$|E
50|$|Mach waves {{can be used}} in schlieren or {{shadowgraph}} {{observations to}} determine the local Mach number of the flow. Early observations by Ernst Mach used grooves in the wall of a duct to produce Mach waves in a duct, which were then photographed by the <b>schlieren</b> <b>method,</b> to obtain data about the flow in nozzles and ducts. Mach angles may also occasionally be visualized out of their condensation in air, for example vapor cones around aircraft during transonic flight.|$|E

The combination of this method with high resolution <b>Schlieren</b> <b>methods</b> or interferometry, permits the growth mechanism of crystals to be investigated directly. Since the {{observation of}} growth steps on crystals is the most direct and sensitive way for investigating a crystal growth mechanism, it would contribute to revealing fundamental differences between the growth in space and on Earth.

To improve the ejector effect and vacuum performance, it is important to clarify the flow behavior within the ejector. In this study a simple rectangular model of ejector is used to obtain the flow pattern in the ejector.

50|$|Variations on {{the optical}} <b>schlieren</b> <b>method</b> include the {{replacement}} of the knife-edge by a coloured target, resulting in rainbow schlieren which can assist in visualising the flow. Different edge configurations such as concentric rings can also give sensitivity to variable gradient directions, and programmable digital edge generation has been demonstrated as well using digital displays and modulators. The adaptive optics pyramid wavefront sensor is a modified form of schlieren (having two perpendicular knife edges formed by the vertices of a refracting square pyramid).|$|E
40|$|The {{far-field}} {{distribution of}} lasers {{is an important}} parameter for measuring beam quality. To overcome the insufficiencies of the CCD Camera dynamic range when measuring the far-field focal spot, the <b>schlieren</b> <b>method</b> {{was used to measure}} the focal spot far-field spatial distribution. Focal spot reconstruction was achieved after gray image matching, calculating the center, and image merging of the main lobe and side lobe. In this study, we used an algorithm based on the optimal arc to obtain the center for the side lobe images by fitting the circle center to improve the accuracy of the focal spot reconstruction.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} a new {{approach}} to the investigation of unsteady transonic flow fields around aerodynamic models and in blade cascades using a <b>schlieren</b> <b>method</b> of flow visualisation. The principle and the application of the Colour Streak <b>Schlieren</b> <b>Method</b> (CSSM) are defined. The characteristic flow field features were observed and analysed around an oscillating NACA 0012 airfoil under the conditions of transonic free stream Mach number (M ∞ = 0. 9), initial angle of attack (α = + 4 deg), one amplitude of oscillation (Δα=± 3 deg), and three frequencies of model oscillation (f = 1, 15, 30 Hz).

40|$|Two {{non-invasive}} optical <b>Schlieren</b> <b>methods</b> {{have been}} adapted to visualize brine channel development and convective processes in experimentally grown sea ice obtained when a NaCl aqueous solution is cooled from above in a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw cell. The two different visualization methods, i. e. traditional and synthetic Schlieren optical imaging, produce high spatial resolution images of transport processes during ice growth, without any external perturbation. These images allow {{observations of the}} flow dynamics simultaneously within the ice layer, around the ice/water interface, and in the liquid water layer, revealing connections between the processes occurring within the two phases. Results from these methods show that desalination of the growing ice layer occurs by two concurrent, yet independent, mechanisms: (1) boundary layer convection persisting throughout the ice growth period, with short fingers present just below the ice/water interface, and (2) gravity-driven drainage from the brine channels producing deep penetrating convective streamers, which appear after a given time {{from the beginning of}} ice growth. The improved visualization and qualitative characterization of these processes show that <b>Schlieren</b> optical <b>methods</b> have exciting potential applications for future study of convective processes during sea-ice growth.

40|$|Non-intrusive {{quantitative}} fluid density measurements {{methods are}} essential in stratified flow experiments. Digital imaging leads to synthetic <b>Schlieren</b> <b>methods</b> {{in which the}} variations of the index of refraction are reconstructed computationally. In this study, an important extension {{to one of these}} methods, called Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS), is proposed. The extension enables an accurate reconstruction of the density field in stratified liquid experiments. Typically, the experiments are performed by the light source, background pattern, and the camera positioned on the opposite sides of a transparent vessel. The multi-media imaging through air-glass-water-glass-air leads to an additional aberration that destroys the reconstruction. A two-step calibration and image remapping transform are the key components that correct the images through the stratified media and provide non-intrusive full-field density measurements of transparent liquids...|$|R
