50|$|Although {{drinking}} water standards frequently {{are referred to}} as if they are simple lists of parametric values, standards documents also specify the <b>sampling</b> <b>location,</b> sampling methods, sampling frequency, analytical methods, and laboratory accreditation AQC. In addition, a number of standards documents also require calculation to determine whether a level exceeds the standard, such as taking an average. Some standards give complex, detailed requirements for the statistical treatment of results, temporal and seasonal variations, summation of related parameters, and mathematical treatment of apparently aberrant results.|$|E

50|$|The {{core of the}} {{standard}} provides the observation schema. An observation is an act that results in the estimation {{of the value of}} a feature property, and involves application of a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain. The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, or ex-situ with respect to the <b>sampling</b> <b>location.</b> Use of a common model for observation metadata allows data to be combined unambiguously, across discipline boundaries. Observation details are also important for data discovery and for data quality estimation. An observation is defined in terms of the set of properties that support these applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{scheme was}} {{established}} in 1974 by the Department of the Environment {{with much of the}} initial planning and implementation undertaken by the Water Research Centre. It involved the creation of a network of sites across the UK. Most sites were at the downstream freshwater limits of the larger rivers although some of the largest rivers also included additional locations below major tributary confluences. Before inclusion of any location in the survey, homogeneity testing was carried out to characterise quality variations laterally and vertically within the river section chosen. For each designated point a specific <b>sampling</b> <b>location</b> was identified {{based on the results of}} the homogeneity exercise. In addition laboratories who were to undertake the analysis of samples were identified and a comprehensive AQC exercise was conducted to ensure comparability of data derived from the monitoring programme.|$|E
50|$|In {{systematic}} and grid sampling, samples are taken at regularly spaced intervals over space or time. An initial location or time is chosen at random, {{and then the}} remaining sampling locations are defined so that all locations are at regular intervals over an area (grid) or time (systematic). Examples Systematic Grid Sampling - Square Grid Systematic Grid Sampling - Triangular Grids of systematic grids include square, rectangular, triangular, or radial grids.Cressie, 1993. In random systematic sampling, an initial <b>sampling</b> <b>location</b> (or time) is chosen at random and the remaining sampling sites are specified {{so that they are}} located according to a regular pattern. Random systematic sampling is used to search for hot spots and to infer means, percentiles, or other parameters and is also useful for estimating spatial patterns or trends over time. This design provides a practical and easy method for designating sample locations and ensures uniform coverage of a site, unit, or process.|$|E

30|$|The <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> {{group in}} C 1 are {{influenced}} by lithogenic factor, whereas C 2 by mixed factor, respectively, for both seasons. However, C 3 <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> are controlled by lithogenic factor for pre monsoon, whereas during post monsoon by anthropogenic factor. Few <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> (10, 17) of C 3 during pre monsoon are grouped under C 1 of post monsoon. The remaining <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> grouped in C 3 (8, 9, 13, 15, 11, 14, 18) for both seasons {{are influenced by}} different sources. It indicates that same <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> are influenced by temporal variation of pollution sources, changing human activities related to seasonality like agriculture and excessive surface runoff often loaded with industrial and domestic effluents during monsoon and post monsoon period. The area also lacks proper drainage system where effluents are directly discharged into local tributaries and enters Sirsa river. CA supported by PCA confirms that the surface water chemistry is strongly controlled by natural factors such as weathering of minerals, ion exchange processes and anthropogenic factors. Hence, a good relation between the two statistical techniques (PCA and CA) is elucidated from the analyzed datasets of water samples.|$|R

Juncus effusus, Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Typha latifolia, Phalaris arundinacea, and Iris pseudacorus grown from clones, {{in response to}} Cu exposure was investigated. Root biomass production varied widely for all these macrophytes in control conditions (0. 08 μM) according to the sampling site. Root biomass production of T. latifolia and I. pseudacorus in the 2. 5 - 25 μM Cu range depended on the <b>sampling</b> <b>location</b> {{but not on the}} Cu dose in the growth medium. For P. australis, J. effusus, S. lacustris, and P. arundinacea, an intra-specific {{variability of}} RP depending on both the <b>sampling</b> <b>location</b> and the Cu-dose was evidenced.

30|$|In general, a ROP is {{difficult}} to analyze, particularly when there are correlations between <b>sampling,</b> <b>location,</b> and orientation of the objects. For the sake of tractability, a Boolean scheme is commonly applied in literature [29, 43, 44, 55, 66, 67]. It satisfies the following properties: (i) the center points form a Poisson point process (PPP); (ii) the attributes of the objects such as orientation, shape, and size are mutually independent; and (iii) for each object, <b>sampling,</b> <b>location,</b> and orientation are also independent. These assumptions of independence enable the tractability of the analysis. On the other hand, they omit correlations among blockages, as observed in practical scenarios.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} internal phosphorus release in a thermally stratified {{fresh water body}} in upstate New York. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved phosphorus were measured at regular intervals {{to the bottom of}} a shallow site and a deep site on the Watervliet Reservoir in mid-August 2004. Both temperature and dissolved-oxygen readings at the deeper <b>sampling</b> <b>location</b> closely matched the general pattern of a thermally stratified lake. Beneath the surface of the reservoir’s epilimnion, which extended from 0. 0 m to 5. 0 m, dissolved oxygen was consistently between 4 and 6 mg O 2 /L. However, beginning at the metalimnion—which lay between 5. 0 m and 6. 0 m—and continuing throughout the hypolimnion—which ranged from 6. 0 m to the bottom—dissolved-oxygen concentrations fell close to zero. The water at the shallower <b>sampling</b> <b>location,</b> which was not significantly stratified, did not exhibit a similar plunge in dissolved oxygen. Even though metalimnetic and hypolimnetic dissolved-oxygen concentrations at the deeper <b>sampling</b> <b>location</b> were well below the 1 -mg O 2 /L threshold at which sediment-bound phosphorus typically begins to dissolve in earnest, no significant phosphorus mobilization was detected...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{chemical}} composition of wood {{depends on a}} number of different factors, such as wood species, anatomical parts of wood, geographic location, habitation, growth, climatic characteristics, and degree of fungal and insect attacks. Recent studies report that the content of certain wood chemical components differed significantly in dependence on different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations.</b> As an extension of the mentioned studies, this study was aimed at investigating the influence of <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> which differ among themselves according to specific ecological factors (soil type, altitude and phytocoenoses) on the {{chemical composition}} of a wood native lignin (NL) model by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Materials and Methods: The beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) sapwood NL samples from seven <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> were used that differ among themselves according to specific ecological factors. NL was isolated according to a modified Brauns method described in previous research, and the FT-IR transmission spectroscopic technique was used for its characterization. The content of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl units (S), as well as syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was estimated for different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations.</b> The observed FT-IR peaks were assigned and quantified as percentages of the peak spectral heights, and the differences between NL were discussed in terms of lignin composition. Results: The results of statistical analysis of the NL contents showed significant differences between some <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> regarding phytocoenoses, soil type and altitude, as well as within some locations with the same sign of the mentioned ecological factors. The obtained FT-IR spectral results revealed that the observed NL composition differs in S/G ratios linked to different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations,</b> as evidenced by relative heights of FT-IR peaks at 1282 – 1283 cm- 1 (represent G units) and 1327 – 1331 cm- 1 (represent S units). The estimated relationship between the content of guaiacyl and syringyl units of the NL model structure was assigned from 63. 06 - 36. 94 % and 71. 62 – 28. 38 %. For different <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> the S/G ratios were from 0. 40 – 0. 59. Conclusions: Statistical analysis and comparison between the results of NL content for all <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> showed significant differences between some <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> with regard to phytocoenoses, soil type and altitude, as well as within some locations with the same sign of the mentioned ecological factors. Furthermore, the results of this study, such as the obtained FT-IR spectras of NL, different S/G ratios and the content of guaiacyl and siringyl units, showed the significant influence of <b>sampling</b> <b>locations</b> on the chemical composition of the wood native lignin model in terms of the content of the observed phenylpropane units...|$|R
