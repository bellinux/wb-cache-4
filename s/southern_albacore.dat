40|$|Taiwanese distant water {{longline}} fishery {{has operated}} throughout the WCPO since the 1960 s {{with the following}} target species: northern albacore in Regions 1 and 2 of the WCPO, bigeye and yellowfin in Regions 3 and 4, and <b>southern</b> <b>albacore</b> in Regions 5 and 6. Among the regions, fishing operations in Region 6 have the most complete time series of data, with more consistent fishing activity and species targeting than indices available from other distant water fishing nations. It is therefore considered important to obtain standardized CPUE series for this fleet and region, which may then {{be used in the}} stock assessments of WCPO yellowfin and bigeye tunas. This report provides standardized CPUE series for the two species in the region using a delta-lognormal approach. Factors affecting catch rates are investigated using regression tree methods. ...|$|E
40|$|Rent {{generated}} by the tuna fisheries occurring {{in the waters of}} Pacific Islands Nations is estimated for various levels and combinations of purse-seine, pole-and-line, frozen tuna longline, and fresh tuna longline fishing effort, using a multi-species, multi-fleet bioeconomic model. The underlying population model integrates available information on the population dynamics of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye, and <b>Southern</b> <b>albacore</b> tunas in the Pacific Ocean. The economic model utilizes the most recent data on fishing effort costs for the purse seine, pole-and-line, and longline fleets operating in the western and central Pacific Ocean, along with recent estimates of prices by species, method of capture and market, and estimates of demand elasticities. The results of the model indicate that fishery rent could be increased substantially above the current level by decreasing the size of all fleets, {{with the possible exception of}} the tuna longline fleet. The results also suggest that the countries of the region could benefit significantly by changing the level and structure of access fees levied as a percentage of total catch revenue.

The GLM {{procedure was}} used to fit a multiplicative multiple linear model assuming log-normal error structure.

40|$|Tuna {{are large}} pelagic fish whose populations {{are close to}} panmixia. In addition, they are {{threatened}} species, so {{it is important for}} the maintenance and monitoring of genetic diversity that genetic information at a genome level be obtained. Here we report the draft assembly of the southern bluefin tuna genome and the collection of genome-wide sequence data for five other tuna species. We sampled five tuna species of the genus Thunnus, the northern and <b>southern</b> bluefin, yellowfin, <b>albacore,</b> and bigeye, as well as the skipjack (Katsuwonis pelamis), a tuna-like species. Genome assembly was facilitated at k-mer= 25 while k-mer= 51 generated assembly artefacts. The estimated size of the southern bluefin tuna genome was 795 Mb. We assembled two southern bluefin tuna individuals independently using both paired end and mate pair sequence. This resulted in scaffolds with N 50 > 174, 000 bp and maximum scaffold lengths> 1. 4 Mb. Our estimate of the size of the assembled genome was the scaffolded sequences in common to both assemblies, which amounted to 721 Mb of the 795 Mb of the southern bluefin tuna genome sequence. Using BLAST, there were matches between 13, 039 of 14, 341 (91 %) refseq mRNA of the zebrafish Danio rerio to the tuna assembly indicating that most of a generic fish transcriptome was covered by the assembly...|$|R
40|$|Information {{on the age}} of {{individuals}} is often required for models assessing the status of stocks. Techniques used to estimate age of tuna have varied across species and agencies, precluding meta-analyses of age and growth. We compared age estimates obtained from commonly used ageing techniques for four important tuna species: bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, southern bluefin tuna, and albacore tuna. Estimates of age from counts of annual increments in transverse-sectioned otoliths were generally higher than those from counts of daily increments in transverse and longitudinal sections for all species, particularly for fish older than two years. However, annual counts produced younger estimates, on average, relative to daily counts for bigeye and yellowfin tuna younger than one year. Estimates derived from daily increments in longitudinal and transverse sections were generally similar, although longitudinal sections produced relatively older age estimates for individuals older than two years. A linear or non-linear increase in the magnitude of differences between ageing methods was the best-approximating model in all cases except when comparing daily-increment counts between transverse and longitudinal otolith sections for southern bluefin tuna. These observations are consistent with a narrowing of daily increments with increasing age, resulting in underestimates of age relative to those derived from annual increments. We conclude that (i) daily increments are unsuitable for ageing individuals over two years, especially for <b>southern</b> bluefin and <b>albacore,</b> (ii) longitudinal sections are more precise and produce older age estimates than transverse sections for daily-age estimates, (iii) there are considerable differences in these trends between species, likely dependent on longevity, and (iv) parameter estimates and/or conclusions based on meta-analyses using age data derived from different ageing methods are likely confounded with methodological biases. This result demonstrates that greater effort is required to provide consistent, validated methods for routine age determination to support the assessment and management of these valuable populations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 North Pacific {{albacore}} (Thunnus alalunga) is {{a highly}} migratory and commercially valuable species of tuna. All stock assessments and management decisions for North Pacific albacore are presently {{based on the assumption}} of a single, uniform stock. However, a growing body of evidence from diverse sources suggests that there are two subgroups of albacore in the coastal fishery of North America. These subgroups are believed to occur north and south of 400 North latitude. This study investigated the existence of the proposed subgroups using more than 40 years of albacore logbook and port sampler data provided by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. I examined regional differences in the coastal albacore fishery using three metrics: 1) catch per unit effort (CPUE), 2) entry and exit date, and 3) size composition. Distinct regional differences were observed for each metric. Spatial mapping of average CPUE by month suggested that migration into the coastal fishery occurs at two distinct locations: approximately 450 North latitude and 300 North latitude. Availability within seasons, expressed as average CPUE by month, differed between the two regions. Average entry and exit dates were also different between the two regions, with the northern region starting on average one month later (July) and ending one month earlier (October) than the <b>southern</b> region. Moreover, <b>albacore</b> from the <b>southern</b> region averaged 2. 5 cm longer than those caught in the northern region. These results support previous findings and suggest that the coastal albacore fishery is comprised of two subgroups with distinct migration routes and size characteristics. The results may have implications for the management of this fishery, particularly if these subgroups represent separate and distinct stocks. Because this study did not examine spawning distribution, further research (possibly using genetics) is needed to determine if the subgroups spawn independently in space and time...|$|R
