5|$|Haddock {{has been}} trying to get the local stonemason to fix a broken <b>step</b> <b>at</b> Marlinspike, but he is never available. Milanese opera diva Bianca Castafiore invites herself to Marlinspike Hall. Haddock, who dislikes her company, tries to leave before she arrives but trips on the broken step and sprains his ankle. The doctor puts his foot in a cast and imposes bed rest. Castafiore then arrives with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner. Castafiore {{presents}} Haddock with a pet parrot and fusses over him, to his great discomfort.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about Rulers 3 to 6 in the dynastic succession, {{although}} it is known from a fragment of a broken monument reused as construction fill in a later building that {{one of them was a}} son of Popol Hol. Ruler3 is depicted on the 8th-century AltarQ, but his name glyph has broken away. KuIx was the 4thruler in the succession. He rebuilt temple 10L-26 in the Acropolis, erecting a stela there and a hieroglyphic <b>step</b> <b>at</b> its base. Although this king is also mentioned on a few other fragments of sculpture, no dates accompany his name. The next two kings in the dynastic sequence are only known from their sculptures on AltarQ.|$|E

25|$|The {{registers}} are clocked in a stop/go fashion using {{a majority}} rule. Each register has an associated clocking bit. At each cycle, the clocking bit {{of all three}} registers is examined and the majority bit is determined. A register is clocked if the clocking bit agrees with the majority bit. Hence at each <b>step</b> <b>at</b> {{least two or three}} registers are clocked, and each register steps with probability 3/4.|$|E

25|$|Eliminating the {{moisture}} source {{is the first}} <b>step</b> <b>at</b> fungal remediation. Removal of affected materials may also be necessary for remediation, if materials are easily replaceable and {{not part of the}} load-bearing structure.

Post-remediation verification of moisture content and fungal growth is required for successful remediation. Many contractors perform post-remediation verification themselves, but property owners may benefit from independent verification.|$|E
25|$|A* is an {{informed}} search algorithm, or a best-first search, {{meaning that it}} solves problems by searching among all possible paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among these paths it first considers the ones that appear to lead most quickly to the solution. It is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific node of a graph, it constructs a tree of paths starting from that node, expanding paths one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time, until one of its paths ends at the predetermined goal node.|$|E

25|$|Other tactically driven {{mobility}} requirements {{include a}} 25-foot turning radius {{and the ability}} to climb 24-inch vertical obstacles in forward and reverse. JLTV must be able to drive off an 18-inch vertical <b>step</b> <b>at</b> 15mph and sustain no mechanical damage. It will be capable of traversing a 20-degree V-ditch that is 25 feet wide at an approach angle of 45 degree. It can 'jump' a 6-inch parallel curb at 15mph and traverse a 20-foot flight of stairs at 5mph. It must climb a 60 percent dry, hard-surfaced gradient and traverse a 40 percent sideslope with no degradation in driver control.|$|E
25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one step, {{up to the}} middle of the board (in the case of the 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make one <b>step</b> <b>at</b> a time. (In the case of an 8×8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was able}} to turn to the {{specifics}} of the case, Olinger reminded the justices that Hogan had agreed that, other than Doyle's contact with WSAI, the board had ample reason not to renew his contract. The rest of the argument focused on the jurisdictional issues. Olinger said that the difference between Doyle's salaries at Mt. Healthy and Miami Trace was too small to reach the $10,000 threshold. Pressed by one of the justices, he admitted that he was not taking into account the difference it might have made {{over the course of several}} years of employment; however he said it was entirely possible that Doyle's potential top salary <b>step</b> <b>at</b> his new school would be higher than it might be at Mt. Healthy.|$|E

25|$|Shaftesbury {{was nearly}} forty before he married, {{and even then}} {{he appears to have}} taken this <b>step</b> <b>at</b> the urgent {{instigation}} of his friends, mainly to supply a successor to the title. The object of his choice (or rather of his second choice, for an earlier project of marriage had shortly before fallen through) was Jane Ewer, the daughter of a Hertfordshire gentleman. The marriage took place in the autumn of 1709, and on 9 February 1711, was born at his house at Reigate, in Surrey, his only child and heir, the fourth Earl, to whose manuscript accounts we are in great part indebted for the details of his father's life. The match appears to have been happy, though Shaftesbury had little sentiment on the subject of married life.|$|E
25|$|In plan view, the twin-mainfloats, {{like those}} of the Short N.2B, were square-fronted with a slight {{increase}} in beam from front to rear, while the stern tapered to a point like a mitred arch. They had a concave bottom (the edges were protected by metal strips) and a sharp <b>step</b> <b>at</b> approximately 3/4 length; a tailfloat was fitted to the fuselage below the conventional tailplane. Attached {{to the rear of the}} tailfloat was a taxying rudder, with an additional drop-plate which improved steering on water, and which, thanks to the hinged mounting at the forward end, would rise up into its recess in the tailfloat on contact with the ground when beaching. Wingtip floats were deemed unnecessary. A detail drawing, which appeared in Flight Magazine in 1920, showed the empennage and tailfloat assembly, including the hinged rudder drop-plate.|$|E
