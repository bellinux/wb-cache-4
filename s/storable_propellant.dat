50|$|In {{addition}} to the suborbital launch pads, the West Texas site includes a number of rocket engine test stands. Engine test cells to support both hydrolox, methalox and <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> engines are present.|$|E
50|$|SuperDraco engines use a <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> {{mixture of}} {{monomethylhydrazine}} fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. They {{are capable of}} being restarted many times, and {{have the capability to}} deeply reduce their thrust providing precise control during propulsive landing of the Dragon capsule.|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the feasibility and mission performance benefits of using advanced space <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> for outer planet exploration was performed. For {{the purpose of this}} study, space <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> are defined to be propellants which can be passively stored without the need for active cooling...|$|R
5000|$|In rockets, {{three main}} liquid {{bipropellant}} combinations are used: cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen, cryogenic oxygen and a hydrocarbon, and <b>storable</b> <b>propellants.</b>|$|R
50|$|The RD-0203/4 was {{the second}} staged {{combustion}} engine in the world, only after the S1.5400, and {{was also the first}} staged combustion engine with <b>storable</b> <b>propellants.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> {{combinations}} - used {{in almost}} all bipropellant low-thrust, auxiliary or reaction control rocket engines, {{as well as in}} some in large rocket engines for first and second stages of ballistic missiles. They are instant-starting and suitable for long-term storage.|$|E
50|$|Draco {{thrusters}} generate 400 newtons (90 pounds-force) of thrust using a <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> {{mixture of}} monomethyl hydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. The Draco thrust {{is comparable to}} the Marquardt R-4D engine developed for the Apollo Service and Lunar Modules in 1960s and used for apogee/perigee maneuvers, orbit adjustment, and attitude control.|$|E
50|$|The Proton M's {{improvements}} included {{lower stage}} modifications to reduce structural mass, increase thrust, and fully use propellants. Generally a Briz-M (Бриз meaning Breeze) <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> upper stage {{is used instead}} of the Blok D or Blok DM stage, removing the need for multiple fuel supplies and oxygen top-off due to boiling; the Proton-M also flew with a Blok-DM upper stage. Efforts were also made to reduce dependency on foreign (usually Ukrainian) component suppliers.|$|E
50|$|The LGM-25C Titan II ICBM was a second-generation ICBM with <b>storable</b> <b>propellants,</b> all {{inertial}} guidance, and in-silo launch capability. Construction of {{the first}} Titan II site began in 1962, and eventually Vandenberg operated four Titan II launch complexes.|$|R
25|$|The {{propulsion}} system {{was intended to}} be a liquid-fueled, dual-thrust rocket, using hypergolic, <b>storable</b> <b>propellants.</b> The rocket motor planned for use in the Diamondback missile was based on that developed by NOTS for the Liquid Propellant Aircraft Rocket (LAR) project.|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the feasibility and mission performance benefits of using advanced space <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> for outer planet exploration was performed. For {{the purpose of this}} study, space <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> are defined to be propellants which can be passively stored without the need for active cooling. A secondary purpose o f this study was to provide guidance as to the limits, benefits, and possible methods of passively storing such mild cryogenic propellants for deep space missions. The study was composed of four distinct efforts. First, candidate propellants were defined and their relevant properties determined. Second, a propellant combination analysis using the Two Dimensional Kinetics 1997 (TDK 97) program was conducted. Third, a thermal storage design was analyzed. Lastly, a mission and systems analysis was performed for three outer planetary missions. The missions are representative in complexity, duration, and requirements for a variegated set of outer planet exploration missions currently being considered by NASA. Nonetheless, the analysis conducted and outlined in this paper determined that outer planet exploration using advanced <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> was feasible and offered a significant benefit in delivered payload compared to previous design studies.

5000|$|Ren Xinmin ( [...] ; 5 December 1915 - 12 February 2017) was a Chinese {{aerospace}} engineer. He was {{a specialist}} in astronautics and liquid rocket engine technology. Ren was the technical director of the Long March 1 rocket, which {{was used for the}} successful launch of Dong Fang Hong I, China's first satellite, and chief designer of Chinese <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> rocket engine. He was also the chief designer for Long March 3 launch vehicle, Fengyun, and SJ (Shijian) series satellites.|$|E
5000|$|The DragonFly {{test vehicle}} {{is powered by}} eight SuperDraco engines, {{arranged}} in a redundant pattern to support fault-tolerance in the propulsion system design. [...] SuperDracos utilize a <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> mixture of monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer (NTO), the same propellants used in the much smaller Draco thrusters used for attitude control and maneuvering on the first-generation Dragon spacecraft.While SuperDraco engines are capable of 16400 lbf N of thrust, during use on DragonFly flight test vehicle each will be throttled to less than 15325 lbf N to maintain vehicle stability.|$|E
50|$|For the Soyuz-T (first flight during 1979), Isayev's OKB-2 {{developed}} for TsKBEM an integrated propulsion system, the KTDU-426. One {{advantage of this}} system is that since the DPO {{could be used as}} backup of the main propulsion for orbit correction and de-orbit maneuvers, there was no need of adding a backup main propulsion (the DKD S5.35 in the previous system). But more importantly they could implement more extensive redundancy while keeping the mass of the system down. And by switching all the engines to the same propellant, all reserves could be consolidating reducing mass further. They also switched to a more efficient and <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> UDMH and N2O4, which improved performance further. The reentry capsule attitude control system, still uses catalytic decomposition of H2O2, but that is a completely separate system.|$|E
40|$|Orbiter Orbital Maneuver Subsystem (OMS) and Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS) tankage {{has proved}} to be highly {{successful}} in shuttle flights on-orbit propellant transfer tests were done. Tank qualification tests along with flight demonstrations were carried out future uses of <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> are cited...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion system {{configurations}} for future NASA and DOD space initiatives {{are driven by}} the continually emerging new mission requirements. These initiatives cover an extremely wide range of mission scenarios, from unmanned planetary programs, to manned lunar and planetary programs, to earth-oriented (Mission to Planet Earth) programs, {{and they are in}} addition to existing and future requirements for near-earth missions such as to geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO). Increasing space transportation costs, and anticipated high costs associated with space-basing of future vehicles, necessitate consideration of cost-effective and easily maintainable configurations which maximize the use of existing technologies and assets, and use budgetary resources effectively. System design considerations {{associated with the use of}} <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> to fill these needs are presented. Comparisons in areas such as complexity, performance, flexibility, maintainability, and technology status are made for earth and space <b>storable</b> <b>propellants,</b> including nitrogen tetroxide/monomethylhydrazine and LOX/monomethylhydrazine...|$|R
50|$|The company {{forecast}} that CRPUs {{would eventually}} be so cheap, recovering and refurbishing a launcher would be no better than simply building more units. The use of <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> and few moving parts meant that launch-site operations would also be very simple. These advantages were expected to overcome the disadvantages of small specific impulse and payload fraction.|$|R
5000|$|Site 41 was {{a complex}} of three launch pads at the Baikonur Cosmodrome {{originally}} built for flight testing of Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) using <b>storable</b> <b>propellant.</b> The need to develop such missiles was determined by low-tactical-technical and operational characteristics of the first Soviet ICBM R-7 created by the OKB-1 {{under the guidance of}} Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. May 13, 1959 by a special decree of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the CM of the design Bureau «Yuzhnoye» (Chief designer-Mikhail K. Yangel) assigned to develop an Intercontinental ballistic missile on storable components of propellant, which has received designation R-16 and index - 8К64 [...] Together with 41 platform built platform № 42 - technical and № 43 - for residing of serving military personnel and representatives of the industry.|$|E
50|$|This {{type of fuel}} {{is mainly}} used for interplanetary probes and {{spacecraft}} propulsion because unlike other more common propellants like liquid oxygen or liquid hydrogen Aerozine 50 is liquid at room temperature and {{can be stored in}} liquid state without significant boil off, thus making it a <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> better suited for long term interplanetary missions. Aerozine 50 was largely used in ICBMs and in their derivative launchers such as the core stages of the Titan-II/III/IV rocket because an ICBM requires long term storage and launch on short notice; the rocket must be stored already fueled. This fuel was also used in ICBM heritage upper stages, such as the Delta II rocket. It was also used by the Apollo Lunar Module and the Service Propulsion System engine in the Apollo CSM. The Ariane 1 through Ariane 4 family used a related fuel, a mixture of 75% UDMH and25% hydrazine hydrate called UH 25.|$|E
50|$|After the World War II, the Soviet {{engineers}} {{tried to}} absorb and further develop the German rocketry technology. For the requirements to have storable propellants and higher thrust, Glushko's OKB-456 developed the RD-211, which had four combustion chambers, each having twice {{the thrust of}} the RD-100, itself a Russian adaptation of the V-2 A-4 engine. The four chambers were fed from a single turbopump which, also like its German inspiration, was feed by steam generated from catalytic decomposition of H2O2. When then came the requirement for the Buran cruise missile project, a version for that application was developed in the RD-212. Regrettably, both RD-211 and RD-212 proved too week for the application and the project were abandoned for the RD-213 for Buran. When Yangel's OKB-586 was tasked with developing the first <b>storable</b> <b>propellant</b> ballistic missile in the Soviet arsenal, the RD-211 proved too weak. Thus, the project was definitely abandoned and the more powerful RD-214 was developed. While Korolev refusal to use toxic propellants basically left him out of the ballistic missile development race, the basic design of the RD-211 also served as basis for the RD-107/RD-108 engine, which went to be the most flown rocket engines in history.|$|E
40|$|Advanced Chemical Propulsion (ACP) {{provides}} near-term incremental {{improvements in}} propulsion system performance and/or cost. It is an evolutionary approach to technology development that produces useful products {{along the way}} to meet increasingly more demanding mission requirements while focusing on improving payload mass fraction to yield greater science capability. Current activities are focused on two areas: chemical propulsion component, subsystem, and manufacturing technologies that offer measurable system level benefits; and the evaluation of high-energy <b>storable</b> <b>propellants</b> with enhanced performance for in-space application. To prioritize candidate propulsion technology alternatives, a variety of propulsion/mission analyses and trades have been conducted for SMD missions to yield sufficient data for investment planning. They include: the Advanced Chemical Propulsion Assessment; an Advanced Chemical Propulsion System Model; a LOx-LH 2 small pumps conceptual design; a space <b>storables</b> <b>propellant</b> study; a spacecraft cryogenic propulsion study; an advanced pressurization and mixture ratio control study; and a pump-fed vs. pressure-fed study...|$|R
