5|$|The {{evidence}} against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both {{had been seen}} to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash. Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his {{with him when he}} came to Rhodesia. Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns. Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and {{the only member of the}} column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard. The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing out that most of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language.|$|E

25|$|On 1 January 2015, Gerrard {{announced}} that he would leave Liverpool {{at the end of the}} season. Gerrard said he would have signed a new contract had it been offered in the offseason, but said the club did not make an offer until November. By that time, Brendan Rodgers had <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about managing his playing time and he had been left out of the starting lineup against Real Madrid in the Champions League, contributing to his decision to leave Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|Poirot visits Alistair Blunt and {{explains}} the murders. The real Mabelle Sainsbury Seale had known Blunt {{and his first}} wife, Gerda, when she and Gerda were both actresses in India. Gerda is masquerading as Helen Montressor, a distant Canadian cousin currently living on Blunt's estate. Blunt's money came from his now-deceased second wife, but he and Gerda never divorced; if the fact of Blunt's bigamy were known, he would be disgraced and ruined. Running into Blunt in the street, Mabelle Sainsbury Seale had recognised and <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{in front of his}} niece, but had not realised that he was now the prominent banker. She had mentioned this chance encounter to the blackmailer, Amberiotis, who made the connection between the name 'Blunt' and the wealthy banker, and began to blackmail him.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the year, Alpha Oumar Konaré, the {{chairman}} of the commission of the African Union and former president of Mali, reportedly urged Bozizé not to stand for election. Bozizé gave an interview to Radio France Internationale on May 17 in which he refused to say whether or not he would run, but he confirmed that Konaré had <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about it, while criticizing Konaré for what he called interference in the country's affairs, and wondering whether he had consulted the opinions of the Central African people before getting involved. He stressed that the matter would depend on the will of the people. Some of his supporters campaigned prominently for him to stand. About 5,000 people walked in Bangui on June 19 to support his candidacy; Bozizé thanked them and asked for time to reflect.|$|E

On September 27, 2015, it was announced that he had been appointed to the British Labour Party's Economic Advisory Committee, convened by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and reporting to Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, for whom he is undertaking an independent review of the Bank of England, although he has stated that he is not a Corbyn supporter and has never <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Blanchflower quit the panel and said he would also wind up his review {{of the role of the}} Bank of England on 28 June 2016 following the mass resignations of the Shadow Cabinet, joining them in calling for Corbyn to step down.|$|E

Some district officials had reportedly <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about his writings, and others had threatened him with a libel action. As {{a result of this}} perceived harassment, Udin had filed multiple complaints with the Legal Aid Institute (...) in Yogyakarta. Udin had also been offered bribes to cease his reporting and received threats of violence. When his wife asked him about the threats, he responded, [...] "What I write is the facts. If I have to die, I will accept it." [...] The night of his murder, two men came to the Bernas office looking for him, but a secretary sent them away.|$|E
500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E

500|$|Kurisu Makise is {{the main}} female protagonist {{of the game and}} Lab Member No. 004. She is an 18-year-old {{neuroscience}} researcher at an American university who can speak and read English well.

Okabe simply tends to call her [...] or one of the several nicknames he comes up with, such as , [...] "the Zombie", and [...] "Celeb Sev", which bugs her to varying degrees. She is something of a mild tsundere, although she will object to it whenever someone (usually Daru) calls her that.

500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E

In one interview granted in 2011, McVicker stated the primary reason he had been inspired to campaign to ensure James Munro and Gregory Miley are never released were the words one of the murder victims' mothers had <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on after he had testified against Bonin at his Los Angeles County trial: [...] "You've got to speak for my kid." ...|$|E

He did give an indication {{that it would not}} be President Obama since Robertson said God told him Obama's views were at [...] "odds with the majority", but left some room for interpretation had the 2012 election expanded beyond a two-person race. Closer to the election, however, he expressly stated that God had told him that Mitt Romney would win and would be a two-term President.|$|E

Hicks denies this and also denies having had the necessary language proficiency, a claim supported by Major Michael Mori and fellow detainee Moazzam Begg. The latter said that Hicks could not speak enough Arabic to be understood. Hicks wrote home that he had met Osama bin Laden 20 times. He later, however, told investigators he had exaggerated, that he had seen bin Laden about eight times and <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> only once.|$|E

2500|$|Robertson's rival Wilson {{appears to}} have held him in similar social disdain. Early in Robertson's tenure as Commandant at Staff College (20 December 1910), he did not speak to Wilson when he visited Staff College with the CIGS Nicholson, causing his {{predecessor}} to complain to Nicholson about his [...] "most rude & unpardonable behaviour". After Robertson had again not <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at a Staff College point-to-point (25 March 1911), Wilson wrote that he was [...] "an ill-mannered swine, though I don't think he means to be rude". Wilson wrote (in 1915) [...] "He is secretive &, like all underbreds, suspicious; also his manners are somewhat repugnant" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "a slippery old boy" [...] and [...] "It is d(amnable?) to work with a man who is not a gentleman.

2500|$|Richmond {{became a}} British Army captain {{at the age}} of 23 in 1787. On 27 May 1789, while a colonel in the Duke of York's regiment, he was {{involved}} in a duel with Frederick, Duke of York, who had expressed the opinion that [...] "Colonel Lennox had heard words <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at Daughbigny's, to which no gentleman ought to have submitted", effectively an accusation of failing to respond to an insult in the way that a gentleman should. At Wimbledon Common, Richmond fired, but his ball [...] "grazed his Royal Highness's curl"; the Duke did not fire. Richmond shortly after exchanged his company for the commission of a lieutenant-colonel in the 35th Regiment of Foot. On 1 July of the same year, he was involved in another duel, with Theophilus Swift, Esq., in consequence of a pamphlet criticising Richmond's character published under Swift's name. They met in a field near the Uxbridge Road, where Swift was wounded in the body, but recovered.|$|E
2500|$|Two police officers, PC Nigel Dawson and PC Neil Blakey, who {{had arrived}} shortly after the {{ambulance}} in a marked patrol car, {{made no attempt to}} speak to Alder. They consulted with the club's manager, who took them inside to review the club's CCTV footage of the incident. A message they sent to their control room at this time indicates that they had already assumed Alder was very drunk, despite not having <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> or having been told this by any of the witnesses they spoke with. A third police officer, Acting Police Sergeant (A/PS) Mark Ellerington, arrived at about 2.50am, after the ambulance left, and went inside to speak with the club manager and the officers already present. He was told by Dawson and Blakey that Alder was drunk. The IPCC report later criticised the stance the police took, saying: [...] "This judgement, based upon very little evidence, tends to suggest that the two officers were making assumptions about Mr. Alder's behaviour, and choosing to attribute it to alcohol taken rather than the injury sustained, from an early stage in their dealings with him." ...|$|E
