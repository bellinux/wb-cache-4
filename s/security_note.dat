50|$|Signcryption {{provides}} {{the properties of}} both digital signatures and encryption schemes {{in a way that}} is more efficient than signing and encrypting separately. This means that at least some aspect of its efficiency (for example the computation time) is better than any hybrid of digital signature and encryption schemes, under a particular model of <b>security.</b> <b>Note</b> that sometimes hybrid encryption can be employed instead of simple encryption, and a single session-key reused for several encryptions to achieve better overall efficiency across many signature-encryptions than a signcryption scheme but the session-key reuse causes the system to lose security under even the relatively weak CPA model. This is the reason why a random session key is used for each message in a hybrid encryption scheme but for a given level of security (i.e., a given model, say CPA), a signcryption scheme should be more efficient than any simple signature-hybrid encryption combination.|$|E

30|$|Let us have {{a closer}} look on how an {{externally}} reported vulnerability in a shipped software version is fixed: First, an external reporter (e.g., customer or independent security researcher) contacts the security response team, which assigns a case manager. The case manager is responsible for driving the decision if a reported problem is a security vulnerability {{that needs to be}} fixed, and for ensuring that the confirmed vulnerability is fixed and that a patch is released. After vulnerability is confirmed, the case manager contacts the development team and often also a dedicated maintenance team (called IMS) to ensure that a fix is developed and back-ported to all necessary older releases (according to SAP’s support and maintenance contracts). The developed fixes are subject to a special security test by the security validation team and, moreover, the response teams reviews the SAP <b>Security</b> <b>Note.</b> If the technical fix as well as the resulting <b>Security</b> <b>Note</b> passes the quality checks, the <b>Security</b> <b>Note</b> is made available to customers individually and/or {{in the form of a}} support package (usually on the first Tuesday of a month). Support packages are functional updates that also contain the latest security notes.|$|E

Virus program is a software agent that changes the functionality of the devices and makes it fulfill not inherent function. A similar approach is used to create intelligent software agents that are loaded on remote terminal devices and solve data storage problems, calculate aggregated indicators, convolution, etc. Computing power sensor nodes and controllers based on programmable logic integrated circuits (FPGAs), operating system and firmware software can significantly extend the functionality of nodes to perform quite complicated procedures for transformation and analytical sensor data processing.|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, NIST began the task of providing cryptographic key management guidance. This included lessons learned over many years of dealing with key management issues, and attempts to encourage the definition and implementation of appropriate key management procedures, to use algorithms that adequately protect sensitive information, and to plan ahead for possible changes in the use of cryptography because of algorithm breaks or the availability of more powerful computing techniques. This guidance is provided in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800 - 57. Some of the guidance provided in SP 800 - 57 includes the definition of security strengths, the association of the approved algorithms with these security strengths, and a projection of the time frames during which the algorithms could be expected to provide adequate <b>security.</b> <b>Note</b> that the length of the cryptographic keys is often an integral part of these determinations. The security strength is measured in bits and is, basically, a measure of the difficulty of discovering the key. The understood security strength for each algorithm is listed in SP 800 - 57. For example, RSA using a key length of 1024 bits (i. e., 1024 -bit RSA) has...|$|E

40|$|Security of {{information}} {{has become a}} major issue during the last decades. New algorithms based on chaotic maps were suggested for protection of different types of multimedia data, especially digital images and videos in this period. However, many of them fundamentally were flawed by a lack of robustness and security. For getting higher security and higher complexity, in the current paper, we introduce a new kind of symmetric key block cipher algorithm that is based on tripled chaotic maps. In this algorithm, the utilization of two coupling parameters, as well as the increased complexity of the cryptosystem, make a contribution to the development of cryptosystem with higher security. In order to increase the security of the proposed algorithm, the size of key space and the computational complexity of the coupling parameters should be increased as well. Both the theoretical and experimental results state that the proposed algorithm has many capabilities such as acceptable speed and complexity in the algorithm due to the existence of two coupling parameter and high <b>security.</b> <b>Note</b> that the ciphertext has a flat distribution and has {{the same size as the}} plaintext. Therefore, it is suitable for practical use in secure communications. ...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsEquity {{crowdfunding}} is {{a phenomenon}} that is emerging at this very moment. Although charity funding has existed for probably, centuries and reward based for years there is natural development and continuation aspiring now. The next big step is equity crowdfunding open for broad public. So far, only certain qualified private investors and private entities were eligible. The challenge is to open it for everyone. The process will truly take off when regulation authorities in the countries around the globe will adopt the laws and rules for that. New rules apply to crowdfunding platforms from October 2014 in UK and in USA; {{they are in the}} final process of negotiation. There are many opportunities and pitfalls. First, the current equity crowdfunding experience studied to draw some conclusions for future development. Few examples from already funded projects used to illustrate the points. This work focuses on the key areas of public available crowdfunding also called crowd investing. Probable solutions discussed and criticism from experienced private investors addressed. Different countries are trying to overcome the fact that their securities regulations and laws adopted long before the term crowdfunding came into life. Few countries exemptions from current regulations studied and compared. Based on the information collected a model for equity crowdfunding process is discussed. Discussion includes proposal to special equity crowdfunding <b>security</b> <b>note</b> and what properties it should have. Some thoughts on further process regulation like continuous funding campaign, internal and external audits by venture backers are described. A potential evolutionary way of funding through funds and further development of crowdfunding platforms is proposed. The whole crowdfunding process is looked at solely through perspective of a technological startup venture searching for the funding and other cases are omitted. The most attention is paid to equity in form of securities funding. Lending, as being mostly, a straightforward process, is touched briefly and mostly overlooked.
