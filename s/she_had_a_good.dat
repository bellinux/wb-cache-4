Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E

He recalled her running around their home singing and that never being annoying due to her having a [...] "beautiful voice". She and her brother became close with their cousin Jomo Hankerson, since growing up, they lived [...] "about five blocks apart". Jomo walked Aaliyah and Rashad to their home from school when their mother {{was not able to}} pick them up and recalled the Haughton household being filled with music. Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when the Haughtons moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.|$|E

500|$|Robert Bathurst was {{appearing}} in The Rover during casting {{and arrived at}} his audition [...] "bearded and shaggy". He {{did not expect to}} win the part of David, the [...] "smooth" [...] management consultant, assuming someone [...] "a lot shinier and flashier" [...] than him would be cast. Langan had seen him in Joking Apart and some other sitcom pilots and was attracted to his [...] "disciplined comic energy". Hermione Norris first read for Rachel but Lowney asked her to read for Karen because her social class matched that of the character, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> rapport with Bathurst.

500|$|Hutchinson {{described}} Steiger's {{mother as}} [...] "plump, energetic and small, with long auburn hair". <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> singing voice and nearly became a Hollywood actress, {{but after a}} leg surgery permanently impaired her walking ability, she gave up acting and turned to alcohol. As a result, she quit show business and moved away from Westhampton to raise her son. They moved through several towns, including Irvington and Bloomfield, before settling in Newark, New Jersey. Her alcoholism caused Steiger much embarrassment, and the family was frequently mocked by other {{children and their parents}} within the community. At the age of five he was sexually abused by a pedophile who lured him in with a butterfly collection. Steiger said of his troubled family background: [...] "If you had the choice of having the childhood you experienced, with your alcoholic mother and being the famous actor you are today, or having a loving, secure childhood and not being famous, which would you take? A loving, secure childhood in a New York minute". During the last 11 years of her life, Steiger's mother stayed sober and regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Steiger recalled: [...] "I was so proud of her. She turned herself around. She came alive again".|$|E
500|$|Jim Harrington of The Oakland Tribune {{described}} {{the show as}} a human embodiment of Britney Spears' [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] (2002). He presumed [...] that the tour was a conscious transition for fans {{who did not want}} Cyrus to separate herself from the Hannah Montana franchise. Kirsty Cameron of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Despite her relatively young age, Cyrus showed her unfailing capability as performer. With the help of her back-up dancers, Cyrus provided her audience with choreographed set pieces and a different spectacle for each song." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted that the Wonder World Tour presented Cyrus as both a [...] "PG-rated tween pop star and an edgy rocker eager". He stated that although she played both roles well, it was apparent that she was more at ease with the latter. Reed also felt the concert did little to display Cyrus' personality and ability to engage with the audience. [...] "We know she's got impressive vocal chops, but now we need to feel what she's trying to put across in her songs, something beyond the standard 'You guys are awesome!' banter." [...] Scott Iwasaki of Deseret News reviewed a concert in which Cyrus was ill. He mentioned that because of her illness, her voice went flat. Iwasaki also expressed his viewpoint that [...] "if there [...] any worries that Miley Cyrus would become another Britney Spears train wreck, those worries were quelled during Tuesday night's show. She kept the show family-friendly and, although obviously sick, looked like <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time." [...] Marlin Levison of The Star Tribune believed the concert lacked much profundity until the last performance.|$|E

2500|$|Hines {{moved in}} with Kathryn Perry (with whom he had {{recorded}} [...] "Sadie Green the Vamp of New Orleans"). Hines said of her, [...] "She'd been at The Sunset too, in a dance act.

We lived in a big apartment and her parents stayed with us". Perry recorded several times with Hines, including [...] "Body & Soul" [...] in 1935. They stayed together until 1940, when Hines [...] "divorced" [...] her to marry Ann Jones Reed, but that marriage was soon [...] "indefinitely postponed".|$|E

2500|$|Fattouma Khefacha, {{was born}} in 1861 to Khadouja Mzali and Ahmed Khefacha. When she was very young, her parents divorced. Bourguiba, who had always criticized {{repudiation}} in Islam, stated in 1973, that the reason of the divorce was [...] "futile". Indeed, the divorce took place because Khadouja presented a cold meal to her husband. Once separated, Ahmed married another woman and founded a new family. Khadouja then, {{had no choice but}} to get back to her parent's place, in the [...] "Tripolitanian quarter". It was in that house that Fattouma was raised, her mother refusing to remarry. In 1880, at the age of 15 or 16 years old, Fattouma married Ali Bourguiba, and upon the instance of her mother, wedded in her father's house, before parting for that of her groom.

Despite that, Bourguiba stated that [...] "in reality, there wasn't much of a relationship between my family and that of mother, that it to say, that of Ahmed Khefacha, who, as I said, had remarried. However, one day, when going across a nearby square, known today as independence square, where there had been a grand café, my father, who held my hand, told me to go kiss my grandfather, while designating a ruddy faced old man. So I did what I was told and kissed him".|$|E
