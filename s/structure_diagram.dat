40|$|Abstract. UML-RT is an {{extension}} of UML for modelling embedded re-active and real-time software systems. Its particular focus lies on system descriptions on the architectural level, dening the overall system structure. In this paper we propose to use UML-RT <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> together with the formal method CSP-OZ combining CSP and Object-Z. While CSP-OZ is used for specifying the system components themselves (by CSP-OZ classes), UML-RT diagrams provide the architecture description. Thus the usual ar-chitecture specication in terms of the CSP operators parallel composition, renaming and hiding is replaced by a graphical description. To preserve the formal semantics of CSP-OZ specications, we develop a translation from UML-RT <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> to CSP. Besides achieving a more easily ac-cessible, graphical architecture modelling for CSP-OZ, we thus also give a semantics to UML-RT <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The β-resorcylic acid (1) unit can {{be found}} in a number of biologically active natural {{products}} including montagnetol (2), hair-growth stimulant pochonin G (3), antioxidant erythrin (4), antifungal agents 15 G 256 b (5) and mycotoxin (S) -zearalenone (6). A conventional total synthesis of 15 G 256 b (5), from β-resorcylic acid units, was fraught with difficulties. 1 Consequently, we established a novel biomimetic strategy for the synthesis of natural product 6, by utilising a late stage aromatisation step, starting from polyketide precursor 7. Two main issues needed to be solved: a flexible synthesis to build polyketides and mild conditions to construct the aromatic ring. [Molecular <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> appear here. To view, please open pdf attachment]. Diketo-dioxinone 10 was found to be an equivalent of a polyketide. Its synthesis was accomplished by reaction of deprotonated dioxinone 8 and benzotriazole derivative 9 (obtained from thermolysis of dioxinone 8 2). [Molecular <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> appear here. To view, please open pdf attachment]. Mild conditions were found to construct the aromatic ring 11 using a weak base followed by an acid work-up. A strategy to build resorcylates in one step from diketodioxinone 10 was also discovered. 2 - 3. [Molecular <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> appear here. To view, please open pdf attachment]. This strategy was then applied to the total synthesis of (S) -zearalenone (6) employing dioxinone derivate 12 and alcohol 13 to afford polyketide 14. Conversion into (S) - zearalenone (6) was accomplished by aromatisation and trans-selective ring closing metathesis. 3. [Molecular <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> appear here. To view, please open pdf attachment]. In an analogous manner to (S) -zearalenone (6), the biomimetic total synthesis of both enantiomers of montagnetol (2) and erythrin (4) were completed, allowing assignment of their absolute stereochemical configuration. 2. [Molecular <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> appear here. To view, please open pdf attachment]. Similarly, an analogue of pochonin G 19 was synthetised, using a C-acylation reaction of the keto-dioxinone 16 dianion with Weinreb amide 17 followed by a cascade sequence consisting of ketene generation, alcohol 18 trapping, aromatization and ring closing metathesis. [Molecular <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> appear here. To view, please open pdf attachment]. From the key diketo-dioxinone building block 10, heteroaromatic 20 as well as resorcylate 15 were synthesised. 2. [Molecular <b>structure</b> <b>diagrams</b> appear here.
