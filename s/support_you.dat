25|$|To you the IRA and all who <b>support</b> <b>you</b> or defend you, {{we have to}} {{say that}} we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

500|$|There {{was talk}} of a {{potential}} run in the 2000 presidential race by Gore as early as January 1998.

[...] In the video, a [...] "smiley" [...] Gomez is seen in a black crop top and shorts with a flannel shirt around her waist, and is shown singing the song with her friends in a dark room. The video is also interspersed with clips of a party in an underground night club, as glitter falls from the ceiling. The video ends with Gomez's friends singing [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] to her.

500|$|When Taylor {{said the}} moves detracted from Hương and Suu's powers, the {{officers}} disagreed {{and said they}} supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the HNC's dissolution. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, concluding with [...] "I don't know whether {{we will continue to}} <b>support</b> <b>you</b> after this...You people have broken a lot of dishes and now we have to see how we can straighten out this mess." [...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E
500|$|In 1974 Ayers Rock began {{recording}} {{their debut}} album, Big Red Rock, at Festival Records' 24-track studio in Sydney. They were {{dissatisfied with the}} sound, which failed to capture their music's [...] "live" [...] essence, and recorded it live-in-the-studio at Armstrong's in Melbourne that September. Kennedy told Margaret MacIntyre of Rolling Stone Australia, [...] "Doing the album live was an experiment really {{and it seemed to}} work." [...] Big Red Rock, released in November, peaked at number 32 on the Kent Music Report album chart. The album had [...] "a more jazz-rock edge" [...] and its single, [...] "Lady Montego" [...] (written by McGuire), was a new version of a song originally performed by Leo de Castro and Friends. According to Juke Magazine, [...] "the single lifted to push the album, 'Lady Montego'... received three weeks airplay and was then dumped." [...] "Lady Montego" [...] was Ayers Rock's most-aired single in Australia, and Kennedy said: [...] "Without AM radio <b>support</b> <b>you</b> can't sell too well in this country." [...] Juke called their songs [...] "lyrically banal" [...] but said the group compensated with [...] "sheer talent", instrumentally and electronically.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was also}} derided by {{opposing}} teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played, {{but also to}} spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribunes Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler {{let it be known}} that any striking players would be suspended. [...] "You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not <b>support</b> <b>you,</b> that you will be outcasts," [...] threatened Chandler. [...] "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another." [...] Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, [...] "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune." ...|$|E
