40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{predictors of}} {{the adoption of}} <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> by mothers of 2 year old children. SETTING: 26 municipalities in the county of Sogn and Fjordane, and four municipalities in the county of Møre and Romsdal in Norway. METHODS: Data was collected by questionnaires mailed to all mothers of 2 year olds in the 30 municipalities (response rate 70. 7 %, n = 1233). Information was obtained on socioeconomic variables, the child's injury history, adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> and variables describing mother's health related beliefs (parent health locus of control) {{and the value of}} health (health value). RESULTS: Income, municipality of residence, age of the mother, and marital status were significantly associated with the reported adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> High income and older, married mothers were positively associated with the adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The significant effect of income on the adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> underlined by the fact that <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> were less often adopted by young single mothers, may indicate that the implementation of structural measures such as loan schemes and subsidies, are necessary to increase the adoption of child <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> The lack of association between education and social cognitive beliefs, respectively, and the adoption of <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> offer less optimism for traditional health education initiatives...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Still {{too many}} deaths and {{injuries}} {{are a result}} of road safety limitations within Europe. Road <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> aimed to change the road environment to reduce the risks on driver errors and to reduce the seriousness of the effects of driver errors are expected to increase road safety. A suitable combination of new technologies with existing infrastructure, or with limited improvements of it, may lead to much more cost-effective solutions (Brookhuis et al. 2006). The In-Safety project was aimed at determining which <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> are expected to be most effective and in the project also evaluations were performed in pilot sites and modeling laboratories. Methods The methodological approach for the selection and prioritization of the initial set of <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> is presented and discussed, based on an accident analysis. First, the general approach is described, then the method is presented including the definition of a scenario, how accident statistics are used as a starting point, the generation of <b>safety</b> <b>measures,</b> and the method of selection of <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, the AHP multicriteria analysis method, involved in the final prioritisation of the selected <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> is presented briefly. Results and conclusion The methodology proves to be appropriate for generating and evaluating self explaining road environment measures and forgiving <b>measures,</b> but <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> in the urban environment were underrepresented, due to stakeholders’ preferences.

5|$|During the 1894 {{legislative}} session, Brown advocated and won {{passage of}} several government efficiency measures, including {{a bill to}} transfer certain state governmental expenses to the counties, a bill to reform state printing contracts, and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions. The most significant bill, {{and the one that}} generated the most debate, was a law giving married women individual property rights {{for the first time in}} state history. Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal <b>safety</b> <b>measure,</b> a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive bidding on tobacco, new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes. Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the <b>safety</b> <b>measure.</b> Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E

5|$|On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed {{at about}} 10:13am as {{it left the}} Farragut North station in {{downtown}} Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered the pocket track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic derailer {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a <b>safety</b> <b>measure.</b> If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train. The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track.|$|E
5|$|Two Air Corps historians {{state that}} no {{evidence}} exists that the Navy {{was behind the}} order. One explained that Craig believed the Air Corps violated War Department policy on publicity, while the second asserted that Craig was unhappy about not being provided details of the mission before it was publicly announced, and thus issued the order to ensure full notification before granting exceptions to the restriction. Deputy chief of staff Embick made {{the claim that the}} restriction had been issued only as a <b>safety</b> <b>measure.</b> Greer, however, in his history of Air Corps doctrine, firmly attributes the restriction to the Navy, noting that in November 1938 it achieved a new modification of the Joint Action statement specifically granting it the authorization for long-range land-based flights that the Army was denied, and immediately prepared six major bases to conduct them. A fourth historian, in a biography of Arnold, stated that the restriction had actually been promulgated on 1 September 1936, at the insistence of the Navy, but was not enforced by Craig until after the Rex incident.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Concern {{with the}} costs of blood safety is growing, which raises the {{question}} whether <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> that reduce risk only marginally should be discontinued. Withdrawing such <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> would allow reallocating resources to more efficient health care interventions, but it might raise moral objections. Materials and Methods: This study evaluates two ethical arguments why discontinuing blood <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> would be more objectionable than not implementing them. The first argument is that whereas withdrawing protective measures causes harm to patients, not starting protective measures 'merely' omits to prevent harm. The second argument is that patients who benefit from protective measures are historically entitled to the continuation of those protective measures. Results: Both arguments are unconvincing. There is only a weak causal connection between removing blood <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> and harms that transfusion recipients suffer. Moreover, patients are not entitled to the continuation of protective measures that prove very inefficient, unless applying these protective measures rectifies past injustice towards them. Conclusion: Unless stronger ethical objections can be found, blood system operators and regulators should be more willing to withdraw inefficient <b>safety</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R
