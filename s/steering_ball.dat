5000|$|Burman and Sons Ltd - defunct {{manufacturer}} of recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> gear ...|$|R
50|$|Mechanical changes {{included}} {{relocation of}} the {{manual transmission shifter}} to the <b>steering</b> column, new <b>ball</b> joints, and a new gear-reduction starter motor.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reworked}} ZF recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> {{was installed}} {{along with a}} redesigned [...] "safety" [...] steering wheel fixed {{to the end of}} a now collapsible steering column.|$|R
5000|$|The ladder-type frame used semielliptical {{leaf springs}} front and rear. <b>Steering</b> {{included}} now <b>ball</b> bearings instead of roller types, and featured a Pitman arm {{in front of}} the front axle.|$|R
2500|$|Volkswagen added a [...] "Super Beetle" [...] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 {{differed}} from the standard Beetle in its use of a MacPherson strut front suspension {{instead of the usual}} torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion <b>steering</b> replaced recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> gears in model year 1974 and up. The front of the car was stretched [...] to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.|$|R
5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|R
25|$|V8 models use {{recirculating}} <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> (as per previous 5 Series generations), however {{rack and}} pinion steering was used for the first time, in the four-cylinder and six-cylinder models. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive.|$|R

50|$|The {{combination}} of a rigid X-shaped ovoid steel tube frame and four-wheel independent suspension provided surprisingly nimble handling. Double wishbones, coil springs, and a stabilizer bar were used up front and Mercedes' typical double coil spring swing axle in rear. An innovative dashboard-operated rear load-leveling suspension engaged a torsion bar to increase stiffness by one-third when needed, and a pedal-operated central lubrication system kept friction points silent. Brakes were vacuum-assisted hydraulic drum all around, <b>steering</b> recirculating <b>ball.</b> Power <b>steering</b> and Artic-Kar air-conditioning were added as options.|$|R
50|$|All XK120s had {{independent}} {{torsion bar}} front suspension, semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear, recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering,</b> telescopically adjustable steering column, and all-round 12-inch drum brakes which were prone to fade. Some cars were fitted with Alfin (ALuminium FINned) brake drums to help overcome the fade.|$|R
50|$|In September 1967 the Diplomat (along {{with its}} less {{expensive}} siblings) received a work-over consisting of rub strips on its flanks, new recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> by ZF and heated rear window. At {{the same time}} a HL (Hochleistung or high performance) version of the 2.8-liter six became available (140 PS/138 hp) for the Kapitän and Admiral models.|$|R
25|$|Unusually, two {{different}} steering systems {{were used for}} the E39, depending on the engine. Models with four-cylinder and six-cylinder models use rack and pinion steering, the first time this system has been used in a 5 Series. This system steers {{from the front of the}} axle. Models with V8 engines use recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering,</b> as per the previous generations of 5 Series.|$|R
5000|$|The Series 72 had {{the same}} general {{appearance}} as the Series 75 but it was three inches shorter and set apart by rectangular taillights set high {{on the sides of}} the trunk. Recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> was tried on Series 72 in 1940, to be adopted on all series in 1941. Like the Series 75 it was Fleetwood bodied, but rode on a 138 in wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was independent, using coil springs, and was {{bolted to}} a substantial sub-frame which also carried the recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> gear. Semi-elliptic leaf springs were {{used on the}} rear axle. Lockheed hydraulic brakes with 9 in drums were fitted front and rear. The three-speed gearbox had a column change and the optional overdrive was operated by a switch on the steering column. A four-speed floor change became an option.|$|R
5000|$|Third-generation Square-body C/K-Series pickups {{gained an}} all-new, high tensile {{strength}} carbon steel ladder type frame with [...] "drop center" [...] design. Steering controls included variable-ratio recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> gear with optional hydraulic power assist. Braking controls included front self-adjusting disc brakes with rear finned drum brakes and optional four-wheel hydraulic Hydra-Boost or Vacuum-Boost power assist. Engines choices initially consisted of six or eight cylinder engines with either manual or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmissions.|$|R
2500|$|Lundgren's biggest {{weakness}} as {{a pitcher}} was lack of control. Even in 1907, his best year, Lundgren averaged 4.0 walks per nine innings pitched. In 1909, he averaged 8.3 walks per nine innings before being released. A profile of Lundgren published in 1913 by The Atlanta Constitution discussed his strengths and weaknesses:"He had everything including speed to burn green hickory {{and an assortment}} of curves that would keep a criptograph specialist figuring all night but he was wild as a March hare in a cyclone and couldn't locate the plate with a field glass. ... He had a strange hold on the art of <b>steering</b> the <b>ball</b> away from the plate that would make Wild Willie Donovan and Cy Seymour look like a brace of pikers who had been touched for their meal tickets." ...|$|R
50|$|The Isuzu 117 Coupé is {{a compact}} Gran Turismo type 2-door {{fastback}} coupé which {{was produced by}} the Japanese automobile manufacturer Isuzu between 1968 and 1981. 117 was a codename for a common development program of Isuzu mid-size cars, involving a coupé, sedan and station wagon. The latter two eventually became the Isuzu Florian, but the coupe kept the original name, and both models shared mechanicals, including the complete FR layout chassis with recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
5|$|In a low-scoring {{match against}} Queensland, New South Wales started {{the final day}} needing 142 to win. Morris scored 108 in only 80 <b>balls,</b> <b>steering</b> his team to victory before lunch. Previously, only Bradman had scored a century before lunch in a Shield match. The innings took only 82 minutes and Morris {{promptly}} returned to {{his work as a}} salesman. Morris rounded off his Shield campaign with 110 against South Australia. The Western Australian Cricket Association attempted to lure Morris to switch states, but he declined.|$|R
5000|$|He joined Alan Buckley's {{struggling}} Third Division Rochdale on a one-month loan at {{the start}} of the 2003-04 campaign, having scored against the club in a pre-season friendly. Booked in his first three games, he was sent off 67 minutes into a 2-2 draw with Cambridge United at Spotland. The loan was extended to three months, and on 30 September, he scored at former club Macclesfield, in a 2-1 defeat, as he [...] "danced into the box before gleefully <b>steering</b> the <b>ball</b> into the far corner". He returned to Manchester in November after turning down the opportunity to add to his fifteen appearances for the [...] "Dale", and was sent out on loan to Neale Cooper's Second Division Hartlepool United the following month. He played fifteen games for the [...] "Pools", scoring one goal in a 5-2 thrashing of Port Vale at Vale Park.|$|R
50|$|The {{recirculating}} <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism {{contains a}} worm gear inside a block with a threaded hole in it; this block has gear teeth cut into the outside to engage the sector shaft (also called a sector gear) which moves the Pitman arm. The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the worm gear inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the worm gear is fixed so that when it spins, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the Pitman arm, causing the roadwheels to turn.|$|R
50|$|Chelsea {{took the}} lead just 42 seconds into the match, with Italian midfielder Roberto Di Matteo {{receiving}} the ball and firing it into the goal off the crossbar from 25 yards to record what {{was at the time}} the quickest ever goal in a Wembley FA Cup final (Louis Saha broke this record 12 years later in the 2009 final after just 25 seconds, coincidentally against Chelsea, though Chelsea won the match 2-1), breaking Jackie Milburn's 42-year record.Middlesbrough's prolific striker Fabrizio Ravanelli limped off after 21 minutes, further diminishing his side's chances of victory. Late in the first half Gianluca Festa put the ball in the net for Middlesbrough, but the goal was controversially ruled out for offside. In a largely disappointing match, in which Chelsea were generally in control, Chelsea eventually added a second goal seven minutes from full-time with Eddie Newton <b>steering</b> the <b>ball</b> into the net from Gianfranco Zola's clever flick to seal a 2-0 win.|$|R
5000|$|With {{less than}} a minute {{remaining}} in the half, Elway completed a 31-yard pass to receiver Steve Watson and an 11-yard pass to Willhite, giving the Broncos a first down at the Giants 20-yard line. But the Giants defense forced three consecutive incompletions, the last of which saw Elway lead tight end Orson Mobley too far on a throw to the end zone and cause him to collide with the goal post. Then Karlis, who had made 11 of 12 field goals from inside 40 yards during the season, missed the ensuing field goal, ending another Denver drive with nothing to show for it. Karlis later admitted his two misses in the first half were devastating to the Broncos. [...] "Both times I didn't get my hips {{all the way through the}} kicks. I was <b>steering</b> the <b>ball,</b> and I know better than that. I felt the team unravel after that. I really hurt them." ...|$|R
25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an upper control arm and a strut stabilized lower control arms in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. <b>Steering</b> was recirculating <b>ball</b> system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|R
5000|$|An {{improvement}} in the Series II though, was its more powerful engine. Referred to as the Rallymaster, it had an increased capacity of [...] The capacity increase combined with a higher compression ratio of 8.5:1 and larger inlet and exhaust valves to raise the power output to [...] at 5,200 rpm. Autocar quoted the top speed as 91 mi/h km/h with a 0-60 mph time of 20.2 seconds. Also {{as a direct result}} of competition experience, the Series II was fitted with larger front brakes and a recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> box instead of the worm and nut box of the Series I.|$|R
50|$|The coupé and sedan were {{mechanically}} identical, with front MacPherson struts and a {{solid axle}} in back mounted on four links and riding on coil springs, either a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission and recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering.</b> The CB also featured a split-folding rear seat. In Japan, the Capella came with 1.6-, 1.8-, or 2.0-liter engines (the 2.0 only being introduced {{in the end of}} March 1979). All had twin-barrel carburettors and produced 90, 100, and 110 PS JIS (66, 74, or 81 kW). The higher equipped versions received the larger US bumpers and were thus somewhat longer overall.|$|R
2500|$|A leg glance is a {{delicate}} straight-batted shot played at a ball aimed slightly on the leg side, using the bat to flick the ball as it passes the batsman, and requiring some wrist work as well, deflecting towards the square leg or fine leg area. The stroke involves deflecting the bat-face towards the leg side at the last moment, head and body moving inside {{the line of the}} ball. This shot is played [...] "off the toes, shins or hip". It is played off the front foot if the ball is pitched up at the toes or shin of the batsman, or off the back foot if the ball bounces at waist/hip height to the batsman. Although the opposite term off glance is not employed within cricket, the concept of angling the bat face towards the offside to deflect the ball away from the wicket for the purpose of scoring runs through the off side is a commonly used technique. This would commonly be described instead as [...] "running (or <b>steering)</b> the <b>ball</b> down to third man".|$|R
5000|$|The 850CSi's {{modified}} suspension included, stiffer {{springs and}} dampers that reduced the car's ride height. The recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> ratio was dropped 15% over the stock E31 setup. The model also sported staggered throwing star wheels. The {{front and rear}} bumpers were reshaped for improved aerodynamic performance. Four round stainless steel exhaust tips replaced the square tips found on other models. The 6-speed manual gearbox was the only transmission option. In Europe, all 850CSi's came with four-wheel steering (AHK - Aktive Hinterachs-Kinematik, Active rear axle Kinematics), uprated and ventilated brakes with floating front discs, rear differential oil cooler, engine oil cooler, two-tone interior, sports seats, and reshaped mirrors. In the United States, the cars instead received [...] "BMW Motorsport" [...] writing on the doorhandles.|$|R
50|$|The Tracker was {{different}} from most other light SUVs {{on the market in}} that it is based on a rugged light-truck chassis and certified as a Light truck. Although it appeared to be a comfortable passenger SUV, it was bolstered by a sturdy off-road 4-wheel-drive system with a conventional light truck engine and transmission coupled to a hi-lo, 2-4 transfer case. The Tracker had a strong front suspension with a rugged recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> box. The conventional front differential was rigidly mounted ahead of the engine, with CV axles connecting the coil-spring front hubs to the differential case. The rear axle was a conventional light truck unit on coil springs. As a result of the truck-like underpinnings, the Tracker had a fairly truck-like ride, but the benefit was its notable durability in harsh conditions.|$|R
50|$|Production of the 230 SL {{commenced}} in June 1963 {{and ended}} on 5 January 1967. Its chassis {{was based on}} the W 111 sedan platform, with a reduced wheelbase by 30 cm, recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> (with optional power steering), double wishbone front suspension and an independent single-joint, low-pivot swing rear-axle with transverse compensator spring. The dual-circuit brake system had front disc brakes and power-assisted rear drum brakes. The 230 SL was offered with a 4-speed manual transmission, or an optional, very responsive fluid coupled (no torque converter) 4-speed automatic transmission, which was popular for US models. From May 1966, the ZF S5-20 5-speed manual transmission was available as an additional option, which was particularly popular in Italy. Of the 19,831 230 SLs produced, less than a quarter were sold in the US.|$|R
25|$|The 2010 Shelby GT500 was {{revealed}} by Ford through {{a press release}} on January 1, 2009, prior to a public unveiling at the 2009 North American International Auto Show. Many of the basic design characteristics of the new GT500 are shared {{with that of the}} Mustang and Mustang GT. The GT500 gains the same exterior and interior updates as the 2010 Mustang and Mustang GT. The front fascia is new with larger upper and lower grilles, a unique hood, large fog lights mounted in the lower front fascia (similar to the previous GT500), Shelby's signature cobra badges on the grille, front fenders, and trunk lid medallion (with Shelby lettering over the medallion), 19-inch wheels (18-inch on the convertible model), and a Gurney Flap rear spoiler. Inside the GT500 gains a cobra disc on the <b>steering</b> wheel, shift <b>ball,</b> and seats with embroidered cobras.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a [...] ZMZ-24D engine, an {{evolution}} of the ZMZ-21A. Retaining the basic OHV configuration, it now ran on 92 RON gasoline (while the ZMZ 24-01 could use commonly available 76 octane, and the 24-07 could use liquid propane). The cylinder block was die cast, instead of the slower coquille for the 21A. The engine featured a twin-choke carburettor, with a higher compression ratio, producing [...] at 4500 rpm and an even more impressive [...] of torque at 2200-2400 RPM. Transmission was now fully synchronised four on floor layout. The brakes were improved, with a hydraulic vacuum servo unit (a licence-built Girling PowerStop), {{as well as an}} independent parking brake (rather than transmission brake of the GAZ-21). At the same time, certain features were retained for their proven reliability, like the kingpin front suspension and recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical {{features}} included recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> {{and front}} disc brakes, with rear-wheel drive suspension consisting front coil springs. Four-wheel drive (4WD) was added in 1981, featuring torsion bar suspension up front. The rear suspension for both comprised leaf springs with bias-mounted shock absorbers. The 4WD system incorporated an extra lever located alongside the main four-speed shifter. This provided three positions; 2WD in high-range, 4WD in high-range, and 4WD in low-range. In low-range, the vehicle travels at half road speed {{for any given}} engine rpm. The transfer case is chain-driven to the front wheels, making it stronger and quieter than the more common gear type. As such, the driver could shift between 2WD and 4WD in high-range without using the clutch, with the activation of low-range requiring the vehicle to be stopped. A warning lamp reminds the driver when 4WD is engaged.|$|R
5000|$|Like all V8-powered E39 models, the E39 M5 was {{equipped}} with a recirculating <b>ball</b> <b>steering</b> system, regarded as less tactile than the rack and pinion set up of other E39s. Overall steering ratio was reduced to 14.7 from 17.9. It featured a Servotronic vehicle-speed-sensitive power assist which provides two levels of resistance controlled via console mounted Sport button. The Sport button also adjusted the electronic throttle butterflies for faster throttle response. The E39 M5 is equipped with four-wheel vented disc brakes measuring 345 mm in diameter in front and 328 mm in diameter in the rear. [...] On European-specification models, the rotors are of a [...] "floating" [...] two-piece design for reduced risk of cone distortion. Their lower unsprung weight improves ride quality and traction on bumpy surfaces as well. Anti-lock brakes, EML (fly-by-wire) throttle control and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) were standard.|$|R
