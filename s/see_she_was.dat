500|$|When mature, Chicado V stood [...] tall. She was a brown mare, with a {{connected}} star, stripe, and snip on {{her face}} as her only markings, or identifying marks. [...] Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels, had the care of ChicadoV after she was born, and said of her that she [...] "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke." [...] When she stood in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said {{she looked like a}} rabbit, because [...] "she had big ears and that's all you could <b>see,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E
500|$|Jewish {{characters}} {{try to pass}} {{themselves off}} as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back. [...] Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's—"you could <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> more Jewish", Vladek says. [...] Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise. [...] This literalization of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their Final Solution may risk reinforcing racist labels, but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters. [...] According to art historian Andrea Liss, this may paradoxically enable the reader {{to identify with the}} characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I could <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and {{it seemed as if}} she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
60|$|Marston nodded. When a steamer's three lights <b>are</b> <b>seen</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> heading direct for the observer.|$|R
6000|$|Presently a cry echoed {{throughout}} the squadron regarding the Oquendo. [...] "She <b>is</b> on fire! <b>See,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> burning in three places!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E
60|$|Miriam {{could not}} in decency refuse, but any woman might <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not filled with delight.|$|E
6000|$|... "But couldn't you <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> old and weak, and wasn't {{responsible}} for her actions? Or were you only thinking of yourself?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Presently {{he said to}} the lady, ‘Put down a good {{mark for}} Sarah Buttermilk. I <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> trying to conquer her quick temper.’ ...|$|R
60|$|DORA. Tell {{him that}} I {{and the lady}} here wish to see him. You <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> lamed, and cannot go down to him.|$|R

60|$|There was no question, no wonderment, no puzzle in {{the eyes}} which met those of Luke. You <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> just a very {{ordinary}} kind of woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's brocht it on hersel," [...] said Leeby. [...] "Ye <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> up sune i' the mornin' {{to begin}} to the darnin' o' Jamie's stockins an' to warm his sark at the fire afore he put it on. He woke up, an' cried to her 'at he wasna {{accustomed}} to hae'n his things warmed for him.

6000|$|... "Of course. Don't you <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> all right. If he'd missed her, I'd have chipped in. Thar warn't {{no sense}} in my doing his duty onless he failed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And you <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in {{a manner}} at his mercy, being son {{to one of the}} heads of the firm, and in a {{situation}} of authority.' ...|$|R
60|$|Since {{it was her}} Evening of Honour, Adelaida was {{the person}} to <b>see.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> very popular, though <b>she</b> <b>is</b> no longer young. In fact, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{the mother of the}} young pert person of Ghosts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor child! she cannot speak,' {{said her}} grandmother. 'You <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> very sorry, and Mrs. Kendal is too kind to wish to say {{any more about}} it.' ...|$|R
60|$|There wasn't a {{doubt about}} it. She was a success. You <b>see,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} new, and London always sits up and takes notice {{when you give}} it that.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Garnett: [...] "Oh, Mr. Ashley, you mustn't {{think it}} strange of Isobel, on my bended knees you mustn't! Why, don't you <b>see?</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> just {{doing it to}} disgust you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's only in Bombay?" [...] Lady Meadowcroft cried, {{clutching}} {{at the last}} straw. I could <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> registering a mental determination to go straight up-country the moment she landed.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{disappeared}} while I {{was talking}} to that good Miss Penwell! You must be pleased now, Alick, you <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> really going to see about going to Scotland." ...|$|R
60|$|He was right, {{and soon}} the many lights from the big steam vessel could <b>be</b> plainly <b>seen.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> heading almost {{directly}} for them, but presently steered to the eastward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Up the river, you mean," [...] said Rollo. [...] "Don't you <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{going against}} the current? See how swift the water runs under the arches of the bridge!" ...|$|R

60|$|I could <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{becoming}} serious again. Lights flashed {{upon her}} face. I {{felt a sudden}} wave of pity mingled with my love for her. After all, {{there were times when}} her anxiety must have been almost insupportable.|$|E
60|$|But Rosamund {{was not to}} <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> in {{the cabin}} at the time. <b>She</b> had <b>been</b> there for this hour past, and it was {{to her that the}} present delay was due.|$|R
60|$|She {{started to}} walk to where I was, and {{suddenly}} I <b>seen</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> limping. So I gave her a hand down to my room, and set her on a chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is not in}} yet," [...] Bill said. [...] "She {{would not}} start until daylight; and I don't suppose <b>she</b> will <b>be</b> round for another two hours. You <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not clear of Portland Bill yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Nicholas {{received}} no shock of jealousy from her announcement. He knew her {{so well that}} he could <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{not in the least}} in love with Bellston. But he asked if Bellston were going to continue his explorations.|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} {{visualize}} her. He {{could see the}} sleeve of her blue corduroy jacket; her eyes he could not <b>see.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> a stranger. Had he idealized her? He was apologetic for his unflattering doubt, but of what sort was she? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ou, she's naething by the ord'nar'; but ye <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> mairit to a Tilliedrum man no lang syne, an' they're said to hae a michty grand establishment. Ay, they've a {{wardrobe}} spleet new; an' what think ye Tibbie wears ilka day?" ...|$|E
