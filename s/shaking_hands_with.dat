5|$|Chance was a disciplinarian. He preached {{moderation}} in socializing, including avoiding alcohol, to {{his players}}. Chance fined his players for <b>shaking</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> {{members of the}} opposing team and forced Solly Hofman to delay his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities on the playing field. In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker {{for the remainder of}} the season for using profanity, though he reinstated Tinker two days later.|$|E

The agents visit the Kindred's remote community, where {{they are asked to}} surrender their guns before entering. Mulder and Scully are invited to dinner. When the Kindred refuse to allow Scully to treat Brother Aaron, a sick participant at the table, Brother Andrew states that the Kindred take care of their own. Meanwhile, in another nightclub, a man convinces a girl to dance with him by touching her hand.|$|E

2500|$|If {{there are}} [...] {{people who can}} <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> one another (where [...] ), the {{pigeonhole}} principle shows that {{there is always a}} pair of people who will <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the 'hole' to which a person is assigned is the number of <b>hands</b> <b>shaken</b> by that person. Since each person <b>shakes</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> some number of people from 0 to , there are [...] possible holes. On the other hand, either the '0' hole or the [...] hole or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if !) for some person to <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> everybody else while some person <b>shakes</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> nobody. This leaves [...] people to be placed in at most [...] non-empty holes, so that the principle applies.|$|R
5|$|In the playoffs, Cleveland {{swept the}} Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks {{to earn a}} matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent {{shooting}} in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1. Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without <b>shaking</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.|$|E
5|$|The Survivor Series in November 2003 also {{marked the}} first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand. After Lesnar claimed in a {{backstage}} interview that he could beat anybody in the world, Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar, <b>shaking</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> him before leaving with a staredown. Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship. Later in the Royal Rumble match, Lesnar attacked Goldberg and attacked him with an F-5, enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} WrestleMania, both the New Breed and the ECW Originals began {{attempting}} to recruit CM Punk into their stables. On the April 3 episode of ECW, Cor Von eventually told Punk {{to choose a}} side, stating that Punk was either with the New Breed or against them. The following week, Punk made his decision and joined the New Breed, <b>shaking</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> Burke in the ring. The next week, his presence immediately created tension within the group, as he berated Cor Von and Thorn for losing and undermined Burke's position {{as the leader of}} the New Breed. Later that episode, Burke faced Van Dam in a singles match. Punk attempted to interfere, sliding a steel chair into the ring, but Van Dam got to it first and hit Burke with it. Afterward, Punk apologized to Burke. The following week, Punk apologized again, but was forced by Burke to miss an eight-man elimination tag team match between the Originals and the New Breed. In retaliation, Punk attacked Burke, causing him to lose the match, and left the New Breed.|$|E

India expressed their resentment by boycotting the post-match presentation ceremony.|$|E

25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, men {{and women}} who are not married and are not closely related are {{generally}} not allowed to touch each other. Many Orthodox married couples will also not touch one another in public. A person who refrains from touching the opposite sex is said to be shomer negiah. Shmirath negiah applies to touching that is b'derech chiba (in an affectionate manner). According to some authorities, mainly of Modern Orthodox background, a quick handshake, particularly in the context of earning a living in a business setting, does not fall under this category. However, people who are stringently shomer negiah will avoid <b>shaking</b> <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> a member of the opposite sex, even in a business context. This is almost universally observed within the Haredi community, and somewhat observed within the Modern Orthodox community where the term originated in recent decades. Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow these laws.|$|E
