As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an analysis of samples of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark, where trans fats are restricted. At KFC, the pattern was reversed, with Hungary's product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product. Even within the United States there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from Atlanta.|$|E

40|$|In the pig industry, farmers always {{strive for}} optimal {{productions}} results. In {{order to obtain}} these results, they carry out several management practices on piglets like tail docking (to avoid tail biting; routinely prohibited), teeth shortening (to avoid wounding to the udder of the sow or to litter mates; routinely prohibited), castration of male piglets (to avoid boar taint), All these procedures are however considered to be painful and therefore can also influence animal welfare and zootechnical results of the piglets. The aim of this thesis was to {{study the effects of}} reducing or adjusting these painful management practices on piglet welfare and zootechnical results. In the society of today, animal welfare is gaining consumers interest and concern. Piglet castration is a sensitive issue that has drawn the attention of the public as a result of animal welfare organizations campaigns. Therefore {{it is important to know}} consumers opinion on this topic. For that reason the opinion of Flemish consumers on unanesthetized piglet castration, and three possible alternatives is reported in the second chapter. A total of 2018 people, spread over the 5 provinces, were questioned. The results showed that in spite of several media campaigns of animal welfare organizations over the past few years, still about half of the Flemish respondents were not aware of the problem of unanesthetized piglet castration. However, after being informed, the majority wanted unanesthetized castration to be banned. Although the concern about animal welfare implications was very high, the willingness to pay extra for alternatives was low, which might prevent the return of investment for the farmers since production costs will increase. Results of the second chapter demonstrated that castration under anesthesia was the most accepted alternative by Flemish consumers. Therefore castration under carbon dioxide (CO 2) anesthesia was compared to unanesthetized castration in the third chapter. No behavioral differences were found in piglets treated with CO 2 -anesthesia or zolazepam, tiletamine (Zoletil®) and xylazine (Xyl-M®), which is an indication that CO 2 matches the anesthetic properties of the combination of Zoletil® and Xyl-M®. In the main experiment, observed differences in behavior were not conclusive. However, a difference in interactive behavior indicated a better state of welfare for the CO 2 -anesthetized castrated piglets compared to the unanesthetized castrated piglets. On the other hand, all barrows, including the anesthetized group, displayed behaviors indicative of pain or discomfort. Therefore, piglets may need to be provided with additional analgesia to eliminate the pain caused by castration even if they are anesthetized prior to castration. Castration is not the only event that may threaten piglets welfare. As mentioned before, piglets are subjected to several painful management practices, especially during their first week of life. In order to improve overall welfare, not only castration has to be dealt with, but painful management procedures in general. In the fourth chapter it was therefore investigated if reducing painful interventions during the first week of life resulted in better zootechnical performance of the piglets, reduced piglet mortality and if the overall welfare, indicated by behavioral criteria, was improved. In 22 litters, all piglets were weighed after birth. The four lightest piglets of each litter of the experimental group were not subjected to tail docking or teeth shortening, the other procedures (castration for the male piglets, iron injection, vaccination, ear tagging) were carried out as normal. The four lightest piglets of each litter of the control group did have their tails docked and teeth shortened, next to the other management procedures. All procedures were applied on the heavier piglets of both the control and the experimental group. The lightest piglets seemed to show less pain related behavior when their teeth and tail were left intact. Moreover, mortality rate tended to be lower when compared with the lightest piglets of the control group but further research specified on neonatal mortality would be useful. The objectives of the previous two chapters, reducing painful procedures and using anesthesia during these procedures, were combined in the fifth chapter. Two experiments, using 41 litters, were carried out. In the first experiment, all procedures were performed on one moment in time in the experimental group while in the control group procedures were carried out as normal (spread over the first week of life). In the second experiment, bundling of the procedures without anesthesia was compared to bundling the procedures after the animals were anesthetized with CO 2. Piglets seemed to cope better with pain if painful interventions were not combined. Moreover, the applied CO 2 -anesthesia had facilitated the pain experience after treatment, since lying, interactive and walking behavior indicated more discomfort for the anesthetized piglets. Anesthetized piglets had only an advantage when considering nursing behavior. Although the beneficial effect of anesthesia during painful procedures is not really confirmed by the results, these results should be interpreted as a delayed pain experience for anesthetized piglets rather than an additional pain experience. As already found in chapter one CO 2 -anesthesia relieves the pain during the procedure, but not after the anesthesia has wore of. The post-operative pain may have been present in both treatments, but the absent pain experience during the procedures for piglets of the anesthetized group can still be interpreted as advantageous to piglet welfare. The results of this thesis showed that public awareness on piglet castration was still low. On the other hand, when respondents were informed, they felt the need for alternatives was high. Castration under anesthesia was the most accepted alternative but willingness to pay an extra price to improve piglet welfare was low. Reducing painful procedures (tail docking and teeth clipping) improved animal welfare and survival rate to a certain extent. Adjusting the painful procedures by using CO 2 -anesthesia and/or bundling all procedures on one moment in time did not give clear results. Bundling of the procedures without anesthesia did not seem to benefit the piglets. Anesthesia with CO 2 provides anesthesia and analgesia on the moment of the procedure, which improves animal welfare, but it wears off quickly resulting in postoperative pain. Further research could be useful to optimize the procedure, e. g. by providing additional analgesia for the postoperative pain.

40|$| {{homogenisation}} temperatures {{representative of}} both vein types, with an independent vitrinite reflectance geothermometer {{that defines the}} maximum temperature of 250 degrees&# 176;C {{at the time of}} vein formation. The results demonstrate that the bedding-normal extension veins are trapped from a low salinity (3. 5 - 8 eq. wt. % NaCl) H 2 O-NaCl fluid at near-lithostatic fluid pressures prior to inversion. After the tectonic inversion, bedding-parallel veins formed from a low salinity (4 - 7 eq. wt. % NaCl) H 2 O-NaCl fluid at lithostatic to supra-lithostatic fluid pressures during {{the early stages of the}} compressional stress regime. Subsequently, during progressive Variscan contraction both vein types were passively folded within characteristic, NW-verging, upright to overturned folds of the North Eifel. In contrast to both extensive veining events that characterise the tectonic inversion, quartz veining occurred rather occasionally during the main compression stage of orogeny. This kinematic history eventually shows a clear relationship between fluid-pressure evolution and the stress-state changes in the basin and exemplifies that (supra&# 8209;) lithostatic overpressures are easier to maintain during compressional tectonic inversion at the onset of orogeny, than during the main phase of compression. This intimate relationship during the stress-state evolution from extension to compression is illustrated by plotting the changing differential stress (sigma 1 -sigma 3) against the vertical effective stress and the fluid-pressure evolution in a 2 D brittle failure mode plot. The results show that the two vein types, which are induced at elevated to (supra&# 8209;) lithostatic fluid pressures, can only form at low differential stress closely related in time to the tectonic switch. The tectonic setting and the localised stress state in the basin are thus both crucial to determine whether the lithostatic fluid overpressure can be sustained by a rock prior to failure at depth. These 2 D brittle failure mode plots are moreover very useful to visualisethe influence of rock parameters such as the tensile strength of rock on the maximum overpressures that can be built up during the transition between two stress regimes. This regional aspect of fluid redistribution within overpressured fluid reservoirs contrasts with the more localised fluid flow along fault systems caused by fault-valving. The 3 D aspect of stress transitions during tectonic inversion of a crust is, however, much more complex than represented in a 2 D brittle failure mode plot. The tectonic switch, illustrated in these brittle failure mode plots, occurs at a specific isotropic stress state in which the three principal stresses are equal and sigma 1 - sigma 3 = 0. The chance that a stress state in the Earths crust equals an isotropic pressure state is, however, highly improbable. The 2 D stress-state evolution visualised in the brittle failure mode plots is therefore an oversimplification of the actual 3 D stress-state evolution in the Earths crust. To discuss the 3 D aspects of stress transitions and to illustrate the complexity of triaxial stress transitions during inversion of Andersonian stress regimes, possible 3 D stress-state evolutions are reconstructed based on the bedding-normal and bedding-parallel veins reflecting the early Variscan tectonic inversion. From these 3 D stress-state reconstructions is concluded that, no matter what orientation of basin geometry or shortening, a transitional wrench tectonic regime should always occur between extension and compression. This transitional stage should contribute to the permeability enhancement during tectonic inversion, although structures that are related to this transitional stage have not yet been reported in a shortened basin affected by tectonic inversion at low differential stress. Ideally, a transitional wrench tectonic regime should be implemented in brittle mode plots at the tectonic inversion. It has been concluded from this research that the naturally fractured Ardenne-Eifel basin can serve a possible analogue to the present upper crust by its regional extent of overpressuring, but more importantly by demonstrating that a tectonic inversion from extension to compression at the onset of orogeny is the crucial timing during which maximum (lithostatic) overpressures can be sustained.

The flavor of the buttercream is also not as intense. In the 1990s, a connection was discovered between trans fats (present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils) and heart disease. In response to this, most manufacturers have reduced the amount of trans fats in their products. Many countries have also enacted regulation to reduce the use of trans fats; for instance, in the United States, manufacturers must reduce trans fats to less than 0.5 grams per serving by 2018.|$|E
