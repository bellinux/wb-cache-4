30|$|The {{horseshoe}} vortex separates at {{the leading edge}} saddle point S 1 on the endwall near the leading edge (LE). The suction surface <b>side</b> <b>leg</b> (HS) and the pressure surface <b>side</b> <b>leg</b> (HP) of the {{horseshoe vortex}} system originate from the saddle point S 1. The HP moves toward the trailing edge of the adjacent blade under the cross-passage pressure gradient of the endwall. The HS intersects with the blade suction surface soon as it flows toward the surface of the blade under the cross-passage pressure gradient. As the low-momentum fluid between the HP and HS both concentrates to the endwall corner, 3 D corner separation occurs.|$|R
25|$|When {{describing}} a field setting, {{the numbers of}} fielders on the off <b>side</b> and <b>leg</b> <b>side</b> are often abbreviated into a shortened form, with the off side number quoted first. For example, a 5–4 field means 5 fielders on the off side and 4 on the <b>leg</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R

50|$|The spladle is {{a wrestling}} {{technique}} commonly {{used as a}} counter and pinning move to single leg take downs. When opponents shoot in and grab the leg the wrestler will drop their weight on the opponents head to prevent advancement of the take down, from there they may reach across the body with their arms to grab hold of the opponents far <b>side</b> <b>leg,</b> once completed they wrap the near <b>side</b> <b>leg</b> with the leg targeted for the take down and roll forward onto the mat. When on the floor {{it is important to}} control both legs of the opponent as the wrestler wants to bring the knees of his opponent as close to inline with the opponents head as possible.|$|R
5000|$|Initially a leg ride is secured. From the top, {{the same}} <b>side</b> <b>leg</b> must hook opponent's inside thigh, {{gripping}} the ankle with the attacker's foot. Next the attacker reaches across {{to grab the}} arm opposite to the <b>side</b> that the <b>leg</b> ride is on. This arm is pulled back and up to allow the attacker to slip his head under it, at or just above the elbow. (The guillotine is most easily applied if the opponent is reaching back during the leg ride.) ...|$|R

25|$|Another attacking {{placement}} on the <b>leg</b> <b>side</b> is the <b>leg</b> <b>side</b> trap, {{which involves}} placing fielders near the boundary at deep square and backward square leg and bowling bouncers {{to try to}} induce the batsman to hook {{the ball into the}} air. For slower bowlers, the leg trap fieldsmen tend to be placed within 10–15m from the bat behind square, to catch leg glances and sweeps.|$|R
50|$|The horse used in sidesaddle riding {{will have}} {{additional}} training to accustom {{it to the}} placement of the rider {{and the use of the}} whip to replace off <b>side</b> <b>leg</b> commands. The horse also may need to adapt to a different and higher hand position. However, most well-trained horses adapt to the basics fairly quickly and generally can be used for riding both sidesaddle and astride.|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental and}} numerical {{investigation of the}} transport of streamwise (passage) vortices in high-pressure axial turbines and their interaction with the downstream blade rows was performed. The results indicate large variations in the downstream flow field, notably {{the development of the}} secondary flows. The mechanism of passage vortex transport was studied in two differently configured high-pressure turbine stages. In the first configuration, the blades are radially stacked while the second configuration features three-dimensionally stacked high-pressure steam turbine blading. The stator hub passage vortex is chopped by the downstream blade row in a similar way to the wake. The bowed vortex tube near the inlet to the rotor appeared to develop two counter-rotating legs extending back to the leading edges of the adjacent blades. These were termed the suction <b>side</b> <b>leg</b> and the pressure <b>side</b> <b>leg.</b> The two legs of the incoming passage vortex then convect with the respective velocities on the blade surfaces. The results are discussed for the radially stacked turbine and the 3 -D turbine separately...|$|R

2500|$|If a bowler, {{usually a}} leg spin bowler, decides {{to attack the}} batsman's legs {{in an attempt to}} force a stumping, bowl him behind his legs, or induce a catch on the <b>leg</b> <b>side,</b> the field may stack 4–5 towards the <b>leg</b> <b>side.</b> It is unusual to see more than 5 fielders on the <b>leg</b> <b>side,</b> because of the {{restriction}} that there must be no more than two fielders placed behind square leg.|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to compare the {{steadiness}} index of spinal regions during single-leg standing in older adults with and without chronic low back pain (LBP) and to correlate measurements of steadiness index with the performance of clinical balance tests. Thirteen community-dwelling older adults (aged 55 years or above) with chronic LBP and 13 age- and gender-matched asymptomatic volunteers participated in this study. Data collection was conducted in a university research laboratory. Measurements were steadiness index of spinal regions (trunk, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, and pelvis) during single-leg standing including relative holding time (RHT) and relative standstill time (RST), and clinical balance tests (timed up and go test and 5 -repetition sit to stand test). The LBP group had a statistically significantly smaller RHT than the control group, regardless of one leg stance on the painful or non-painful sides. The RSTs on the painful <b>side</b> <b>leg</b> in the LBP group were not statistically significantly different from the average RSTs of both legs in the control group; however, the RSTs on the non-painful <b>side</b> <b>leg</b> in the LBP group were statistically significantly smaller than those in the control group for the trunk, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine. No statistically significant intra-group differences were found in the RHTs and RSTs between the painful and non-painful <b>side</b> <b>legs</b> in the LBP group. Measurements of clinical balance tests also showed insignificant weak to moderate correlations with steadiness index. In conclusion, older adults with chronic LBP demonstrated decreased spinal steadiness not only in the symptomatic lumbar spine but also in the other spinal regions within the kinetic chain of the spine. When treating older adults with chronic LBP, clinicians may also need to examine their balance performance and spinal steadiness during balance challenging tests...|$|R
