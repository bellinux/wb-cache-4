25|$|Yup'ik women roles {{included}} child rearing, {{food preparation}} and sewing. Skin sewing is artistic {{arena in which}} Yup'ik women and a few younger men excel. Everyday functional items like skin mittens, mukluks, and jackets are commonly made today, but the elegant fancy parkas of traditional times are now rare. The proper sewing of skins requires considerable and varied traditional knowledge and an intact extended family whose members help in hunting gathering, and processing the various components in addition to sewing. Women's tools include ulu, scraper, <b>scraping</b> <b>board,</b> needle, needle case, thimble, and pattern. There are many regional differences {{in the design and}} function of these tools.|$|R

These are intended primarily {{for the use of}} <b>scraping</b> cutting <b>boards</b> and bowls rather than working dough. These uses have introduced further variants of the name, including terms such as bowl scraper or chopper, scooper, scraper.|$|R

His {{analysis of the data}} showed interesting patterns in the marking system, suggesting that the marks were rounded off with no student getting an odd numbered mark as the result of an examination. Further analysis of the data however showed that this was purely due to the marking scheme where the maximum mark for most questions was even numbered and that the cause for any alarm or suspicion was unfounded.|$|R

It is probable that, {{as soon as the}} boats got back, Carthew sent his skipper or mate off with a couple of the men to Port au Prince, to lay a complaint for piracy against me. But, even if they got horses, it would take them a couple of days to get there; that is, if they are not much better riders than the majority of sailors are. Then it is likely that there would be some time lost in formalities, and even if there was a Government steamer lying in the port, it would take her {{a long time to get}} up steam. Moreover, I am by no means sure that even Carthew would venture on such an impudent thing as that. It is certain that we should get into a bad <b>scrape</b> for <b>boarding</b> and burning a vessel in Haytian waters, but that is all the harm he could do us. The British Consul would certainly be more likely to believe the story of the owner of a Royal Squadron yacht, backed by that of her captain, mates and crew, and by Miss Greendale and her maid; than the tale of the owner of a vessel that could give no satisfactory explanation for being here. Besides, he will know that before a steamer could start in chase we should be certainly two, or perhaps three, days away, and whether we should make for Jamaica or Bermuda, or round the northwestern point of the bay, and then for England, he could have no clue whatever." ...|$|R
5000|$|Let {{the cream}} {{be at the}} {{temperature}} of 55° to 60°, by a Fahrenheit thermometer; this is very important. If the weather be cold put boiling water into the churn {{for half an hour}} before you want to use it; when that is poured off strain in the cream through a butter cloth. When the butter is coming, which is easily ascertained by the sound, take off the lid, and with a small, flat <b>board</b> <b>scrape</b> down the sides of the churn, and do the same to the lid: this prevents waste. When the butter is come the butter-milk is to be poured off and spring water put into the churn, and turned for two or three minutes; this is to be then poured away and fresh added, and again the handle turned for a minute or two. Should there be the least milkiness when this is poured from the churn, more must be put in.The butter is then to be placed on a board or marble slab and salted to taste; then with a cream cloth, wrung out in spring water, press all the moisture from it. When dry and firm make it up into rolls with flat boards. The whole process should be completed in three-quarters of an hour. In hot weather pains must be taken to keep the cream from reaching too high a heat. If the dairy be not cool enough, keep the cream-pot in the coldest water you can get; make the butter early in the morning, and place cold water in the churn for a while before it is used.|$|R
60|$|To be brief, he accosted one of {{the many}} surly overseers, or taskmasters of the yard, who, with no few pompous airs, finally engaged him at six shillings a week, almost {{equivalent}} to a dollar and a half. He was appointed to {{one of the}} mills for grinding up the ingredients. This mill stood in the open air. It was of a rude, primitive, Eastern aspect, consisting of a sort of hopper, emptying into a barrel-shaped receptacle. In the barrel was a clumsy machine turned round at its axis by a great bent beam, like a well-sweep, only it was horizontal; to this beam, at its outer end, a spavined old horse was attached. The muddy mixture was shovelled into the hopper by spavined-looking old men, while, trudging wearily round and round, the spavined old horse ground it all up till it slowly squashed out {{at the bottom of the}} barrel, in a doughy compound, all ready for the moulds. Where the dough squeezed out of the barrel a pit was sunken, so as to bring the moulder here stationed down to a level with the trough, into which the dough fell. Israel was assigned to this pit. Men came to him continually, reaching down rude wooden trays, divided into compartments, each of the size and shape of a brick. With a flat sort of big ladle, Israel slapped the dough into the trays from the trough; then, with a bit of smooth <b>board,</b> <b>scraped</b> the top even, and handed it up. Half buried there in the pit, all the time handing those desolate trays, poor Israel seemed some gravedigger, or churchyard man, tucking away dead little innocents in their coffins on one side, and cunningly disinterring them again to resurrectionists stationed on the other.|$|R
40|$|Oral history {{interview}} with Colin Pike, conducted by Dale Jarvis and Terra Barrett, {{with his son}} Wayne Pike present. Colin talks about growing up, the different jobs he had, including working on the railway, as a logger, and with Newfoundland Power as a lineman. He also talks about his father, including his service during the First World War, and {{his life as a}} trapper. Recorded at the office of the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, 1 Springdale Street, St. John's. 0 : 00 Colin Pike was born in Charleston, NL on January 31 st, 1929; 0 : 30 Colin names his parents, Alfred and Aurora Pike. Mother’s maiden name was Quinton – possibly a distant relative to the Red Cliff Quintons. The Pikes came from Carbonear. Colin is related to the pirate. 01 : 20 Colin’s grandfather came to Jamestown from Carbonear. His father moved to Charleston after he got married. 01 : 38 Colin comes from a family of 10 children. Remembers playing games as a child – games that they would make up. Also remembers swimming in a pool in the brook near the harbour – swimming early in the season (May). Would make things to pass the time. They would go sliding in the winter time. 03 : 00 Colin describes what school was like. He was late going to school – attended the Anglican school because that was all that was available. Went there for a couple of years, around 1938 - 1939. Described arguments and “scattered fights” between the United and Anglican kids (because Anglicans went to school and the United kids didn’t). Colin’s parents took them out of school after {{it got to the point}} that the kids no longer wanted to go. Finally, the minister at the time wanted to have a place for the children to go to school that wasn’t the Anglican school. Colin’s grandmother was living alone and had a house with a living room that wasn’t used, so she offered up her living room to be used as a classroom. The minister found a teacher and the children attended school in Colin’s grandmother’s living room. Doesn’t remember the name of the minister, but the teacher was Mary (he thinks) Janes from Grates Cove. There were 12 - 15 students. Everyone had to provide their own seat and desk. Colin made his own desk, with no help from anyone. By the time the school year ended in June, there was a school being constructed for the United children (1942). 1943 September, the new school was opened, even though the building wasn’t finished. Teacher was Rina King from Random Island. Colin finished school that year, in 1944. 06 : 07 After he finished school, Colin went to work. He was 16 years old, and went to work in the lumber woods (AND Company and Price? Bowaters?). Worked in a lumber camp in the forest near Terra Nova, cutting wood. Was there for a month and went home. Later that year he went to another lumber camp in Indian Bay. Part of the time he was there, he worked in the cookhouse as a “cookie”, helping the cook, peeling potatoes, etc. 07 : 40 Colin’s son, Wayne, reminds his father about a story of a plane crash he mentioned that morning. Colin doesn’t remember where he was, but he remembers hearing about when the Sabena Airliner crashed in Gander Lake. References cemetery where the victims were buried. 08 : 21 Later that year (1946) Colin and his brother and another gentleman decided to go to another lumber camp. His brother had been working on the military base in Stephenville (Harman Field?), and Colin really wanted to work there, but since everyone was going into the woods he went with them. Camp was near Badger. Were late getting to Badger because a train derailed ahead of them. They finally got to Badger and the next day went into the woods. 09 : 16 Colin didn’t want to go into the woods, he wanted to go to Stephenville. After a day in the woods it started to rain, so everyone went back to camp. Colin intent on not staying. He took his axe and his saw and walked them out of the camp, hiding them under a tree in case he needed them. Rain stopped and sun came out in afternoon, so Colin’s brother and friends went back into the woods. Colin went and got his saw, turned it in, jumped on the truck and left camp to head for Harman Field. 10 : 13 Colin took the train from Badger to Stephenville. Describes arriving and being shocked at the crowd of people there. Took a taxi onto the base. Ran into his second cousin (he’d known he was there). His cousin directed him to the employment office. Next day, he was hired on as a kitchen helped in the mess hall. September 1946. He was there until Christmas, and then he went home. 11 : 17 It was the early days, but Colin says they were already using the base to service planes, etc. He remembers servicemen being at the base, and serving them in the mess hall. Says they served 2000 men every morning for breakfast. Worked night shift for a little while – would go to work at midnight and spend the night cracking eggs for breakfast. 12 : 08 Colin lived in the dormitory on the base while he worked there. Later he went back to the base, working for a contractor, and had to find his own accommodation off the base. Colin, his brother, and another man lived in a canvas tent on someone’s lawn for three months. That was in 1948. 12 : 42 He was working as a maintenance man on the base, cleaning, sweeping, etc. A building was being renovated so they would pick up <b>boards,</b> <b>scrape</b> paint off windows with razors. Thinks they were finishing the dormitories then. He enjoyed being in Stephenville, being away from home, considered it an adventure. When payday came, they were paid in American dollars (because it was an US base), in cash. Canadian cash, but they were rated in American dollars. Cash in an envelope. 14 : 33 Worked as a postmaster in the early 50 s. When he left Stephenville, he thinks he went home, and worked as a fisherman for a bit. Remembers whole family going handlining in one boat. Father was a fisherman, but not very serious, used to do hand-lining. One summer they fished quite a bit in the late 40 s. 15 : 27 Colin’s son, Wayne, clarifies that it was June 1948 when Colin went to Stephenville the second time with “Hugh and Bert”. June 22. He made 63 cents an hour in Stephenville. Pay in the lumber woods depended on how much wood you cut. When he was a “cookie” he got an hourly pay. 16 : 49 Describes how he became postmaster in the post office in Charleston, what he did. Was there for a few years. Mail would arrive by train from Clarenville; sometimes three times a week, sometimes every day. Someone would pick the mail up from the train and bring it to Colin at the post office. Then he would sort it. 1952 - 1957 he worked at the post office. 18 : 29 Colin describes how he learned to wire houses. Bought a book from a department store catalogue and learned from that. Wired his own house first, then wired some others. Kept doing it until you needed a permit and to have it inspected, then he stopped. He wired Wayne’s house in Gander in 1986 and it was the only house on the street that passed inspection the first time. 20 : 25 Colin talks about building his own house. It was his first house in Charleston. He’d never built a house before. Learned how to do carpenter work and just did it. Didn’t have any wiring; there was no power at the time. Just used kerosene lanterns. Talks about Wayne blowing out the lamplight before going to bed when he was young. 21 : 15 Colin talks about how he met his wife. They were second-cousins, living in the same community. It was a small community, not very many people lived there. They stayed in Charleston until he went to work with the Newfoundland Power Commission as a lineman. 22 : 06 Went to trade school in Seal Cove to do a lineman course. Was placed with a crew in Grand Falls after he finished. Started school in Seal Cove in November 1965. Finished in April (1966), then was on contract in Swift Current for 6 months. There until October, and then he went to Grand Falls in October 1966. 23 : 45 Colin talks about working for the railway. Seasonal with the maintenance gangs. One summer out of Gaff Topsails. Wasn’t much to do in the evenings after work, would go berry picking. Maintenance meant laying new rails to replace ones that were worn, heavier rails, ballast replacement. Mostly rails. Talks about replacing the rails between Millertown Junction and Gaff Topsails with a heavier rail over the course of one summer. 40 - 50 men on a maintenance crew, covering half a mile. Men lifting rails. Most Colin did was drive spikes. Talks about how that happened. They lived in a boarding car, and had a meal car for meals. Food was good. Really good cooks. 26 : 49 Colin says he enjoyed working for Hydro as a lineman. Worked for them from 1965 - 1989, but doing different things. When he finished in 1989 he was working in the maintenance shop in Bishop’s Falls, testing safety equipment like heaving rubber gloves used by linemen. Testing the sticks for handling high lines. That was the last job he held with Hydro. 28 : 04 Colin still lives in Charleston. Lived in Grand Falls until 3 years after he retired. They’d maintained a house in Charleston where they would go on holiday. They moved back in 1993. In 2001 his wife passed away. He’s lived there on his own ever since. Called the death of his wife “end of an era”. Describes going camping with his wife when they were married. He sold the motor home after she died. 30 : 28 Colin describes how the town has changed since he was a boy. They have electricity now, paved roads, but it’s still the same place, you know everyone the same as you always did. 30 : 55 Colin describes what Christmases were like when he was a boy. Says they were an exciting time in his life. Talks about the busyness of the season. Christmas night you would hang up your stocking and go to bed, but not go to sleep. At first light, you would be up and down the stairs with one sock on (because the other was hanging on the wall). Says they’d have something special, like sheep or cow or something|$|R
