50|$|Fullarton was {{challenging}} a Central Arbitration Committee {{decision for}} {{recognition of the}} Iron and Steel Trades Confederation. Fullarton had announced redundancies in October and November 2000 after an application from the ISTC for recognition. In December 2000 the ISTC applied to the Central Arbitration Committee for recognition in respect of a bargaining unit under Schedule A1 paragraph 22. CAC made a panel with a case manager, but no agreement was reached by February 2001 so the CAC decided the bargaining unit was at the relevant plant as the union proposed. Comparing the manager and the union lists, the case manager decided 49.3% of people at work were union members. The union requested reconsideration, {{and then it was}} 51.3%, so the CAC decided a ballot would not be held. Fullarton argued the case manager’s decision was ultra vires, because the CAC ought to take the decision, that it was unfair anyway because 15 new members were found and Fullarton had no way of seeing how the conclusion was reached, that even then the decision was irrational because <b>paragraph</b> <b>22(4)</b> conditions were not given proper weight, nor was the marginal nature of the decision.|$|R

40|$|The blacklisting {{of trade}} union members and activists during the {{recruitment}} process has an ignoble {{history in the}} UK. This practice was particularly widespread in the construction and financial industries during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Organisations like the Economic League (now defunct) established a database of union and political activists that could be accessed by employers in order to check the trade union affiliations and political opinions of job applicants. In organisations where this vetting process took place, union members and activists were often denied employment or suffered discrimination at the workplace. The practice of blacklisting in the UK {{was the subject of}} a complaint by the Trade Union Congress to the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1991 and was subsequently condemned by the supervisory institutions of the ILO as acts of anti-union discrimination in violation of Article 1 of ILO Convention No 98 on the right to organise in trade unions. The Freedom of Association Committee in a number of reports asserted that the blacklisting of trade union officials or members constituted a serious threat to the free exercise of trade union rights guaranteed by the ILO conventions and that it is incumbent on governments to take stringent measures to combat such practices (see the 283 rd Report, Case No 1618, paragraphs 422 – 4; 287 th Report, Case No 1618, <b>paragraphs</b> <b>224</b> – 67; and 297 th Report Case No 1618, paragraph 22) ...|$|R
