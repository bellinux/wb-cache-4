5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds {{have a high}} aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E

First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome.

Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared {{up to the first}} balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored.

5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a fair trial, and under what circumstances indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
