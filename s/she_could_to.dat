25|$|Another {{theme is}} the extreme legalism of the Puritans and how Hester {{chooses not to}} conform to their rules and beliefs. Hester was {{rejected}} by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> help the sick and the poor. Because of the social shunning, she spent her life mostly in solitude, and wouldn't go to church.|$|E
25|$|She {{worked for}} the relief of the famine-stricken Irish peasants during the Irish Potato Famine. She wrote Orlandino {{for the benefit of}} the Relieve Fund. Her letters to the Quaker Relief Committee provide a vivid account of the desperate plight facing the tenants in Edgeworthstown, the extreme {{conditions}} under which they lived, and the struggle to obtain whatever aid and assistance <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> alleviate their plight. Through her efforts she received gifts for the poor from America.|$|E
25|$|DeLorean's mother, Kathryn, was an Austrian {{immigrant}} from Austria-Hungary. She was employed at the Carboloy Products Division of General Electric {{throughout much of}} DeLorean's early life. She took work where ever <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> supplement the family's income.

25|$|Henrietta Maria {{spent the}} autumn and winter of 1643 in Oxford with Charles, where she attempted, as best <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} the pleasant court life {{that they had}} enjoyed before the war. The Queen lived in the Warden's lodgings in Merton College, adorned with the royal furniture which had been brought up from London. The Queen's usual companions were present: Denbigh, Davenant, her dwarves; her rooms were overrun by dogs, including Mitte. The atmosphere in Oxford {{was a combination of}} a fortified city and a royal court, and Henrietta Maria was frequently stressed with worry.|$|E
25|$|By 1086, Alan IV {{was forced}} to abandon his duchy after an {{invasion}} launched by William I of England. However, a peace settlement was reached that same year and in the negotiations that followed Alan IV was forced into marriage with King William I's second daughter Constance of England. The marriage ceremonies may {{have taken place in}} Bayeux in Normandy. William of Malmesbury wrote that Constance was unpopular at the Breton court because of her 'sever and conservative' manner. William of Malmesbury also alleged that Alan IV had Constance poisoned to death, but this remained unverified However, Orderic Vitalis wrote that as duchess, Constance did all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> further the welfare of the Bretons, who grieved deeply at her death in 1090.|$|E
25|$|In June, {{after the}} last of the {{primaries}} had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States. For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do everything <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> help him get elected.|$|E

25|$|According to Sigmund Freud, {{being unable}} to accept the illness of her child, Victoria ended up {{distancing}} herself from her first-born, which made {{a great impact on}} the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the Crown Princess was very affectionate with her children. According to him, Vicky wanted her children to be like the idealised figure of her own father and tried, as best <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>to</b> follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could grow up in an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria's influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and the Crown Princess feared that such education would undermine their values.|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} leave Hollyoaks in early 2011, as {{she felt she had}} given all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> the role. This {{prompted}} the producers to devise a memorable exit storyline for Rae. Barlow was informed of their plans in March 2011, but her exit, and details of the storyline, were concealed from viewers. Speculation arose that Rae would become the next victim of serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle); Barlow tried to discredit these rumours, and denied that she was leaving Hollyoaks as she wanted viewers to be [...] "surprised and shocked" [...] by her exit.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Price Peterson, {{writing for}} TV.com, gave a more mixed review, heavily criticizing the {{resolution}} to Veronica's rape case. While calling it an [...] "entertaining episode", {{he said that}} it had an [...] "appalling message." [...] He explained by writing that [...] "egardless of Duncan having been drugged, Veronica could not give consent to him any more than <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> the dudes who were playing puppet-girl with her during the party. Regardless of the retroactive comfort of knowing that she'd lost her virginity to someone she liked, Veronica did not remember it...That kind of psychological trauma goes away immediately?" [...] Kimberly Roots of TV Line called the episode [...] "cathartic" [...] and that [...] "we get a huge reveal from Duncan, some unintentionally very public LoVe PDA and a say-it-ain’t-so-Logan! cliffhanger that swings us right into the season finale." ...|$|E

500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the flat design and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland {{can only be described as}} commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.|$|E
500|$|James Boomgard, {{regional}} director for Development Alternatives Inc. (the company employing Norgrove {{when she was}} kidnapped), released a statement: [...] "We are saddened beyond words {{by the death of}} a wonderful woman whose sole purpose in Afghanistan was to do good – to help the Afghan people achieve a measure of prosperity and stability in their everyday lives as they set about rebuilding their country". United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Robert Watkins praised Norgrove: [...] "She was a true advocate for the people of Afghanistan and was dedicated to bringing improvements to their lives", and [...] "her spirit and compassion will be greatly missed". First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said: [...] "Ms Norgrove was a dedicated aid worker who was doing everything <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> help people in Afghanistan—hopefully that legacy of service in a humanitarian cause can be of some comfort to her loved ones in their time of grief".|$|E
500|$|George {{had been}} raised under strict conditions, which he had rebelled against. [...] Despite this, he {{attempted}} to put his daughter, who had {{the appearance of a}} grown woman at age 15, under even stricter conditions. [...] He gave her a clothing allowance insufficient for an adult princess, and insisted that if she attended the opera, she was to sit {{in the rear of the}} box and leave before the end. [...] With the Prince Regent busy with affairs of state, Charlotte was required to spend most of her time at Windsor with her maiden aunts. [...] Bored, she soon became infatuated with her first cousin, George FitzClarence, illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence. [...] FitzClarence was, shortly thereafter, called to Brighton to join his regiment, and Charlotte's gaze fell on Lieutenant Charles Hesse of the Light Dragoons, reputedly the illegitimate son of Charlotte's uncle, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. [...] Hesse and Charlotte had a number of clandestine meetings. [...] Lady de Clifford feared the Prince Regent's rage should they be found out, but Princess Caroline was delighted by her daughter's passion. She did everything that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> encourage the relationship, even allowing them time alone in a room in her apartments. [...] These meetings ended when Hesse left to join the British forces in Spain. Most of the Royal Family, except the Prince Regent, were aware of these meetings, but did nothing to interfere, disapproving of the way George was treating his daughter.|$|E

Together, they adopted a daughter, Amy Fishman (born 1953). They divorced three years later.

2500|$|Travelling to the cape, a man fell {{overboard}} in high seas. Tryon had to {{make the}} difficult decision whether to try to rescue him, because any small boat risked sinking, taking her crew down also. However, the man was seen to be swimming strongly, so the ship was halted and a boat launched to rescue him. The boat got away well, though was sucked back under the stern of the ship before breaking free. The ship then had to manoeuvre under sail, tacking as best <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> follow the boat while keeping it on the safe side for recovery. [...] All went well, and Tryon received congratulations from the other captains for his skill in carrying out the rescue.|$|E
2500|$|In fact, she had by now begun {{appearing}} in public almost exclusively as a male. [...] She began {{to refer to}} herself as Mr. Charles Brown and {{although there is no}} way of telling why she chose the name Brown, there is a possibility that it was chosen because of her elder sister, Catherine Brown. She boasted further that a young heiress fell in love with her, believing her to really be a man, and proposed marriage. [...] This resulted, not surprisingly, in disappointment for both Charke and the hopeful heiress. Although the identity of the young woman remains [...] "shadowy", many historians believe that she is indeed [...] "Mrs. Brown". [...] Unable to earn a living in the sanctioned theatres, Charlotte began to work any job <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> support herself and Catherine, but she was always attracted to jobs she could perform as a man. [...] Therefore, she was a valet to Richard Annesley, 6th Earl of Anglesey, and then even took up as a sausage maker. [...] Anglesey was famous as a bigamist and libertine, and lived with a paramour during Charlotte's employ. Charlotte claimed that when Anglesey was not entertaining guests, the trio would dine together as friendly equals. As a valet's service would indeed be personal, normally including dressing one's master for the day, the entire arrangement would have been quite unusual. [...] (Anglesey was soon a central party to an infamous scandal, being dispossessed of his lands—but allowed to continue using his title—after a court ruled that he had sold his young kinsman, James Annesley, who had a better claim to the inheritance, into slavery.) ...|$|E
