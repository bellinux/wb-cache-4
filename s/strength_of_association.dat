2500|$|Gene {{networks}} {{can also}} be constructed without formulating an explicit causal model. This {{is often the case}} when assembling networks from large expression data sets. Covariation and correlation of expression is computed across a large sample of cases and measurements (often transcriptome or proteome data). The source of variation can be either experimental or natural (observational). There are several ways to construct gene expression networks, but one common approach is to compute a matrix of all pair-wise correlations of expression across conditions, time points, or individuals and convert the matrix (after thresholding at some cut-off value) into a graphical representation in which nodes represent genes, transcripts, or proteins and edges connecting these nodes represent the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> (see [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|A {{standard}} model of memory that employs association {{in this manner}} is the Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model. Though SAM was originally designed to model episodic memory, its mechanisms are sufficient to support some semantic memory representations, as well. The SAM model contains a short- term store (STS) and long term store (LTS), where STS is a briefly activated subset of {{the information in the}} LTS. [...] The STS has limited capacity and affects the retrieval process by limiting the amount of information that can be sampled and limiting the time the sampled subset is in an active mode. [...] The retrieval process in LTS is cue dependent and probabilistic, meaning that a cue initiates the retrieval process and the selected information from memory is random. [...] The probability of being sampled is dependent on the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> between the cue and the item being retrieved, with stronger associations being sampled and finally one is chosen. [...] The buffer size is defined as r, and not a fixed number, and as items are rehearsed in the buffer the associative strengths grow linearly {{as a function of the}} total time inside the buffer. In SAM, when any two items simultaneously occupy a working memory buffer, the strength of their association is incremented. Thus, items that co-occur more often are more strongly associated. Items in SAM are also associated with a specific context, where the strength of that association determined by how long each item is present in a given context. In SAM, then, memories consist of a set of associations between items in memory and between items and contexts. The presence of a set of items and/or a context is more likely to evoke, then, some subset of the items in memory. The degree to which items evoke one another—either by virtue of their shared context or their co-occurrence—is an indication of the items' semantic relatedness.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Evidence on the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>association</b> between low SES {{and chronic}} kidney disease (CKD; {{measured}} by low estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], high albuminuria, low eGFR/high albuminuria, and renal failure) is scattered and sometimes conflicting. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to summarize the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>associations</b> between SES and CKD and identify study-level characteristics related to this association. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Studies published through January 2013 in MEDLINE and Embase were searched. From 35 studies that met the inclusion criteria, association estimates were pooled per CKD measure in the meta-analysis (performed between 2013 and 2014). Meta-regression {{analysis was used to}} identify study-level characteristics related to the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the SES-CKD <b>association.</b> EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Low SES was associated with low eGFR (OR= 1. 41, 95 % CI= 1. 21, 1. 62), high albuminuria (OR= 1. 52, 95 % CI= 1. 22, 1. 82), low eGFR/high albuminuria (OR= 1. 38, 95 % CI= 1. 03, 1. 74), and renal failure (OR= 1. 55, 95 % CI= 1. 40, 1. 71). Differences in SES measures across studies were not related to the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> between low SES and any of the CKD measures (low GFR, p= 0. 63; high albuminuria, p= 0. 29; low eGFR/high albuminuria, p= 0. 54; renal failure, p= 0. 31). Variations in the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> were related to the level of covariate adjustment for low eGFR (p< 0. 001) and high albuminuria (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic disparities in CKD were fairly strong, irrespective of how SES was measured. Variations in the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>associations</b> were related to the level of covariate adjustment, particularly for low eGFR and high albuminuria...|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this review}} was to {{identify}} and evaluate the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> <b>of</b> the key parental factors measured in studies examining early childhood physical activity (PA). A systematic review of the literature, using databases PsychINFO, Medline, Academic Search Complete, PSYCHinfo, and CINHAL, published between January 1986 and March 2011 was conducted; 20 papers were relevant for the current review. While 12 parenting variables were identified, only 5 of these had been investigated sufficiently to provide conclusive findings. There were inconsistencies in the findings involving the social learning variable parental enjoyment and variables involving parental behaviours such as maternal depression and self-efficacy, and rules for sedentary behaviour, and parental perceptions, which included perceived importance of PA, fear of safety, and perception of child’s motor competence. Given these inconsistencies, a metaanalysis was conducted {{to determine whether the}} method of measuring PA (objective or subjective) influenced the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> between the parental factors and young children’s PA. There was no difference in the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> in the studies that used objective or subjective measurement (via parent self-report). Further investigation is needed to clarify and understand the specific parental influences and behaviours that are associated with PA in young children. In particular, longitudinal research is needed to better understand how parental influences and PA levels of children during the formative preschool and early elementary school years are associated. <br /...|$|R

50|$|In many FE {{investigations}} {{there is}} no need for a causal plausibility analysis if a general causal relationship is well established. In large part, plausibility of a relationship is entertained once implausibility has been rejected. The two remaining Hill criteria are temporality and <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>association.</b> While both criteria have utility in assessing specific causation, temporality is the feature of an association that must be present, at least with regard to sequence (i.e., the exposure must precede the outcome), in order to consider a relationship causal. Temporal proximity can also be useful in some specific causation evaluations, as the closer the investigated exposure and the outcome are in time the less opportunity there is for an intervening cause to act. Another feature of temporality that may have a role in a specific causation evaluation is latency. An outcome may occur too soon or too long after an exposure to be considered causally related. As an example, some food borne illnesses must incubate for hours or days after ingestion, and thus an illness that begins directly following a meal, and which is later found to be caused by a food borne microorganism that requires >12 h incubation, was not caused by the investigated meal, even if an investigation were to reveal the microorganism in the ingested food. <b>Strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> is the criterion that is used in general causation to assess the impact of the exposure on the population, and is often quantified in terms of RR. In a specific causation evaluation the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome is quantified by the CRR, as described above.|$|E

The study (a) assesses and compares overall fit of the three models for Americans and Chinese, (b) examines how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control together predicted behavioral intentions of the three support provision behaviors for both Americans and Chinese, and (c) compares how Americans and Chinese were similar and different with regard to ratings of the TPB key components (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions) and <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> between the three predictors (attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control) and intentions. ^ 289 American college students and 227 Chinese college students participated in this research. Data were collected from self-reported questionnaires. Data analyses were conducted by employing various techniques, such as structural equation modeling, mix-model ANOVAs, and t-tests.

Methods Time history of the cervical and thoracic acceleration/deceleration and EMG activity was acquired in thirty-four subjects with chronic neck pain and thirty-four age- and gender-matched asymptomatic subjects during active neck movements. The <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the <b>association</b> between the electromyographic activity of spinal muscles and the cervical and thoracic acceleration/deceleration was determined using cross-correlation method.

Significant negative correlations were found between the functional disability level and the <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> this defined <b>association</b> in the symptomatic group. Interpretation The compromised capability of the spinal muscles to produce acceleration/deceleration in the neck pain group may imply an impaired electromechanical coupling of these spinal muscles when performing neck movements.
