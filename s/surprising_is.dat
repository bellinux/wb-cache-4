5|$|What {{is perhaps}} more <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> that Prince of Wales {{returned}} to British ownership. There is an entry {{for her in}} the supplemental (i.e., late addition) pages for the 1797 volume. One suspects that the Royal Navy recaptured her in the West Indies, but so far evidence for the conjecture is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The salvage {{pathways}} used in microorganisms {{differ from}} those of mammals. Some pathogens, such as the yeast Candida glabrata and the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae are NAD auxotrophs– they cannot synthesize NAD– but possess salvage pathways and thus are dependent on external sources of NAD or its precursors. precursors in Candida glabrata | journal = Mol.

25|$|Ashokavadana– The Aśokāvadāna is a 2nd-century CE text {{related to}} the legend of Ashoka. The legend was {{translated}} into Chinese by Fa Hien in 300 CE. It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India. The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring {{the relationship between the}} king and the community of monks (the Sangha) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the laity (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits. The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion {{has nothing to do with}} the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty. Equally <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion. The legend of Veetashoka provides insights into Ashoka’s character that are not available in the widely known Pali records.|$|E
50|$|What <b>was</b> {{even more}} <b>surprising</b> <b>was</b> {{the two sides}} ear-marked for closure. Caledonia Reds were the current Scottish Inter-District Championship holders. Border Reivers were based in Scotland's rugby heartland.|$|R

25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> that it {{is not one of the}} first things that comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

Nevertheless, Morris said that Woodruff has [...] "a great turn of phrase and a rather wicked sense of humour". Morris concluded that [...] "What is <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> that he was not successful in producing many surgeons in his own mould, despite the intellectual talent that was entering surgery and especially transplantation in the 1960s. However, his influence in transplantation at all levels was enormous." ...|$|E
50|$|With only 20 grid spots {{available}} on the tight Monaco circuit, qualifying always threw up a few surprises and 1984 was no different. The most <b>surprising</b> <b>were</b> the turbo cars of Eddie Cheever (Alfa Romeo) and Thierry Boutsen (Arrows-BMW) both failing to qualify.|$|R

50|$|Thompson did {{not expect}} to sell many copies of Front Parlour Ballads.

500|$|Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post, {{placed it}} at number 32 {{on his list}} [...] "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles". He wrote: [...] "What's <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> that this heartfelt ballad's release was {{sandwiched}} between 'Justify My Love' and 'Erotica', which corroborates the many checkered crowns that Madonna can wear". Similarly, AllMusic's Jose F. Promis called it [...] "a quiet predecessor to her most notorious album Erotica". Promis also believed that the single version of the song was worth of collecting since it was not released in CD version in the United States. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, called {{it one of the}} singer's [...] "soundtrack gems". Writing for the Deseret News, Chris Hicks called the song [...] "a lovely change-of-pace number" [...] for Madonna.|$|E
500|$|However, Matthew Horton of BBC Online viewed [...] "Party" [...] {{as one of}} the [...] "less {{successful}} interruptions" [...] on 4. Similarly, Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes {{gave the}} song a mixed review, writing: [...] " [...] the less said about the phrase 'swag goo' the better; 'Party', the song on which those unfortunate words appear — Kanye West providing that unfortunate pun — is otherwise wonderful, but yet some errors are too grievous to forgive." [...] Andy Kellman from Allmusic stated, [...] " [...] What's most <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> that a song titled 'Party' quickly settles into a low-watt groove and remains there." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com added, [...] "Kanye West and Andre 3000 provide interesting vocal color for 'Party' but the song itself is just a variant on the 'this is my night to be bad' theme." [...] A negative review came from Al Shipley of The Village Voice who wrote that [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] were [...] "among the album's worst and most unrepresentative songs".|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{said that}} their first album [...] "is a {{compendium}} of slick secondhand urban pop encompassing [...] G-funk synths on 'Say You'll Be There' [...] and Babyface's guitar and strings balladry on '2 Become 1'". Larry Flick of Billboard magazine compared it to [...] "Wannabe" [...] saying that it [...] "is as immediately infectious, though it's not nearly as silly and novelty-driven". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a bid for street cred", while David Browne from the same magazine commented about the confusing lyrics, [...] "let's see: She wants to be friends, he wants more, and yet she croons, 'I'm giving you everything/All that joy can bring'? She's as confused as I am. Better to revel in the delectably frothy girl-group melody". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, {{in a review of}} their debut album Spice, said that [...] "what is <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> how the sultry soul of 'Say You'll Be There' {{is more than just a}} guilty pleasure". In a review of the group's 2007 compilation album Greatest Hits, NME said that it is a [...] "fine song in any age".|$|E
50|$|Few {{students}} enrolled in secondary school, in part because most secondary institutions were private and too expensive for the average family. By these standards, the 8% of the college-age population enrolled in Nicaraguan universities seemed relatively high. Less <b>surprising</b> <b>was</b> that upper-class families typically sent their children abroad for higher education.|$|R
50|$|Using the new dam for {{hydroelectric}} power {{should not have}} been a surprise considering that that was {{the primary purpose of the}} original dam.

500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today showed {{appreciation}} for [...] "I Was Here": [...] "At 29, the still-in-her-prime Beyoncé {{seems a little}} young to be worrying about her legacy, as she does on the Warren power ballad I Was Here. But she puts so much feeling into it that it winds up being the album's most moving song." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice." [...] She concluded that [...] "I Was Here" [...] ends up being a [...] "standout song on the album [...] we won't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not a surprise that 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> just how good it is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E

50|$|Less <b>surprising</b> <b>was</b> the Republican {{victory in}} the other Tennessee Senate contest.

The Republican nominee, actor and attorney Fred Thompson, defeated six-term Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper in an overwhelming landslide.|$|R

2500|$|The {{leaders of}} Hartington {{would have been}} {{familiar}} with these and other Steele-designed Prairie School style buildings; {{there would be no}} surprise in what they were getting.

There was considerable public outcry against the Woodbury County Courthouse just five years earlier (including demands from one group for “a courthouse of ordinary and usual design”), but no record of dissent in Hartington. This design “as compared to other known civic buildings in the surrounding counties, stands as a progressive building in an otherwise conservative community.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Such was {{the quality}} of Christie's work on this book that many {{compared}} it to her novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926). For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the Toronto Daily Star of 16 March 1940 said, [...] "Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, {{but no one can}} touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending.

2500|$|The song {{is in the}} key of G {{major and}} lyrically opens two beats early with [...] "Oh yeah, I'll tell you something" [...] with a D-B, B-D melody note drop and rise over a I (G) chord. Controversy exists over the {{landmark}} chord that Lennon stated McCartney hit on the piano while they were composing the song. Marshall considers it is the minor vi (Em) chord (the third chord in the I-V7-vi (G-D7-Em) progression). Everett is of the same opinion. Pedler claims, however, that more <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> the melody note drop from B to F# against a III7 (B7) chord on [...] "understand". Music theorists are divided over whether this chord is a iii (Bm), a B major, or a B7 or even a B5 power chord with no major or minor defining third.|$|E

Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that {{he just wants to}} [...] "yelp about wicked things" [...] that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother Freyr, when all of the other laughing gods surprised her, Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested.

2500|$|... "It is {{difficult}} to believe that until approximately year 1900 it was not known that neurons are the basic units of the brain (Santiago Ramón y Cajal). Equally <b>surprising</b> <b>is</b> the fact that the concept of chemical transmission in the brain was not known until around 1930 (Henry Hallett Dale) and (Otto Loewi). We began to understand the basic electrical phenomenon that neurons use in order to communicate among themselves, the action potential, in the 1950s (Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley and John Eccles). It was in the 1960s that we became aware of how basic neuronal networks code stimuli and thus basic concepts are possible (David H. Hubel, and Torsten Wiesel). The molecular revolution swept across US universities in the 1980s. It was in the 1990s that molecular mechanisms of behavioral phenomena became widely known (Eric Richard Kandel)." [...] A microscopic examination shows that nerves consist primarily of axons, along with different membranes that wrap around them and segregate them into fascicles. The neurons that give rise to nerves do not lie entirely within the nerves themselves—their cell bodies reside within the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral ganglia.|$|E
