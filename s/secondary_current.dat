25|$|However, in {{the typical}} circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action {{prevents}} high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its <b>secondary</b> <b>current</b> by means of internal leakage inductance. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.|$|E

An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. Kristian Birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named [...] "auroral electrojets" [...] (see also Birkeland currents).|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> on various hydrodynamic processes in channel flow is discussed. Different mechanisms that generate <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> are presented. The {{effect of the}} earth's rotation on channel flow is analysed and it is shown that in wide channels and for moderate Rossby numbers the relative magnitude of the horizontal <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> is approximately 4 times the inverse of the Rossby number. The effect of the channel width on {{the magnitude of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> is shown to be small for normal aspect ratios. The Coriolis generated <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> are shown to develop in 30 - 60 channel depths downstream from zero cross-stream velocities. The effect of <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> on friction losses is shown to be small for secondary velocities of the order of I % of the downstream velocity. However, secondary velocities of this magnitude are shown to have significant effect on the lateral mixing of a passive tracer in a channel. The distance needed for complete lateral mixing is clearly reduced with <b>secondary</b> <b>currents.</b> This effect is shown to increase when the source is located off the centre line of the channel. It is further shown that a diffusion model for the lateral mixing is not appropriate when the <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> are important. Godkänd; 1986; 20070502 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the conditions for}} initiation and maintenance of <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> in open channel flows. By analyzing the Reynolds equation in the wall-normal and wall-tangent directions, this study reveals that, like other types of vortices, the <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> are originated in the near-boundary region, and the magnitude (or strength) of secondary flow {{is proportional to the}} lateral gradient of near-wall velocity. The near-wall secondary flow always moves from the region with lower velocity (or lower boundary shear stress) to the location with higher velocity (or higher boundary shear stress). Subsequently, the near-boundary secondary flow creeps into the main flow and drives circulation within a region enclosed by lines of zero total shear stress, leading to anisotropy of turbulence in the main flow region. This paper also discusses typical <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> in open channel flows and presents the relationship between sediment transport and <b>secondary</b> <b>currents.</b> The formation of sand ridges widely observed on the Earth surface is explained {{in the light of the}} proposed relationship...|$|R

50|$|One factor {{often not}} taken into {{consideration}} when discussing CDI spark energy is the actual energy provided to the spark gap versus the energy applied to the primary side of the coil. As a simple example, a typical ignition coil may have a secondary winding resistance of 4000 ohms and a <b>secondary</b> <b>current</b> of 400 milliamperes. Once a spark has struck, the voltage across the spark gap in a running engine drops to a relatively low value, {{in the order of}} 1500-2000 volts. This, combined {{with the fact that the}} coil <b>secondary</b> <b>current</b> of 400 milliamperes loses approximately 1600 volts through the 4000 ohm secondary resistance means that fully 50% of the energy is lost in heating the coil secondary.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{determine}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> structure in a compound channel flow. We have tested two turbulence models based on one point closure. The first order k-ε model and the second order Reynolds stress model. The numerical simulations of the transport equations is realised by the computational fluid dynamic code PHOENICS which integrates these two turbulence model. Numerical simulations show that the k-ε model can not reproduce the <b>secondary</b> <b>currents.</b> The Reynolds stress turbulence model is therefore necessary to reproduce the flow structure. The <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> affected the main velocity, kinetic energy and turbulent intensities distributions. This effect is shown by the isovalues bulging {{in the vicinity of the}} main channel floodplain interface. These bulges are due to the secondary convection that expressed the momentum transfer on the main channel flood plain interface. The momentum transfer is quantified by the apparent shear stress. The <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> structure is affected by the relative depth variation. In fact, the free surface vortex disappears when relative depth drops. These interpretations refer to the three-dimensional nature of the flow. The three-dimensional study has allowed to evaluate the dispersion coefficient α which appears in the integrated 1 D models. In the fluvial hydraulic, α is equal to 1. Calculations show that α is really different from the 1 and it is dependent to the relative depth through a polynomial relation...|$|R

A total current of about 140 kA flows within one daytime vortex. The rotating Sq current and the electrically conducting earth interior behave like a huge transformer with the dynamo region as the primary winding and the earth as the secondary winding. Since the Sq current varies with the basic period of one day, electric currents are induced within the earth's interior. The magnetic field of this <b>secondary</b> <b>current</b> is superimposed on the magnetic field of the primary Sq current. Methodes to separate both components go back to Gauss.

40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} the small vertical water movements created by thermal convection and the Coriolis force acting on groundwater flows. These small flows are {{of importance to}} vertical transports of temperature, nutrients and contaminants {{that would not be}} spread in the way they are. The first part analyzes thermally driven, seasonal groundwater convection by numerical simulation. The second part shows that the Coriolis force also induces <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> in groundwater flow through different vertical permeability distributions. Density driven convection occurs during the autumn in southern Sweden when the ambient air temperature cools the mean groundwater temperature from about 10 ºC. When the shallow groundwater is cooled by the ambient air its increased density makes this water sink, slowly increasing in temperature, while pressing the warmer water upwards creating a convection cell. The process is ongoing {{as long as there is}} a thermal gradient between ground surface and the groundwater. Under favorable conditions convection can reach a depth of 6 m. Such density-driven water movements occur most easily in more permeable soil. In northern Sweden, the situation is reversed, since the mean groundwater temperature is below 4 ºC, at which water is at its density maximum. So, in springtime when the uppermost groundwater is heated to 4 ºC by the warmer air the convection process starts. Here, the sinking groundwater does not reach the same depth, less than one meter. The Coriolis force has been considered too small to have any effect on groundwater flow, though its importance in meteorology and oceanography is well established. These theories have been applied using numerical simulations of groundwater flow. The numerical model has been validated by simulating some earlier studies of Coriolis forces in fluids. Furthermore the model has been extended to include porous media. It has been shown that <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> occur in nonlinear vertical permeability distributions. For simulations of constant and linear distributions no <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> have been seen. The development is more pronounced in confined aquifers. The structure of the bottom of the aquifer  affects  how the <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> arise. It was shown that both temperature gradients and the Coriolis force form <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> in groundwater and a general conclusion is that groundwater flow is more complex than previously assumed...|$|R

50|$|Previously, a {{measurement}} was taken {{across the whole}} of the flyback waveform which led to error, but it was realized that measurements at the so-called knee point (when the <b>secondary</b> <b>current</b> is zero, see Fig. 3) allow for a much more accurate measurement of what is happening on the secondary side.

Such models are hierarchically derived from a common and general mathematical framework and then analyzed with a detailed discussion of the physical processes and relevant hypotheses that are involved.

The analysis of the models shows {{the importance of}} the closure of <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> especially in the modeling of eddy viscosity.

On the other hand, the free response of the sediments, the phase lag of <b>secondary</b> <b>currents,</b> and the momentum redistribution due to the coupling between the main and the transverse flow are shown to be less relevant. Hence the second-order models, which neglect the effect of superelevation induced by the topography-driven lateral flow on the longitudinal flow, can reasonably be considered a good approximation for both predictive analysis and the computation of the resonant conditions.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{velocity}} gradients and <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> {{on the distribution of}} the shear force between the walls and bed of rectangular open channels. We show that neglecting the effect of <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> and assuming zero-shear division lines does not yield acceptable results. We, accordingly, introduce a method to determine the percentage of the total shear force acting on the walls and bed of rectangular open channels, which takes both the velocity gradients and <b>secondary</b> <b>currents</b> into account. Using the channel bisectors, along which there is no secondary flows effect, and orthogonal trajectories to isovels, along which there is no shear stress, we divide the channel cross section into three major subsections, namely bed area, walls area, and shared area. The geometry of each subsection is derived given the location of the maximum velocity. The share of the bed and wall shear forces from the shared area, are calculated afterward. The results for bed and walls shear forces agree well with the experimental data with an average relative error less than 5 % for both regular flows and flows carrying suspended sediment. This method also provides a physics-driven range for the wall and bed shear forces which nicely covers the experimental data...|$|R
