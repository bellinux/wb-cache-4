5|$|All {{those lines}} are labeled as N3 and N2 optical centers and {{associated}} with a defect consisting of three nitrogen atoms bordering a vacancy. Other stones show additional bands: brown, green, or yellow diamonds show a band in the green at 504nm (H3 center, see above), sometimes accompanied by two additional weak bands at 537nm and 495nm (H4 center, a large complex presumably involving 4 <b>substitutional</b> nitrogen atoms and 2 lattice vacancies). Type IIb diamonds may absorb in the far red due to the <b>substitutional</b> boron, but otherwise show no observable visible absorption spectrum.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, silicon does {{react with}} vacancies, {{creating}} the described above optical absorption at 738nm. The assumed mechanism is trapping of migrating vacancy by <b>substitutional</b> silicon {{resulting in the}} Si-V (semi-divacancy) configuration.|$|E
5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond {{may be the}} result of lattice {{irregularities}} or extrinsic <b>substitutional</b> or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.|$|E
5|$|Most ZnO has n-type character, even in {{the absence}} of {{intentional}} doping. Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional <b>substitutional</b> hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable n-type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a <b>substitutional</b> impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with <b>substitutional</b> nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{luminescence}} colors is often unclear and not unique. Blue emission from type IIa and IIb diamonds is reliably identified with dislocations by directly correlating the emission with dislocations in an electron microscope. However, blue emission in type Ia diamond could be either due to dislocations or the N3 defects (three nitrogen atoms bordering a vacancy). Green emission in natural diamond is usually due to the H3 center (two <b>substitutional</b> nitrogen atoms separated by a vacancy), whereas in synthetic diamond it usually originates from nickel used as a catalyst (see figure). Orange or red emission {{could be due to}} various reasons, one being the nitrogen-vacancy center which is present in sufficient quantities in all types of diamond, even type IIb.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen-vacancy {{centers are}} {{typically}} produced from single <b>substitutional</b> nitrogen centers (called C or P1 centers in diamond literature) by irradiation followed by annealing at temperatures above 700°C. A {{wide range of}} high-energy particles are suitable for such irradiation, including electrons, protons, neutrons, ions, and gamma photons. Irradiation produces lattice vacancies, which {{are a part of}} N-V centers. Those vacancies are immobile at room temperature, and annealing is required to move them. Single <b>substitutional</b> nitrogen produces strain in the diamond lattice; it therefore efficiently captures moving vacancies, producing the N-V centers.|$|E
25|$|During {{chemical}} vapor {{deposition of}} diamond, {{a small fraction of}} single <b>substitutional</b> nitrogen impurity (typically <0.5%) traps vacancies generated {{as a result of the}} plasma synthesis. Such nitrogen-vacancy centers are preferentially aligned to the growth direction.|$|E
25|$|Genetic load may {{increase}} when deleterious mutations, migration, inbreeding, or outcrossing lower mean fitness. Genetic load may also increase when beneficial mutations increase the maximum fitness against which other mutations are compared; {{this is known}} as the <b>substitutional</b> load or cost of selection.|$|E
25|$|The {{measures}} of sequence divergence {{shown in the}} table only take the <b>substitutional</b> differences, for example from an A (adenine) to a G (guanine), into account. DNA sequences may however also differ by insertions and deletions (indels) of bases. These are usually stripped from the alignments before the calculation of sequence divergence is performed.|$|E
25|$|Crystallographic defects {{strongly}} {{affect the}} tube's thermal properties. Such defects lead to phonon scattering, {{which in turn}} increases the relaxation rate of the phonons. This reduces the mean free path and reduces the thermal conductivity of nanotube structures. Phonon transport simulations indicate that <b>substitutional</b> defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high-frequency optical phonons. However, larger-scale defects such as Stone Wales defects cause phonon scattering {{over a wide range}} of frequencies, leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity.|$|E
25|$|In hamsters, the CK1ε-tau {{mutation}} {{was first}} discovered by Michael Menaker and colleagues while studying a laboratory shipment of Syrian hamsters. The prominent phenotype in the mutant hamsters was an unusually short free-running period — 22 hours in heterozygotes, and 20 hours in homozygotes for the mutation—making this allele semidominant. The gene was later mapped and identified by Joseph Takahashi and colleagues, which revealed a single base-pair C-to-T <b>substitutional</b> mutation in the hamster CK1ε gene. This {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) results in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution in a phosphate recognition domain region of CK1ε, a highly conserved region of the gene across mammals. Presently, {{it is unclear how}} exactly the CK1ε-tau mutation results in a shorter free-running period. The CK1ε-tau mutation in hamsters was the first full description of a mammalian circadian mutant.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{mechanism}} is expected for nickel, for which both <b>substitutional</b> and semi-divacancy configurations are reliably identified (see subsection [...] "nickel and cobalt" [...] above). In an unpublished study, diamonds rich in <b>substitutional</b> nickel were electron irradiated and annealed, with following careful optical measurements performed after each annealing step, but {{no evidence for}} creation or enhancement of Ni-vacancy centers was obtained.|$|E
500|$|Numerous Ni-related defects {{have been}} {{detected}} by electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence, both in synthetic and natural diamonds. Three major structures can be distinguished: <b>substitutional</b> Ni, nickel-vacancy and nickel-vacancy complex decorated {{by one or more}} <b>substitutional</b> nitrogen atoms. The [...] "nickel-vacancy" [...] structure, also called [...] "semi-divacancy" [...] is specific for most large impurities in diamond and silicon (e.g., tin in silicon). Its production mechanism is generally accepted as follows: large nickel atom incorporates substitutionally, then expels a nearby carbon (creating a neighboring vacancy), and shifts in-between the two sites.|$|E
500|$|The defect {{symmetry}} allows predicting many optical properties. For example, one-phonon (infrared) absorption in pure diamond lattice {{is forbidden}} because the lattice has an inversion center. However, introducing any defect (even [...] "very symmetrical", such as N-N <b>substitutional</b> pair) breaks the crystal symmetry resulting in defect-induced infrared absorption, {{which is the}} most common tool to measure the defect concentrations in diamond.|$|E
500|$|Diamonds {{occur in}} various colors: black, brown, yellow, gray, white, blue, orange, purple to pink and red. Colored {{diamonds}} contain crystallographic defects, including <b>substitutional</b> impurities and structural defects, {{that cause the}} coloration. Theoretically, pure diamonds would be transparent and colorless. Diamonds are scientifically classed into two main types and several subtypes, according {{to the nature of}} defects present and how they affect light absorption: ...|$|E
500|$|Diamond {{is a good}} {{electrical}} insulator, {{having a}} resistivity of 100GΩ·m to 1EΩ·m (1011 to 1018 Ω·m). [...] Most natural blue diamonds are an exception and are semiconductors due to <b>substitutional</b> boron impurities replacing carbon atoms. [...] Natural blue or blue-gray diamonds, common for the Argyle diamond mine in Australia, are rich in hydrogen; these diamonds are not semiconductors and {{it is unclear whether}} hydrogen is actually responsible for their blue-gray color. Natural blue diamonds containing boron and synthetic diamonds doped with boron are p-type semiconductors. N-type diamond films are reproducibly synthesized by phosphorus doping during chemical vapor deposition. Diode p-n junctions and UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm) have been produced by sequential deposition of p-type (boron-doped) and n-type (phosphorus-doped) layers.|$|E
500|$|The C center {{corresponds}} to electrically neutral single <b>substitutional</b> nitrogen {{atoms in the}} diamond lattice. These are easily seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (in which they are confusingly called P1 centers). C centers impart a deep yellow to brown color; these diamonds are classed as type Ib and {{are commonly known as}} [...] "canary diamonds", which are rare in gem form. Most synthetic diamonds produced by high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) technique contain a high level of nitrogen in the C form; nitrogen impurity originates from the atmosphere or from the graphite source. One nitrogen atom per 100,000 carbon atoms will produce yellow color. Because the nitrogen atoms have five available electrons (one more than the carbon atoms they replace), they act as [...] "deep donors"; that is, each substituting nitrogen has an extra electron to donate and forms a donor energy level within the band gap. Light with energy above ~2.2 eV can excite the donor electrons into the conduction band, resulting in the yellow color.|$|E

2500|$|The Jahn–Teller effect, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as Jahn–Teller distortion, describes the geometrical distortion of molecules and ions {{that is associated with}} certain electron configurations. [...] The Jahn–Teller theorem essentially states that any nonlinear molecule with a spatially degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy, because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the species. For a description of another type of geometrical distortion that occurs in crystals with <b>substitutional</b> impurities see article off-center ions.|$|E
2500|$|... – Generally {{thought to}} be Williams's best novel, Descent deals with various forms of selfishness, and how the cycle of sin brings about the {{necessity}} for redemptive acts. In it, an academic becomes so {{far removed from the}} world that he fetishises a woman to the extent that his perversion {{takes the form of a}} succubus. Other characters include a doppelgänger, the ghost of a suicidal Victorian labourer, and a playwright modelled in some ways on the author.

2500|$|This term {{is often}} used {{in the field of}} {{metallurgy}} to refer to the extent that an alloying element will dissolve into the base metal without forming a separate phase. The solvus or solubility line (or curve) is the line (or lines) on a phase diagram that give the limits of solute addition. That is, the lines show the maximum amount of a component that can be added to another component and still be in solid solution. [...] In the solid's crystalline structure, the 'solute' element can either take the place of the matrix within the lattice (a <b>substitutional</b> position; for example, chromium in iron) or take a place in a space between the lattice points (an interstitial position; for example, carbon in iron).|$|E
2500|$|Haldane (1957 [...] ) drew {{attention}} to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the <b>substitutional</b> (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I like to think of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main story}} is an allegory of Christ's crucifixion: [...] Aslan sacrifices himself for Edmund, a traitor who may deserve death, {{in the same}} way that Christians believe Jesus sacrificed himself for sinners. [...] Aslan is killed on the Stone Table, symbolizing Mosaic Law, which breaks when he is resurrected, symbolizing the {{replacement}} of the strict justice of Old Testament law with redeeming grace and forgiveness granted on the basis of <b>substitutional</b> atonement, according to Christian theology. [...] As with the Christian Passion, it is women (Susan and Lucy) who tend Aslan's body after he dies and are the first to see him after his resurrection. The significance of the death contains elements of both the ransom theory of atonement and the satisfaction theory: [...] Aslan suffers Edmund's penalty (satisfaction), and buys him back from the White Witch, who was entitled to him by reason of his treachery (ransom). In Christian belief, Christ is associated with the Biblical [...] "Lion of Judah" [...] of Revelation 5:5.|$|E
2500|$|Metal {{substrates}} {{for use in}} SAMs can {{be produced}} through physical vapor deposition techniques, electrodeposition or electroless deposition. Thiol or selenium SAMs produced by adsorption from solution are typically made by immersing a substrate into a dilute solution of alkane thiol in ethanol, though many different solvents can be used besides use of pure liquids. While SAMs are often allowed to form over 12 to 72 hours at room temperature, SAMs of alkanethiolates form within minutes. Special attention is essential in some cases, {{such as that of}} dithiol SAMs to avoid problems due to oxidation or photoinduced processes, which can affect terminal groups and lead to disorder and multilayer formation. In this case appropriate choice of solvents, their degassing by inert gasses and preparation in the absence of light is crucial and allows formation of [...] "standing up" [...] SAMs with free –SH groups. Self-assembled monolayers can also be adsorbed from the vapor phase. In some cases when obtaining an ordered assembly is difficult or when different density phases need to be obtained <b>substitutional</b> self-assembly is used. Here one first forms the SAM of a given type of molecules, which give rise to ordered assembly and then a second assembly phase is performed (e.g. by immersion into a different solution). This method has also been used to give information on relative binding strengths of SAMs with different head groups and more generally on self-assembly characteristics.|$|E

In <b>substitutional</b> lattice diffusion (self-diffusion for example), the atom can only move by substituting place with another atom. <b>Substitutional</b> lattice diffusion is often contingent upon the availability of point vacancies throughout the crystal lattice. Diffusing particles migrate from point vacancy to point vacancy by the rapid, essentially random jumping about(jump diffusion).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>substitutional</b> incorporation of manganese, low-temperature MBE also causes the inclusion of other impurities. The two other common impurities are interstitial manganeseand arsenic antisites.The former is where the manganese atom sits between the other atoms in the zinc-blende lattice structure and the latter is where an arsenic atom occupies a gallium site. Both impurities act as double donors, removing the holes provided by the <b>substitutional</b> manganese, and as such they are known as compensating defects. The interstitial manganese also bond antiferromagnetically to <b>substitutional</b> manganese, removing the magnetic moment.
