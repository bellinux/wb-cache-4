25|$|Even {{though he}} {{produced}} a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of compensation balance and methods of balance spring adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable temperature compensation device. For technical reasons, the temperature compensation for the balance spring had to <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> incorporated into the balance itself and not act on the balance spring directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.|$|E
25|$|Expression on {{instruments}} can {{be closely}} related {{to the role of the}} breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions. Whether these can <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2002–03 season, RDS secured {{exclusive}} French language {{rights to the}} NHL. The deal, negotiated with the Canadiens and not with the league itself, was meant to ensure a consistent home for all Canadiens games. Radio-Canada did not bid for these rights, saying that, as a general-interest network, it could not give up so much airtime to hockey. The announcement drew the ire of, among others, then-Heritage-Minister Sheila Copps, who suggested that the network would <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> violating its conditions of licence by not airing LSDH. In reality there is no specific regulatory requirement that the CBC's networks carry the NHL, nor that the two networks have {{the same level of}} NHL coverage.|$|E

25|$|The team first {{considered}} {{spinning the}} radar dish around a vertical axis and then angling the dish {{up and down}} a few degrees with each complete circuit. The vertical motion could be smoothed out by moving continually rather than in steps, producing a helix pattern. However, this helical-scan solution had two disadvantages; one was that the dish spent half of its time pointed backwards, limiting the amount of energy broadcast forward, and the other was that it required the microwave energy to <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> sent to the antenna through a rotating feed. At a 25 October all-hands meeting attended by Dee, Hodgkin and members of the GEC group at GEC's labs, {{the decision was made to}} proceed with the helical-scan solution in spite of these issues. GEC solved the problem of having the signal turned off half the time by using two dishes mounted back-to-back and switching the output of the magnetron to the one facing forward at that instant. They initially suggested that the system would be available by December 1940, but as work progressed it became clear that it would take much longer.|$|E
500|$|When {{performing}} {{an experiment}} on chimpanzees, the CDC determines {{that money is}} somehow responsible for infecting males with sexual addiction. Because an image of Independence Hall appears {{on the back of}} a $100 bill, they believe the origins of the disorder can <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> traced there. They submit their findings to President Barack Obama, who believes that a virus for sex addiction had previously been brought to Earth by extraterrestrials. He accompanies a SWAT team on their raid on Independence Hall in search of the [...] "wizard alien" [...] that is responsible for the sex addiction epidemic. When one member of the team suggests that the mission is irrational and that sex addiction is simply an inherent part of the male ego, he is ordered by Obama to be hauled away.|$|E

She {{stays in the}} car while he goes in the facility to find Eckerle {{who is in a}} hysterical, paranoid state, having been unable to escape the roaches that he feels are following him. Eckerle pulls a gun on Mulder, thinking that even he may <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> a cockroach. Scully arrives on the scene and meets Berenbaum. [...] Scully then goes in the facility seeking for Mulder and then phones Mulder, and when Mulder's phone rings, Eckerle believes it to be Mulder making a tone {{like the rest of the}} unusual roaches. Eckerle fires at Mulder, and his shots rupture and ignite pipes containing methane gas. The agents flee, and the facility explodes with Eckerle still inside. The next day, Dr. Ivanov arrives to talk with Mulder at the scene of the explosion and meets Berenbaum. The two leave with one another, discussing their interests in insects and robots. That night Mulder writes his report on the case, wondering how humanity would react if insect-like robots visited Earth. Mulder finds a bizarre looking bug by his food, and crushes it with an X-File.|$|E

500|$|Kurtzman {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Hefner and Playboy executive editor Ray Russell, who was interested in Kurtzman's idea of a comic strip suitable for the magazine's audience and suggested [...] "satire... as an excuse or rationale for a slick magazine to be publishing a comic strip." [...] Although single-panel cartoons were an established part of the magazine, a comic strip was unprecedented {{and had to be}} justified. Kurtzman submitted some Goodman Beaver strips and was surprised to receive a favorable response from Hefner, who liked the [...] "fresh and eager" [...] character. He especially enjoyed [...] "Goodman Goes Playboy", which featured a boisterous romp in Hefner's mansion. Hefner nevertheless insisted that the material was not right for his magazine, but requested an explanation of the character with a suggestion: [...] "Maybe there is a way of launching a similar series... that can <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> related to Playboy". Kurtzman replied that Goodman Beaver [...] "could be foolish {{and at the same time}} wise," [...] and that he [...] "innocently partakes of the bad while espousing the good." [...] He further stated that Beaver's innocent, restive, and charming nature allotted him especial creative freedom. A week later, Kurtzman wrote to Hefner, [...] "What would you think of a girl character... whom I could apply to my kind of situations?" [...] Six weeks later Hefner replied, [...] "I think your notion of doing a Goodman Beaver strip of two, three, or four pages, but using a sexy girl... is a bull's eye. We can run it every issue." ...|$|E
500|$|While the Doctor alters part of {{the command}} module of Apollo 11, Canton and Amy visit a nearby orphanage, hoping to find where {{the girl in the}} {{spacesuit}} was taken from. Amy discovers a nest of the Silence, and a photograph of her and a baby amongst pictures of the little girl from the space suit. The girl enters with the Silence, and Amy is abducted and taken to their time engine control room. Arriving too late, the Doctor and his allies find Amy's recording device, through which Rory still can hear Amy's voice confessing her love for one of the group. Canton is able to shoot and wound one of the creatures, and from it the Doctor discovers the creatures are the Silence, a group he was warned about by several of his foes in his recent adventures. Analysing the now-empty space suit, River realises that the girl possesses incredible strength to have forced her way out of it, and that the suit's advanced life-support technology would have called the President as the highest authority figure on Earth when the girl got scared. The Doctor realises why the Silence have been controlling humanity— by guiding their technological advances, they have influenced humanity into the Space Race for purposes of building a spacesuit, which must <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> crucial to their intentions. Meanwhile, Canton interrogates the captured Silent in the Area 51 prison, who mocks humanity for treating him when [...] "...you should kill us all on sight". Canton records this using Amy's mobile phone.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier {{attempts}} at reconciliation of Christianity with Newtonian mechanics appear {{quite different from}} later {{attempts at}} reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of evolution or relativity. Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a struggle for existence. These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal patterns of biological cooperation. According to John Habgood, all man really knows {{here is that the}} universe seems to be a mix of good and evil, beauty and pain, and that suffering may <b>somehow</b> <b>be</b> {{part of the process of}} creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by God, given their faith in the symbol of the Cross.|$|E
2500|$|A {{key element}} of the single-payer plan that Daschle and his co-authors propose {{in the book is}} a new [...] "Federal Health Board" [...] that would {{establish}} the framework and fill in the details.

2500|$|Because {{the almost}} {{simultaneous}} disclosures of PD 59 and the stealth technology {{came in the}} midst of the 1980 presidential campaign, some critics asserted that the Carter administration leaked them to counter charges of weakness and boost its re-election chances.

Brown insisted that the countervailing strategy was not a first strike strategy.

Tyrrell stated that she quit because a Metrolink Board {{statement}} called her announcement premature and inappropriate; she maintained that it was proper {{to get out in}} front of the story before the NTSB took over the investigation. [...] She stated that she asked for and received authorization to make the comments from David Solow, Metrolink's chief executive. [...] Solow confirmed that he did give authorization, but said that, in hindsight, he would not have given permission. [...] After her resignation, some good government proponents praised Tyrrell for her candor, including the chief public advocate with California Common Cause.
