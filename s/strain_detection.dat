30|$|In {{order to}} achieve the same origin {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) strain measurement, one three-dimensional (3 D) fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain sensor is proposed in this paper. The metal structure of this sensor is composed by three elliptical rings with different geometrical parameters. All these elliptical rings make sure that this sensor achieves the same origin 3 D <b>strain</b> <b>detection</b> and increases the strain measurement coefficient. A theory calculation model of this sensor is established. The finite element method is utilized to optimize this sensor and verify the correctness of the theory model. After sensor optimization, 1 mm is chosen as the radical thickness of this sensor based on taking high <b>strain</b> <b>detection</b> coefficient and structure strength into account. To further obtain detection characteristics of this sensor, the calibration experiment is carried out. Experimental data of FBG 1 which is the core sensitive element of this sensor is chosen as the specimen to be analyzed by the least square method. When the wavelength of FBG 1 is changed by external stress, wavelengths of FBG 2 and FBG 3 have just a little fluctuation maybe caused by the fiber demodulation instrument SM 125. So sensitive elements (FBG 1, FBG 2, and FBG 3) of this sensor have no crosstalk problem for three-dimensional detection. After data analysis, the measuring coefficient of FBG 1 is 0.05 nm/N. Similarly, the coefficients of FBG 2 and FBG 3 are 0.045 nm/N and 0.39 nm/N, respectively. All these data confirm that this sensor could achieve the same origin 3 D strain measurement without the crosstalk problem and has certain practical applications.|$|E

Heteroresistance could be detected with the Kirby-Bauer test if the incubation temperature was 30 or 35 C instead of 37 C, when tests were performed against methicillin, oxacillin, or nafcillin, because the resistant organisms grew up to the disks even though the susceptible organisms were inhibited. At 37 C, the resistance was detectable with some strains but not with others. When cloxacillin disks were used, the temperature effect was not seen.
