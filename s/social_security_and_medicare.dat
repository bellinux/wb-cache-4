5|$|In February 2010, President Obama {{formed the}} {{bipartisan}} BowlesSimpson Commission to recommend steps {{that could be}} taken to reduce future budget deficits. The commission released its report on November 10, 2010, which recommended deep domestic and military spending cuts, reforming the tax system by eliminating many tax breaks in return for lower overall rates, and reducing benefits for <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicare.</b> The plan did not receive the supermajority vote within the commission which {{it needed to be}} directly sent to Congress, and portions of the plan were rejected by both parties.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to calling for cuts in federal government spending {{to help reduce}} the national debt, Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs, such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicare.</b> He supported substantial increases in military spending and promised to invest more heavily in military weapons programs while {{increasing the number of}} active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E

40|$|Government {{policies}} {{that are based on}} age do not adjust to the fact that a given age is associated with a higher remaining life expectancy and lower mortality risk relative to earlier time periods due to improvements in mortality. We examine four possible methods for adjusting the eligibility ages for <b>Social</b> <b>Security,</b> <b>Medicare,</b> <b>and</b> Individual Retirement Accounts to determine what eligibility ages would be today and in 2050 if adjustments for mortality improvement were taken into account. We find that historical adjustment of eligibility ages for age inflation would have increased ages of eligibility by approximately 0. 15 years annually. Failure to adjust for mortality improvement implies the percent of the population eligible to receive full <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits <b>and</b> <b>Medicare</b> will increase substantially relative to the share eligible under a policy of age adjustment. ...|$|R

The traditional source of funding for these social welfare programs – payroll taxes – is inadequate because it does not capture income from capital, and income above the payroll tax cap, which make up a larger and larger share of national income as inequality increases.|$|E

Marshall wrote a letter to Jeffrey M.

25|$|The {{framework}} of U.S. immigration law has largely {{remained the same}} since 1965. The U.S. economy needs both high-skilled and low-skilled immigrant workers to remain competitive and to have enough workers who continue to pay into <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicare</b> as the U.S. population grows older. Nonetheless, there are currently very few channels for immigration to the U.S. for work-related reasons under current law. Furthermore, Amnesty International has taken concern regarding the excessive brutality inflicted upon illegal immigrants, which includes beatings, sexual assault, denial of medical attention, and denial of food, water and warmth for long periods.|$|E

The proposal also calls for a monthly payment to households of citizens and legal resident aliens (based on family size) as an advance rebate of tax on purchases up to the poverty level.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Federal income tax, John will probably pay state income tax, <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> tax, <b>and</b> <b>Medicare</b> tax. The <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> tax in 2007 for John is 6.2% on the first $97,500 of earned income (wages), or a maximum of $6,045. There are no exclusions from earned income for <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> so John will pay the maximum of $6,045. His wife will pay $12,000 x 6.2% = $744. Medicare is 1.45% on all earned income with no maximum. John and his wife will pay $112,000 x 1.45% = $1,624 for Medicare in 2007.|$|R
