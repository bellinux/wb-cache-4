In the escalators' undercarriage, approximately 8800 kg of accumulated detritus acted as a wick to a neglected buildup of interior lubricants; wood veneers, paper and plastic advertisements, <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paint,</b> plywood in the ticket hall, and melamine combustion added to the impact of the calamity.|$|E
50|$|Body shells {{are painted}} in a semi-clean {{environment}} using <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paint.</b> Shells are dipped in chemical tanks to cleanse them of any oils {{picked up on}} the panels during their manufacture in Body Shop. Once bodies have been dipped and cleansed, they are then immersed in an anti-corrosion paint dip called ED (Electrocoat Dip). This 'dip' coats the entire body, both inside and outside, and is the first paint coating it will receive. Once the 'dipped' body has been stoved in the ED oven, the body progresses to the 'Sealing' Booth. In this booth, the body has its interior panel joints, floor, tailgate, hood and door edges sealed with a PVC based sealant, to prevent water ingress and corrosion as the car is driven on the road. Also within this zone, sound pads are added to the floor and boot to reduce road noise (standard practice in the motor industry). The next booth it enters is the 'Underbody' Booth. In this booth, similar to 'Sealing' Booth, the body's wheel arches are sealed using the same PVC based sealant. Robots then apply the underseal to the underfloor and wheel arches. Also robots are used to apply the SGC (Stone Guard Coat) layer to the sills: this coating is designed for abrasion resistance, i.e. preventing stone chips, scuffs, etc. From here, the body proceeds into the Undercoat Oven. The next zone is 'ED Sanding' booth where the body is inspected for any minor imperfections received in the ED Coat. The next zone is the 'Surfacer' Booth, where the body receives its second coat of paint, this being the Surfacer Coat, then into the Surfacer Oven. Next is 'Surfacer Sanding' Booth: the same as ED Sanding, this zone inspects the body for any imperfections picked up within the Surfacer coating. Next comes the 'Topcoat' Booth, where the body receives its final coats of paint, these being Topcoat and Clearcoat layers. After being stoved in the Topcoat oven, the body then enters the 'Touch-up' Booth where the body has its final inspection for any imperfections picked up in the Topcoat process. Once the body leaves here, it then moves on to the PBS (Painted Body Store) above Trim and Chassis to await {{the next step in the}} production process.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} methodological approaches for reconstructing long-term occupational exposure to organic solvents among construction painters. A detailed exposure questionnaire {{was administered to}} 125 painters to develop a job exposure matrix (JEM). The questionnaire inquired about <b>painting</b> activities with <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paints</b> and use of protection equipment for the previous 25 years in 5 -year intervals. Current and historical distributions of solvent air concentrations were assessed for {{the same time period}} based on the following information: industrial hygiene measurements, paint composition changes, and VOC emission rate changes from architectural and industrial maintenance coatings. Changes in protection factors of respirators were also assessed. A cumulative solvent exposure index was calculated for each painter through Monte Carlo simulations by combining appropriate input distributions of solvent air concentrations and protection factors of respirators with JEM. Sensitivity simulations revealed that the historical variations in solvent air concentrations had a higher impact on the cumulative solvent exposure index than changes in protection factors for respirators. Fifty-eight percent of painters were classified with a different exposure quartile when the solvent exposure index was used vs. an exposure based only on years using <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paints,</b> suggesting the need for more detailed exposure analysis than just years working when conducting epidemiologic studies for this worker population.

40|$|Abstract. The {{emission}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC) from single-component polyurethane varnish applied to beech plywood at two temperatures (33 °C, 43 °C) has been investigated in a small environmental chamber. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} concentration of each compound, as well as the total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), increased rapidly after the start of experiment, and attained their maximum values at 0. 5 h. The concentrations decreased rapidly after 0. 5 h, and then decreased more slowly in the period 2 – 24 h. The concentrations of isopropylbenzene, n-decane and TVOC were higher in the 43 °C test than in the 33 °C test within the first 1. 5 h.

40|$|Abstract—The {{increased}} use of water-based paint (WBP) for indoor application {{during the last decade}} has drastically changed the exposure conditions for Swedish house painters. WBP has a lower emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paint</b> (SBP), but contains more reactive compounds, such as biocides, glycol ethers, and other high molecular solvents. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the incidence of airway symptoms and self-reported asthma in house painters with a different degree of use of WBP and SBP. The incidence of seven general airway symptoms, and three work-related symptoms, was analysed by means of a self-administered questionnaire, in a cohort of 207 house painters followed from 1989 to 1992. Different airway symptoms were compared with clinical information obtained by a methacholine challenge test and dynamic spirometry in a selected subgroup of 44 painters. Information on the degree of use of SBP and WBP was used to estimate the total exposure to volatile organic compounds (TVOQ for each individual. In total, 175 men in the cohort worked as painters during the study period. No increase of asthma or respiratory symptoms was observed among those 50 painters with a pure exposure to WBP (estimated TVOC 1 - 3 mgm" 3).

Materials and Methods: Gamma-spectrometry technique has been used throughout the research {{in order to determine the}} activity of natural radionuclides. Later, annual doses were calculated. Results: The average radioactivity values were 632. 2 Bq kg- 1 for fly-ash, 4. 4 Bq kg- 1 for brick, 73. 3 Bq kg- 1 for soil, 306. 6 Bq kg- 1 for cement, 302. 3 Bq kg- 1 for phosphogypsum and 83. 6 Bq kg- 1 for <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paint</b> in the research region. The activity of water-based paint and foam were below MDA 1. The annual effective doses ranged between 0. 009 and 1. 479 mSv y- 1.

Methods: Ten auto body shops in King County, Washington that use waterborne coatings were recruited to participate in this study. Based on reviews of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) from commonly used waterborne basecoats, 14 target compounds were selected to characterize exposures to components of these products. Task-based personal air sampling was conducted on 11 painters when applying basecoats. Sampling results were summarized and compared to MSDSs and historical exposure studies of <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paints.</b> Painters’ work practices were also recorded to determine other possible routes of exposure. Work practices recorded included the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), gun-cleaning procedures, waste disposal, and paint booth maintenance. Results: Breathing zone concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons and polar volatile organic compounds were typically below their respective method limits of quantitation (MLOQ). On average, 11 % (SD= 16 %) of the aromatic hydrocarbon samples and 23 % (SD= 19 %) of the polar compound samples exceeded their respective MLOQs. All analyte concentrations had threshold limit value (TLV) parametric exceedance fractions below 0. 03, and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) odor parametric exceedance fractions below 0. 05. VOC exposures when spraying waterborne paints were up to 56 times lower than historical studies on VOC exposures to <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paints.</b> Procedures for cleaning paint guns and disposing of waterborne paint wastes varied between shops. Several shops disposed of waste in the municipal solid waste stream without chemical characterization, in violation of state regulations. Painters were observed using lacquer thinner to clean their waterborne paint guns, which is not recommended by manufacturers. Painters were also observed handling waterborne waste with inadequate exposure controls. We observed that the air flow rates in spray booths typically failed to meet OSHA requirements. Conclusions: Workers’ exposures to target compounds when applying waterborne basecoats were typically below their respective MLOQs and regulatory limits. The typical PPE worn by painters should be adequate to protect painters from possible exposures. This study also shows that the waterborne paint exposures during spraying are lower than the historical exposures due to spraying <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paints.</b> However, without maintaining adequate airflow in the paint booths and adequate guidelines for all aspects of handling the paints, workers can still be at risk of exposures to waterborne paints and other chemicals used during non-spraying operations.

Fourteen embalmers participated in the workplace evaluation.   Knowledge increased, with more mmSDS users showing increases at the first post-intervention study.   Cumulative exposure to formaldehyde decreased slightly post-intervention, although there were no significant differences between packages.   There was little change in the use of protective measures due to embalmers already using measures available.   Twenty-four members of the general public participated in a laboratory-based painting study.   None had previously used the paint and knowledge increased for both mmSDS and SDS users.   The mmSDS was more effective at promoting positive changes in the wearing of masks, hand washing and ventilation.   Cumulative exposures to solvents decreased, although there were no statistically significant differences between packages. The impact of the mmSDSs and SDSs interventions on participants’ behaviour and exposure to chemicals was more pronounced in the laboratory study however the majority of the workplace participants were already using all the protective measures available.   Overall, the findings suggest that the mmSDS concept may be an effective method of providing chemical hazard and risk information in the workplace.

40|$|Coating {{shrinkage}} upon drying is {{a phenomenon}} well known to the paper coating industry, where it often causes changes in the final structure of the coating layer leading to poor results in terms of gloss, light scattering, surface strength, coverage, uniformity and printability. Such shrinkage has in previous studies been wrongly associated with shrinkage of the polymeric binders used in the coating formulation, by making erroneous comparison with <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paint</b> systems. Natural binders, as starch or proteins, which come from renewable resources and are therefore environmentally friendly, suffer more from this shrinkage phenomenon than synthetic binders. The aim of this research project was to improve {{the understanding of the}} processes involved in the drying of a coating layer and to create a model able to describe them. Shrinkage while the coating layer dries has been successfully measured by observing the deflection of coated strips of a synthetic elastically-deformable substrate. Ground calcium carbonate was used as the coating pigment, together with latex binders of both low and high glass transition temperature, Tg, respectively, and also with starch which is a natural film-forming water soluble binder. The final dry coatings were studied with mercury porosimetry and by scanning electron microscopy in order to characterise their porous structure. The flow and rheological properties of the coating colour formulations were measured in order to probe the particle-particle interaction between the different species in the wet coating colour. The void space of the dry coating layers was modelled using Pore-Cor, a software which generates simulated porous networks. A new algorithm was developed to model, within the simulated void space, the effective particles or "skeletal elements" representative of the solid phase of the dried porous system. The water-filled porous structures {{at the beginning of the}} shrinkage process (first critical concentration, FCC) were subsequently modelled by creating Pore-Cor structures with the same solid skeletal elements distribution as at the second critical concentration (at which the particles lock their positions), but with higher given porosity to account for the water present The capillary forces acting on the surface of the simulated coating were calculated, and found to be several orders of magnitude larger than the measured shrinkage forces. The shrinkage process was thus described as resulting from the effect of capillary forces in the plane of the coating layer resisted by a stick-slip process, where the capillary forces yield shrinkage only if a resistance force within the drying coating layer holds the structure in place and allows the menisci to form. The stick-slip theory was strongly supported by quantitative comparisons between the experimental forces required to intrude mercury, and the capillary forces within the simulated void structure.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{graphically}} that the monodisperse resins give rise to higher LCPVC values than polydispersed resins, which ultimately allows the coatings formulator to propose latex paints with higher PVCs and therefore coatings with a better cost/benefit relationship.

40|$|Background: Long-term {{exposure}} to organic solvents {{may lead to}} chronic solvent induced encephalopathy (CSE) in painters. In combination with reduction of exposure, a workers' health surveillance programme was developed, resulting in a three-stage CSE screening procedure for early neurobehavioural changes possibly predicting chronic health effects. The screening consists of a questionnaire (Neurosymptom Screening Checklist 60, NSC- 60), computerised neurobehavioural functioning testing (Neurobehavioural Evaluation System; NES 2) and multidisciplinary differential diagnostic evaluation by experts (called 'Solvent Team'). Results from the screening were compared {{with the results of}} the 'care as usual' (CAU), in which symptomatic patients were referred directly to the Solvent Team by occupational physicians, general practitioners or medical specialists. Parallel to the screening programme, a legal ban on indoor use of <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paints</b> resulted in lower {{exposure to}} solvents. Objective: To investigate the usefulness of the NSC- 60 questionnaire as a screening tool for CSE among painters and to investigate the course of the number of CSE cases over the years as a potential consequence of improved prevention and control. Results: From 1998 to 2004, more than 40, 000 painters were invited to participate in a health surveillance programme including a periodical occupational health examination (PHE) and 50 % did participate. Four percent (N = 794) of these had a positive score on the NSC- 60. The Solvent Team assessed 101 of these for CSE, which resulted in 27 CSE cases diagnosed. CAU during the same period of the surveillance (1998 - 2004) yielded 619 painters and 75 of these had the diagnosis CSE. After 2002 the number of CSE diagnosed cases dropped considerably and in 2004 only one case of CSE could be diagnosed. The substantially lower prevalence of CSE diagnosed cases in painters after 2002 might partly be explained {{as a result of a}} successful participation in the screening procedure of most prevalent CSE cases during the years 1998 - 2002. A second reason for the reduction of new diagnosed cases of CSE can be the effectiveness of the ban on indoor use of <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paints</b> resulting in lower exposure levels at work. Conclusion: The screening procedure is useful to screen for CSE among people taking part in the PHE programme. Control of CSE can be achieved by an integrated preventive approach with reduction of exposure and screening on early health effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserve...|$|R

Two new electron cloud detectors have been discussed, developed and installed during the Long Shutdown (LS 1) in one of the PS main magnets. The first measurement method is based on current measurement by using a shielded button-type pick-up. Due to the geometry and space limitation in the PS magnet, the button-type pick-up made of a 96 %Al 2 O 3 block coated with a thin layer of <b>solvent-based</b> Ag <b>painting,</b> placed 30 degrees to the bottom part of the vacuum chamber was installed in the horizontal direction where the only opening of the magnet coil is. The other newly developed measurement method is based on detection of photons emitted by the electrons from the electron cloud impinging on the vacuum chamber walls. The emitted photons are reected to a quartz window. A MCP-PMT (Micro-Channel Plate Photomultiplier Tube) with high magnetic field/radiation resistance and fast response is attached outside the quartz window behind two UV lenses and one UV mirror and then counts the photons during the beam operation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Powder {{painting}} {{is an alternative}} to <b>solvent-based</b> spray <b>painting.</b> Powder paints may contain organic acid anhydrides (OAAs), which are irritants to the airways and may cause sensitisation. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and immunological response among powder painters and to describe the exposure to OAAs. Methods: In all, 205 subjects in 32 enterprises participated: 93 exposed and 26 formerly exposed workers in 25 powder paint shops and 86 unexposed workers. They completed a questionnaire about working conditions and symptoms and took part in a medical examination, which included a lung function test. Urine samples, for determination of two OAAs, and blood samples, for analysis of specific antibodies against the OAAs, were taken. In addition, 33 paint samples were analysed for nine OAAs. Results: The powder painters reported more work-related respiratory symptoms than unexposed subjects did. The prevalence of three or more symptoms was 24 % in subjects with low exposure, 44 % in highly exposed individuals, 46 % in formerly exposed subjects and 19 % in unexposed workers. Asthma symptoms were frequent, 7 %, 40 %, 15 % and 2 %, respectively. Regression analyses of the lung volumes did not show any influence of exposure. IgG, but not IgE, against the OAAs and metabolites of OAAs was found in some subjects, but no associations with the exposure could be observed. OAAs were found in only small amounts in the paint samples. Conclusions: The exposure to organic acid anhydrides was estimated to be low, and yet, IgG antibodies to OAA were observed in some subjects. The prevalence of work-related symptoms from the eyes and the airways was relatively high among the powder painters, and these symptoms, but not the lung volumes, were clearly related to exposure. The symptoms were probably caused by irritative properties of the powder paint dust...|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes involve the coating of substrates with thin layers of paint. This paper {{is concerned with}} modelling the variations in layer thickness which may occur as a paint layer dries. Firstly, a systematic derivation is provided of a model based on classical lubrication theory for a drying paint layer consisting of a non-volatile resin and a volatile solvent. The effects of variable surface tension, viscosity, solvent diffusivity and solvent evaporation rate are all included in the model. This analysis makes explicit {{the validity of the}} physically intuitive approximations made by earlier authors and hence clarifies when the model is appropriate. Secondly, the model is used to analyse the evolution of small perturbations to the thickness of, and the concentration of solvent in, a drying paint layer. This analysis provides an analytical description of the 'reversal' of an initial perturbation to the thickness of the layer and the appearance of a perturbation to an initially flat layer caused by an initial perturbation to the concentration of solvent. Thirdly, it is shown how a simplified version of the model applicable to the case of surface-tension-gradient-dominated flow can be derived and solved as an initial-value problem. Fourthly, the applicability of the present theory developed for <b>solvent-based</b> high-gloss alkyd <b>paints</b> to waterborne coatings is discussed.

40|$|Coatings and paints play a {{significant}} role in daily life; they prolong the lifetime of materials by offering protection against, for example, corrosion, weathering or fouling, and literally add color to our lives. Due to their widespread use, their environmental consequences have become focus of increasingly strict regulations and public awareness. There has been a strong effort to replace traditional solvent-based coatings with waterborne coatings to reduce or eliminate the volatile organic compounds (VOC) that traditionally formed the main component of paints. A pronounced shift from solvent-based to water-based systems has already taken place for decorative (consumer) coatings. However, for more demanding applications in industry, the replacement of <b>solvent-based</b> <b>paints</b> with greener waterborne formulations still has a long way to go, due to their lower performance in terms of both mechanical, durability and aesthetic aspects. The development of waterborne coatings with the same or better performance than solvent-borne systems is thus an important step towards the further vanishing of VOC-rich coatings. Ultimately, the final aimis to replace all solvent-borne coatings with VOC-free paint formulations. Waterborne paints form a very promising candidate, yet several key aspects of their properties during storage, handling and during their lifetime as a coating, remain poorly understood. Waterborne coatings are complex multiphase systems, containing a wide variety of dissolved and dispersed components in the common aqueous continuous phase. During the drying of the paint, after application, this complex mixture must undergo a phase inversion to achieve a homogeneous film of the resinfrom its initial dispersed state. While this state governs the structure, and thus final properties of the coating film, its complexity precludes a deep understanding to date. This is due to the complexity of the drying and phase inversion process, which is governed by a seemingly immense number of chemical and physical parameters. We therefore adopted a simplification approach, minimizing the number of parameters to obtain a first-pass insight into the phase inversion process. We started by directly visualizing how coalescence occurs in a drying 2 D emulsion film, both on the single-particle scale, with confocal microscopy, and by macroscopic imaging. Based on these observations, we built a hydrodynamic model that explains some of the key governing parameters in the film formation process. Furthermore, we explored the possibilities to manipulate phase inversion and coalescence, by developing new thermoresponsive surfactants. These new strategies allow us to obtain new insights into this complex problem.   Understanding coalescence in dense emulsions The first part of this thesis focusses on understanding how coalescence and phase inversion occurs in a drying emulsion film, through direct quantitative imaging. Our observations at different length scales are unified in a hydrodynamic model to arrive at a microscopic understanding of this complex macroscopic phenomenon. In Chapter 2 we observed two distinctmodes of phase inversion in surfactant-stabilized o/wemulsions exposed to aunidirectional drying stress. Coalescence occurs either through a nucleation-and-growth mechanism, where coalesced pockets form and grow randomly throughout the sample, or through a coalescence front that propagates into the sample from the drying end. The way in which coalescence occurs is determined by a balance between the established pressure profile across the film and the local critical disjoining pressure in the emulsion. For very stable emulsions, narrow plateau borders can develop, leading to steep pressure gradients; the actual pressure only exceeds the critical pressure in a narrow zone around the drying front and front coalescence results. The opposite occurs for unstable emulsions; only shallow pressure profiles develop before coalescence commences throughout the bulk of the sample. Moreover, we find that surfactant concentration plays {{a significant}} role through its effect on the critical disjoining pressure atwhich coalescence occurs. This, to our knowledge, is the first observation and explanation of different modes of coalescence dynamics in dense emulsion films. In chapter 3 we present a hydrodynamic model for the water flow in a jammed emulsion, subjected to a unidirectional drying stress. Water flows through the Plateau borders towards the drying end, driven by gradients in the capillary pressure. Our model predicts the pressure gradients that arise, and allows us to explain the different modes of coalescence observed experimentally in chapter 2. From these results, we estimate the boundaries (critical pressure and evaporation rate) between bulk and front coalescence. We explore the parameter space of our hydrodynamic model, to further investigate the key factors involved in film formation. We show that, those two distinct coalescence behaviors can be obtained within the same model by varying the critical disjoining pressure. Furthermore, we get a ‘coalescence modes phase diagram’ to show where and how the coalescence transit from one to other.   Manipulating coalescence in dense emulsions In Chapter 4 we showthe successful synthesis of well-defined thermoresponsive surfactants through Atom Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP) using a alkyl-functional initiator. These surfactantscan be used to stabilise emulsions for over four months at room temperature, below the collapse transition of the hydrophilic block of the surfactant, yet can be triggered to break the emulsion within minutes when the sample is heated to above 40 °C. This on-demand coalescence is mediated by desorption of the surfactants from parts of the surface, as evidenced by surface tension measurements and direct microscopic observations of the droplets surface. Our results suggest that these well-defined thermoresponsive surfactants form an interesting platform to study droplet coalescence and triggered phase inversion in emulsion systems. Moreover, the ability to break a very stable emulsion on demand has industrial relevance for several applications, such as in film formation of waterborne emulsion paints and the recovery of products during emulsion-based extraction and reaction processes. In Chapter 5 we reported on a new approach to study coalescence in dense thermoresponsive emulsions using a microfluidic-based microcentrifugation method in which a constant external field can be applied. We have shown that both thermodynamic and kinetic properties can be measured through automated image analysis, and that the temperature-responsivity of the surfactants can be used to trigger different modes of coalescence on demand. These results form further proof that our conclusions in Chapters 3 & 4 regarding the nature of the transition from front to bulk coalescence are valid; also here we observe that changing the critical disjoining pressure, through changing the temperature, can induce a spontaneous switch in coalescence mode. This new approach forms a stepping stone for further investigations into the governing mechanisms that dominate phase inversion and film formation. Using the knowledge and methods developed in this thesis, new avenues for studying film formation have been opened. Our work focussed on highly idealised emulsions, real coating systems exhibit some complicating factors, such as viscoelasticity of the latex droplets, and even chemical reactions between different species of droplets, interactions with several surface active species and solid pigment particles. Moreover, the length scales in real paints are a few orders of magnitude smaller, requiring the development of new methodologies suitable for these length scales. These topics will be subject for future study, and are required to fully understand and control the properties of water-based coatings...|$|R
