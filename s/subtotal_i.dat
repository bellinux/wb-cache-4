40|$|The {{treatment}} of a transverse maxillary deficiency in skeletally mature individuals should include surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion. This study evaluated the distribution of stresses that affect the expander's anchor teeth using finite element analysis when the osteotomy is varied.

40|$|Objective: We {{report the}} case of a 42 -y-old morbidly obese woman who {{presented}} persistent anemia as result of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Methods: The surgical procedure conducted in 1999 consisted of horizontal gastroplasty with truncular vagotomy, Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis with an alimentary limb of 60 cm, and cholecystectomy. In 2000 a second surgery (<b>subtotal</b> gastrectomy, <b>i.</b> e., 90 %, with a 50 -mL gastric pouch) was performed because of failed gastroplasty. Anemia was detected approximately 1 y after the second surgery. This condition worsened significantly after an abdominal lipectomy performed in 2001. Since then, different oral iron compounds were used for treatment, but with unsatisfactory results. The subject was anemic for 4 y. Results: The condition was corrected only after intravenous iron administration. Iron absorptions from 3 mg of iron as ferrous ascorbate and from a standardized diet that also contained 3 mg of iron were 48. 4 % and 39. 9 %, respectively. Conclusion: Iron absorption tests provided evidence that the reduction of intestinal iron absorption capacity was the most probable cause of the persistent anemia. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Class II, {{anterior}} open bite {{and/or a}} steep mandibular plane angle are frequently considered a contraindication {{to the use}} of surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE). Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the maxillary and mandibular effects after SARPE on the sagittal and vertical planes, with dissimilar results and small samples of patients. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the sagittal and vertical effects after SARPE. METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive adult patients (7 males, 14 females; mean age, 25. 6 ± 6. 3 years) who required SARPE were included in this study. All patients were subjected to <b>subtotal</b> LeFort <b>I</b> osteotomy with pterygomaxillary disjunction. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken during the preoperative assessment (T 0) and 6 months {{after the end of the}} expansion (T 1). Cephalometric measurements were realized at T 0 and T 1 for all the patients. Independent-sample t test and analysis of variance were used. RESULTS: Statistically significant changes were observed only in upper incisor^NA (P = 0. 04). No skeletal sagittal or vertical variation was found after SARPE. CONCLUSIONS: Class II, anterior open bite and/or a steep mandibular plane angle cannot be considered an outright contraindication to its use. Upper incisor palatal inclination could result after SARPE...|$|R

The remaining 97 cases are analysed according to their histological type, age and sex. 26 patients presented metastases and all died within 3 years. For the 71 patients without metastasis {{the most frequently used}} operations were total thyroidectomy (50), <b>subtotal</b> thyroidectomy <b>i.</b> e. at least one complete extracapsular lobectomy (16), and radical neck dissection when cervical nodes were clinically detectable (26). The survival rate of patients with differentiated carcinoma is 81 % at 5 yr and 73 % at 10 yr; it is 63 % at 5 yr and 47 % at 10 yr in cases of medullary carcinoma. Patients with an undifferentiated giant cell type usually die within the first year. The authors recommend a total lobectomy {{on the side of the}} tumor, the rest of the treatment being adapted to the age of the patient and histological type of tumor. In giant cell undifferentiated carcinoma a simple diagnostic biopsy is the only thing to do. Patients under 40 - 45 yr old with a differentiated carcinoma are candidates for radical unilateral lobectomy and subtotal contralateral resection, with a modified neck dissection in cases with cervical nodes. In all other cases total thyroidectomy with radical neck dissection is generally warranted. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|In North America, {{hysterectomy}} is {{the most}} common major surgery for benign non-obstetric reasons (e. g., uterine fibroids, endometriosis, abnormal bleeding) in premenopausal women. Many of these conditions may result in pelvic pain, sexual and psychological difficulties. However, the capacity of hysterectomy to relieve these problems has not been adequately evaluated. Recently, there has been controversy as to whether less invasive surgeries such as subtotal hysterectomy, in which the uterus is removed and the cervix is left intact, are less detrimental than total hysterectomy, in which both the uterus and the cervix are excised. The first part of this thesis consists of a comprehensive review of the literature on the psychosocial outcomes of hysterectomy published within the past 30 years. Controversial theories, empirical studies, and review articles are discussed with regard to sexual, pain, and psychological outcomes. Findings suggest that while hysterectomy results in reduced pain, there are no strong effects on sexual or psychological functioning. Nevertheless, many studies reported adverse psychosocial outcomes in a subgroup of 10 - 20 % of women post-hysterectomy. The second part of this thesis presents findings from a randomized controlled trial investigating the psychosocial outcomes of total versus subtotal hysterectomy. Premenopausal patients with benign gynecological conditions were randomly assigned to either total hysterectomy, i. e., laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (N= 32), or <b>subtotal</b> hysterectomy, <b>i.</b> e., supra-cervical laparoscopic hysterectomy (N= 31). In addition, two control groups of premenopausal women undergoing minor gynecological surgery (N= 30) and healthy women undergoing no surgery (N= 40) were recruited. For the two hysterectomy groups, abdominal pain was significantly reduced post-surgery. There was some evidence for positive effects of hysterectomy on sexual functioning, while psychological functioning did not significantly change. The study indicated that total and subtotal hysterectomy produced equally beneficial outcomes. Although 3 - 16 % of women reported various adverse effects in psychosocial functioning post-hysterectomy, similar percentages of the two control groups reported such changes...|$|R

Material and Methods Fourteen patients were submitted to SARME through <b>subtotal</b> Le Fort <b>I</b> osteotomy. Both the opening pattern and the mean bone density at midpalatal suture area to evaluate bone formation were assessed pre- and post-operatively (15, 60 and 180 days) through CBCT. Results Type I opening pattern (from anterior to posterior nasal spine) occurred in 12 subjects while type II opening pattern (from anterior nasal spine to transverse palatine suture) occurred in 2 individuals. The 180 -day postoperative mean (PO 180) of bone density value was 49. 9 % of the preoperative mean (Pre) value.

40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: a deficiência {{transversal}} da maxila é caracterizada pela atresia maxilar, palato ogival, apinhamento e rotação dos dentes, além da mordida cruzada posterior (uni ou bilateral). O tratamento dos pacientes com esta deficiência consiste no alargamento das bases ósseas maxilares. Nos pacientes com maturidade esquelética, a expansão da maxila é obtida através de procedimentos ortocirúrgicos (conhecidos como expansão de maxila cirurgicamente assistida - EMCA) que podem gerar efeitos sobre a cavidade e sobre o septo nasal. OBJETIVO: avaliar o comportamento do septo nasal frente aos procedimentos de EMCA. METODOLOGIA: foram avaliadas radiografias cefalométricas em norma póstero-anterior e radiografias oclusais totais de maxila, obtidas pela técnica convencional e posteriormente digitalizadas, de 16 pacientes submetidos à EMCA pela técnica de osteotomia Le Fort <b>I</b> <b>subtotal.</b> As radiografias foram obtidas no período pré-operatório (inicial) e pós-operatório mediato ou ao final da expansão e foram digitalizadas e mensuradas utilizando o programa DIGORA. Foram medidas, ainda, as distâncias entre os dentes (caninos, primeiro pré-molares, segundo pré-molares, primeiros molares e segundos molares). RESULTADOS: após a análise estatística pode-se constatar o aumento das distâncias interdentárias e intermaxilares, além do aumento da largura da porção basal da abertura piriforme e das distâncias entre a parede lateral da porção basal da abertura piriforme e o septo nasal. CONCLUSÃO: a EMCA é um procedimento eficaz, capaz de alargar a porção basal da abertura piriforme, que parece não influenciar no posicionamento do septo nasal. INTRODUCTION: Maxillary transversal deficiency {{is characterized}} by constricted maxillary arch, dental crowding and rotation, along with posterior uni or bilateral crossbite. The treatment of this deficiency {{is based on the}} widening of maxillary bone. In skeletal mature patients the maxillary expansion is achieved by means of surgical-orthodontic procedures (known as surgically assisted maxillary expansion - SAME) that can cause some effects on the nasal cavity and septum. AIM: To evaluate the behavior of the nasal septum after the procedures of SAME. METHODS: Post-anterior cephalometric and maxillary occlusal radiographs, taken by conventional technique and therefore digitalized, were analyzed from 16 patients undergone SAME. For all patients, the SAME technique consisted of <b>subtotal</b> Le Fort <b>I</b> osteotomy. The radiographs were taken before the surgical procedure, right after (mediate post-operatory time) or after the expansion, and thereafter digitalized and measured using DIGORA program. Also, the distances between teeth (canines, first premolars, second premolars, first molars and second molars) were registered. RESULTS: The statistical treatment showed an increase in interdental and intermaxillary distances, along with an increase in the width of the base of piriform aperture and in the distances between the base of lateral wall of the piriform aperture and nasal septum. CONCLUSION: SAME is an efficient procedure that seems not to influence the septum position...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Parathyroid {{hyperplasia}} (PHP) {{is defined}} as an absolute increase in the mass of parenchymal cells of the parathyroid gland. PHP is classified as primary, secondary and tertiary. The enlargement of parathyroid glands (PG) is usually asymmetric, resulting in a “dominant“ gland. In order to confirm the diagnosis, at least two glands should be examined histologically. <b>Subtotal</b> parathyroidectomy, <b>i.</b> e. removal of the three PG and leaving a small remnant of the forth, is the treatment of choice. High percent of PHP recurrence imposes the need for preoperative high sensitivity localizing procedures. Parathyroid scintigraphy localizes about 60 % of hyperplastic glands. The {{aim of this study}} was to correlate findings of subtraction parathyroid scintigraphy (SPS) with weight, pathohistologic finding and oxyphil cell (OC) content of PG in patients with primary, secondary and tertiary parathyroid hyperplasia. Methods. Twenty-seven patients with primary/secondary PHP underwent SPS before surgery. Scintigraphic results were graded from 1 - 5, in relation to the degree of uptake. SPS graded 3, 4 and 5 were considered positive. The number and weight of operated PG were evaluated macroscopically. Pathohistologic and cellular types were defined on standard stained hematoxylin-eosin slides. OC content was defined as a percent of OC and graded from 1 to 3 : grade 1 < 10 %, grade 2 ≥ 10 % and grade 3 ≥ 20 % of OC. Results. SPS localized dominant gland in all patients with sensitivity 100 %, and 51 from 73 hyperplastic PG, with sensitivity per gland of 70 %. PG weighed 0. 1 g to 6. 7 g (median 1 g). A significant positive correlation (p < 0. 0001) was found between the SPS results and PG weight. A significant positive correlation was found between PG weight and OC content (p = 0. 0002). An insignificant correlation was found between SPS and OC content. Thirty-eight PG had < 10 % of OC, 32 PG had < 10 % and 3 PG had ≥ 20 % of OC. Four patients had diffuse PHP and 23 patients nodular PHP. There was no statistically significant difference in SPS results compared to hyperplasia type, and between OC content and hyperplasia type. A significant positive correlation (p = 0. 05) was found between PG weight and hyperplasia type. Conclusion. A high positive correlation was found between SPS results and PG weight, PG weight and OC content and PG weight and hyperplasia type. Between SPS results and OC content, and between SPS results and hyperplasia type, an insignificant correlation was found. Our results showed that SPS is a reliable and very sensitive diagnostic tool in detecting abnormal PG in parathyroid hyperplasia, reaching 100 % sensitivity in detecting a “dominant gland” and sensitivity per localized gland of 70 %. Causes that affect increased uptake of liposolubile Tc 99 m radiopharmaceuticals (RF) in the hyperfunctional PG tissue and conditions which prevent RF admission into the PG cells still remain to be accurately and precisely determined...|$|R
40|$|Objective. {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of laser therapy on bone regeneration in the midpalatal anterior suture (MPAS) after surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (SARME). Methods. Thirteen patients aged between 18 and 33 years old with maxillary transverse deficiency (>= 7. 0 mm) were evaluated. All patients underwent <b>subtotal</b> Le Fort <b>I</b> osteotomy with separation of the pterygomaxillary suture with the use of Hyrax expander, and were divided into 2 groups: control group (n = 6) and laser group (n = 7). A GaAlAs laser (P = 100 mW, lambda = 830 nm, empty set = 0. 06 cm(2)) was used. the laser was applied in 8 treatment sessions with intervals of 48 hours. Each treatment session consisted of laser applications, per point (E = 8. 4 J, ED = 140 J/cm(2)), at 3 points on the MPAS, and total dose of E = 25. 2 J, ED = 420 J/cm(2). Digital radiographs were taken before the surgical procedure and at 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, and 7 -month follow-up visits. Optical density analysis of the regenerated bone was performed using Adobe Photoshop 8. 0 software. Results. Bone regeneration associated with the use of laser after SARME showed a statistically significant difference. A higher mineralization rate was found in the laser group (26. 3 %, P <. 001) than the control group. Conclusion. Low-level laser irradiation (GaAlAs) accelerates bone regeneration in MPAS after SARME. However, the optical density measurements after 7 months of follow-up were lower in comparison with the preoperative measurements.
