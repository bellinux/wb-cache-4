5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections, placing A.obovata in A.sect. Eurylaema, defined as containing those species with one sterile <b>stamen,</b> and perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{held the}} {{opposite}} position; he maintained that Linnaeus's works should be translated as literally {{as possible and}} that the sexual references in the nomenclature should be retained. In 1783 and 1787, the Botanical Society of Lichfield, founded by Darwin {{and several of his}} friends specifically to translate Linnaeus's works, issued their own English translation, A System of Vegetables, that categorized over 1400 plants. Assisted by Samuel Johnson, they coined over fifty new botanical words; it is this work, along with the group's The Families of Plants that introduced the words <b>stamen</b> and pistil into the English language, for example. By 1796 their translation had prevailed and Withering was forced to adopt their vocabulary in later editions of his work.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in type C genes, these {{mutations}} {{affect the}} reproductive verticils, namely the <b>stamen</b> and the carpels. The A. thaliana mutant {{of this type}} is called AGAMOUS, it possesses a phenotype containing petals instead of <b>stamen</b> and sepals instead of carpels.|$|E

25|$|Mutations in type B genes, these {{mutations}} {{affect the}} corolla and the <b>stamen,</b> {{which are the}} intermediate verticils. Two mutations {{have been found in}} A. thaliana, APETALA3 and PISTILLATA, which cause development of sepals instead of petals and carpels in the place of <b>stamen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mutations {{affecting}} flower morphology in Arabidopsis can {{be described}} by the ABC model of flower development. In this model, genes involved in flower formation belong {{to one of three}} classes of genes: A class genes which affect sepal and petal formation, B class genes which affect petal and <b>stamen</b> formation, and C class genes which affect <b>stamen</b> and carpel formation. These genes are expressed in certain regions of the developing flower and are responsible for development of organs in those regions. Agamous is a C class gene, a transcription factor responsible for activating genes involved in <b>stamen</b> and carpel development.|$|E
25|$|In Arabidopsis, {{which has}} been used as a model for {{understanding}} flower development, the double-flower gene AGAMOUS encodes a protein responsible for tissue specification of <b>stamen</b> and carpel flower segments. When both copies of the gene are deleted or otherwise damaged, developing flowers lack the signals to form <b>stamen</b> and carpel segments. Regions which would have formed stamens instead default to petals and the carpel region develops into a new flower, resulting in a recursive sepal-petal-petal pattern. Because no stamens and carpels form, the plants have no reproductive organs and are sexually sterile.|$|E
50|$|A {{characteristic}} of the genus Schlumbergera is that the many <b>stamens</b> are arranged in two series: the inner <b>stamens</b> form a ring around the style; the outer <b>stamens</b> arise from the floral tube. The <b>stamens</b> are pale pink with pink pollen. The style has six to eight lobes at its end and is darker pink.|$|R
60|$|Short-styled form, longest <b>stamens</b> (20 measurements): 14.6. Short-styled form, mid-length <b>stamens</b> (20 measurements): 12.3.|$|R
50|$|A {{characteristic}} of the genus Schlumbergera is that the many <b>stamens</b> are arranged in two series: the inner <b>stamens</b> form a ring around the style; the outer <b>stamens</b> arise from the floral tube. The filaments of the <b>stamens</b> are white, the anthers and pollen being yellow. The style has six to eight lobes at its end and is dark red.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} reported {{observations of}} pollen {{under a microscope}} {{are likely to have}} been in the 1640s by the English botanist Nehemiah Grew, who described pollen and the <b>stamen,</b> and correctly predicted that pollen is required for sexual reproduction in flowering plants.|$|E
25|$|Maize flowers may {{sometimes}} exhibit mutations {{that lead to}} the formation of female flowers in the tassel. These mutations, ts4 and Ts6, prohibit the development of the <b>stamen</b> while simultaneously promoting pistil development. This may cause inflorescences containing both male and female flowers, or hermaphrodite flowers.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in type A genes, these {{mutations}} {{affect the}} calyx and corolla, {{which are the}} outermost verticils. In these mutants, such as APETALA2 in A. thaliana, carpels develop instead of sepals and <b>stamen</b> in place of petals. This means that, the verticils of the perianth are transformed into reproductive verticils.|$|E
30|$|Stigma and anthers {{spatially}} separated: <b>stamens</b> {{are positioned}} higher than stigmas (<b>stamens</b> {{on the right}} and left of flower 1.82 [*]±[*] 0.05  mm; <b>stamens</b> on the upper and lower of flower 0.86 [*]±[*] 0.02  mm, n[*]=[*] 20)[*]=[*] 1.|$|R

50|$|Phyllody of the <b>stamens</b> is rare. In fact, the <b>stamens</b> are {{the least}} likely of the floral organs to be {{affected}} by phyllody. This is thought to be because the <b>stamens</b> are the most highly differentiated organs in flowers.|$|R
25|$|The Asparagales are {{generally}} {{distinguished from the}} Liliales {{by the lack of}} markings on the tepals, the presence of septal nectaries in the ovaries, rather than the bases of the tepals or <b>stamen</b> filaments, and the presence of secondary growth. They {{are generally}} geophytes, but with linear leaves, and a lack of fine reticular venation.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all members}} of the Asteraceae family, Senecio squalidus has a {{composite}} flower head known as a capitulum. What look like single flowers are actually a cluster of florets, each petal or ligule being a flower, or floret, possessing its own <b>stamen</b> and capable of producing the specialized seed of the family Asteraceae, the parachute-like achene.|$|E
25|$|Cross-pollination, {{also called}} allogamy, occurs when pollen is {{delivered}} from the <b>stamen</b> of one flower to {{the stigma of}} a flower on another plant of the same species. Plants adapted for cross-pollination have several mechanisms to prevent self-pollination; the reproductive organs may be arranged {{in such a way}} that self-fertilisation is unlikely, or the stamens and carpels may mature at different times.|$|E

50|$|Amphistemon are erect {{perennial}} herbs or subshrubs {{with the}} unique {{feature in the}} Hedyotis-Oldenlandia group of having <b>stamens</b> inserted at two distinct levels in the corolla tube, the lower <b>stamens</b> with filaments and anthers shorter {{than those of the}} upper <b>stamens.</b>|$|R

25|$|According to Dworkin, in ca. 1988, WAP {{established}} {{a criminal defense}} fund for Jayne <b>Stamen,</b> {{who was convicted of}} manslaughter for arranging a beating of her husband (who died) which followed experience with her husband using pornography and of criminal solicitation for trying to have him murdered after he threatened violence, but the fund was unable to raise bail money for her appeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{composed}} of three sepals and three petals that are seldom noticed by people, they are small and hidden under extravagant stamens. What appear to be petals are the highly modified stamens or staminodes. The staminodes number (1–) 3 (–4) (with at least one staminodal member called the labellum, always being present. A specialized staminode, the <b>stamen,</b> bears pollen from a half-anther. A somewhat narrower 'petal' is the pistil which is connected down to a three-chambered ovary.|$|E
25|$|In A. thaliana, the C {{function}} {{is derived from}} one MADS-box type gene called AGAMOUS (AG), which intervenes both {{in the establishment of}} <b>stamen</b> and carpel identity {{as well as in the}} determination of the floral meristem. Therefore, the AG mutants are devoid of androecium and gynoecium and they have petals and sepals in their place. In addition, the growth in the centre of the flower is undifferentiated, therefore the petals and sepals grow in repetitive verticils.|$|E
50|$|Fertile <b>stamens</b> 6, or 3 and {{alternating}} with 3 staminodes. <b>Stamens</b> and staminodes inserted on tepals. Anthers basifixed and introrse.|$|R
5000|$|Heterostylous plants {{having three}} flower morphs are termed [...] "tristylous". Each morph has {{two types of}} <b>stamens.</b> In one morph, the pistil is short, and the <b>stamens</b> are long and intermediate; in the second morph, the pistil is intermediate, and the <b>stamens</b> are short and long; in the third morph, the pistil is long, and the <b>stamens</b> are short and intermediate. Oxalis pes-caprae, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and some other species of Lythrum are trimorphic.|$|R
50|$|The classes {{based on}} the number of <b>stamens</b> were then {{subdivided}} by the number of pistils, e.g. Hexandria monogynia with six <b>stamens</b> and one pistil.|$|R
25|$|Seeds are {{produced}} from sexual reproduction, involving {{the transfer of}} pollen from the <b>stamen</b> of the pollen parent onto the stigma of the seed parent. In the case of Canna, the same plant can usually play the roles of both pollen and seed parents, technically {{referred to as a}} hermaphrodite. However, the cultivars of the Italian Group and triploids are almost always seed sterile, and their pollen has a low fertility level. Mutations are almost always totally sterile.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the organs present in the four floral verticils {{is a consequence of}} the interaction of at least three types of gene products, each with distinct functions. According to the ABC model, functions A and C are required {{in order to determine the}} {{identity of}} the verticils of the perianth and the reproductive verticils, respectively. These functions are exclusive and the absence of one of them means that the other will determine the identity of all the floral verticils. The B function allows the differentiation of petals from sepals in the secondary verticil, as well as the differentiation of the <b>stamen</b> from the carpel on the tertiary verticil.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1900s, yogurt was {{a staple}} in diets {{of people in the}} Russian Empire (and {{especially}} Central Asia and the Caucasus), Western Asia, South Eastern Europe/Balkans, Central Europe, and India. <b>Stamen</b> Grigorov (1878–1945), a Bulgarian student of medicine in Geneva, first examined the microflora of the Bulgarian yogurt. In 1905, he described it as consisting of a spherical and a rod-like lactic acid-producing bacteria. In 1907, the rod-like bacterium was called Bacillus bulgaricus (now Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). The Russian Nobel laureate and biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, was influenced by Grigorov's work and hypothesized that regular consumption of yogurt was responsible for the unusually long lifespans of Bulgarian peasants. Believing Lactobacillus to be essential for good health, Mechnikov worked to popularize yogurt as a foodstuff throughout Europe.|$|E
60|$|The pistil {{occupies}} the position represented in Figure 4.10, with its extremity considerably upturned, {{but to a}} variable degree; the stigma is seated between the anthers of the longest and the shortest <b>stamens.</b> The six longest <b>stamens</b> correspond in length with the pistil of the long-styled form; their filaments are coloured bright pink; the anthers are dark-coloured, but from containing bright-green pollen and from their early dehiscence they appear emerald-green. Hence in general appearance these <b>stamens</b> are remarkably dissimilar from the mid-length <b>stamens</b> of the long-styled form. The six shortest <b>stamens</b> are enclosed within the calyx, and resemble in all respects the shortest <b>stamens</b> of the long-styled form; both these sets correspond in length with the short pistil of the short-styled form. The green pollen-grains of the longest <b>stamens</b> are 9 to 10 in diameter, whilst the yellow grains from the shortest <b>stamens</b> are only 6; or as 100 to 63. But the pollen-grains from different plants appeared to me, {{in this case and}} others, to be in some degree variable in size. The capsules contain on an average 130 seeds; but perhaps, as we shall see, this is rather too high an average. The seeds themselves, as before remarked, are smaller than those of the long-styled form.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} reddish purple and have 4 sepals, 4 petals and 4 claw-like bundles of <b>stamens.</b> The bundles are all narrow but the upper ones are larger and contain 3 to 5 <b>stamens</b> but the lower two have only 1 or 2 <b>stamens.</b> Flowering occurs from July to November and is {{followed}} by fruits that are woody capsules.|$|R
60|$|From this summary and {{the several}} {{foregoing}} tables {{we see that}} it is only pollen from the longest <b>stamens</b> which can fully fertilise the longest pistil; only that from the mid-length <b>stamens,</b> the mid-length pistil; and only that from the shortest <b>stamens,</b> the shortest pistil. And now we can comprehend the meaning of the almost exact correspondence in length between the pistil in each form and a set of six <b>stamens</b> in two of the other forms; for the stigma of each form is thus rubbed against that part of the insect's body which becomes charged with the proper pollen. It is also evident that the stigma of each form, fertilised in three different ways with pollen from the longest, mid-length, and shortest <b>stamens,</b> is acted on very differently, and conversely that the pollen from the twelve longest, twelve mid-length, and twelve shortest <b>stamens</b> acts very differently on each of the three stigmas; so that there are three sets of female and of male organs. Moreover, in most cases the six <b>stamens</b> of each set differ somewhat in their fertilising power from the six corresponding ones in one of the other forms. We may further draw the remarkable conclusion that the greater the inequality in length between the pistil and the set of <b>stamens,</b> the pollen of which is employed for its fertilisation, by so much is the sterility of the union increased. There are no exceptions to this rule. To understand what follows the reader should look to Tables 4.23, 4.24 and 4.25, and to the diagram Figure 4.10. In the long-styled form the short <b>stamens</b> obviously differ in length from the pistil to a greater degree than do the mid-length stamens; and the capsules produced by the use of pollen from the shortest <b>stamens</b> contain fewer seeds than those produced by the pollen from the mid-length <b>stamens.</b> The same result follows with the long-styled form, from the use of the pollen of shortest <b>stamens</b> of the mid-styled form and of the mid-length <b>stamens</b> of the short-styled form. The same rule also holds good with the mid-styled and short- styled forms, when illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the <b>stamens</b> more or less unequal in length to their pistils. Certainly the difference in sterility in these several cases is slight; but, as far as we are enabled to judge, it always increases with the increasing inequality of length between the pistil and the <b>stamens</b> which are used in each case.|$|R
