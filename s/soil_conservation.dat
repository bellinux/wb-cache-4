5|$|The Civilian Public Service (CPS) was {{a program}} of the United States {{government}} that provided conscientious objectors with an alternative to military service during World War II. From 1941 to 1947, nearly 12,000 draftees, willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service, accepted assignments in work of national importance in 152 CPS camps throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Draftees from the historic peace churches and other faiths worked {{in areas such as}} <b>soil</b> <b>conservation,</b> forestry, fire fighting, agriculture, under the supervision of such agencies as the U.S. Forest Service, the <b>Soil</b> <b>Conservation</b> Service, and the National Park Service.

40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} the {{important}} causes of land degradation. Many <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices have been implemented in order to decrease soil erosion and prevent land degradation for a long period in Yanhe River Basin which is characteristic of serious soil erosion for concentrated rainfall, erodible soil and hilly and gully terrain. <b>Soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices cannot only reduce soil and water loss but also change the situation of the land surface and influence the structure and functions of the eco-system. This study tried to quantitatively assess influence on ecosystem service caused by <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> with the index of ecosystem service value. Ecosystem service value was calculated using the data of precipitation, soil, terrain and <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practice with the guidance of the theory of <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> science and science of ecological economics based on GIS. For the study area the ecological service value of eco-system was 13. 693 billion and 24. 464 billion RMB, respectively, in 1997 and 2006 in the initial state of <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> and 14. 264 and 25. 620 billion RMB in the end state. The ecosystem service value could increase by 0. 571 and 1. 156 billion RMB caused by the accumulated <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices in 1997 and 2006 and <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> improved the quality of environment...|$|R

He is of {{predominantly}} English, as well as Welsh, Irish, and French Huguenot ancestry; Cheney's 8th great-grandfather, William Cheney, immigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 17th century. Although not a direct descendant, he is collaterally related to Benjamin Pierce Cheney (1815–1895), the early American expressman. Cheney is a very distant cousin of both Harry S.

A large camp such as number 57 near Hill City, South Dakota, had five dormitories and housed as many as 172 men building the Deerfield Dam. Later, with projects located in urban areas, the men lived in smaller units, communal housing near their assignments. CPS men typically worked nine hours, six days per week.|$|E
5|$|Suillus collinitus is {{the most}} {{frequent}} fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and <b>soil</b> <b>conservation</b> against erosion in the Mediterranean region. A study performed {{in the south of}} France discovered that S.collinitus and S.mediterraneensis are multi-stage ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may {{play a key role in}} the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites. Roots mycorrhizal with S.collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees. The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries. Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates, such as S.grevillei and S.spraguei, S.collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy. The absence of above-ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations.|$|E

40|$|Research results {{published}} {{regarding the}} impact of <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices in the highland areas of Ethiopia have been inconsistent and scattered. In this paper, a detailed review and synthesis is reported that was conducted to identify the impacts of <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices on crop yield, surface run-off, soil loss, nutrient loss, and the economic viability, {{as well as to}} discuss the implications for an integrated approach and ecosystem services. The review and synthesis showed that most physical <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices such as soil bunds and stone bunds were very effective in reducing run-off, soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Despite these positive impacts on these services, {{the impact of}} physical <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices on crop yield was negative mainly due to the reduction of effective cultivable area by soil/stone bunds. In contrast, most agronomic <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices increase crop yield and reduce run-off and soil losses. This implies that integrating physical <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices with agronomic <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices are essential to increase both provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Additionally, effective use of unutilized land (the area occupied by bunds) by planting multipurpose grasses and trees on the bunds may offset the yield lost due to a reduction in planting area. If high value grasses and trees can be grown on this land, farmers can harvest fodder for animals or fuel wood, both in scarce supply in Ethiopia. Growing of these grasses and trees can also help the stability of the bunds and reduce maintenance cost. Economic feasibility analysis also showed that, <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices became economically more viable if physical and agronomic <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> practices are integrated...|$|R

This implies that older farmers’ are less likely to take <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> and seasonal migration which require more labor.

Thus, younger households’ are active and energized than older households’ in the application of <b>soil</b> and water <b>conservation</b> and seasonal migration as a strategy.

40|$|The new {{fertilizer}} subsidies in Sub-Saharan Africa {{are intended}} to increase agricultural production and ensure fertilizer market development.
