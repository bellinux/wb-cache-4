5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable.

40|$|AIM: <b>The</b> {{objective}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was}} to determine <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operator and the assistant on <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> rate <b>of</b> proximal ART- restorations after 2 years when placed using two methods of tooth-isolation and three glass ionomer cement-brands. STUDY DESIGN: A clinical intervention study. METHODS: Each of 804 children aged 6 - 8 years received one proximal restoration in their primary molars. The restorations were placed by ‘experienced/inexperienced' operators randomly paired with 'experienced/ inexperienced' assistants. The atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) approach was used with 3 brands of glass ionomer cements (GIC) and 2 tooth-isolation methods (rubber dam vs cotton rolls). Trained and calibrated evaluators evaluated the restorations, soon after placement and after 2 years. STATISTICS: The data collected were analyzed using SPSS 14. 0, to determine and relate <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restorations to the operator and assistant with respect to the other factors such as the restorative material used and the isolation method applied. RESULTS: After 2 years, <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restorations was 30. 8 %. In general, there were no statistical significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restorations made by the ‘experienced' vs ‘inexperienced' operators, but individually, the operator with more experience was associated with a significantly higher <b>survival</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restorations. The experienced assistants were associated with significantly higher <b>survival</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restorations. The most ‘experienced' operator paired with any ‘experienced' assistant and using rubber dam tooth-isolation method, was associated with a significantly higher <b>survival</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restorations. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘experienced' operator and assistant using rubber dam tooth-isolation method had <b>the</b> best chance <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> for proximal ART restorations, irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material-brand used...|$|R
