The rationale, the process of strategy development, the intervention procedures, and data obtained are all summarized, and research and practical im-plications presented. More important, reflections on the interventions are offered that may resonate with other intervention researchers. Two decades of research on individuals with learning disabilities (LD) in writing have spawned a small but solid empirical base that continues to expand. In the seventies, researchers highlighted lower order mechanical problems in spelling and punctuation in the compositions of students with LD (e. g., Houck & Billingsley, 1989; Poteet, 1978). In the eighties, reflecting {{the influence of the}} writing-process instructional approach, re-searchers focused on higher order cognitive and metacognitive aspects of writing. They found that like normally achieving novice and poor writers, students with LD had little awareness of the need to plan and revise; essentially, they wrote down whatever ideas came to mind ("knowledge telling, " Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1987). However, in other areas of composing, stu-dents with LD appear to have substantially more problems than their normally achieving counter-parts. Specifically, they have a prominent pro-duction problem in that they write pitifully little (Graham, Harris, MacArthur, & Schwartz, 1991). They also take an inordinate length of time to produce an incredibly small amount of writing. Additionally, more focused investiga-tions of metacognition in writing showed that students with LD had very poor awareness of text structure, the writing process, their own cognitive processes in writing, and what writing involves. Of more concern was their conception of "good writing, " that it is a paper devoid of spelling errors. They also had little understand-ing of the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>paragraph</b> (Englert...|$|E
50|$|Multigenre {{research}} paper {{is an alternative}} to the traditional five paragraph essay commonly used in secondary education. It emphasizes the use of multiple genres to represent a given or chosen research topic. A genre is <b>a</b> specific type <b>of</b> art including literature, speech, drawings, music, etc. With this type of project, students are expected to research their given topic and then present the information they gathered using <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> genres, with <b>an</b> emphasis on writing and composition. The genres created to represent the topic can be put together through the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theme and bracketed by an introduction and conclusion. This creates a unified {{research paper}} that avoids the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traditional five <b>paragraph</b> essay.|$|R

Sometimes it can also be useful to add non-breaking spaces to the first two (or few) short words <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>paragraph</b> to avoid that a single orphaned word is placed to the left or right <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picture or table, while the remainder of the text (with longer words) would only appear after the table.|$|R
