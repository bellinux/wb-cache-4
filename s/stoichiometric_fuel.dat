The first case, second-stage fuel injection into a uniform duct flow, produced data indicating that fuel mixing is considerably slower than estimates {{based on an}} empirical mixing correlation. The second-case, two-stage fuel injection (or second-stage fuel injection into a nonuniform duct flow), produced a large interaction between stages with extensive flow separation. For this case the measured wall pressure, heat transfer, and amount of reaction at the duct exit were significantly greater than estimates based on the mixing correlation.

Nowadays, {{every new}} {{gasoline}} car sold in US, Canada and Europe {{is equipped with}} a three-way catalytic converter (TWC) in combination with a fuel control system {{in order to reduce the}} pollutant emissions.

For this purpose an estimation of the air incoming into cylinders becomes necessary in every driving condition, not only in steady-state operations, but especially during rapid throttle transients. A conventional speed-density equation, that evaluates the air incoming engine, depends on the engine speed and intake manifold pressure. The pressure signal is influenced by sensor dynamic and by pumping fluctuations due to periodic moving masses as engine valves.

40|$|Sulfur {{recovery}} unit (SRU) thermal reactors are negatively affected by high temperature operation. In this paper, {{the effect of}} the fuel mass fraction on the combustion and fluid flow in a SRU thermal reactor is investigated numerically. Practical operating conditions for a petrochemical corporation in Taiwan are used as the design conditions for the discussion. The simulation results show that the present design condition is a fuel-rich (or air-lean) condition and gives acceptable sulfur recovery, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) destruction, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions and thermal reactor temperature for an oxygen-normal operation. However, for an oxygen-rich operation, the local maximum temperature exceeds the suggested maximum service temperature, although the average temperature is acceptable. The high temperature region must be inspected very carefully during the annual maintenance period if there are oxygen-rich operations. If the fuel mass fraction to the zone ahead of the choke ring (zone 1) is 0. 0625 or 0. 125, the average temperature in the zone behind the choke ring (zone 2) is higher than the zone 1 average temperature, which can damage the downstream heat exchanger tubes. If the zone 1 fuel mass fraction is reduced to ensure a lower zone 1 temperature, the temperature in zone 2 and the heat exchanger section must be monitored closely and the zone 2 wall and heat exchanger tubes must be inspected very carefully during the annual maintenance period. To determine a suitable fuel mass fraction for operation, a detailed numerical simulation should be performed first to find the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>fuel</b> mass fraction which produces the most complete combustion and the highest temperature. This <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>fuel</b> mass fraction should be avoided because the high temperature could damage the zone 1 corner or the choke ring. A higher fuel mass fraction (i. e., fuel-rich or air-lean condition) is more suitable because it can avoid deteriorations of both zone 1 and heat exchanger tubes. Although a lower fuel mass fraction (i. e., fuel-lean or air-rich condition) can avoid deterioration of zone 1, the heat exchanger tubes may be damaged. This paper provides a guideline for adjusting the fuel mass fraction to reduce the high temperature inside the thermal reactor and to ensure an acceptable sulfur recovery...|$|E

An average value of 2845 ± 70 K was obtained for CH* rotational temperature in the set up used in the experiments. This value did not show significant change with the type of flame analyzed and it is compatible with the calculated adiabatic flame temperatures of the investigated systems. This temperature value also agrees with that determined by an indirect measurement, using the sodium line reversal method, which is independent from the radical natural emission and well established in literature.

Major portion of today’s energy demand in India is being met with fossil fuels. Hence it is high time that alternate fuels for engines should be derived from indigenous sources.

40|$|Rapid {{compression}} machines (RCM) are laboratory devices used {{to measure}} gas-phase fuel reactivity at conditions relevant to combustion engines. Test mixtures are generally prepared by rapidly compressing a gas phase fuel+oxidizer+diluent mixture to {{high pressure and temperature}} (e. g., 10 - 50 bar, 650 - 1000 K). It is extremely challenging to utilize diesel-relevant liquid fuels in these devices due to their involatility. One proposed method involves the delivery of an aerosol of suspended fuel droplets (∼ 0. 1 mLfuel/Lgas at <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>fuel</b> loading) to the machine. The compression stroke of the RCM subsequently heats the gas phase of the aerosol thereby achieving vaporization of the fuel. The properties of the aerosol delivered to the RCM such as the droplet size distribution (DSD) are critical to ensuring successful execution of the experiments. For instance, the fuel droplets must be smaller than a critical threshold (e. g., d 0 ∼ 6 - 10 μm to ensure timely fuel evaporation and gas-phase mixing; in addition, the droplets must resist gravitational forces that could cause them to fall out of suspension. Low aerosol velocities are required in order to minimize fluid motion and thus heat loss from the compressed reacting gases during the RCM experiment. An aerosol model has been developed in this thesis project {{in order to understand the}} aerosol dynamics during the generation and machine delivery processes. Issues such as droplet impingement, coagulation, evaporation and settling can be investigated with the model, and thus the configuration (i. e., intake valve geometry, mixing chamber design, etc.) and operational characteristics (i. e., gas flow rates, fuel loading, etc.) of the aerosol RCM can be understood/improved/optimized.

40|$|The present thesis gives a {{contribution}} to the study and the modelling of the helium behaviour (from its production to the release) in oxide nuclear fuels. In particular, a model for the production of helium in LWR oxide fuels has been developed and implemented in TUBRNP. The model takes into account the helium produced by alpha decays, (n,alpha) reactions and ternary fissions. At first, it has been verified by means of detailed neutron-transport depletion calculations, performed by means of the VESTA Monte Carlo-depletion code. A good agreement has been found in terms of helium produced and actinides concentrations for both the UO 2 and MOX cases. Finally, the model has been validated against experimental data. In particular, a good agreement has been found in terms of average concentrations and radial profiles of the main alpha- emitters produced in UO 2 fuels. As a second step, the microstructure of oxide fuels has been studied experimentally and theoretically, since it is relevant for the behaviour of the gases. More precisely, grain growth of UO 2 and MOX fuels has been investigated. In fact, grain boundaries strongly influence the diffusion process. As far as the UO 2 is concerned, experimental data of unirradiated fuel pellets have been analysed and interpreted by means of different models available in literature. As far as the MOX fuel is concerned, an experimental campaign has been carried out at JRC/ITU in order to study {{for the first time the}} influence of plutonium content (0, 3. 7, 9, 25 %wt) and fabrication technique (SOLGEL, SBR, MIMAS) on the grain growth of stoichiometric MOX fuels annealed at different temperatures (1350 - 1750 °C). It has been found that normalized size distributions did not change significantly during the annealing and were similar among the different samples. On the other hand, large differences have been noticed in terms of growth kinetics. The slowest kinetics has been experienced by the SBR sample, followed by MIMAS and UO 2 samples, while the two SOLGEL samples had the largest growth. No dependence with the plutonium content has been found and the predominant effect has been attributed to the pore size. In fact, SBR fuel is characterized by the largest and then slowest pores, while SOLGEL is characterized by the smallest and then fastest pores. All things considered, grain growth kinetics of the analyzed samples lies within the large scatter of the values available in the open literature for UO 2 fuels, and the correlation proposed by Sari for <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>fuel</b> is in agreement with the growth experienced by the samples manufactured by means of the SOLGEL technique, which is faster with respect to commercial fuels. This means that the adoption of Sari correlation for commercial MOX fuels could lead to an overestimation of the grain growth, with consequencies for the estimation of the fission gas and helium releases. For the fuel performance, on the basis of the large scatter of the experimental data, the same correlation developed for UO 2 can be used also for MOX fuels. However, a quantification of the effect of porosity and fission gas bubble on the grain boundary movement should be more deeply investigated. As a final step, the transport of helium in the fuel has been investigated. A model for the release of helium in the gap between the fuel and the cladding has been developed, implemented in TRANSURANUS and preliminarily validated on the basis of pressurized and unpressurized fuel rods. The agreement is satisfactory although some discrepancies have been noticed. More experimental data are needed for a better assesment of the model parameters (diffusion coefficients, solubilities) and for a proper validation of the model. JRC. E. 3 -Materials researc...|$|E

Air and fuel-air mixtures are excited by a burst of high-voltage nanosecond pulses (peak voltage 20 kV, pulse duration ~ 25 nanosecond) at a 40 kHz pulse repetition rate and burst repetition rate of 10 Hz. The number of pulses in the burst is varied from a few pulses to a few hundred pulses. The results are compared to the previously developed hydrocarbon-air plasma chemistry model, modified to incorporate non-empirical scaling of the nanosecond discharge pulse energy coupled to the plasma with the number density, as well as one-dimensional conduction heat transfer. Experimental time-resolved temperature, determined {{as a function of}} number of pulses in the burst, is found to agree well with the model predictions. The results demonstrate that the heating rate in fuel-air plasmas is much faster compared to air plasmas, primarily due to energy release in exothermic reactions of fuel with O atoms generated by the plasma. It is found that the initial heating rate in fuel-air plasmas is controlled by the rate of radical (primarily O atoms) generation and is nearly independent of the equivalence ratio.

The pyrolysis of 25 DMF has been re-investigated in a shock tube using the singlepulse method for mixtures of 3 % 25 DMF in argon, at temperatures from 1200 - 1350 K, pressures from 2 - 2. 5 atm and residence times of approximately 2 ms. Ignition delay times for mixtures of 0. 75 % 25 DMF in argon have been measured at atmospheric pressure, temperatures of 1350 - 1800 K at equivalence ratios () of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 along with auto-ignition measurements for <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>fuel</b> in air mixtures of 25 DMF at 20 and 80 bar, from 820 - 1210 K. This is supplemented with an oxidative speciation study of 25 DMF in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) from 770 - 1220 K, at 10. 0 atm, residence times of 0. 7 s and at = 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0. Laminar burning velocities for 25 DMF-air mixtures have been measured using the heatflux method at unburnt gas temperatures of 298 and 358 K, at atmospheric pressure from = 0. 6 - 1. 6. These laminar burning velocity measurements highlight inconsistencies in the current literature data and provide a validation target for kinetic mechanisms. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism containing 2768 reactions and 545 species has been simultaneously developed to describe the combustion of 25 DMF under the experimental conditions described above. Numerical modelling results based on the mechanism can accurately reproduce the majority of experimental data. At high temperatures, a hydrogen atom transfer reaction is found to be the dominant unimolecular decomposition pathway of 25 DMF. The reactions of hydrogen atom with the fuel are also found to be important in predicting pyrolysis and ignition delay time experiments. Numerous proposals are made on the mechanism and kinetics of the previously unexplored intermediate temperature combustion pathways of 25 DMF. Hydroxyl radical addition to the furan ring is highlighted as an important fuel consuming reaction, leading to the formation of methyl vinyl ketone and acetyl radical. The chemically activated recombination of H˙O 2 or CH 3 ˙O 2 with the 5 -methyl- 2 -furanylmethyl radical, forming a 5 -methyl- 2 -furylmethanoxy radical and ˙OH or CH 3 ˙O radical is also found to exhibit significant control over ignition delay times, as well as being important reactions in the prediction of species profiles in a JSR. Kinetics for the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the alkyl side-chain of the fuel by molecular oxygen and H˙O 2 radical are found to be sensitive in the estimation of ignition delay times for fuel-air mixtures from temperatures of 820 - 1200 K. At intermediate temperatures, the resonantly stabilised 5 -methyl- 2 -furanylmethyl radical is found to predominantly undergo bimolecular reactions, and as a result sub-mechanisms for 5 -methyl- 2 -formylfuran and 5 -methyl- 2 -ethylfuran, and their derivatives, have also been developed with consumption pathways proposed. This study is the first to attempt to simulate the combustion of these species in any detail, although future refinements are likely necessary. The current study illustrates both quantitatively and qualitatively the complex chemical behavior of what is a high potential biofuel. Whilst the current work is the most comprehensive study on the oxidation of 25 DMF in the literature to date, the mechanism cannot accurately reproduce laminar burning velocity measurements over a suitable range of unburnt gas temperatures, pressures and equivalence ratios, although discrepancies in the experimental literature data are highlighted. Resolving this issue should remain a focus of future work...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, multi-objective {{optimization}} method has been employed {{to optimize the}} long term performance of an HT-PEM fuel cell based cogeneration system. In {{order to have a}} proper estimation of the long term performance of the plant, the degradation within the fuel cell stack and the fuel processor, has been taken into account. Steam to carbon ratio, auxiliary to process <b>fuel</b> ratio, anodic <b>stoichiometric</b> ratio and <b>fuel</b> partialization factor are considered as the design parameters. In order to investigate the feasibility of addressing an intermittent demand, thermal generation of the plant has been considered as one of the objectives while the electrical efficiency, as an indicator of the system's performance, is considered as the second one. Taking into account the degradation trends, the optimization procedure is carried out in certain time steps, therefore a series of Pareto fronts are obtained and the system design parameters are adaptively optimized...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} the intake flow field, air fuel mixing processes, {{thermodynamic}} performance and emissions output has been investigated {{for a range of}} valve operating profiles. A standard speed load point of 2000 rpm and 2. 7 bar IMEP 720 ° has been reached by throttling the intake whilst running standard cam profiles, by early closing of both inlet valves (EIVC) and by early closing of each inlet individually to generate bulk swirl motions within the cylinder. Data has been recorded at <b>stoichiometric</b> air <b>fuel</b> ratios for both direct injection and port fuelled operation. The valve profiles have been applied to two single cylinder homogeneous gasoline direct injection (GDI) spark ignition engines, developed to investigate the potential of controlling engine load by limiting the inducted air mass using fully variable valve timing (FVVT) to reduce pumping losses at part load. The first engine featured a full length optical liner, allowing 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the intake flow fields to be made, along with Mie imaging studies of the liquid fuel fraction. The second was a thermodynamic engine equipped to measure specific fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2, CO, NOX and THC. The work shows that fuel economy benefits can be gained by operating the engine with unthrottled EIVC operation. However, the interaction between the intake air and direct injection fuel spray means performance is highly dependant upon which valve is operated and the timing of the direct injection fuel spray...|$|R
40|$|Gaseous and {{particulate}} emissions {{have been investigated}} with different air staging strategies {{over a wide range}} of secondary air flow rates. Laboratory scale wood pellet combustor, supplied by an underfeed fuel bed input, is used. The air staging strategies have been employed to study burning rate, temperature in primary and post combustion zones, and NO, CO and PM emissions, taking into account the air to <b>fuel</b> <b>stoichiometric</b> ratio. 50 % CO reduction and 9 times less particle mass concentration than non-staged combustion are achieved by deploying a uniform secondary air module in a higher position from the bed. The minimum NO (37 % reduction than non-staged) measured in the non-uniform air distribution module at the higher flow rate with lower distance from the fuel bed. The results demonstrate a trade-off between NO and CO, PM emissions but also significant potential for reducing particulate and gaseous emissions by deploying air staging in the pellet combustor...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that there are close correlations between the normalized yields of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from the combustion of materials containing nitrogen. In this paper, a generalized relationship using the <b>stoichiometric</b> oxygen to <b>fuel</b> mass ratio (SOFMR) is derived to represent these correlations. Using this generalized relationship, the predicted yields of HCN for nylon in tube furnace experiments and HCN concentrations in full-scale cable fire tests are in good agreement with the corresponding measured data. The derived relationship is used to analyse the contributions of CO from different materials in a complex fire reconstruction. The generalized relationship is then used to predict HCN concentrations in two full-scale nylon fires and the predicted concentrations are compared with both experimental data and predictions from a flamelet model. Finally, a method to incorporate the generalized relationship within CFD fire simulations to determine HCN (or CO) concentrations based on measurements of CO (or HCN) yields is presented...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{experimental studies}} and analyses on the detonation properties of flammable gases that may {{be present in the}} waste storage tanks at Hanford, WA. These studies were carried out in the Explosion Dynamics Laboratory, part of the the Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT). Detonation cell sizes and pressures were measured in the GALCIT detonation tube facility for mixtures of hydrogen, ammonia, methane, nitrous oxide, oxygen and nitrogen. Measurements were made as a function of nitrogen and air dilution for <b>stoichiometric</b> mixtures of <b>fuels</b> and oxidizers and also specific retained gas compositions of tanks such as SY- 101. Chemical kinetic modeling of these mixtures has been performed using the idealized ZND model. Existing reaction mechanisms and rate constant sets were benchmarked against shock tube data available in the literature. Correlations between reaction zone length and detonation cell width were developed {{that can be used to}} correlate and extrapolate the existing experimental data base...|$|R
