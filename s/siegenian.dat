5000|$|Huvenia is a genus of extinct {{plants of}} the Early Devonian (Pragian or <b>Siegenian</b> stage, around [...] ), found in slate {{deposits}} of the Rhenish Massif. The sporophyte generation consisted of leafless stems (axes), which {{appear to be}} flattened, and which branch dichotomously. The strand of conducting tissue contains simple tracheids, making this a vascular plant (tracheophyte). The sporangia (spore-forming organs) are borne {{on the ends of}} short branching stems (sporangiophores) rather than terminating main stems as in some other early land plants. Sporangia appear to be twisted, {{but it is not clear}} whether this feature was present in life or developed after death.|$|E

All other species {{have been found in}} North America and Europe, which formed part of the {{continent}} of Laurussia in the Devonian. The name reflects a belief that the species is 'primitive', with considerable dichotomous branching and a loose, less tightly branched habit. As with all species of Psilophyton, pairs of sporangia were created by dichotomously branching fertile units, although in P. primitivum there were relatively few per unit (4-8) and they were somewhat loosely clustered. Similarities with P. microspinum and P. parvulum were suggested.|$|E
5000|$|Yunia is a genus of extinct {{vascular}} {{plants from}} the Early Devonian (Pragian or <b>Siegenian</b> stage, around [...] ). It was first described from the Posongchong Formation of Yunnan, China. The leafless plant consisted of spiny stems, some 2 to 5 cm wide, which branched dichotomously at wide angles in a cruciate arrangement. Each stem contained vascular tissue {{with one or}} two strands of protoxylem. The spore-forming organs (sporangia) were elongated and borne on short stalks. The spores had a relatively smooth sculptural pattern and were trilete (i.e. each spore has three lines on it resulting from its formation in a tetrahedral set of four spores).|$|E
5000|$|The genus {{was first}} {{discovered}} as fossils of Early Devonian age (Pragian or <b>Siegenian</b> to Emsian, [...] ), consisting of isolated spikes of sporangia (spore-forming organs) found at Beartooth Butte, Wyoming, United States of America. Specimens of D. ovata with sporangia attached to stems were later {{found at the}} same location. The base of the plant remains unknown; the known part was about 8.5 cm high. The sporophyte consisted of narrow leafless stems (axes) 1.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which branched dichotomously. Stems which did not bear sporangia ended in blunt points; fertile branches bore compact one-sided spikes of up to 20 laterally attached sporangia, more-or-less opposite. The sporangia were kidney-shaped (reniform) and had short stalks around 1.5 mm long which curved {{so that all the}} sporangia were {{on one side of the}} stem. The sporangia split (dehisced) distally into two equal parts in order to release the unornamented spores. [...] Specimens from the Pragian flora of Bathurst Island, Nunavut, Canada, were later also assigned to this species, although their sporangia were smaller.|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} sequence of Devonian sediments is exposed {{in the northern}} part of the province of Palencia (NW-Spain), on the southern slope of the Cantabrian Mountains. This study concerns the stratigraphy and paleontology of the Lower Devonian formations. At the base of the sequence a clastic formation is found, called the Carazo Formation. This unit can be sub-divided into three members, from top to bottom: (c) alternating shales and sandstones, (b) quartzitic sandstones, partly strongly ferruginous, (a) shales and micaceous sandstones. Members a and b did not yield fossils. The upper part of the formation is richly fossiliferous. The main element of the fauna consists of brachiopods, which occur together with tentaculites, trilobites, ostracods, and pelecypods. The well-preserved and characteristic brachiopods are illustrated. The fauna indicates a Lower Gedinnian age for these sediments. The next lithologic unit, called the Lebanza Formation, consists of some 100 metres of well-bedded limestones with shale intercalations at the base and top of the formation. This formation is extremely fossiliferous. Brachiopods dominate; tentaculites, trilobites, pelecypods, corals, stromatoporoids, bryozoans, and crinoid stems also occur. The diagnosis and systematic position of 18 of the brachiopods are discussed, viz. 3 dalmanellids; 7 rhynchonellids, including 3 new species; 4 terebratuloids; and 4 rostrospirids. Special attention is paid to the internal structure which was studied in serial sections by means of the peel technique. Drawings of the more important sections are given with each diagnosis. In total, 25 species were determined in the brachiopod assemblage. Different assemblages occur in the upper and lower parts of the formation. The association in the lower part gives no definite indications about the age of these rocks. With their stratigraphical position taken into account, an Upper Gedinnian to Lower <b>Siegenian</b> age is concluded. The upper part of the formation shows only typical <b>Siegenian</b> species. On account of the correspondence with faunas of the Middle <b>Siegenian</b> formations of the Massif Armoricain (Brittany, France), the age of this part of the formation can be established as Middle <b>Siegenian.</b> The correlations with sequences in adjacent areas are discussed.

Related species of Malvinokaffric Realm origin from South Africa, Falkland Islands, Antarctica, South America, and Libya are reviewed, including the poorly known Discina anomala from the Lower Devonian of Germany. The giant size and convexo−planar shells of these discinoids, remarkably similar to recent lim− pets, are interpreted as adaptation to a habitat in proximity of sandy and gravel beaches in a high−energy environment.

The later stages of the Caledonides in the British Isles coincided {{with one of the most}} important events in plant evolution—the appearance of vascular plants. As today the majority of such plants are terrestrial, it may be assumed that the macrofloras occurring in late Silurian and Early Devonian sediments of southern Britain and Scotland record episodes early in the colonisation of land surfaces. Plants of quite different affinities but which also possess anatomical modifications indicating tolerance of hostile drying sub-aerial conditions are sometimes present in the floras.

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of a {{research}} into the Devonian trilobites of the southern Cantabrian Mountains. The systematics of the most common group, the subfamily of the Asteropyginae, forms the major part of this work. More than 50 species, belonging to sixteen (sub) genera are distinguished; thirteen species are newly described and four species are redescribed. It turned out that many species recently described from Aragón, Asturias and the Armorican Massif also occur in the southern Cantabrian Mountains. The find of Metacanthina lavidensis n. sp. in the La Vid Fm. makes it probable that the genus Metacanthina descended from Pilletina in the <b>Siegenian.</b> The morphological features and age of Delocare? dalii n. sp. support the theory that Delocare descended from Paracryphaeus in the <b>Siegenian.</b> A first time a Neocalmonia species N. cantabrica n. sp.) has been found outside Afghanistan. Its morphological features and occurrence in the Huergas Fm. indicate it descended from the genus Bradocryphaeus in the lowermost Givetian. The genus Neocalmonia therefore originated in Europe. The find of G. (Greenops) ultimus n. sp. in the Portilla Fm. prolongs the known existence of the genus Greenops far into the Frasnian. Bradocryphaeus sexspiniferus n. sp. is the first species of Frasnian age with six pairs of lateral pygidial spines which has been found outside Afghanistan. Meraspides of Kayserops obsoletus are discussed. Apart from the Asteropyginae more than 60 other trilobite species are mentioned per stratigraphic level and for the greater part depicted. In the Devonian the trilobite faunas of the Asturo-Leonese and Palentian Basins show a gradually growing difference. In the Gedinnian and <b>Siegenian</b> the difference is not very marked. In the Emsian the Palentian Basin yields, beside common species with the Asturo-Leonese Basin, many elements which indicate a deeper water environment (Odontochile, Reedops, Cheirurus (Pilletopeltis), Xiphogonium and Astycoryphe). In the Middle and Upper Devonian the two basins do not have any species in common. In the Asturo-Leonese Basin Asteropyginae and some subspecies of the “North American” Phacops rana dominate; in the Palentian Basin a restricted fauna occurs which indicates a deeper water environment (with Eocryphops, Paraaulacopleura and Trimerocephalus). It has been attempted to correlate the deposits in both basins with other areas (a. o. Aragón and the Armorican Massif). Most striking are the correlations which have been made of the Requejada Member (Abadía Fm.; Palentian Basin) with {{the upper part of the}} Faou Fm. (Armorican Massif) and of the upper part of the limestone member of the La Vid Fm. (Asturo-Leonese Basin) with the lower part of the Mariposas Fm. (Aragón). As a result of correlations with Asteropyginae within the Ibero-Armorican region a provisional zonation has been designed. It turned out that the Asteropyginae, which originated in the Lower Gedinnian in Europe (or northern Africa) and extended in the Middle Devonian to the east and the west, were restricted to the tropical part of the southern hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|Sterile and fertile shoots of a microphyllous {{vascular}} plant are described from the Lower Devonian Posongchong Formation (? upper <b>Siegenian),</b> Yunnan Province, southern China {{and placed in}} the new taxon Halleophyton zhichangense gen. et sp. nov. The sterile axes are characterized by conspicuous, contiguous swollen rhomboidal to hexagonal leaf bases and relatively broad spatulate laminae. The relief of the leaf bases is not so pronounced in the fertile areas, which bear numerous cauline sporangia with two equal valves. In vegetative characters the new fossils, although smaller and more fragmentary, resemble Drepanophycus gaspianus but in the absence of information on the fertile parts of the latter and because of the controversy surrounding the concept of the genus Drepanophycus, we decided to erect a new genus. Its relationship to the lycophytes sensu stricto is equivocal as exact details of the relationship of sporangium with leaf and sporangium vascularization remain unknown...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new genus and species, Yunia dichotoma, {{collected from the}} Posonchong Formation of <b>Siegenian</b> age in the Wenshan district of Yunnan, China. The spiny axes are characterized by cruciate dichotomy. Associated, but not in organic connection, with the vegetative axes, are numerous elongate elliptical or ovoid sporangia. One small branching system consisting of a single dichotomy bears the basal part of a sporangium, suggesting {{the possibility that the}} sporangia were borne terminally in pairs. Sections of permineralized segments of the axis reveal a columnar protostele, circular to elliptical in transverse section containing one or two roughly circular to transversely elongate (often lunate) regions of large parenchyma cells sparsely interspersed peripherally with tracheids of small diameter. We interpret these regions of parenchyma and tracheids to be protoxylem strands and development of primary xylem to be centrarch. During branching of an axis, the initially single protoxylem region in a branch stele divides precociously prior to the separation of the daughter axes. Thus, the stele may contain two protoxylem strands through considerable ngths of daughter axes between levels of dichotomy. Yunia is tentatively assigned to the Trimerophytales...|$|E
40|$|Re-investigation of permineralized plants {{originally}} called Cooksonia sp. {{from the}} Lower Old Red Sandstone (<b>Siegenian)</b> of Gwent, S. Wales shows {{them to be}} rhyniopsids with simple isotomous branching in smooth axes and ellipsoidal terminal sporangia that are longer than wide and that possess a complex wall organization. They are thus placed in a new genus. The sporangial wall is several cells thick, the outermost comprising a layer with pronounced thickening of the anticlinal and outer periclinal walls, which is interrupted by a zone of thinner-walled cells parallel to the longest dimension of the ellipsoidal organ and considered {{to be involved in}} its dehiscence into two equal halves. The alete isospores have a bilayered wall, the outer interpreted as an ornamented perispore. Similar granular ornament seen on sheets and globules {{in the vicinity of the}} spores and on the innermost surface of the sporangium wall possibly demonstrates the activity of a periplasmodial tapetum. The permineralized sporangia are considered conspecific with those in compression fossils with elliptical outlines and pronounced borders. Comparison of presumed dehiscence mechanisms in a number of Silurian and early Devonian fossils suggests that splitting into two equal valves along the longest dimension, so that a maximum area of spores was exposed to the atmosphere, arose independently in a number of unrelated plants...|$|E

40|$|Conodont faunas were {{collected}} from the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous in an area ranging from the Rio Fsera (prov. of Huesca) {{in the west to}} the Rio Llobregat (prov. of Barcelona) in the east. Most conodont zones and -Faunas recognized in Germany and Spain could be distinguished. The ages of the formations distinguished in the Compte-, Sierra Negra s. l. - and Renanué sub-facies of the Southern facies (Mey, 1968 a) could be indicated quite accurately. The formations in the various sub-facies are lithostratigraphically and chronostratigraphically correlated. There is very strong evidence of a Tournaisian hiatus of changing extent, while the existence of a small Lower Frasnian hiatus is probable and the existence of a <b>Siegenian</b> hiatus in the Compte subfacies might be suggested. Lithostratigraphic correlation of the formations of the Southern facies area with formations to the east, north and west, furnished stratigraphic cross sections, which were used for a reconstruction of the Pyrenean Basin. The picture arises of a basin in which during the Upper Givetian or lowermost Frasnian a central geanticline emerged, the Pyrenean Geanticline. Until the end of the Viséan the Pyrenean Geanticline remained an area of non-deposition. During the Namurian an intermontane basin possibly developed. A lithostratigraphic correlation is presented between the Central Pyrenees and the Palentine facies of the Cantabrian Mountains, which suggests that both areas belonged to the same basin during the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of the monophyletic superfamily Adelophthalmoidea {{suggests that there is}} a basal, hitherto unrecognised genus, Eysyslopterus gen. nov., in the clade, on the basis of carapace shape, anterior ornament and eye position. The two comparatively poorly known genera Pittsfordipterus and Bassipterus form a relatively basal clade and are united by their shared possession of elongated eyes and a type A genital appendage consisting of two articles forming a complex distal termination. The genera Parahughmilleria and Nanahughmilleria are represented in the analysis by only one well-known species each and the monophyly of these two genera re-mains untested. The geologically long-lasting Adelophthalmus is monophyletic and supported by a number of synapomorphies. The clade probably had a marine origin. Most known representatives are brackish (estuarine–deltaic) or freshwater (laminated lacustrine–fluvial) inhabitants, but with a marine influence commonly encountered within the sequences. The fossil record of the clade is relatively poor with a Relative Completeness Index value of between 31 and 34 %. However, the fit between phylogeny and stratigraphical occurrences of the taxa analysed is very good (Stratigraphic Consistency Index = 0. 73; Gap Excess Ratio = 0. 96 – 0. 97). The sister group of Adelophthalmus, the genus Parahughmilleria, is reported for the first time from the Silurian of Lesmahagow, Scotland and these specimens are questionably referred to P. cf. hefteri, previously known only from the <b>Siegenian</b> and Emsian of western Germany and Luxembourg...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen species, one {{subspecies}} {{and five}} varieties of the brachiopod genus Schizophoria {{have been studied}} from parts of the Devonian and Carboniferous of Western Europe. One Carboniferous species and the Devonian subspecies of S. pygmaea are new, and will be formally named in due course. All taxa are shown to be both externally and internally distinct. In the Devonian, Schizophoria is most abundant in the Middle Devonian of the Eifel region (Germany), and in the Lower to Upper Devonian of the Dinant basin (Belgium). In the Carboniferous, Schizophoria is most abundant in the Dinantian of the Dinant basin, and in the C-D zone reef facies of the British Isles. Species of Schizophoria from the Carboniferous are shown to be statistically distinct, when appropriate characters are selected. A detailed knowledge of morphology is necessary before accurate statistical work is undertaken. Insufficient material prevented similar work on Devonian species. Certain Carboniferous species are apparently restricted to particular areas of reef limestone, {{and more than one}} species can in some cases be collected from the same stratigraphical and geographical position. Most of the species are long ranging forms, except Schizophoria provulvaria (Maurer) and S. strigosa (Sowerby) of the <b>Siegenian</b> to Lower Emsian, S. vulvaria (Quenstedt), of the Lower Emsian to Lower Eifelian, and S. pygmaea Struve, of the Eifelian. Schizophoria pygmaea is a dwarf form occurring in two horizons within the Eifelian of the Eifel region. Schizophoria woodi Bond is restricted to the Visean. Phylogenetically the species were probably derived from two root stocks in the Lower Devonian, S. provulvaria and S. strigosa. An earlier ancestor is unknown. Four main lines are recognised in the Carboniferous. Lines of evolution are based externally on outline and ornament, and internally on muscle fields and the form of the brachiophore plates. <p...|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to an evaluation by Biermayr et al. (2007), the geothermal potential in Luxembourg cannot be negated a priori. In the following, it is shown that temperature gradients for the Mesozoic {{are higher than}} about 18 °C km− 1 specified by Biermayr et al. (2007). According to recent TC data for lithotypes and entire formations and a surface heat flow value of 75  mW m− 2 evaluated by Schintgen et al. (2015), average thermal gradients amount to 27.8 °C km− 1 in the Triassic and 32.6 °C km− 1 in the Liassic and Dogger (or Lower and Middle Jurassic). The lower thermal gradient in the Triassic is related to {{a higher proportion of}} sandstone and evaporites such as dolomite presenting a high TC (median 3.2 and 3.8  W m− 1  K− 1, respectively). Except for the Luxembourg Sandstone Formation (median TC 3.6  W m− 1  K− 1), the Liassic marine sediments are generally more fine-grained and characterized by claystone, marlstone, and limestone of relatively low TC (median 2.1, 2.5, and 2.3  W m− 1  K− 1, respectively; Schintgen et al. 2015). The thermal gradient amounts to 30 °C km− 1 for the entire Mesozoic represented in Luxembourg, which constitutes a value characteristic for similar geological environments, e.g., in France and in the Netherlands (Bonté et al. 2010, 2012). In the Paleozoic basement, temperature maps show at each depth a SW-NE-oriented plateau of maximum temperature (Figure  4 a,b,c,d,e,f). For example, maximum temperatures at 5  km depth are in the range of 120 °C to 125 °C according to the thermal model by Schintgen et al. (2015). Temperature in the plateau region exhibits a thermal gradient of about 20 °C km− 1 due to a higher TC of the compact rock in the basement in comparison to the Mesozoic sediments. In the northwest, in the Belgian Ardennes, temperatures are reduced by 5 °C at 1, 000  m depth increasing to 20 °C at 5, 000 and 6, 000  m depth. The reduced temperature is associated with the thinning of the Emsian and <b>Siegenian</b> cover of relatively low TC (3.2  W m− 1  K− 1) and a shallow depth of the Cambrian-Ordovician basement of overall high TC (3.1 to 4.3  W m− 1  K− 1; Schintgen et al. 2015). In the southeast, in the Hunsrück region, temperatures are lower by 10 °C at 1, 000  m depth increasing to 30 °C at 6, 000  m depth. The reduced temperature is related to the high TC of the Taunusquarzit (approximately 5  W m− 1  K− 1).|$|E
40|$|A short {{review of}} the {{literature}} on the stratigraphy of the Devonian and the Lower Carboniferous of the Cantabrian Mountains precedes the report of the author's stratigraphic and palaeontologic observations in León: the Río Esla area (Gedinnian to Viséan), the central Cantabrian area (Famennian to Viséan), and the Gildar-Montó area (Eifelian to Viséan); in Asturias: the coastal area (Frasnian to Viséan); in Palencia: the Arauz-Polentinos area (Gedinnian to Givetian), the Carda 0 ̆ 148 o-Triollo area (Eifelian to Viséan), and the San Martín-Valsurvio area (Givetian and Famennian to Viséan); and in Santander: the Liébana area (Eifelian to Viséan). Most of the conodont faunas, which were extracted from calcareous formations, could be arranged in the zonal succession established in Germany, and thus supplied new data about several formations in the Cantabrian Mountains. The presence of the transgressive Ermita Formation in Asturias and Palencia is demonstrated. The age of this unit ranges maximally from uppermost Famennian to lowermost Tournaisian. The Carda 0 ̆ 148 o Formation ranges from middle or upper Givetian to upper Frasnian. The Vidrieros Formation ranges from {{the upper part of the}} lower Famennian to the lowermost Tournaisian. A synthesis of the stratigraphic data delimits the Palentine facies area, which is clearly separated from the Asturo-Leonese facies area by positive areas. The following palaeogeographic units are distinguished: the Asturo-Leonese Basin, the Palentine Basin, and the Asturian Geanticline. The development of these units from the Middle Devonian to the Lower Carboniferous is demonstrated by eight facies-pattern maps. The sedimentation on the Asturian Geanticline was limited and probably incomplete. An epeirogenetic uplift of this geanticline took place in late Frasnian to early Famennian times. This uplift is correlated with the deposition of the quartzitic Murcia Formation in the sheltered Palentine Basin. The uplifted area was covered by the Ermita transgression in the late Famennian to early Tournaisian. After a break in the sedimentation, a local transgression resulted in the Vegamian Formation in the upper Tournaisian. In most of the area the Alba transgression began in the uppermost Tournaisian or lower Viséan. In the Palentine Basin the deposition of the Alba Formation started in the upper Viséan. The chapter on systematics deals mainly with the most important zonal guide forms of the conodonts. Three new elements are described: Icriodus eslaensis n. sp. from the middle to upper Givetian, Siphonodella? n. sp. a, probably from the upper Tournaisian, and n. gen.

40|$|A {{continuous}} sequence of about 1000 m of Devonian sediments {{has been found}} in the Valsurvio dome, ranging from probable <b>Siegenian</b> to Famennian in age. This sequence of a neritic-littoral facies shows similar characteristics to the Devonian found further west in the province of León. North of the Valsurvio dome, a narrow E—W ridge (zone of San Martin—Camporredondo) has been uplifted by a total of 900 — 1000 m during two periods in the Middle and Upper Devonian. The upheaval of this zone resulted in rapid facies changes, the development of two large hiatuses in the Devonian of this zone and in the totally different facies development north (Rio Arruz area) and south (Valsurvio dome). During Carboniferous time the San Martin-Camporredondo zone {{played an important role in}} sedimentary history. The Carboniferous is subdivided in three groups. The Ruesga group (Pre-Curavacas folding) is developed in the Valsurvio dome as thick massive limestones of the Caliza de Montaña facies, whereas in the San Martin-Camporredondo zone predominantly clastic, reworked and highly mixed sediments of the Culm facies occur; these lithological differences being due to a subsidence of latter zone during sedimentation of the Ruesga group. The sediments of the Yuso group (post-Curavacas and Pre-Asturian folding) are very similar to the Culm facies of the Ruesga group. The Cea group contains at least 1200 m of coal measures, outcropping in a small E—W zone situated at the boundary of the Cantabrian mountains and the meseta of Old Castile. At least four deformation periods have been distinguished: 1. The Curavacas folding phase which caused isoclinal E—W trending folds and altered the incompetent Devonian shales into slates. In the competent Upper Devonian rocks and limestones of the Ruesga group minor folding has played a less important role. Large isoclinal folds dip 60 — 40 ° S. These structures are most typically developed in the Valsurvio dome, but with the facies change into the zone of San Martin-Camporredondo large ESE 2 ̆ 500 WNW tracing lowangle overthrusts developed. The maximum measured thrust movement to the north is about 2. 5 km. 2. In the Asturian folding phase contemporaneous E 2 ̆ 500 W and N 2 ̆ 500 S fold directions occur. A crenulation cleavage has been developed in the already cleaved rocks, whereas in the rocks of the Yuso group a slaty cleavage developed, often subparallel to the bedding. A late recrystallization of small unoriented porphyroblasts of chloritoid has been observed. 3. During a Post-Stephanian (and probable Pre-Triassic) folding phase broad open E 2 ̆ 500 W folds developed, which caused the updoming of the Valsurvio dome and a reorientation of first and second generation structures. In the zone of San Martin-Camporredondo this folding is presented by minor folds and crenulation cleavages, often both developed as conjugate systems. 4. Tertiary deformation. The epirogenetic upheaval of the mountainous area along a set of border faults has caused a steepening of the Cea group, the Cretaceous and the lower part of the Tertiary conglomerates in a small E 2 ̆ 500 W running zone in the south of the area. Together with the development of the WNW 2 ̆ 500 ESE Cotolorno wrench-fault, a flexure like fold has been developed in the Cea group and the Cretaceous. The influence of the Tertiary deformation apart from the wrench faults, is restricted to the southern part of the area...|$|E
40|$|The present {{publication}} {{deals with}} the geology of the area known as the Ida ou Zal, situated principally in the Palaeozoic of the Western High Atlas mountains in Morocco. The area extends grosso modo between Argana (N), Sidi Idir (E), Menizla (S) and Tirkou (W); its centre lies at 34 ° 10 N— 12 ° 65 W. The stratigraphical sequence covers formations from — as we assume — the Infracambrian (loc. Adoudounien) {{up to and including}} the Trias. In the so-called Caledonian geosyncline, extending in a roughly E—W direction along the northern edge of the African shield, series of Older Palaeozoic sediments of some 10 km thickness were deposited starting with the Basal-formation (?) of the Adoudounian (?) and reaching up to and including the Upper-Ordovician (Caradoc?). In the Adoudounian it came to a vehement volcanism with lava extrusions probably of a basaltic or andesitic composition. The Georgian s. s. consists of marbles and limy shales, for the greater part presenting the appearance of what the French call „calcaires scoriacés”. As to the origin of this extraordinary type of rock the present author puts forward a tectonic explanation. A volcanic activity with submarine extrusions of spilitic lavas took place {{at the end of the}} Georgian, probably continuing into the beginning of the Acadian. The Lower Acadian is characterised by re-sedimented tuffs, showing graded beddings. The Sardic tectonic phase reveals itself by at least a disconformity that includes the Potsdamian; a slight angular unconformity between the Ordovician and the Acadian seems probable. Gothlandian (Wenlock-Ludlow) and Devonian (<b>Siegenian)</b> only occur in overthrust sheets. The autochthonous was folded by a Hercynian phase; the tectonic elements are directed N—S in the Western part of the area, curving to neary NE—SW in the East. The author presumes that this folding is related directly to that of the Anti Atlas, where it is attributed to the Second Erzgebirge folding-phase. The palaeozoic of the Western High Atlas may probably be considered as the Northern flank of a wide anticlinorium, the Southern offshoots of the Anti Atlas forming the Southward dipping flank; the Precambrian outcrops in the core. The curving of the tectonic elements in the Western High Atlas and in the Western Anti Atlas is analogous. A hypothesis is set forward that explains the curving through an adaptation of the tectonical elements — whilst folding — to the NW corner of the African shield. Overthrusts developed, probably as a result of later Hercynian tectonic movements, i. c. one of the Asturian phases. A large overthrust can be followed in the field from the extreme SE of the area to its Western part. As far as could be observed the overthrust is mainly composed of Georgian and Acadian p. p. the sandy formation, presumably Acadian, in the present publication known as “Acadien gréseux probable”. Overthrusted Gothlandian and Devonian appear in the Western part of the area, partly between, partly in front of the principal mass of the overthrust. The writer supposes that the root of the overthrust will lie somewhere to the south east. A subsiding basin was formed during the greater part of the Stephanian and the beginning of the Autunian, in which lacustrine sediments — first red, later greenish — were deposited, covering a pre-existing relief. The total thickness amounts to at least 1500 m, the formation bears all characteristics of a post-orogenetic suite. It is taken that the lake can be considered as an Intramontane trough (Umbgrove); the longitudinal extension was parallel to the direction of the structural elements of the basement i. e. N—S. It is assumed that the whole width of the area was part of the basin. The area was lifted and slightly folded in about E—W direction by the Post-Autunien tectonic phase (Saalian phase). The „Agadir ou Anzizen fault” originated during or after the folding; the author assumes that at this stage other E—W faults came into being as well. In the case of the Agadir ou Anzizen fault, the southern block subsided with respect to the northern block. In the area all of the Stephano-Autunien sediments N of the fault were eroded. There the Trias covers directly the pre-Stephanian Palaeozoic, while on the other side the Trias overlies Stephano-Autunien, from which it is separated by an angular unconformity. The Trias has a typical molasse fades; it is completely composed of red sediments, attaining a thickness of about 2400 m, not counting the conglomerats at its base. The source of the sedimentary material probably must be sought in the southeast. According to the writers conception the first Triassic deposits were deltaic in a lake, covering a pre-existing relief. After the lake had been filled-up, a sandy and marly sedimentation developed, partly in lagoonal environment. The Triassic sedimentary sequence ended with the deposition of red clays that were overlain by basaltic lavas. The dioritic volcanic vent near Zarhenrhin has probably been one of the feeders of the extrusions. The dioritic dyke system too, is probably connected with the Late-Triassic volcanic period. Perhaps there exists a relation between the iron mineralisation near Agadir ou Anzizen and the occurrence of the dioritic dykes. The Alpine orogeny slightly folded the Triassic with an E—W direction. Principally however the Alpine tectonics revealed itself in faulting: all of the E—W faults show an Alpine shift, possibly a rejuvenation of a late-Hercynian fault system. An erosion-plane was formed during a period of quiet, on grounds of analogy supposedly the “Surface préhammadienne”. An erosion plane on a lower level may probably be taken for the “Surface villafranchienne”. Between these two the configuration of the topography permits to distinguish some relics of intermediate levels, indicating the action of tectonic pulsations. Terraces were formed as a consequence of climatical changes during the Pleistocene...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} decade, {{there is an}} {{increased}} interest in the processes active {{at the base of}} the seismogenic crust, with a particular focus on the evolution and characterisation of elevated fluid pressures that could possibly drive fault rupturing and initiate major earthquakes. The base of the seismogenic zone, however, is not directly accessible. One of the possibilities to overcome this research problem is the study of natural fossil analogues to pursue a better understanding of the formation and evolution of these overpressured fluids at relatively great depths. Within the broad framework of natural analogues, vein studies provide an important insight in the characterisation of fluids and the role of fluid pressure during a complete deformation cycle. In vein analysis, an extensive interdisciplinary approach is required in order to determine a fluid-assisted deformation during orogeny. This research project focuses on overpressured fluids that are generated in a sedimentary basin during late burial that is affected by an incipient tectonic shortening at the onset of orogeny. Quartz veins that result from the overpressures in sedimentary basins preserve valuable information on the metamorphic fluids which were present during burial and subsequent orogenic deformation. A detailed geometric and kinematic structural analysis of several successive quartz vein types has been performed to allow constraining a geometric evolutionary model of the emplacement of these different, successive veins with respect to structural features such as bedding, cleavage, folds and faults. This model is refined by means of a pervasive microstructural and microthermometric analysis of the vein infill in order to implement physico-chemical parameters such as formation temperature and pore-fluid pressure. Ultimately, this study aims at understanding why, how and when fluids become overpressured and how they subsequently evolve at the onset of orogeny. More specifically, the study focuses on Lower Devonian multilayer siliciclastic metasediments that were deposited in the Ardenne-Eifel basin. This basin formed part of the northern passive margin of the short-lived Rhenohercynian Ocean which was closed during the Variscan orogeny. These metasediments are currently exposed in the High-Ardenne slate belt (Belgium, France, Luxemburg & Germany), which belongs to the central part of the Rhenohercynian foreland fold-and-thrust belt in the northern extremity of the Central European Variscan belt. The rocks, in which quartz veins frequently occur, are studied in the north-eastern part of the High-Ardenne slate belt (Rursee, Urftsee; North Eifel; Germany) and are affected by a very low-grade metamorphism, which is considered to have a burial origin, pre- to early synkinematic with the prograding Variscan deformation. This metamorphism documents the peak of subsidence and sediment accumulation (at about 7 km) prior to the main Variscan contraction of the basin. The analysis focuses on two successive quartz vein types, oriented normal and parallel to bedding respectively, in which the very low-grade metamorphism is reflected. A first vein type consists of several generations of bedding-normal veins that remain perpendicular to bedding around the characteristic, NW-verging, upright to overturned folds of the North Eifel, thereby clearly predating the main Variscan contraction and fold-and-cleavage development of the slate belt. The planar to lensoid veins are mostly restricted to competent sandstone layers, although they sometimes continue into the adjacent incompetent layers, refracting at the competent-incompetent interface, similar to cleavage. The fabric of the bedding-normal veins predominantly shows a fibrous to elongate-blocky vein infill in which the fibres or the elongated crystals are oriented at high angle to the vein walls. Both syntaxial and ataxial growth morphologies are recognised. Repetition of host-rock inclusion bands internally in the vein quartz reflects episodic opening of the vein by the crack-seal mechanism. Pseudosecondary fluid-inclusion planes, oriented at high angle to the crystal fibre walls and reflecting intracrystal healed microcracks, confirm that crystal growth occurred by incremental crack-seal steps. The specific orientation of fluid-inclusion planes and host-rock inclusion bands indicate that the veins are extension veins which originally grew in Mode I fractures in a rock that was already significantly reduced in porosity during burial. The fluid-inclusion planes have been particularly useful as a microstructural marker to reconstruct the stress state in the basin at the time of vein formation. In this respect, the maximum principal stress (sigma 1) was still vertical, corresponding with load of the overburden (sigma V) and the veins opened perpendicular to the least principal stress (sigma 3), that roughly indicate the extension direction in the basin. The propagation of fractures during vein formation occured in the sigma 1 - sigma 2 plane. Secondary inclusion planes, corresponding to post-veining transcrystal microcracks oriented parallel to the vein walls, evidence that microcracks still developed after opening of the extension veins but still in a similar stress regime as the pseudosecondary inclusion planes. The consistent pre-folding orientation of bedding-normal veins in the North Eifel corresponds to the pre-folding orientation of intermullion quartz veins in the central part of the High-Ardenne slate belt (Ardennes, Belgium) highlighting that this veining event occurred regionally. The (micro) structural analysis of bedding-normal veins eventually shows that these veins developed at low differential stress during the lateststage of the extensional stress regime and reflect a regional NW-SE opening of the Ardenne-Eifel basin. A structural change of the pre-folding vein orientation from NW-SE (Ardennes) to NNW-SSE (Eifel) is probably related to a post-veining oroclinal bending of the slate belt during the main Variscan contraction due to the presence of the rigid Brabant basement in the north. Apart from the orientation analysis, the spatial distribution of these bedding-normal quartz veins in the High-Ardenne slate belt is investigated in order to determine the effect of the layer thickness to vein spacing. The results show a quasi linear relationship between vein spacing and layer thickness in thin ( 40 cm). Vein spacing tends to increase to a maximum value becoming more or less independent of layer thickness. The resemblance of vein spacing with regularly spaced fractures that result from saturation during fracture development, suggests that in an unfractured rock, the host rock can get saturated by the presence of initial veins in which the veins subsequently either grow by progressive extension or that new cross-cutting veins develop in case the regional stress field changes relatively with respect to the existing veins. In the North Eifel, bedding-parallel quartz veins cross-cut, truncate and offset the bedding-normal veins and are continuously present around fold hinges. Bedding-parallel veins occur interbedded between two contrasting lithologies, as well as intrabedded in the competent and incompetent sequences. Macroscopically, the veins show a composite internal fabric consisting of several distinct generations of quartz laminae, often marked by slickenlines, intercalated with thin pelitic wall-rock inclusion seams. Microscopically, the variety in microstructures is indicative of different combined mechanisms of vein growth and mineral infill, reflecting a complex vein formation. Repeated crack-seal inclusion bands that are oriented parallel to the vein wall, and thus parallel to bedding, reflect bedding-normal opening of crack-seal quartz laminae. This mechanism also is also evidenced by the alignment of pseudosecondary fluid-inclusion planes internally in the fibres. The presence of blocky laminae reflects crystal growth in an open cavity during bedding-normal uplift. Bedding-parallel stylolites in often occur in these blocky laminae and represent pressure-dissolution during bedding-normal collapse. The occurrence of shear laminae, in which small quartz crystals are dynamically recrystallised during the main phase of the Variscan contraction, has, on the other hand, been used as indicator of bedding-parallel shear events. The pronounced bedding-parallel fabric is interpreted to form during several alternating phases of bedding-normal uplift and bedding-parallel shearing taking place at the onset of folding. Based on the microstructural analysis, the bedding-parallel veins are classified as extension veins to extensional-shear veins that formed at low differential stress. This vein type is the brittle expression of the first phases of the compressional stress regime affecting the siliciclastic metasediments of the Ardenne-Eifel basin at the onset of Variscan shortening. In this configuration, the bedding-parallel veins demonstrate a particular stress-state in the basin at the time of vein formation in which the maximum principal stress (sigma 1) was oriented parallel to a NW-SE-oriented tectonic compression (sigmaT) and the minimum principal stress (sigma 3) corresponded to the vertical load of the overburden. The succession of bedding-normal to bedding-parallel extension quartz veins thus materialises the transition from extension to compression at the onset of Variscan orogeny and is interpreted to have formed during early orogenic compressional tectonic inversion. A petrographic and micro-thermometric analysis of fluid inclusions within the vein quartz has further helped to constrain the kinematic and pressure-temperature trapping conditions of both vein types, allowing the reconstruction of the fluid pressure and stress-state evolution during tectonic inversion. The method used for defining the trapping conditions involves cross-cutting isochores, calculated from the salinity and homogenisation temperatures representative of both vein types, with an independent vitrinite reflectance geothermometer that defines the maximum temperature of 250 degrees&# 176;C at the time of vein formation. The results demonstrate that the bedding-normal extension veins are trapped from a low salinity (3. 5 - 8 eq. wt. % NaCl) H 2 O-NaCl fluid at near-lithostatic fluid pressures prior to inversion. After the tectonic inversion, bedding-parallel veins formed from a low salinity (4 - 7 eq. wt. % NaCl) H 2 O-NaCl fluid at lithostatic to supra-lithostatic fluid pressures during the early stages of the compressional stress regime. Subsequently, during progressive Variscan contraction both vein types were passively folded within characteristic, NW-verging, upright to overturned folds of the North Eifel. In contrast to both extensive veining events that characterise the tectonic inversion, quartz veining occurred rather occasionally during the main compression stage of orogeny. This kinematic history eventually shows a clear relationship between fluid-pressure evolution and the stress-state changes in the basin and exemplifies that (supra&# 8209;) lithostatic overpressures are easier to maintain during compressional tectonic inversion at the onset of orogeny, than during the main phase of compression. This intimate relationship during the stress-state evolution from extension to compression is illustrated by plotting the changing differential stress (sigma 1 -sigma 3) against the vertical effective stress and the fluid-pressure evolution in a 2 D brittle failure mode plot. The results show that the two vein types, which are induced at elevated to (supra&# 8209;) lithostatic fluid pressures, can only form at low differential stress closely related in time to the tectonic switch. The tectonic setting and the localised stress state in the basin are thus both crucial to determine whether the lithostatic fluid overpressure can be sustained by a rock prior to failure at depth. These 2 D brittle failure mode plots are moreover very useful to visualisethe influence of rock parameters such as the tensile strength of rock on the maximum overpressures that can be built up during the transition between two stress regimes. This regional aspect of fluid redistribution within overpressured fluid reservoirs contrasts with the more localised fluid flow along fault systems caused by fault-valving. The 3 D aspect of stress transitions during tectonic inversion of a crust is, however, much more complex than represented in a 2 D brittle failure mode plot. The tectonic switch, illustrated in these brittle failure mode plots, occurs at a specific isotropic stress state in which the three principal stresses are equal and sigma 1 - sigma 3 = 0. The chance that a stress state in the Earths crust equals an isotropic pressure state is, however, highly improbable. The 2 D stress-state evolution visualised in the brittle failure mode plots is therefore an oversimplification of the actual 3 D stress-state evolution in the Earths crust. To discuss the 3 D aspects of stress transitions and to illustrate the complexity of triaxial stress transitions during inversion of Andersonian stress regimes, possible 3 D stress-state evolutions are reconstructed based on the bedding-normal and bedding-parallel veins reflecting the early Variscan tectonic inversion. From these 3 D stress-state reconstructions is concluded that, no matter what orientation of basin geometry or shortening, a transitional wrench tectonic regime should always occur between extension and compression. This transitional stage should contribute to the permeability enhancement during tectonic inversion, although structures that are related to this transitional stage have not yet been reported in a shortened basin affected by tectonic inversion at low differential stress. Ideally, a transitional wrench tectonic regime should be implemented in brittle mode plots at the tectonic inversion. It has been concluded from this research that the naturally fractured Ardenne-Eifel basin can serve a possible analogue to the present upper crust by its regional extent of overpressuring, but more importantly by demonstrating that a tectonic inversion from extension to compression at the onset of orogeny is the crucial timing during which maximum (lithostatic) overpressures can be sustained.
