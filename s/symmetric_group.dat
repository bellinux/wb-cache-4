5|$|Analogously, the {{alternating}} {{group is a}} subgroup of index 2 in the <b>symmetric</b> <b>group</b> on n letters. The elements of the {{alternating group}}, called even permutations, are the products of even numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, is an even permutation since zero is even; it is the identity element of the group.|$|E
5|$|These {{operations}} {{define a}} symmetry relation between equivalent grids. Excluding relabeling, and {{with respect to}} the 81 grid cell values, the operations form a subgroup of the <b>symmetric</b> <b>group</b> S81, of order 3!8×2=3,359,232. Applying the above operations on majority of the grids results in 3!8×2×9! essentially equivalent grids. Exceptions are Automorphic Sudokus which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{distinct}} solutions {{can also be}} identified with Burnside's Lemma. For a solution, the set of equivalent solutions which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an orbit of the <b>symmetric</b> <b>group.</b> The number of essentially different solutions is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's lemma. The Burnside fixed points are solutions that differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell computed the number of essentially different (symmetrically distinct) solutions as 5,472,730,538.|$|E
