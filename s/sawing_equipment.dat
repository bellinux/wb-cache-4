40|$|Experiments {{with early}} entry light sawing of Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) contraction joints began in Iowa in 1989. Since that time, changes in early <b>sawing</b> <b>equipment</b> have occurred {{as well as}} changes in specifications for sawing. The option to use early sawing for transverse contraction joints was specified in 1992. A problem happening occasionally with early sawing was the break out {{of some of the}} concrete around the end of the joint as the saw blade approached the edge of the slab. To prevent this, it was proposed that the sawing would terminate approximately 1 / 2 " to 3 / 4 " before the edge of the slab, creating a "short joint". This procedure would also leave a concrete "dam" to prevent the run-out and waste of the hot liquid joint sealant onto the shoulder. It would also eliminate the need for the labor and material for applying a duct tape dam at the open ends of each sawed joint to stop hot liquid sealant run-out Agreements were made with the contractor to apply the "short joint" technique for 1 day of paving. The evaluation and results are compared with an adjoining control section. The research found no negative aspects from sawing the "short joint". Three specific findings were noted. They are the following: 1) No joint end "blow-out" spalls of concrete occurred. 2) The need for the duct tape dam to stop liquid sealant overflow was eliminated. 3) Joint end corner spalls appear to be caused mainly by construction shouldering operations equipment. The "short joint" sawing technique can be routinely applied to early entry sawed transverse contraction joints with expectations of only positive results...|$|E
40|$|The 1 - 3 {{connectivity}} composite transducers comprise active piezoceramic pillars {{within a}} passive polymer matrix. The first stage in manufacturing the 1 - 3 material {{is to produce}} a bristle block (comprising a solid stock of active material with protruding pillars) by injection moulding or by dicing a piece of ceramic using precision <b>sawing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The bristle block is filled with a reactive polymer liquid that produces the passive polymer phase, and the filled block is machined to the desired dimensions. For optimum performance, the polymer phase should have complementary interaction with the ceramic phase as well as imparting dimensional stability. Epoxy-based polymers are the most usual passive materials because of their low viscosity in the uncured state and solvent resistance, coupled with their excellent adhesive, mechanical, and electrical properties. However, the curing of epoxy resins results in shrinkage of the polymer matrix and internal stress within the passive phase. This can lead to prestressing of the active ceramic material, distortion of pillars, reduction in the parallelism between the sides of pillars, acid, in certain circumstances, warpage of transducers. This is particularly evident when the solid stock in the bristle block is relatively thin. This paper reports the in situ modification of epoxy in the bristle block by UV-based low temperature polymerization of acrylate monomers within the epoxy matrix prior to polymerization of the epoxy resin. Internal stress measurements are presented to quantify the influence of this modification via a reduction of internal stress within the polymer matrix. Results from finite element analysis emphasise the conclusions of the experimental work, and examples of manufactured devices are presented. Composite transducer performance is assessed by laser measurement of surface displacement profiles, and a 50 % improvement in surface displacement magnitude was observed for the modified devices...|$|E

As assistant to Scott, Thomson built railroads and bridges as well as directed the transport of troops and supplies. Thomson was relieved of military duty in June 1864, and appointed Superintendent of the Eastern Division of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. He served in this position until 1873, when he was appointed Superintendent of Motive Power of the PRR at Altoona, and in 1874, General Manager of the PRR system east of Pittsburgh and Erie.

40|$|Branches {{on trees}} {{introduce}} defects on sawn timber called knots. By scanning sawlogs using computed tomography, knots {{can be detected}} and accounted for so that the sawing process can be optimized with respect to outgoing product value. How the optimization should be done differs depending on available <b>sawing</b> <b>equipment</b> and the production strategy of the sawmill. It is important to investigate interesting production strategies with computer simulations to obtain an approximation of the profitability for a sawmill if investing in a computed tomography scanner. Another important step in the optimization process is to automatically segment knots {{so that they can}} be used by a computer when optimizing. This thesis presents an algorithm that automatically segments knots from computed tomography images of logs. The algorithm uses variable thresholds to segment knots on cylindrical shells of the computed tomography images. The knots are fitted to ellipses and matched between several cylindrical shells. The algorithm was tested on a variety of Scandinavian Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) with a knot detection rate of 88 - 94 % and generating about 1 % falsely detected knots. Knots are defects with high impact on boards that are graded with respect to their bending strength. Some sawmills specialize in the production of such boards and this thesis includes a simulation study of sawing Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) logs to optimize the outgoing board value for such a sawmill. The production strategy investigated in this thesis was scanning of sawlogs with computed tomography and optimizing the rotational positioning of the logs in the sawing process. This study showed a possible mean value increase of the sawn timber by 11 %. There are additional degrees of freedom in log breakdown than rotational positioning, such as log spatial position, skew and which sawing pattern to use. If every possible combination of sawing parameters would be simulated, enormous computational resources would be required. A study made in this thesis investigates the feasibility to use only parts of the knot information when optimizing log rotational position. This is done by projecting all knots to a plane perpendicular to the log lengthwise direction and filter out the least significant knots. The study showed a great challenge in this approach and the presented algorithm was insufficient in its present form to compete with alternatives that use full information of the knots.

5000|$|To {{start when}} looking at saws {{there are a few}} types to choose from, {{including}} M-Tooth, and Peg and Raker. Depending on your skill level most beginners will start on a M-Tooth because they are a much more [...] "forgiving" [...] saw and move up to the Peg and Raker as they become better. These saws can run you anywhere from $1000 to $2500. Next are the bow saws, not like the ones you can buy commercially. These frames and blades are 42" [...] long, but for most of the bow <b>saw</b> <b>equipment</b> you'll be having to look much harder to find it. Now we have the axes, {{these are some of the}} sharpest and precise tools that you'll use. There are many different grinds and makes. Some of the more popular ones are Tuatahi and Keech, but there are others starting to become more popular such as Brute Force. The racing axes will run you around $550 and practice axes around $200.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{research}} is {{a new type of}} the multirip saw machine with circular reciprocating saw blades. This machine has a number of advantages in comparison with other machines of similar purpose. The paper presents an overview of different types of <b>saw</b> <b>equipment</b> and describes basic characteristics of the machine under investigation. Using the concept of lifecycle management of the considered machine in a unified information space is necessary to improve quality and competitiveness in the current production environment. In this lifecycle all the members, namely designers, technologists, customers, etc., have a philosophy to tend to optimize the overall machine design as much as possible. However, it is not always possible to achieve. Conversely, at the boundary between the phases there are several mismatching situations, if not even conflicting inconsistencies. For example, improvement of mass characteristics can lead to poor stability and rigidity of the saw blade. Machine output improvement through increasing frequency of the machine motor rotation, on the other side, results in reducing stable ability of the saw blades and so on. In order to provide a coherent framework for the collaborative environment between the members of the life cycle, the article presents a technique to construct a mathematical model that allows combining all different members’ requirements in the unified information model. The article also gives analysis of kinematic and dynamic behavior and technological characteristics of the machine. Describes in detail all the controlled parameters, functional constraints, and quality criteria of the machine under consideration. Depending on the controlled parameters, the analytical relationships formulate functional constraints and quality criteria of the machine. The proposed algorithm allows fast and exact calculation of all the functional constraints and quality criteria of the machine for a given vector of the control variables. Based on the obtained unified information model, a multi-criterion problem has been formulated for the process of automated synthesis and rational choice to design and manufacture the multirip saw machine of new generation. </p...|$|R
