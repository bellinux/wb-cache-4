50|$|CNC mills use {{computer}} {{controls to}} cut different materials. They {{are able to}} translate programs consisting of specific numbers and letters to move the spindle (or workpiece) to various locations and depths. Many use G-code, which is a standardized programming language that many CNC machines understand, while others use proprietary languages created by their manufacturers. These proprietary languages, while often simpler than G-code, are not transferable to other machines. CNC mills have many functions including face milling, <b>shoulder</b> <b>milling,</b> tapping, drilling and some even offer turning. Standard linear CNC mills are limited to 3 axis (X, Y, and Z) which allows for 2.5D machining, but others may also have one or more rotational axes which allow for advanced 3D machining. Today, CNC mills can have 3 to 6 axes.|$|E

A Lagrangian formulation with an explicit solution scheme and a penalty contact algorithm has been used. Many experiments were performed in <b>shoulder</b> <b>milling</b> configurations {{in order to}} study the machinability of this material and also to validate the results obtained from the developed 3 D finite element model. In the simulations, the material behaviour is modelled with a classical Johnson-Cook law. Some enhancements and simplifications {{had to be made}} in geometry, meshing, friction and temperature considerations for limiting the calculation time. The final aim consists to obtain realistic numerical cutting forces for <b>shoulder</b> <b>milling</b> operations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{developing}} a statistical model to predict cutting force {{in terms of}} machining parameters such as cutting speed, cutting feed rate and axial depth of cut. Response surface methodology experimental design was used for conducting experiments. The work piece material was Aluminum (Al 7075 -T 6) and the tool was a <b>shoulder</b> <b>mill</b> with two carbide insert. The cutting forces were measured using three axis milling tool dynamometer. The second order mathematical model in terms of machining parameters was developed for predicting cutting force. The adequacy of the predictive models was tested by analysis of variance and found to be adequate. The direct and interaction effect was graphically plotted which helps to study {{the significance of these}} parameters with cutting force. The optimization of <b>shoulder</b> <b>mill</b> machining parameters to acquire minimum cutting force was done by genetic algorithms (GA). A Matlab genetic algorithm solver was used to do the optimization...|$|R

40|$|Following a {{comprehensive}} review on titanium machining and methods of cutting fluid application, this paper presents a new Controlled cutting fluid impinging supply system (Cut‐list) developed to deliver an accurate amount of cutting fluid into the machining zone via wellpositioned coherent nozzles based on the calculation of the heat generated. The performance {{of the new system}} was evaluated against a conventional flood cutting fluid supply system during step <b>shoulder</b> <b>milling</b> of Ti‐ 6 Al‐ 4 V using vegetable oil‐based cutting fluid. The comparison was performed at different cutting speeds and feed rates. Comparison measures/indicators were cutting force, workpiece temperature, tool flank wear, burr formation and average surface roughness (Ra). The new system provided significant reductions in cutting fluid consumption of up to 42 %. Additionally, reductions in cutting force, tool flank wear and burr height of 16. 41 %, 46. 77 %, and 31. 70 % were recorded, respectively. Smaller Ra values were also found {{with the use of the}} new system...|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{cutting fluid}} impinging supply system (CUT-LIST) {{was developed to}} deliver an accurate amount of cutting fluid into the machining zone via well-positioned coherent nozzles based on a calculation of the heat generated. The performance of the CUT-LIST was evaluated against a conventional flood cutting fluid supply system during step <b>shoulder</b> <b>milling</b> of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using vegetable oil-based cutting fluid. In this paper, the micro-hardness of the machined surface {{was used as the}} main criterion to compare the two systems. CUT-LIST provided significant reductions in cutting fluid consumption (up to 42 %). Both systems caused increased micro-hardness value at 100 µm from the machined surface, whereas a slight reduction in micro-hardness of 4. 5 % was measured when using CUL-LIST. It was noted that the first 50 µm is the soft sub-surface promoted by thermal softening, whereas down to 100 µm is the hard sub-surface caused by the cyclic internal work hardening and then gradually decreased until it reached the base material nominal hardness. It can be concluded that the CUT-LIST has always given lower micro-hardness values near the machined surfaces in all conditions investigated...|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Monk's {{theory about}} Lorber and Stipe getting {{shot by the}} same person is thrown into question. Monk and Natalie {{head back to the}} San Francisco Airporter, where they are once again at a crime scene outside the {{convention}} center and Disher is once again talking to a frantic witness. This time, however, the victim is Kingston Mills. Stottlemeyer and Disher try to coax Judson Beck into getting out of his car, but Beck refuses, forcing Randy to drag him from the scene. It appears that Mills arrived at the convention in his chauffeured car, {{and as soon as he}} got out, a gunman dressed as Mr. Snork shot him in the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>Mills</b> tried to run, but the shooter shot him in the leg and blew him off his feet, then stepped up to the victim and shot him in the back, fatally. Monk has only two theories: A) the hit man is trying to lead them astray or B) this is a copycat killing committed by someone taking advantage of the publicity caused by Stipe's murder, although Stottlemeyer insists that both shootings are connected, as this shooter wore a Beyond Earth costume identical to the first shooter's one. Monk however, notices a crucial clue: Mills was shot three times, and only the last bullet was fatal, but Conrad Stipe was shot only once (in the heart). Also, whereas in the Stipe shooting, the killer made sure to be seen, the Mills shooting had the killer sometimes get obscured by other objects.|$|R

40|$|International audienceLast years {{analytical}} or {{finite element}} models of milling become more efficient and focus on more physical aspects, nevertheless the milling process is still experimentally unknown {{on a wide range}} of use. This paper propose to analyse with accuracy milling operations by investigating the cutting forces values, shape of cutting forces curves obtained for different cutting speeds, and related phenomena as tool wear or tool run-out. These detailed experimental data in milling constitute a suitable experimental basis available to develop predictive machining modelling. All the tests have been conducted on the 304 -L stainless steel in many cutting configurations and for different tool geometries. The machinability of the 304 -L stainless steel with different tools geometries and configurations in <b>shoulder</b> <b>milling</b> is defined by three working zones: a conventional zone permitting stable cutting (low cutting speed; under 200 - 250 m. min− 1), a dead zone (unfavourable for cutting forces level and cutting stability; between 250 and 450 m. min− 1), and a high speed machining zone (high cutting speed; up to 450 - 500 m. min− 1). All the used criteria (cutting forces, chips, wear) confirm the existence of these different zones and a correlation is proposed with cutting perturbations as tool run-out, cutting instability, ploughing, and abrasive wear...|$|E
40|$|Micro-milling can {{be defined}} as milling with end mills smaller than 1 mm of diameter. The {{top-down}} approach from milling to micro-milling is often used to define cutting conditions. Unfortunately geometries either for the active part or the overall shape are quite different from conventional tools, leading to inexistent problems at the macro-scale, such as a larger cutting edge radius to uncut chip thickness ratio leading to ploughing effect. Moreover, micro-milling can be used on particular material such as shape memory alloys in biomedical domain which are difficult to machine. This study focuses on burr formation during <b>shoulder</b> <b>milling</b> for two biocompatible NiTi alloys: a martensitic NiTi (shape memory effect) and an austenitic one (pseudo-elasticity effect). Design of experiment is used to highlight the influence of various parameters (cutting parameters and material phases) on the burr formation in micro-milling NiTi alloys. Burrs were observed and measured using confocal, optical and electronic microscopy and tend to be as large as shoulders dimensions. Material phase transformation was also examined. Analysis of variance emphasizes that the larger the feed per tooth and the smaller the width of cut are, the smaller the top burr is. Cutting strategy leads to different burr shape: up-milling burrs have a large curvature, whereas down-milling burrs are slightly bent. An affected layer of about 10 μm has been observed for the austenitic NiTi. The proposed experimental approach give the opportunity to study burr formation in micro-milling, the machinability of alloys or superelastic NiTi shape memory and a qualitative explanation of burr formation has been developed.

40|$|The {{increasing}} trend {{among several}} manufacturing industries of producing precise and complex micro-pieces with three-dimensional geometries and shapes has forced researchers {{to develop new}} micro-techniques. Micro-milling is a key technology characterized by a material removal performed by mechanical interaction between a tool with sharp edges and a workpiece. Cutting force prediction at micro-scale is an important research field in order to enable correct choice of cutting parameters, correct design of micro tools and estimation of machining tolerances. This work aims {{to determine if the}} finite element model taken as an input for a global dynamic model is accurate enough to simulate experimental measurements, therefore a simulation approach and experimental tests are performed to be compared. The dynamic simulation software employed is DyStaMill which has been developed in the faculty of engineering. The software is based in three fundamental aspects: modeling of the cutting forces, modeling of the surface generation and prediction of the displacement between the tool and the workpiece. The experimental plan followed comprises slot milling tests and <b>shoulder</b> <b>milling</b> tests with small feed per tooth and several cutting parameters to titanium (Ti 6 Al 4 V) workpieces. The calculations for the developed cutting force model are compared to the experimental findings. The comparison shows significant differences between measurements and simulation on the values of the efforts. These differences {{can be explained by the}} cutting edge radius which is different between simulations and experiments and to a possible effect of cutter run-out. Finally, an inverse analysis confirmed the validity of the model when correct input parameters are given...|$|E
