25|$|Short pasta pieces {{fall on the}} <b>shaker</b> <b>conveyor</b> and {{powerful}} hot air is blown to them immediately after the extrusion. This reduces the moisture content by 5% and prevents the pieces from sticking and flattening. Shaker then carries the product through tiers with dry hot air and buckets collect the pasta and spread them on the upper tier of the multi-tier drying unit. This unit has four areas which periods of intense moisture extraction alternately followed by periods of rest occur at eight drying/stabilizing cycle in total. Process ends in cold air chamber for stabilizing.|$|E
50|$|Up to 1915, all {{the coal}} at Whitfield {{had to be}} hewn from the coal face {{without the aid of}} machinery. In that year, however, {{electrically}} driven coal cutters and compressed air <b>shaker</b> <b>conveyors</b> were introduced to help remove some of the physical work required to mine and transport the coal from the face.|$|R
50|$|The {{returning}} mud {{can contain}} natural gases or other flammable materials which will collect {{in and around}} the shale <b>shaker</b> / <b>conveyor</b> area or in other work areas. Because of the risk of a fire or an explosion if they ignite, special monitoring sensors and explosion-proof certified equipment is commonly installed, and workers are advised to take safety precautions. The mud is then pumped back down the hole and further re-circulated. After testing, the mud is treated periodically in the mud pits to ensure properties which optimize and improve drilling efficiency, borehole stability, and other requirements listed below.|$|R
40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a gray and ductile iron foundry. The employer was concerned about noise exposures in the knockoff areas of the facility. The foundry had seven knockoff areas where employees separated ductile iron castings from the metal riser and runner gating that remained attached following the casting process. We measured sound levels in the knockoff areas; they were very high. Metal-to-metal contact, <b>shaker</b> <b>conveyors</b> and other equipment, and vibration caused most noise. Employees' time-weighted average noise exposures {{in all of the}} knockoff jobs we monitored exceeded NIOSH and OSHA occupational exposure limits. Furthermore, time-weighted average noise exposures in all of the knockoff locations were greater than 100 decibels, A-weighted. We observed that most but not all employees working in these areas wore dual hearing protection as recommended by NIOSH and OSHA. Some employees did not fully insert their foam earplugs. We recommend installing engineering noise controls, improving acoustic barriers and treatments, maintaining equipment to eliminate unnecessary rattling from loose parts, and implementing a Buy Quiet program to help reduce noise exposures.

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a gray and ductile iron foundry. The employer was seeking guidance on noise control solutions for the molding, knockoff, grinding, and inspection areas. We visited the facility in April 2011 to discuss concerns with managers and employees; observe work activities and processes; measure employees' noise exposures, sound levels, and noise frequencies; and assess potential noise control options. Noise sources included striking metal with sledgehammers; cutting metal with chop saws; and smoothing metal edges with stationary abrasive stone grinders, hand-held pneumatic chisels and grinders, and shotblast tumblers. The foundry operated three shifts per day and had about 200 employees. Employees worked 10 -hour shifts. Noise levels in many work areas were very high (above 100 decibels). Metal-to-metal contact, grinders and saws, compressed air, and vibration caused most noise from equipment and <b>shaker</b> <b>conveyors.</b> All employees we monitored were exposed to noise above noise exposure limits, and some employees' noise exposures were above 100 decibels, A-weighted. Some employees did not insert their foam earplugs properly. We recommended the foundry install controls to reduce noise, implement a long-term plan to purchase new equipment that generates less noise, require employees working in areas where noise exposures are above 100 decibels, A-weighted to wear earplugs and earmuffs, and use National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendations for evaluating employees' hearing tests. We recommended employees wear hearing protection properly and tell their doctor that they work in areas with high noise levels and about hearing problems they have.
