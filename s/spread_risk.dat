50|$|As is {{demonstrated}} by these statistics, self-funded health plans {{are rooted in the}} same underlying mathematical principle as insurance in general: <b>Spread</b> of <b>risk.</b> Larger employers have more plan participants over which to <b>spread</b> the <b>risk</b> (loss) and are therefore able to more accurately predict and budget for the cost of the plan.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect that risk and risk aversion have on risk sharing in large economies with {{numerous}} agents. We show that as the economy expands, with all sectors expanding, exposure to risk is not eliminated. The risk premium does not go to zero and financial prices depend on both risk and risk-aversion, i. e., concern for risk does not disappear in the limit. Hence, while {{a large number of}} investors <b>spreads</b> <b>risk,</b> risk does not become negligible because the risk premium depends on the level of entrepreneurial activity relative {{to the size of the}} economy...|$|R

5000|$|A {{constant}} maturity {{credit default swap}} (CMCDS) {{is a type of}} credit derivative product, similar to a standard credit default swap (CDS). Addressing CMCDS typically requires prior understanding of credit default swaps. In a CMCDS the protection buyer makes periodic payments to the protection seller (these payments constitute the premium leg), and in return receives a payoff (protection or default leg) if an underlying financial instrument defaults. Differently from a standard CDS, the premium leg of a CMCDS does not pay a fixed and pre-agreed amount but a floating spread, using a traded CDS as a reference index. More precisely, given a pre-assigned time-to-maturity, at any payment instant of the premium leg the rate that is offered is indexed at a traded CDS spread on the same reference credit existing in that moment for the pre-assigned time-to-maturity (hence the name [...] "{{constant maturity}}" [...] CDS). The default or protection leg is mostly the same as the leg of a standard CDS. Often CMCDS are expressed in terms of participation rate. The participation rate may be defined as the ratio between the present value of the premium leg of a standard CDS with the same final maturity and the present value of the premium leg of the constant maturity CDS. CMCDS may be combined with CDS on the same entity to take only <b>spread</b> <b>risk</b> and not default risk on an entity. Indeed, as the default leg is the same, buying a CDS and selling a CMCDS or vice versa will offset the default legs and leave only the difference in the premium legs, that are driven by <b>spread</b> <b>risk.</b> Valuation of CMCDS has been explored by Damiano Brigo (2004) and Anlong Li (2006) ...|$|E
50|$|Health {{insurance}} exchanges in the United States expand {{insurance coverage}} while allowing insurers {{to compete in}} cost-efficient ways and help them to comply with consumer protection laws. Exchanges are not themselves insurers, so they do not bear risk themselves, but they do determine which insurance companies participate in the exchange. An ideal exchange promotes insurance transparency and accountability, facilitates increased enrollment and delivery of subsidies, and helps <b>spread</b> <b>risk</b> {{to ensure that the}} costs associated with expensive medical treatments are shared more broadly across large groups of people, rather than spread across just a few beneficiaries. Health insurance exchanges use electronic data interchange (EDI) to transmit required information between the exchanges and carriers (trading partners), in particular the 83 transaction for enrollment information and the 820 transaction for premium payment.|$|E

50|$|NNN leased {{investments}} are generally leased to one single tenant {{and are thus}} referred to as STNLs or Single Tenant Net Leases. A NNN lease investment can however have two or more tenants, though {{it would not be}} considered an STNL investment. An example of this would be a Starbucks & MetroPCS which share a building under two separate NNN leases, or a retail strip center where all tenants are wrapped into one NNN lease. Both examples would be considered NNN leased investments; however they would not be STNLs. The risk of default is spread out over more than one tenant in such NNN deals (i.e. If either Starbucks or Metro PCS goes bankrupt, the other tenant continues to pay the rent due under their NNN lease). Such deals can appeal to investors seeking to <b>spread</b> <b>risk,</b> though the simplicity of collecting one rent check from one tenant is forfeited.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{structural}} {{difference between}} Korean chaebol and the Japanese keiretsu is that chaebol do not all {{have their own}} financial institutions. Most were heavily dependent on government loans and loan guarantees in their early years, and {{they still have a}} closer relationship with government than their Japanese counterparts. Chaebol are largely prohibited from owning private banks, partly to <b>spread</b> <b>risk</b> and partly to increase the government's leverage over the banks in areas such as credit allocation. In 1990, government regulations made it difficult for a chaebol to develop an exclusive banking relationship, but following the cascading collapses of the late 1990s, it was somewhat relaxed. Keiretsu have historically worked with an affiliated bank, giving the affiliated companies almost unlimited access to credit, so the economic problems for which the Japanese have been known is zombie banks rather than a systemic banking crises. However, many of the largest keiretsu have diversified their debt practices, and public bond sales have become somewhat common.|$|E
