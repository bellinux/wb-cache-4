40|$|Masonry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used building material for construction of low rise buildings and even for infill-walls of some high-rise buildings in Sri Lanka. Propagation of cracks in masonry walls {{is one of the main}} problems in masonry structures as it affects aesthetics and serviceability greatly. Movement in masonry is the prime cause for such cracks. Especially when movements are restrained, stresses will be set up which may lead to cracking. Even though these cracks may not be of structural significance, due to the difficulties in concealing them permanently and due to increase in maintenance costs of buildings, it has become one of the main concerns in the construction industry. In a few Codes of Practice and Standards, various guidelines are stipulated to control cracking in masonry, but still there are no hard and fast rules for predicting movements accurately at the design stage, due to its complexity. The guidelines specified for design of movement joints for masonry in other countries cannot be directly used in Sri Lanka for local masonry, due to differences in environmental conditions and material properties. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a methodology for movement joint design and a specification of movement joints for masonry structures in Sri Lanka. To achieve this goal, a comprehensive research study was carried out. It consisted of a literature survey, a field study, an experimental study, a theoretical study and a finite element study. The literature survey was carried out to identify the important parameters to be studied, to assess the current state of knowledge, and to gather necessary information on the design of movement joints. A field study was carried out by conducting a detailed questionnaire survey to collect information on cracking of local masonry walls. Most of the houses had at least one or more cracked walls and majority of the cracks was present only in the <b>superstructure.</b> <b>Wall</b> thickness, exposure to direct sunlight /rain, wall length/height ratio, existence of openings, cross sectional variations in walls, and existence of wall junctions or wall returns were found to be influential parameters on movements. The experimental study included an extensive investigation of movements in different types of masonry wall panels, where 34 wall panels were tested for movements over long period of time till movements stabilized. As brickwork {{is the most}} widely used masonry material in Sri Lanka, greater emphasis was given to it. With these tests, long-term movements in different types of masonry were investigated. Numerous tests were also carried out to determine the required properties of brickwork and constituents of brickwork, needed for the theoretical study and the finite element study. The experimental study also resulted in the development of a simple, accurate and inexpensive method for measurement of long term movements in masonry. A theoretical model accounting for elastic, creep, shrinkage and thermal deformations of bricks and mortar was developed with an accuracy of 96 % to predict the long-term movements in masonry, which can be used to investigate various aspects which influence design of movement joints for masonry walls. Parametric study highlighted its usefulness. A finite element analysis, using SAP 2000 with thin shell elements, was carried out to study the behaviour of masonry walls subjected to restrained shrinkage, using varying sizes and varying end conditions of a rectangular wall. Significant influence of L/H ratios of walls on stresses iii developed in masonry walls was seen. Influence of openings, wall returns, and restraints were also studied. Finally a methodology for design of movement joints was developed and presented. Further, simplified guidelines for design of movement joints with minimum calculations, were also proposed. Some important conclusions of the study were that moisture expansion of local bricks is insignificant in comparison to that reported for high strength bricks in other countries; movement of local masonry can be described by three parameters maximum shrinkage (ε 0), maximum expansion (εex) and critical shrinkage (εcr) of which last is the most decisive parameter; and first year after construction is the critical period as regards movement of local masonry...|$|E

50|$|This was a {{prototype}} tank developed in 1945. It used {{elements of both}} the IS-2 and IS-3 tanks. The overall height of the vehicle was reduced to 2240 mm, which was compensated with an increased width of the superstructure. The factory designation was Object 704 (Объект 704). It was armed with the 152.4 mm ML-20SM model 1944 (МЛ-20СМ обр. 1944 г.) gun-howitzer, with a barrel length of over 4.5 metres (29.6 calibers) and no muzzle brake. It had a maximum range of 13,000 metres. The self-propelled gun carried 20 rounds of two piece (shell and charge) armour-piercing and high explosive ammunition. The armour-piercing round, weighing 48.78 kg, had a muzzle velocity of 655 m/s. The rate of fire was 1-2 round/min. Object 704 had four hatches at the superstructure roof and one emergency hatch {{at the bottom of}} the hull behind the driver's seat, which had an armoured cover. The self-propelled gun carried two external fuel tanks (90 litres each), not connected to the supply system. The secondary armament of the fighting vehicle consisted of two 12.7 x 108 mm DShK machine guns, one anti-aircraft and one co-axial. The protection was increased by placing thicker armour at more radical angles. In the area of the gun, where the mantlet combined with the hull front behind it and the housing of the recoil mechanism, the armour thickness was 320 mm. Object 704 (ИСУ-152 обр. 1945 г.) was the best protected of all experimental or production Soviet self-propelled guns of the Second World War. However, the radical incline of the <b>superstructure</b> <b>walls</b> combined with the increased recoil of the gun, due to the lack of a muzzle brake, significantly complicated the work of the crew, and for this reason it wasn't adopted.|$|R

40|$|The {{disposal}} of human excreta in latrines {{is an important}} step in reducing the transmission of diarrhoeal diseases. However, in latrines, flies can access the latrine contents and serve as a mechanical transmitter of diarrhoeal pathogens. Furthermore, the latrine contents {{can be used as a}} breeding site for flies, which may further contribute to disease transmission. Latrines do not all produce flies, and there are some which produce only a few, while others can produce thousands. In order to understand the role of the latrine in determining this productivity, a pilot study was conducted, in which fifty latrines were observed in and around Ifakara, Tanzania. The characteristics of the latrine superstructure, use of the latrine, and chemical characteristics of pit latrine contents were compared to the numbers of flies collected in an exit trap placed over the drop hole in the latrine. Absence of a roof was found to have a significant positive association (t= 3. 17, p= 0. 003) with the total number of flies collected, and temporary superstructures, particularly as opposed to brick superstructures (z= 4. 26, p< 0. 001), and increased total solids in pit latrines (z= 2. 57, p= 0. 01) were significantly associated with increased numbers of blowflies leaving the latrine.

40|$|International audienceFused-cast {{refractory}} materials {{are widely used}} in the glass industry, especially {{in the building of}} <b>superstructures</b> and side <b>walls</b> of fusion furnaces. The HZFC (High Zirconia Fused Cast) products are especially used as tank blocks for the fusion of highly corrosive glasses melted at very high temperature (such as LCD glass), due to their high corrosion resistance and their low generation of glass defects generation. The presence of this high amount of pure ZrO 2 in the refractory can be responsible for microdamage occurrence during the cooling step after melt casting (annealing), associated to the martensitic transition of zirconia. Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is well known as a reliable tool to investigate microstuctural evolution at a very small scale. In this work, a fused-cast ZrO 2 refractory has been investigated using a AE unsupervised pattern recognition procedure and a frequency-energy coupled analysis. Data gathering during thermal cycles at high temperature (typically 1500 °C) has been done thanks to an innovative self-developed testing device. The analysis of frequency and energy parameters makes it possible to detect and to characterize the occurrence and the chronology of microdamage in specific range of temperature. Hypothesis concerning different ways of microdamage formation below the temperature of the martensitic transformation of ZrO 2 during the cooling stage can be proposed related to thermo-mechanical properties and the microstructure of the material. In particular, intergranular and intragranular microcracks due to CTE mismatches occurring in the material have been also investigated...|$|R
5000|$|In this temple the Hoysala architects {{have broken}} from the {{tradition}} of using five moldings with friezes (which is the [...] "old style") {{at the base of}} the temple, below the large wall sculptures and the window screens. The outer walls have two eaves that run around the temple. The top eaves, one at the roof of the temple where the <b>superstructure</b> meets the <b>wall,</b> and the second eaves is about a meter below. In between there are decorated miniature towers (aedicule). Below the lower eaves are the wall sculptures and below them, the eight moldings. Historian Kamath calls this type of relief work [...] "horizontal treatment". Each of the eight friezes carries an array of decoration. Going from the bottom where the temple wall meets the platform, the lowest frieze depicts charging elephants which symbolize strength and stability, above which, in order, are friezes with lions which symbolize courage, floral scrolls as decoration, horses symbolizing speed, another band of floral scrolls, depictions from the Hindu epics, mythical beasts called makara and finally a frieze with hansas (swans). According to Foekema, no two animals are alike in a total frieze span of over 200 m. In the epic frieze, the epics are not continuous as they are mixed with other depictions. After the construction of this temple, Hoysala architects used this new kind of horizontal treatment only fifty years later, making it a standard style, though they reduced it to six molding friezes.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the seismic}} design {{specified}} by Japanese Specifications of Highway Bridges (JSHB), a large gap size between two adjacent girders or the girder and abutment has recommended to be {{constructed in the}} concrete girder bridge with multi-spans {{in order to prevent}} the collision, when it is subjected to Level 2 ground motion. However, the adoption of large gap into PC bridge will increase the construction and seismic reinforcement costs since relatively large expansion joints have to be used. Also, it causes the girders falling in the presumption of strong earthquake. It has been suggested that allowing the girder collision at the abutment by restricting the girder bridges displacement, the size of expansion joints can be reduced. These conditions are able to reduce the seismic design and seismic reinforcement cost. Although many studies on the effect of the collision have been published, the effect of displacement restriction of girders is still remains to be elucidated. This present study aims to investigate the seismic response of concrete girder bridges taking into account the effect of displacement restriction of girders allowing the girder collision at the abutment and the wing wall. Two span concrete girder bridge was examined in theoretically by 3 D FEM model of ABAQUS with four different approaches at the wing wall abutment model. The dead load and soil pressure were calculated based on JSHB loading conditions and gap between <b>superstructure</b> and parapet <b>wall</b> was chosen to be 10 cm and 20 cm. Level 2 earthquake ground accelerations were applied horizontally at the bottom of pier. The numerical results showed that the parameters such as shear stress, response stress, displacement, and cracking were affected by displacement restriction and different wing wall model. Installing of the wing wall in abutment generally increased the response stress in parapet wall and shear stress around vertical wall of abutment. In contrast, it significantly reduced the horizontal displacement of abutment...|$|R
40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{study has been}} started {{with respect to the}} joint-free exectution of quay walls in high-performance concrete. This {{feasibility study}} has the purpose of looking for faster means of building quay walls. The use of high performance concrete is an excellent material for a faster execution of the <b>superstructure</b> of quay <b>walls.</b> The strength development of the material is significantly higher then normal concrete, which allows for faster dismantling of the casing. To further improve the building speed it's been proposed to broaden the study with the subject of joint-free execution. This means there will be no contraction joints anymore in the concrete upper structure of the quay walls, which allows for a continuous execution of the superstructure. As a reference project the quay wall of ECT (Europe Container Terminal) has been chosen. A reference project is chosen to allow for a comparison between the new and the old design. The superstructure has been redesigned in high performance concrete without the use of contraction joints. The substructure stayed the same to allow for a comparison between only the superstructures. The first problem faced was the temperature induced deformation of the superstructure. The foundation (the substructure) was unable to withstand these new forces, causing them to fail in certain cases. The main item here was the increased length of the quay wall when the concrete got warmer. To disable the influence of the elongation of the superstructure with respect to the loads on the substructure a slide bearing has been designed between the superstructure and the substructure. This allows the superstructure to elongate without causing any harmful loads on the substructure. The only adjustment in the design was the relocation of the strain element (the MV-pole) from the superstructure to the substructure. Furthermore the superstructure has to be made from fibre-reinforced concrete. This has to be done to make the concrete strong enough to withstand the extra strains, caused by the joint free execution. When at the end the two designs (the old one and the new one) were compared it showed a slight profit for the new design of 200. 000 euro. Compared to the overall costs of 24 Million euro of the project this was a small profit. More economical profit could be gained when the used concrete mixtures will be cheaper. The price of the concrete made up for {{a large proportion of the}} loss-factor, so cheaper concrete would increase the overall profit significantly. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
