40|$|The bail-in tool as {{implemented}} in the European bank resolution framework suffers from severe shortcomings. To some extent, the regulatory framework can remedy the impediments to the desirable incentive effect of private sector involvement (PSI) that emanate {{from a lack of}} predictability of outcomes, if it compels banks to issue a sufficiently sized minimum of high-quality, easy to bail-in (<b>subordinated)</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Yet, even the limited improvements any prescription of bail-in capital can offer for PSI’s operational effectiveness seem compromised in important respects. The main problem, echoing the general concerns voiced against the European bail-in regime, is that the specifications for minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) are also highly detailed and discretionary and thus alleviate the predicament of investors in bail-in debt, at best, only insufficiently. Quite importantly, given the character of typical MREL instruments as non-runnable long-term debt, even if investors are able to gauge the relevant risk of PSI in a bank’s failure correctly at the time of purchase, subsequent adjustment of MREL-prescriptions by competent or resolution authorities potentially change the risk profile of the pertinent instruments. Therefore, original pricing decisions may prove inadequate and so may market discipline that follows from them. The pending European legislation aims at an implementation of the already complex specifications of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) by very detailed and case specific amendments to both the regulatory capital and the resolution regime with an exorbitant emphasis on proportionality and technical fine-tuning. What gets lost in this approach, however, is the key policy objective of enhanced market discipline through predictable PSI: it is hardly conceivable that the pricing of MREL-instruments reflects an accurate risk-assessment of investors because of the many discretionary choices a multitude of agencies are supposed to make and revisit in the administration of the new regime. To prove this conclusion, this chapter looks in more detail at the regulatory objectives of the BRRD’s prescriptions for MREL and their implementation in the prospectively amended European supervisory and resolution framework...|$|E

40|$|Often, {{decisions}} regarding employment {{are made with}} the input of or based on the observations {{of more than one}} person. This presents complications for employment discrimination plaintiffs seeking to prove discriminatory animus resulting in an adverse employment decision for the plaintiff. Specifically, many plaintiffs are left to deal with the unresolved issue of whether they have a claim for employment discrimination when a discriminating non-decision making coworker or direct supervisor supplies incorrect or distorted information to their superiors who have the authority to fire them. This is known as the 2 ̆ 2 cat 2 ̆ 7 s paw 2 ̆ 2 theory of liability or 2 ̆ 2 <b>subordinate</b> bias <b>liability.</b> 2 ̆ 2 The United States Supreme Court attempted to resolve this issue in Staub v.

Prior to Staub, the circuit courts were split on <b>subordinate</b> bias <b>liability.</b> This article analyzes the various theories adopted by the circuit courts in deciding subordinate bias cases and considers the resulting difficulties. Next, the article analyzes the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Staub decision, and identifies the additional difficulties created by the Court. Ultimately, the article concludes that the Supreme Court adopted none of the standards used by the circuit courts, simultaneously creating a standard that may be difficult for plaintiffs to satisfy...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} Russian law on criminal market manipulation and compares it with equivalent rules in Western Europe. The Russian rules do not work; {{no one has}} been charged or sentenced for market manipulation since the relevant laws came into force. The Russian rules on criminal liability for market manipulation do not complement the general rules on fraud, they duplicate them. Our prohibition on market manipulation is unclear and is not comprehensive, i. e., there are gaps in the law. This prohibition and the criminal law rules based on it require serious revision; it is necessary to eliminate the gaps and make the law clear. It is inappropriate to <b>subordinate</b> the <b>liability</b> for this crime to the fact of causing consequences expressed formally in a sum of money. The rule of law requires a logical generalization. Establishing criminal liability for negligent market manipulation in Russia seems premature...|$|R
40|$|Recapitalizing {{banks in}} a {{systemic}} crisis {{is a complex}} medium-term process that requires significant government intervention and careful management at both the strategic and individual bank levels. This paper highlights the range of operational and strategic issues to be addressed and the institutional arrangements needed to foster an effective banking system restructuring and maximize the returns on government investment. The approaches to recapitalization have varied, with countries choosing different mixes of direct capital injections and asset purchase and rehabilitation. The choice of an appropriate mix is critical, to minimize the expected present value of government outlays net of recoveries.

5000|$|The Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, [...] (1863), {{entitled}} An Act {{relating to}} Habeas Corpus, and regulating Judicial Proceedings in Certain Cases, was an Act of Congress that authorized {{the president of}} the United States to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in response to the United States Civil War and provided for the release of political prisoners. It began in the House of Representatives as an indemnity bill, introduced on December 5, 1862, releasing the president and his <b>subordinates</b> from any <b>liability</b> for having suspended habeas corpus without congressional approval. The Senate amended the House's bill, and the compromise reported out of the conference committee altered it to qualify the indemnity and to suspend habeas corpus on Congress's own authority. Abraham Lincoln signed the bill into law on March 3, 1863, and suspended habeas corpus under the authority it granted him six months later. The suspension was partially lifted with the issuance of Proclamation 148 by Andrew Johnson, and the Act became inoperative {{with the end of the}} Civil War. The exceptions to his Proclamation 148 were the States of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, the District of Columbia, and the Territories of New Mexico and Arizona.|$|R
