50|$|Heuglin's gull or <b>Siberian</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus fuscus heuglini) is a seabird in {{the genus}} Larus. It is {{sometimes}} {{considered as a}} separate species (Larus heuglini) but is now usually treated as a subspecies of the lesser black-backed gull.|$|E
50|$|The Mongolian gull (L. (vegae/cachinnans) mongolicus) may be classed as a {{subspecies}} of the Caspian gull, a subspecies of the East <b>Siberian</b> <b>gull</b> or as {{a species}} in its own right. It breeds in Mongolia and surrounding areas and migrates south-east in winter.|$|E
50|$|The Vega gull, East <b>Siberian</b> <b>gull,</b> or East Siberian {{herring gull}} (Larus vegae) {{is a large}} gull of the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull complex which breeds in North-east Asia. Its {{classification}} is still controversial and uncertain. It is variously treated as a separate species, as a subspecies of American herring gull (L. smithsonianus) or included with both the American herring gull and European herring gull in L. argentatus. The Mongolian gull, Larus mongolicus, has previously been regarded as a subspecies of the Caspian gull (L. cachinnans) but is now sometimes lumped with the Vega gull.|$|E

50|$|The European {{herring gull}} (L. argentatus argenteus), which lives {{primarily}} in Great Britain and Ireland, can hybridize with the American herring gull (L. smithsonianus), (living in North America), {{which can also}} hybridize with the Vega or East <b>Siberian</b> herring <b>gull</b> (L. vegae), the western subspecies of which, Birula's gull (L. vegae birulai), can hybridize with Heuglin's gull (L. heuglini), which in turn can hybridize with the <b>Siberian</b> lesser black-backed <b>gull</b> (L. fuscus). All four of these live across the north of Siberia. The last is the eastern representative of the lesser black-backed gulls back in north-western Europe, including Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|The {{circumpolar}} {{group of}} Larus gull species {{has often been}} cited as {{a classic example of}} the ring species. The range of these gulls forms a ring around the North Pole. The European herring gull, which lives primarily in Great Britain, can hybridize with the American herring gull (living in North America), which can also interbreed with the Vega or East <b>Siberian</b> herring <b>gull,</b> the western subspecies of which, Birula's gull, can hybridize with Heuglin's gull, which in turn can interbreed with the <b>Siberian</b> lesser black-backed <b>gull</b> (all four of these live across the north of Siberia). The last is the eastern representative of the lesser black-backed gulls back in northwestern Europe, including Great Britain. However, the lesser black-backed gulls and herring gull are sufficiently different that they cannot interbreed; thus the group of gulls forms a continuum except in Europe where the two lineages meet. However, a recent genetic study has shown that this example is far more complicated than presented here, and probably does not constitute a true ring species.|$|R
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the herring gull group is very complicated and much is still controversial and uncertain. A 2002 study {{suggested that the}} American herring gull is not closely related to European herring gulls, belonging instead to a separate clade of gulls. Several authorities such as the Association of European Rarities Committees and British Ornithologists' Union now recognize it as a separate species. The BOU also includes the East <b>Siberian</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus vegae) of north-east Asia within the American herring gull. The American Ornithologists' Union has not adopted the split and continues to treat the American herring gull as a subspecies of Larus argentatus.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Information on the appearance, {{behaviour}} {{and ecology}} of taxa within the evolutionarily young ‘large white-headed gull ’ complex (taxa currently grouped by three species, Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus, Herring Gull L. argentatus and Yellow-legged Gull L. cachinnans) {{is of interest}} to those ornithologists who study their identification, systematics and speciation. A sharp discrepancy has arisen between the demand for information {{about some of these}} taxa and the lack of elementary primary data. The delay in gathering data is due to the inaccessibility of the breeding grounds of some forms and to difficulties with systematic methodologies within the group. There is a critical lack of information about three forms in particular: ‘West <b>Siberian</b> <b>Gull</b> ’ L. heuglini antelius, ‘Taimyr Gull ’ L. h. heuglini (= ‘taimyrensis’) and ‘Baraba Gull ’ L. cachinnans barabensis. This paper presents data on the plumage, biometrics, sexual dimorphism and geographical variation of West <b>Siberian</b> <b>Gull.</b> The identification of the Stuttgart type-specimen of heuglini is reviewed. It is suggested that thi...|$|E
50|$|Yunnan University is {{situated}} {{in the city of}} Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan noted for its mild climate. The university occupies an area of 426,669 sq m, of which 350,000 sq m are built up with teaching, library and research facilities. Its main campus faces the Green Lake Park, a winter haunt for the <b>Siberian</b> black-headed <b>gull.</b> The campus is covered with the green shade of ginkgo and is surrounded by stretches of cherry and plum trees. The university is also next to the Yuantong Hill, a zoological park known for its rare animal and bird species.|$|R
