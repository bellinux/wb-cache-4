5|$|In {{the later}} {{parts of his}} career and {{especially}} following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> and emotional problems, particularly alcoholism. He has been jailed or sectioned on numerous occasions and his personal struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, {{and he has not}} worked in football since being fired as the manager of Kettering Town in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, are at {{a significantly}} greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|After the war, H.D. and Bryher {{no longer}} lived together, but {{remained}} in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, {{in the spring}} of 1946, she suffered a <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> breakdown, which resulted in her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number of trips to the States, H.D. spent {{the rest of her life}} in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt. At Heydt's prompting, she wrote End to Torment, a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of Hilda's Book to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the American Academy of Arts and Letters medal.|$|E

Suffice it, that being all four out of their depths, and all unable to swim, they splashed up words in all directions, and floundered about famously. On the whole, it was {{considered}} to have been the <b>severest</b> <b>mental</b> exercise ever heard in the National Hotel.

25|$|Although {{there are}} {{limitations}} {{in the research}} studies conducted in this area, namely that most have focused primarily on schizophrenia, this theory provides an explanation of why relatively low levels of substance misuse often result in negative consequences for individuals with <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> illness.|$|E
25|$|Hemimegalencephaly is an {{extremely}} rare form of macrocephaly and is characterized by uneven development of brain hemispheres (one-half of brain is larger than other).

25|$|In contrast, {{those with}} <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> illness may have {{acquired}} stigma through professional labels and diagnoses {{as well as}} through other behaviors associated with their mental illness defined as deviant. This stigma may not be as easily understood as alcoholism or addiction because the behavior is more varied and can not be explained by substance use.|$|E

Some chronic general medical conditions have been linked to some aspects of mental disorder, such as AIDS-related psychosis.|$|E

40|$|The current article {{tries to}} detect the {{variables}} that explain labour insertion rates (close to 50 %) of people with <b>severe</b> and enduring <b>mental</b> illness who come to work rehabilitation centres (CRL´s) in the Community of Madrid. To this end, firstly, has been used a documentary methodology {{through the use of}} activity memoirs of the CRL´s in the Community of Madrid with activity in 2008 - 2012. And, second, a qualitative methodology using In-depth interviews with professionals of different profiles of various CRL´s as well as the technical coordinator of the public network of social care and people with <b>severe</b> and enduring <b>mental</b> illness of the Community of Madrid; and Focus groups according to professional category, as well as people served and family. The results show that the public network of care for people with <b>severe</b> and enduring <b>mental</b> illness, offers more than 5, 900 seats in different collective resources (psychosocial rehabilitation centres, day centres, social support, vocational rehabilitation centres, nursing homes or supervised apartments). Specifically, CRL´s  serving a total of 1, 313 people, of which 47. 4 % find employment (622 people with <b>severe</b> and enduring <b>mental</b> illness). </p...|$|R
25|$|The Pike Market Medical Clinic {{provides}} {{primary care}} and ancillary services to 3,600 patients. Most {{of these are}} either elderly, HIV-positive, or working poor. One third homeless, 30% are physically disabled, and 60% have <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> illness and/or chemical addiction. The clinic provides basic medical care, subsidized prescriptions, lab work, mental health counseling, drug and alcohol counseling, connections to other community services, and sometimes even assistance in finding housing.|$|E
25|$|The {{alleviation}} of dysphoria {{theory suggests}} that people with <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> illness commonly have a negative self-image, which makes them vulnerable to using psychoactive substances to alleviate these feelings. Despite {{the existence of a}} wide range of dysphoric feelings (anxiety, depression, boredom, and loneliness), the literature on self-reported reasons for use seems to lend support for the experience of these feelings being the primary motivator for drug and alcohol misuse.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{a review}} of {{permanent}} supportive housing and case management on health found that interventions using “housing-first models” can improve health outcomes among chronically homeless individuals, many of whom suffer from substance use disorders and <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> illness. Improvements include positive changes in self-reported mental health status, substance use, and overall well-being. These models can also help reduce hospital admissions, length of stay in inpatient psychiatric units, and emergency room visits.|$|E

60|$|We {{are seldom}} able to {{discover}} under any ordinary conditions of self-knowledge, how intimately that spiritual part of us, which is undying, can attach to {{itself and its}} operations the poorest objects of that external world around us, which is perishable. In the ravelled skein, the slightest threads are the hardest to follow. In analysing the associations and sympathies which regulate the play of our passions, the simplest and homeliest are the last that we detect. It is only when the shock comes, and the mind recoils before it--when joy is changed into sorrow, or sorrow into joy--that we really discern what trifles in the outer world our noblest mental pleasures, or our <b>severest</b> <b>mental</b> pains, have made part of themselves; atoms which the whirlpool has drawn into its vortex, as greedily and as surely as the largest mass.|$|R

25|$|With {{the closing}} of these state mental {{institutions}} {{it has become increasingly}} difficult for people who suffer from <b>severe</b> <b>mental</b> illness to receive treatment in a facility. Many mentally ill individuals were left homeless after deinstitutionalization, making up one-third of the homeless population (D.E. Torrey). Today the most prominent treatment for the severely mentally ill is incarceration in a correctional facility, where mentally ill individuals are not receiving adequate care for their disorder.|$|E
