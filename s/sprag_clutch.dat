25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch).</b> The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E
5000|$|Backstopping {{prevents}} {{a loaded}} inclined conveyor from running {{back when the}} drive system is stopped. The outer race of the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> is fixed to the machine frame, usually via a torque arm. The inner race rotates freely in the forward direction of the conveyor drive. When the machine tries to run backward, the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> prevents this motion. In this application the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> is often called a [...] "backstop" [...] or [...] "holdback".|$|E
50|$|A <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is used in}} many {{helicopter}} {{designs to}} transfer power from the engine to the main rotor. In {{the event of an}} engine failure, the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> allows the main rotor to continue rotating faster than the engines so that the helicopter can enter autorotation.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronically}} controlled {{transmission is}} designed around a fully articulated Ravigneaux gearset that {{is controlled by}} electronically timed application of several range-specific hydraulic clutches, in combination with mechanical one-way <b>sprag</b> <b>clutches.</b> The 5L40E unit's centerpiece is an automatic overdrive which supersedes the French-made 4L30E four-speed automatic light-duty gearboxes, and like them features a torque converter clutch to eliminate slipping losses in select forward ranges. It is assembled in Strasbourg, France.|$|R
25|$|Each train {{consists}} of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going backwards. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with a ratchet and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are braked. Recent improvements in design have replaced the ratchet (gear and pawl mechanism) with <b>sprag</b> <b>clutches</b> and disc brake assemblies. Most of the locomotives {{were made by the}} Manchester Locomotive Works.|$|R
5000|$|The Controlled Coupling HydraMatic {{incorporated}} a secondary fluid coupling {{and a pair}} of <b>sprag</b> <b>clutches</b> in place of the former friction clutch and brake bands, shifting in part by alternately draining and filling the secondary coupling. It was a later version of GM's [...] "dual range Hydra-Matic", first introduced in some 1952 models. The dual range feature allowed the driver to hold the transmission in third gear until the maximum allowable upshift points, for improved performance in traffic or in mountain driving. The new, dual coupling transmission also {{incorporated a}} separate park position, falling in line with other automatic transmissions of the day.|$|R
50|$|An {{indexing}} motion {{provides for}} accuracy {{in the drive}} system. A link is installed between the prime mover and one race of the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch.</b> The reciprocating motion of the prime mover is converted to an indexing movement on the other race of the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{a one-way}} {{freewheel}} clutch.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The non-smooth {{modeling}} of mechanical and electrical systems allows for ideal unilateral contacts, <b>sprag</b> <b>clutches</b> and dry friction in mechanical systems and for ideal diodes and switches in electrical systems. The formulation of non-smooth electrical models {{is demonstrated by}} {{the example of the}} DC-DC buck con-verter using the flux approach. The non-smooth electrical elements are described with set-valued branch relations in analogy with set-valued force laws in mechan-ics. With the set-valued branch relations, the dynamics of the circuit are described as measure differential inclusions. The measure differential inclusions obtained for the DC-DC buck converter are related to an analogous mechanical system. For the numerical solution, the measure differential inclusions are formulated as a measure complementarity system and discretised with a difference scheme, known in me-chanics as time-stepping. For every time-step a linear complementarity problem is obtained. ...|$|R
5000|$|Around 1979, the THM-200 {{received}} a lockup torque converter, and some internal components (primarily the low/reverse clutch drum and planetary gears) were later {{shared with the}} Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R. The low/reverse <b>sprag</b> (roller <b>clutch)</b> assembly was also shared with the 1988-04 Chrysler Torqueflite 904 (also 30, 31, 32RH) and its derivatives e.g the A500 and 42RE.|$|R
5000|$|... "The gold eyelids travel {{across the}} eye and {{disappear}} again in an instant; {{if you are not}} watching carefully you will not even notice... Sometimes you will even see two blinks in quick succession. The Blink is performed by a hidden spring drive, controlled in the best tradition of seventeenth century clockmakers of London. The spring is coiled up inside a housing that can be seen mounted on the large gearwheel visibly protruding {{from the bottom of the}} mechanism. As the huge pendulum below the Clock rocks the Chronophage as he steps round the great escapewheel, each backward and forward movement is used by <b>sprag</b> <b>clutches</b> to wind up the drive spring. A position step prevents the spring from being overwound yet allows the spring to be ready at an instant to drive the Blink. The mechanism is released by a countwheel with semi random spacing so the Blink takes place at any position in the to- and fro- motion of the pendulum. A further countwheel mechanism chooses a single or a double blink whilst the air damper at the top of the gear train slows the action to a realistic pace." ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is used in}} most older {{automatic}} transmissions and some newer ones for shifts which require the synchronized engagement of one clutch with the disengagement of another. Using an overrunning clutch instead of a hydraulically actuated one makes this synchronization automatic. The <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> simply [...] "lets go" [...] once the reaction force it provides is no longer needed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is used in}} the {{electric}} starter motors of modern motorcycle engines to replace the Bendix gear common to automobile starters.|$|E
50|$|Sprag {{clutches}} may be oil or grease lubricated. Most <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> manufacturers do {{not allow}} the use of lubricants containing extreme pressure additives.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is used in}} some {{automatic}} transmissions {{as a method of}} allowing the transmission to smoothly change gears under load. Various models of General Motors' turbo-hydramatic gearbox have used this system.|$|E
50|$|The gearbox {{differed}} {{little from}} the RC30’s; in fact, it {{even had the}} same gear ratios with only the primary and secondary ratios changed. The one-way <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> was also carried over from the RC30 but was of NR750 design. This <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> was a forerunner to today’s slipper clutches affording a slight amount of slip on overrun {{in the attempt to}} stop the back wheel from locking. The clutch plates were also from the NR750 and were much larger in diameter compared to the ones used in the RC30. The first gear was so tall that the increase in clutch plate diameter improved their longevity. All gears in the RC45’s gearbox were undercut to reduce the chance of a gear disengaging.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{sport and}} racing bikes use sprag {{clutches}} {{in the primary}} drive between the engine and transmission. This prevents the rear wheel from losing traction during rapid downshifts when the engine speed is not matched to road speed. If a <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> is not present, much greater care is required when downshifting, because losing rear wheel traction can cause dangerous highside accidents.|$|E
50|$|One-way sprag {{clutches}} {{have also}} been used for the same purpose, but are generally not adjustable for disengagement force. Early Honda Shadow models used a design wherein a <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> is connected to just half of the clutch friction plates, allowing the clutch to slip during heavy backloading sufficiently to prevent rear-wheel lockup, while still allowing moderate engine compression braking with the remaining friction plates.|$|E
5000|$|... "TB-28", the [...] "drag axle", a micro-turbine to {{be mounted}} {{directly}} to the rear axle of a vehicle. It would supplement {{the power of the}} conventional engine, usually driving the axle via a Borg Warner <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch,</b> and was intended for drag racing. The price for a complete unit was [...] Power output was stated as up to , and it was essentially a on/off device.|$|E
50|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigation, the NTSB {{found that the}} <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> that was installed in the helicopter, which was on lease to WNBC Radio by Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, was a military surplus part which was not designed {{for use in a}} civilian aircraft, and that the part had not been adequately lubricated. It directly led to a mid-air seizure of the main rotor blades.|$|E
50|$|A one-way <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is built}} {{into the center of the}} upper sheave to allow the rotor system to {{continue}} to rotate in the event of engine failure, allowing the R22 to enter autorotation and land in a controlled manner. Because the main rotor has very little mass and inertia, autorotation in an R22 requires careful and proper execution to assure a successful outcome. Much time is spent in training practicing various types of autorotation. Target speed in an autorotation is 65 kn and the glide ratio is approximately 4:1 in maximum-glide configuration.|$|E
50|$|With the RC45, Honda drew on its {{extensive}} {{knowledge of}} racing the RC30 and factory RVF racers. Many engineering ideas were brought {{across to the}} RC45. Honda wanted to produce another no-expenses-spared race machine. Just a short time earlier the extremely complex NR750 had been released for road use, a bike which to this day is still considered an engineering masterpiece. Some of the technology of the NR750 was carried across to the RC45, These included its fuel-injection system, clutch, <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> and even the 16-inch front wheel size.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> {{arrangement}} would {{preclude the}} use of the starter as a generator if employed in hybrid scheme mentioned above, unless modifications were made. The standard starter motor is typically designed for intermittent use, which would preclude its use as a generator. The starter's electrical components are designed only to operate for typically under 30 seconds before overheating (by too-slow dissipation of heat from ohmic losses), to save weight and cost. Most automobile owner's manuals instruct the operator to pause for at least ten seconds after each ten or fifteen seconds of cranking the engine, when trying to start an engine that does not start immediately.|$|E
5000|$|Chaika's Cruise-o-matic copy {{required}} less adaptations, {{due to its}} mating with a 195 hp V8 engine. The transmission {{was controlled}} by a dial-button panel with four regimes: Зх, Н, Д, Т corresponding to Reverse, Neutral, Drive and [...] "Braking". In Drive the car was would start in first and sequentially shift to third and back. In [...] "Braking" [...] (i.e. engine braking), third gear would be locked out, and the first gear would be engaged by the rear band immobilizing the planetary carrier, rather than the one-way <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> (absent on Volga's transmission). The more powerful engine and thus torque required a liquid cooling system. Gear ratios were identical to GAZ-21, except for the torque converter, which had a maximum multiplication of 2.5.|$|E
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter's pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|E
5000|$|To effect gear changes, one of {{two types}} of {{clutches}} or bands are used to hold a particular member of the planetary gearset motionless, while allowing another member to rotate, thereby transmitting torque and producing gear reductions or overdrive ratios. These clutches are actuated by the valve body (see below), their sequence controlled by the transmission's internal programming. Principally, a type of device known as a sprag or roller clutch is used for routine upshifts/downshifts. Operating much as a ratchet, it transmits torque only in one direction, free-wheeling or [...] "overrunning" [...] in the other. The advantage {{of this type of}} clutch is that it eliminates the sensitivity of timing a simultaneous clutch release/apply on two planetaries, simply [...] "taking up" [...] the drivetrain load when actuated, and releasing automatically when the next gear's <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> assumes the torque transfer. The bands come into play for manually selected gears, such as low range or reverse, and operate on the planetary drum's circumference. Bands are not applied when drive/overdrive range is selected, the torque being transmitted by the sprag clutches instead. Bands are used for braking; the GM Turbo-Hydramatics incorporated this..|$|E
5000|$|Electric {{starting}} {{is available}} for small engines and is found primarily on high-feature garden machinery and larger generators particularly where {{there is already a}} complex electrical system and there may be a need for auto-starting on demand. However, a self-retracting rope-pull mechanism called a recoil starter is the predominant method of starting small engines; it does not require a battery to power a starter motor, nor an alternator to keep a battery charged. Before the invention of the recoil starter, a notched pulley was attached to the engine's flywheel; the operator would manually wind a rope around the pulley then jerk the rope to rotate the engine so that it would start. Another starting method briefly popular in the 1960s was the [...] "impulse" [...] or [...] "wind-up" [...] starter. These were operated by winding a heavy spring by means of a rotating crank handle equipped with a <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch,</b> then releasing the spring's tension by means of a lever or knob so that it would spin the engine. These were discontinued when safety problems became apparent: it was possible to leave the starter wound up and ready to start the engine unintentionally, even long after the crank was wound up, if the release were jarred.|$|E

50|$|In most {{automatic}} transmissions, {{the drive}} turbine only functions as an input to the transmission where {{the power is}} redirected to gears in its automatic gearbox. Turboglide differs by using three individual drive turbines, each connected to a different ratio inside the gearbox. Oil leaving the pump first strikes the turbine connected to the Low (first gear) ratio. The design of the turbine permits oil to pass through its blades and strike the next turbine in line, the one connected to the Intermediate ratio, which receives some of the energy remaining in the oil flow. After leaving the intermediate turbine, the oil is passed to the direct turbine which is direct drive at drive shaft speed. As the car starts from rest, the low turbine, which has the greatest gear reduction ratio {{is relatively easy to}} bring up to match pump (engine) speed and the car starts from rest easily and accelerates quickly. While this occurs, the intermediate turbine receives an ever increasing share of the energy from the pump, as the Low turbine moves faster and oil passes more freely through it. Eventually, the low turbine matches pump speed, and the low turbine freewheels on a one-way <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> much like on a bicycle. At this point, the intermediate turbine is carrying the majority of the drive force, and some energy is being sent to the direct turbine from the oil passing through the intermediate turbine as it also begins to match pump speed. Eventually, the intermediate turbine also matches pump speed, and the oil passes freely through low and intermediate turbines to drive the direct turbine alone, in direct drive (1:1 ratio). Because of the overlapping power input in different ratios, there is no 'shift' or sequential gearing, rather there is a concurrent geared drive, in effect the car starts out in 1-2-3, eventually drops 1 to be in 2-3 and eventually drops 2 to be in 3 alone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the wear {{resistance}} of the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> under the work condition, the chemical vapor deposition technology is used {{on the surface of}} sprag. The hardness of surface is HV 0. 11700 ~ 2300, the thickness is 5 ~ 8 µm, and the adhesion force isn’t less than 65 N. In the end, the wear resistant life of the sprag surface used the chemical vapor deposition process is improved 5 times than that of the sprag surface used the physical vapor deposition process by the low cycle fatigue test. The life of the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> is effectively improved...|$|E
40|$|A RANCOR drill was {{designed}} to fit a Mars Exploration Rover (MER) class vehicle. The low mass of 3 kg was achieved by using the same actuator for three functions: rotation, percussions, and core break-off. Initial testing of the drill exposed an unexpected behavior of an off-the-shelf <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> used to couple and decouple rotary-percussive function from the core break off function. Failure of the sprag {{was due to the}} vibration induced during percussive drilling. The <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> would back drive in conditions where it was expected to hold position. Although this did not affect the performance of the drill, it nevertheless reduced the quality of the cores produced. Ultimately, the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> was replaced with a custom ratchet system that allowed for some angular displacement without advancing in either direction. Replacing the sprag with the ratchet improved the collected core quality. Also, premature failure of a 300 -series stainless steel percussion spring was observed. The 300 -series percussion spring was ultimately replaced with a music wire spring based on performances of previously designed rotary-percussive drill systems...|$|E
40|$|A new multiarc <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> model {{considering}} {{geometry and}} internal interaction during engagement is proposed in this paper. To increase {{the accuracy of}} the model, an improved model of geometric deformation coordination is presented to describe the basic geometrical quantities after rotation of the sprag. Then, based on this model, a novel nonlinear iteration method focusing on the varied contact radius is proposed to compute the normal contact force and show a good agreement with the FEM model. In addition, the alternate friction model considering stationary and rate-dependency friction is formulated and applied in the contacts of both the inner race and outer race. The proposed model is verified by comparison with other published results and experimental results. In subsequent analysis, the new model fully reveals the dynamical behaviors of the multiarc clutch during preload engagement under torque excitation; therefore, it will be useful for the performance analysis and dynamic design of multiarc <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch...</b>|$|E
40|$|Work done at Case Western Reserve University on the Thermal Mechanical {{analysis}} of sprag helicopter clutches is reported. The report {{is presented in}} two parts. The first part is a description of a test rig for the measurement of the heat generated by high speed <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> assemblies during cyclic torsional loading. The second part describes a finite element modeling procedure for sliding contact. The test rig provides a cyclic torsional load of 756 inch-pounds at 5000 rpm using a four-square arrangement. The <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> test unit was placed between the high speed pinions of the circulating power loop. The test unit was designed to have replaceable inner ad outer races, which contain the instrumentation to monitor the <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch.</b> The torque loading device was chosen to be a water cooled magnetic clutch, which is controlled either manually or through a computer. In the second part, a Generalized Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for non-linear dynamic problems is developed for solid materials. This formulation is derived from the basic laws and axioms of continuum mechanics. The novel aspect of this method is that we are able to investigate the physics in the spatial region of interest as material flows through it without having to follow material points. A finite element approximation to the governing equations is developed. Iterative Methods for the solution of the discrete finite element equations are explored. A FORTRAN program to implement this formulation is developed and a number of solutions to problems of sliding contact are presented...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to study the {{feasibility}} of using tethered kites to generate power from the wind. Generating electricity using kites instead of wind turbines may have certain advantages, particularly for developing nations. These include generating power at low cost while eliminating certain environmental problems associated with wind turbines. Another advantage is that kites can fly at greater heights than wind turbines can operate. Since wind speed increases with height, and available power is proportional to wind speed cubed, the wind power potential is larger for kites. A literature review was conducted of previous studies of kite power systems. A mechanism was designed to convert the oscillating tether tension caused by the vertical motion of a kite into rotary shaft motion to drive a generator. The mechanism {{is based on a}} rocking, balanced beam of 5 meter length attached to a power train and <b>Sprag</b> <b>clutch.</b> The design uses a commercially available sport kite which is 10 meters squared in size. A previously developed MATLAB code was used to model the final system design, and power outputs comparable to small wind turbines were predicted...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to investigate multiple-speed transmissions for electric vehicles. This research is driven by the requirement to reduce emissions within the automotive industry increasing the demand for electric vehicles. The typical torque characteristics of an electric motor allow a clutchless single-speed transmission to be used, yet it is suggested by literature that the adoption of multiple-speed transmissions can benefit the energy consumption and vehicle performance. However, the published research up to date is limited in this field and lacks credible quantifiable evidence and as such motivates this research. The author developed complex non-linear models in Matlab/Simulink of case study vehicles with single and multiple-speed transmissions to analyse vehicle performance and simulate driving cycles to calculate energy consumption. The main focus of {{the research}} was based around a single and two-speed transmission developed by Vocis Drivelines and Oerlikon Graziano. The two-speed transmission has a novel mechanical layout comprising a friction clutch and <b>sprag</b> <b>clutch</b> allowing seamless gearshifts, a gearshift controller was developed as part of the research. The two transmissions were modelled in simulation with the gearshift dynamics of the two-speed transmission being simulated and considered with multiple controllers. In addition, a hardware-in-the-loop test rig was built at the University of Surrey by the author to test the prototype single and two-speed transmissions. The vehicle models were validated using the hardware-in-the-loop test rig whilst allowing performance tests and driving cycles to be carried out. The research showed that the adoption of the two-speed transmission over the single-speed transmission gave rise to reductions in energy consumption over numerous driving cycles of up to 4 % for the case study vehicles. The vehicle performance was also improved with the top speed increased by 12 % and the 0 - 100 km/h time reduced by 2 %. In addition, a novel four-speed dual-motor drivetrain was investigated through simulations and compared with optimised single-speed and two-speed variants. The novel four-speed transmission delivered up to a 9 % and 5 % improvement in energy consumption during standard driving cycles over the single-speed and two-speed transmissions, respectively. The four-speed transmission allowed up to a 25 % improvement in top speed and a 10 % improvement in 0 - 100 km/h time over the two-speed transmission...|$|E
