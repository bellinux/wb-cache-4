25|$|Middleton married Maude H. Webster in 1921. She died in 1968, and {{the couple}} had no children. In 1973, Middleton married a second time, to Ruth Adams, {{who had been a}} member of his staff in the Veterans Administration. He was a fierce {{competitor}} in tennis and handball, and swam in Madison's Lake Mendota every <b>summer</b> <b>morning</b> until the age of 81.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1967, Seedman, then chief detective for {{southern}} Brooklyn, caught {{the case that}} made his reputation as an investigator who could solve baffling cases. While driving on the Belt Parkway one <b>summer</b> <b>morning</b> near Plum Beach, a young woman named Nancy McEwen suddenly drifted off the road onto the median strip. A police lieutenant in the car behind her pulled over {{to see what the}} problem was. He found her moaning, with her head slumped forward, and called for an ambulance. She died a short time later at Coney Island Hospital, where doctors found a small hole on the side of her head that turned out to have been caused by a bullet.|$|E

500|$|The {{pastoral}} Epistles, too, {{give the}} impression of being in real places, with flesh-and-blood people, at specific times of day. Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one <b>summer</b> <b>morning</b> in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of a moment in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of her cabin, the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E
500|$|Auden's clipped, satiric, and ironic {{style in}} the 1930s was widely imitated by younger poets such as Charles Madge, who wrote in a poem [...] "there waited {{for me in the}} <b>summer</b> <b>morning</b> / Auden fiercely. I read, shuddered, and knew." [...] He was widely {{described}} as the leader of an [...] "Auden group" [...] that comprised his friends Stephen Spender, Cecil Day-Lewis, and Louis MacNeice. The four were mocked by the poet Roy Campbell as if they were a single undifferentiated poet named [...] "Macspaunday." [...] Auden's propagandistic poetic plays, including The Dog Beneath the Skin and The Ascent of F6, and his political poems such as [...] "Spain" [...] gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions, such as that of Austin Clarke who called Auden's work [...] "liberal, democratic, and humane", and John Drummond, who wrote that Auden misused a [...] "characteristic and popularizing trick, the generalized image", to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact [...] "confined to bourgeois experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Walking {{down from}} Lustagam they pass hand-made {{irrigation}} canals of hollowed-out halved tree trunks on stone pillars. They are shown a large rock, the Sang Neveshteh, with an inscription {{said to be}} in Kufic script, supposedly recording the Emperor Timur Leng's visit in 1398 A.D. Newby gives some pages of history [...] "lifted almost in their entirety... from Elliott [...] and Dawson's History of India, Vol. III, London, 1871." [...] The emperor forcibly converted the Nuristanis to Islam, which Newby implies they still regret. The country becomes lusher, with both ordinary mulberries and the king mulberry, plums, sloes and soft apples. Then they cross a wooded country with watermills, wild raspberries and buttercups [...] "like a <b>summer</b> <b>morning</b> in England, but a long time ago". They climb back into the [...] "wilderness" [...] to Gadval, a village on a cliff, with picturesque privies over the streams. At Lake Mundul a mullah swims the horse with Newby's camera and all their film and other possessions across the river. The headman shows a scar inflicted on him in deep snow by a black bear.|$|E

2500|$|He {{remained}} {{a very popular}} and well-known figure in Somerset even after his cricket-playing days were long over. When he died, Taunton {{was in a state}} of mourning. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow wrote of him: [...] "If you wanted to know Taunton, you walked round it with Sam Woods on a <b>summer</b> <b>morning</b> before the match. Sam was Somerset's godfather." ...|$|E
2500|$|Summers {{are cool}} and humid with {{afternoon}} maximum temperatures averaging {{in the mid}} 70s °F. [...] <b>Summer</b> <b>morning</b> minimum temperatures average in the low 50s °F. [...] Due to its altitude and [...] "frost hollow" [...] topography, extreme minimum temperatures below freezing (20s °F) have been recorded in every month of the year. The average growing season of about 95 days is shorter than in Fairbanks, Alaska in interior central Alaska.|$|E
2500|$|The book's autumnal {{setting was}} {{intended}} as a thematic sequel to Bradbury's summer-tinged Dandelion Wine. Both works are set in the fictitious Green Town (based on Bradbury's hometown, Waukegan, Illinois) but have different tones, with the seasons in which they are set reflecting different aspects of the transition from childhood to adulthood. While none of the characters in Dandelion Wine reappear in Something Wicked This Way Comes, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade can be viewed as one-year older representations of Dandelion Wines Douglas Spaulding and John Huff, respectively. These two novels, coupled with Bradbury's official 2006 sequel to Dandelion Wine, Farewell Summer, constitute what Bradbury has termed his [...] "Green Town Trilogy." [...] The 2008 short story collection <b>Summer</b> <b>Morning,</b> Summer Night is also set in Green Town.|$|E
60|$|And now, let us {{close the}} book, look forth over this lonesome country and lonesome amphitheatre, and imagine what a scene both must have presented, when a play {{was to be}} acted on a fine <b>summer's</b> <b>morning</b> in the year 1611.|$|R

60|$|He went to {{the window}} and blinked at the garden outside. His two younger sons {{appeared}} on their bicycles returning from some early expedition. He waved a hand of greeting.

25|$|Records {{from the}} later Qin Dynasty say {{that during the}} last year of Jie’s reign, ice formed during the <b>summer</b> <b>mornings</b> and frost {{occurred}} through July. Heavy rainfall toppled buildings, hot and cold weather arrived in disorder, and crops failed. Some scientists correlate this event with a volcanic winter, possibly due to the Minoan eruption of Thera circa 1628 BC.|$|R
25|$|A similar dish {{consumed}} in the Indian states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh is known as pakhal, pokhalo, pakhala or pakhal bhat. It differs from panta bhat in seasoning as yoghurt is sometimes added prior to the fermentation process. This cold and wet food, is suitable for <b>summer</b> <b>mornings,</b> but in winter dry foods, such as chira (flattened rice) and muri (puffed rice) are more preferred.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} <b>summer</b> <b>morning,</b> and {{the voices of the}} children within accorded well with the notes of birds and bleating flocks without--a cheerful, yet Sabbath-like and quieting sound.|$|E

60|$|Almanz.
