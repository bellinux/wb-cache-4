40|$|Plant {{cell wall}} invertases and fructan exohydrolases (FEHs) are very closely related enzymes at the {{molecular}} and structural level (family 32 of glycoside hydrolases) but they are functionally different and are believed to fulfill distinct roles in plants. Invertases preferentially hydrolyze the Glc-Fru linkage in sucrose while plant FEHs have no invertase activity and only <b>split</b> <b>terminal</b> Fru-Fru linkages in fructans. Recently, the 3 -D structures of Arabidopsis thaliana cell wall invertase 1 (AtcwINV 1) and chicory 1 -FEH IIa were resolved. Until now, it remained unknown which amino acid residues determine whether sucrose or fructan {{is used as a}} donor substrate in the hydrolysis reaction of the glycosidic bond. In this manuscript, we present site-directed mutagenesis based data on AtcwINV 1 showing that the Asp 239 residue fulfills an important role in both binding and hydrolysis of sucrose. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} presence of a hydrophobic zone at the rim of the active site is important for optimal and stable binding of sucrose. Surprisingly, a D 239 A mutant acted as a 1 -FEH preferentially degrading 1 -kestose, indicating that plant FEHs lacking invertase activity could have evolved from a cell wall invertase-type ancestor by few mutational changes. In general, family 32 and 68 enzymes containing an Asp 239 functional homologue have sucrose as preferential substrate while enzymes lacking this homologue use fructans as donor substrate. The presence or absence of such an Asp 239 homologue is proposed as a reliable determinant to discriminate between real invertases and defective invertases/FEHs. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|A 3-terminal network {{can also}} be used as a 2-port. To achieve this, one of the {{terminals}} is connected in common to one terminal of both ports. In other words, one <b>terminal</b> has been <b>split</b> into two <b>terminals</b> and the network has effectively been converted to a 4-terminal network. This topology is known as unbalanced topology and is opposed to balanced topology. Balanced topology requires, referring to Figure 3, that the impedance measured between terminals 1 and 3 is equal to the impedance measured between 2 and 4. This is the pairs of terminals not forming ports: the case where the pairs of terminals forming ports have equal impedance is referred to as symmetrical. Strictly speaking, any network that does not meet the balance condition is unbalanced, but the term is most often referring to the 3-terminal topology described above and in Figure 3. Transforming an unbalanced 2-port network into a balanced network is usually quite straightforward: all series connected elements are divided in half with one half being relocated in what was the common branch. Transforming from balanced to unbalanced topology will often be possible with the reverse transformation but there are certain cases of certain topologies which cannot be transformed in this way. For example, see the discussion of lattice transforms below.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to ensemble learning. Our approach constructs a tree of subsets of the feature space and associates a predictor (predictive model) - determined by training one of a given family of base learners on an endogenously determined training set - to each node of the tree; we call the resulting object a tree of predictors. The (locally) optimal tree of predictors is derived recursively; each step involves jointly optimizing the <b>split</b> of the <b>terminal</b> nodes of the previous tree and the choice of learner and training set (hence predictor) for each set in the split. The feature vector of a new instance determines a unique path through the optimal tree of predictors; the final prediction aggregates the predictions of the predictors along this path. We derive loss bounds for the final predictor in terms of the Rademacher complexity of the base learners. We report the results of a number of experiments on a variety of datasets, showing that our approach provides statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including various ensemble learning methods. Our approach works because it allows us to endogenously create more complex learners - when needed - and endogenously match both the learner and the training set to the characteristics of the dataset while still avoiding over-fitting.

40|$|The {{steady-state}} kinetics of {{the reaction}} catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase b from rabbit skeletal muscles has been studied {{in a wide range}} of the concentrations of adenosine 5 ′-monophosphate in the direction of glycogen synthesis under the conditions of saturation of the enzyme by glycogen. The kinetic model has been proposed to describe the bell-shaped dependence of the initial rate of the enzymatic reaction on the concentration of adenosine 5 ′-monophosphate. The parameters of the equation for the initial rate of the enzymatic reaction are calculated by the nonlinear regression method. The conformational transitions in the glycogen phosphorylase b molecule compatible with the proposed kinetic mechanism are discussed. A distinguishing feature of the allosteric enzymes is an existence of the distinct spatially separated site, in which the binding of the allosteric effector occurs. Allosteric enzymes, as a rule, consist of two or more subunits and have at least two catalytic and two allosteric sites [1]. One of the approaches to elucidation of the mechanism of the site interaction in the enzyme molecule is the study of the kinetic mechanism of allosteric regulation of the enzymatic activity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an analysis}} of the morphosyntax of the Turkish causative construction within the framework of Distributed Morphology (DM). It is an attempt to capture a range of different phenomena in a principled way within this framework. Important aspects of DM for the analysis herein include the syntactic derivation of words; the existence of an acategorial Root from which all words are syntactically derived; and the late (post-syntactic) insertion of Vocabulary Items (VIs) into terminal syntactic nodes. A distinction is made between two different levels of causative: Root (or inner) causatives, and productive (or outer) causatives. Root causatives are minimal structures in which a Root phrase (comprising a Root and its nominal complement) is merged with a verbalizing head, little-v (Harley 1995; Chomsky 1995, 2001; Marantz 1997). This domain is the locus of idiosyncratic allomorphy, and it is where the traditionally recognized ‘irregular’ causatives suffixes are found. In addition, another type of idiosyncratic Root-adjacent phenomenon is identified in this study: independent exponence of the verbalizing feature and of the causative feature (CAUS). This is analyzed as CAUS fission: the result of a post-syntactic operation that <b>splits</b> the <b>terminal</b> node [v, CAUS] into two positions of exponence. Productive causatives are larger structures in which a vP is merged with a CAUS head. The identification of the Root causative head as v. CAUS but the productive causative head as simply CAUS is a departure from Harley's (2008) analysis of Japanese causatives, and is a new proposal in this work. Following Pylkkänen (2002, 2008), the external argument is not introduced by either v. CAUS or CAUS, but by a higher projection, Voice. This innovation makes it possible to model syntactic differences between Japanese and Turkish productive causatives. Japanese causatives embed Voice (i. e., they are ‘phase-selecting,’ in Pylkkänen's terminology) while Turkish causatives embed little-v (i. e., they are ‘verb-selecting’). Hence, the former behave as two clauses with regard to a range of diagnostics, while the latter behave as a single clause. Furthermore, it is proposed that productive causatives do not exhibit syntactic recursion, and that cases of causative iteration are actually morphological reduplication...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use of tree pattern {{matching}} for instruction selection has proven {{very successful in}} modern compilers. This {{can be attributed to}} the declarative nature of tree grammar specifications, which greatly simplifies the development of fast high-quality code generators. The approach has also been adopted widely by generator tools that aim to automatically extract the instruction selector, as well as other compiler components, for application-specific instruction processors from generic processor models. A major advantage of tree {{pattern matching}} is that it is suitable for static analysis and allows to verify properties of a given specification. Completeness is an important example of such a property, in particular for automatically generated compilers. Tree automata can be used to prove that a given instruction selector specification is complete, i. e., can actually generate machine code for all possible input programs. Traditional approaches for completeness tests cannot represent dynamic checks that may disable certain matching rules during code generation. However, these dynamic checks occur very frequently in compilers targeting application-specific processors. The dynamic checks arise from hidden properties that are not captured by the terminal symbols of the tree grammar notation. We apply <b>terminal</b> <b>splitting</b> to the instruction selector specifications that are automatically derived from structural processor models to make these properties explicit. The transformed specification is then verified using a traditional completeness test. If the test fails, counter examples are presented that allow to adopt the compiler or extend the processor model accordingly...|$|R

The Eighth Mediterranean Games, held in Split in {{the second}} half of September 1979, the largest sporting event in Yugoslavia so far, were not only sports, but also a political event. At the newly built stadium in Poljud, the Games were opened by Josip Broz Tito as their chief sponsor. Despite the precarious internal political situation, but considering the overall political situation in the Mediterranean, Yugoslavia was the only possible organiser of the Games. By overriding the sporting dimension, the echoes of political dimension had left a considerable trace, especially in the printed media. The rhetoric of the newspaper articles and interviews with the top organisers of the Games, who were also top officials of the then policy, promoted the very internal and foreign policy of Yugoslavia through sport, and the feuilletons were giving a retrospective overview of the previous seven Games and the superimposition of the negative political aspects on sport, or chronic problems among the Mediterranean states. Although the dominant political dimension and its echoes in the press had been following the ten years preparation period and the successful realisation of the Games, the most long-term goal of the Games was the infrastructural renaissance of Split and co-organising towns.

The {{northern part of}} the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on {{the southern end of the}} Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort. Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as [...] "LD" [...] which is part of the Cincinnati Division. From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee. At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash [...] "Amqui" [...] location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal. Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as [...] "SA" [...] and operates on AAR58. There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui. From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track). There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1. Few more miles southward, the next major location appears. At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal. From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago. The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track. From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track. From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike. The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of [...] "0BA" [...] but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal. At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard. Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals. This location is known as North Radnor. The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta. The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures. The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main. Both lines remain double track for a while. The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0. Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south. From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge. At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40. From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10. After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown. On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present. This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it. The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye. The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic. The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal. The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0. The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 [...] "11th Avenue" [...] where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track. The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at [...] "Shops". Now speed has been increased. The line is still double track until [...] "Sellars", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher. For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements. The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3. The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines. The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed. The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel. Crew change usually occurs at the [...] "walkway" [...] which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower. This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins. Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated. At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now. There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3. About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double. About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names). When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as [...] "Long Lead". And now, the <b>Terminal</b> <b>splits</b> into two parts. The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood. The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while. This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line. The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2. Speed is now increased to 40. Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance. Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line. At 00J3.6 known as A-1. Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9). Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line. At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, [...] "SC". At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill. There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track. And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad. Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard. Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10. Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192. The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use. The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs. At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1. Speed is now at 40. 2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present. This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main. There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track. Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains. This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent. From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip. The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood. Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher. The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important.|$|R
