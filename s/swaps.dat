5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with maturities {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations.

40|$|PURPOSE. To compare intersubject {{variability}} {{and normal}} limits of threshold values {{between the new}} Swedish interactive test algorithm short wavelength automated perimetry (SITA <b>SWAP)</b> and the older Full Threshold <b>SWAP</b> programs (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). METHODS. Normal reduction of differential tight sensitivity with age, age-corrected thresholds, intersubject variability, and normal limits of sensitivity were calculated from SITA <b>SWAP</b> and Full Threshold <b>SWAP</b> fields obtained in 53 normal subjects between 20 and 72 years of age. RESULTS. Age influence on threshold sensitivity was {{the same with the}} two <b>SWAP</b> programs. On average, sensitivity decreased by 0. 13 dB per year of age. Age-corrected normal threshold sensitivity was significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) for SITA <b>SWAP</b> than for Full Threshold <b>SWAP.</b> The means for a subject 45. 4 years of age were 28. 8 dB with SITA <b>SWAP</b> and 24. 4 dB with Full Threshold <b>SWAP.</b> Intersubject variance was 22 % smaller with SITA <b>SWAP</b> than with Full Threshold <b>SWAP.</b> Normal limits at the P < 5 % significance level were, on average, 14 % narrower with SITA <b>SWAP</b> than with Full Threshold <b>SWAP</b> using Total Deviations from age-corrected normal thresholds and 11 % narrower when applying Pattern Deviation, which is intended to adjust for general depression or elevation of the field. CONCLUSIONS. SITA <b>SWAP</b> test results from normal eyes showed higher sensitivities than results from the older Full Threshold <b>SWAP.</b> This represents an increase of the dynamic range, which implies that more patients can be tested with <b>SWAP.</b> The smaller intersubject variability with SITA <b>SWAP</b> means narrower normal limits and may be associated with more sensitive probability maps...|$|R

40|$|The {{observed}} {{difference between}} the <b>swap</b> rate and the government bond yield of corresponding maturity {{is known as the}} <b>swap</b> spread. The <b>swap</b> spread reflects the risk premium that is involved in a <b>swap</b> transaction instead of holding risk-free government bonds. It is primarily composed of the liquidity risk premium and the credit risk premium. In recent years there has been growing interest in modelling <b>swap</b> spreads because the <b>swap</b> spread is the key pricing variable for the <b>swap</b> rate. The Australian interest rate <b>swap</b> market is the most important over-the-counter (OTC) derivative market in Australia. In this paper we apply the class of mixture autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (MARCH) models to three (3 -year, 5 -year and 10 -year) <b>swap</b> spread series in Australia. The MARCH model is able to capture both of the stylised characteristics of the observed changes of the <b>swap</b> spread series: volatility persistence and the dependence of volatility on the level of the data.

5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then <b>swaps</b> the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E
