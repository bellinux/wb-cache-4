40|$|The {{title of}} this {{contribution}} concerns the sovereignty of OHADA’s States as a solution or a problem of juridical integration. In our analysis, we consider that the States of the OHADA’s area are the main actors of this integration. In fact, the <b>States</b> <b>express</b> <b>their</b> <b>sovereignty</b> towards organs and tools of OHADA. In one hand, the way <b>States</b> <b>express</b> <b>their</b> <b>sovereignty</b> enable {{to have the same}} law amongst OHADA’s States. In another hand, by allowing any State to have his own criminal law (as far as sanctions are concerned) the aim of integration (unification) has been jeopardized. The solution of this problem is to have the same penal approach...|$|E

That Amendment expressly forbade citizens of one state from suing another state, but said nothing about citizens suing their own state. Thus the Court was left to resolve the issue of whether such a suit was therefore allowed.|$|R

40|$|The Indigenous {{nations of}} the United States have long been subject to federal policy. Since the Civil Rights Era, that federal policy purportedly has been to {{encourage}} self-determination and tribal sovereignty. One {{of the hallmarks of}} self-determination is the development of Tribal legal systems, which have been actively encouraged and funded by the federal government. As a result, Tribes have been exercising their jurisdiction in ways that were not contemplated decades ago. As Tribes have <b>expressed</b> <b>their</b> <b>sovereignty</b> through <b>their</b> court systems, {{it is not surprising that}} states sometimes feel that their own jurisdiction is threatened. This conflict creates a need for increased understanding, communication, and cooperation between Tribal and state governments. The extent to which Tribal-state cooperation succeeds or fails depends in large part upon their ability to understand each other’s philosophical, legal, and historical realities. Cultural barriers to communication can, if left unattended, prevent meaningful cooperation from taking place. Historical myths and prejudices about the First Peoples of the United States threaten to keep Indigenous communities impoverished and marginalized. These myths stem from first contact, and form the root of modern, anti- Tribal policies, legislation, and court decisions. If we agree that Tribal-state relationships should evolve, we must first accept that the historical animosity and distrust are the products of a powerful legacy of colonization, genocide, and oppression...|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} criticism, over the years, {{in regards to}} this “unwritten constitution” and much {{encouragement}} {{from the international community}} to change this. The 2009 Universal Periodic Review on New Zealand, through the Human Rights Council, is a good demonstration of this. In this review concerns were expressed that, due to constitution, not entrenched, there was no overarching protection for human rights. Within the review multiple <b>states</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>their</b> concerns over the lack of protection human rights had, due to the constitutional framework; all states were seen to highly recommend New Zealand taking steps towards constitutional entrenchment, and therefore protected human rights. Aside from these issues brought up, the international community collectively commended New Zealand's work in upholding human rights, such as the amount of ratifications completed and the work with the Maori peoples.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2008. Major: American Studies. Advisor: Wilkins, David E. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 324 pages. This dissertation seeks {{to better understand}} and explain how the Anishinaabe constructed and <b>expressed</b> <b>their</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> nationhood, and land tenure when they negotiated treaties with the United States and Canada from 1785 to 1923. This trilogy of terms often became convoluted in treaty negotiations during which both native Nations and the two states involved brought their own understandings for these terms into the negotiation processes. I analyze approximately fifty-four ratified treaties negotiated between the Anishinaabe and the United States and Canada. Placing Anishinaabe bands at the center, this study examines how and why treaty provisions dealing with land have affected the political and legal status of aboriginal in treaty rights in both states. Anishinaabe sovereignty was deeply intertwined with conceptions of nationhood and land tenure. A focus on treaty making provides a site where the competing conceptions of these terms held by participating nations must be negotiated. In order to obtain mutual agreements with each other. This dissertation operates from the premise that a re-examination of treaty discourse, when interpreted according to Anishinaabe cultural conceptions and knowledge systems, may help reveal what these peoples ceded or surrendered and what they reserved in these agreements. These findings provide a fresh understanding of bilateral treaty making, which forms the foundation of Anishinaabe-state relations. Furthermore, the insights gleaned from this study may reshape our understandings of Anishinaabe reserved aboriginal and treaty rights and help improve intergovernmental relations...|$|R

40|$|The {{mounting}} {{tension between}} African {{states and the}} International Criminal Court casts a dark shadow over the Court’s tenth anniversary. Since the Prosecutor’s application for an arrest warrant against the Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir in July 2008, African <b>states</b> have <b>expressed</b> <b>their</b> concerns and indeed frustrations about the Court. The purpose of this thesis is to explain what these proclaimed concerns and frustrations might imply for the sociological legitimacy of the Court. In contrast to most preceding studies on sociological legitimacy in the international realm, this thesis embarks upon this task by analysing the legitimacy perceptions of African states. Unmistakably, these perceptions are subjective qualities and are as such not readily accessible for outside-observers. However, although scholars cannot make conclusive statements about the legitimacy perceptions of African states, they {{can come up with}} reasonable assumptions about what African states perceive as legitimate and what this might imply for the sociological legitimacy of the Court. This thesis proposes that such reasonable assumptions can be derived from the specific contexts in which African <b>states</b> have <b>expressed</b> <b>their</b> concerns and frustrations about the Court and from the wider political space in which African states operate. ...|$|R

However, there was no official comment on this view from the EU Commission.

30|$|This {{philosophical}} {{stance is}} distinctively {{different from the}} view of egalitarianism as hold by educators and scholars in the West, which emphasizes equality in political, economics, educational, or social life (Condron 2011; Gordon 1999; Holtug and Lippert-Rasmussen 2007). As discussed earlier, in the United States, No Child Left Behind (NCTB) which mandates testing for all students in grades 3 through grade 8 has been spreading controversies. Educators in the United <b>States</b> <b>express</b> <b>their</b> concerns that the implementation of NCTB would reinforce the wide inequalities in income among families, with the most resources being spent on children from the wealthiest communities and the fewest on {{the children of the}} poor, especially in high-minority communities (Darling-Hammond 2000). Carlson (2009) described that assessment in its educational system in Sweden has a role to play in achieving a fair distribution of privileges, requiring where the extra resources are given to those who are in need. Therefore, testing and assessment is constructed to discriminate between the weak students and the others, but not between the average and the clever ones. However, the new policy and national testing started in 2003 differentiated the average and the clever, and eroded the egalitarianism tradition.|$|R
