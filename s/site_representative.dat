40|$|PURPOSE: The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{determine}} (i) the long-term disease recurrence in intraosseous defects that had undergone an open flap debridement (OFD) procedure with or without enamel matrix derivative (EMD); and (ii) whether and to what extent clinical changes recorded on teeth treated with surgery were similar at sites involved or adjacent to the intraosseous defect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients contributing twelve reconstructed intraosseous defects were retrospectively recruited and included for analysis. Immediately before surgery, at 12 months post-surgery and at long-term examination (6 - 8 years post-surgery), probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded at the test <b>site</b> (<b>representative</b> of the reconstructed intraosseous defect) and the control <b>site</b> (<b>representative</b> of an adjacent non-reconstructed site) of each tooth treated with surgery. RESULTS: All patients received monthly professional maintenance up to 12 months after surgery, and every 6 months or less frequently thereafter. In test sites, CAL varied from 5. 4 +/- 0. 8 mm at 12 months to 6. 5 +/- 1. 0 mm at the long-term examination. PPD increased from 3. 7 +/- 0. 4 mm at 12 months to 4. 3 +/- 0. 6 mm at the long-term examination, the changes being not statistically significant. When PPD and CAL changes from 12 months to the long-term examination were compared between test and control sites, no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Within its limitations and considering the limited sample size, the present study indicates that (i) the attachment gain that has been achieved by means of a surgical reconstructive procedure (based on OFD with/without EMD) may be mostly maintained over a 6 - 8 year follow-up period; and (ii) the extent of disease recurrence, as assessed by attachment loss and pocket deepening, was similar at sites involved or adjacent to the intraosseous defect...|$|E

40|$|The Australian Great Artesian Basin (GAB) {{supports}} {{a unique and}} diverse range of groundwater dependent wetland ecosystems termed GAB springs. In recent decades the ecological sustainability of the springs has become uncertain as demands on this iconic groundwater resource increase. The impacts of existing water extractions for mining and pastoral activities are unknown. This situation {{is compounded by the}} likelihood of future increasing demand for extractions. Hyperspectral remote sensing provides the necessary spectral and spatial detail to discriminate wetland vegetation communities. Therefore the objectives of this paper are to discriminate the spatial extent and distribution of key spring wetland vegetation communities associated with the GAB springs evaluating three hyperspectral techniques: Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) and Spectrally Segmented PCA. In addition, to determine if the hyperspectral techniques developed can be applied at a number of <b>sites</b> <b>representative</b> of the range of spring formations and geomorphic settings and at two temporal intervals.

40|$|Abstract. –The thermal {{biology of}} {{obligatory}} aquatic salamanders (e. g., Amphiumidae) is largely unknown. We therefore investigated thermal selection and temperature preference in the fully aquatic salamander, Amphiuma tridactylum. In a laboratory thermal gradient, A. tridactylum selected a mean water temperature of 26. 3 ° C (SE = 0. 29, n = 15, range = 24. 3 to 27. 9). We also investigated potential influences of body size on thermal selection {{and found no}} significant relationship between thermal selection and snout-vent length or body mass. The preferred selected temperature {{is higher than the}} preferred temperatures reported for other obligatory aquatic salamanders, a difference that may reflect A. tridactylum’s southern distribution in the U.
