50|$|With the DP-3 head, {{the camera}} became the F2SB Photomic, {{available}} 1976 to 1977. The DP-3 introduced three innovations: a <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> light meter (a first for Nikon SLRs) for {{faster and more}} accurate light readings, a five-stage center-the-LED exposure control system using +/o/− LEDs, and an eyepiece blind.|$|E

50|$|The Konica FT-1 was {{the last}} SLR to be built both under the Konica name and by Konica themselves.

50|$|Features {{include an}} {{integrated}} <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> TTL lightmeter which works from EV-2 to EV20.

The camera's viewfinder is available with different magnifications of 0.58x, 0.72x and 0.85x and is improved to reduce flaring with multicoated glass elements and a condenser lens. The camera is also compatible with Leica Motor-M, Winder-M, Winder 4-P and Winder 4-2 motorised film winders and the Leicavit manual winder.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Photodetectors {{constructed}} of <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiodes</b> are in widespread use in optical radiometry. Along with single photodiodes, configurations known as trap defectors 1, 2 {{have been developed}} and implemented {{during the past two}} decades. Reflection trap detectors have been successfully used, e. g., in comparison measurements of optical power scales, 3, 4 for establishing spectral responsivity scales, 5, 6 and in realization of detector-based illuminance 7 and spectral irradiance scales. 8, 9 Recently, a new branch of trap detectors for precision radiometry, known as transmission trap detectors, has been introduced 10, 11 and characterized. 12, 13 Measurement uncertainties at the level of 1 3 10 24 are achievable in precision radiometry with detectors based on <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiodes.</b> To reach such an accuracy, one must take into accoun...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{cryogenic}} radiometers for {{the determination of}} detector responsivity at single wavelengths has reduced the uncertainties in such calibrations by {{an order of magnitude}} if not more (Fox et al 1990, Nield et al 1998). However, maintaining such uncertainties also relies upon the artifacts being stable over time to better than the uncertainty itself. The stability of sets of radiometric quality (<b>silicon)</b> <b>photodiodes</b> has been followed for almost a decade in two different NMIs. The <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiodes</b> are invariably Hamamatsu S 1337 or S 6337 in both single and multi-element trap detector configurations. The trap configurations include 3 -element (S 1337) and 5 -element (S 1337) reflection traps as well as 4 -element (S 6337) transmission traps. In all cases, unless otherwise stated, th...|$|R

50|$|The major {{improvements}} in the FM2 compared to the FM were <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> light meter sensors, limited automatic dedicated electronic flash control and, most famously, a mechanically-timed vertical metal shutter (bearing mounted for reduced friction and extended life) reaching {{a top speed of}} an unprecedented 1/4000th second, with an X-sync of 1/200. This shutter was able to reach such ultra-fast speeds because its titanium honeycomb curtains had a travel time of 3.3 milliseconds, half of typical vertical travel metal-bladed focal plane shutters of the time.|$|E
50|$|The <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> sensors are {{designed}} to detect the distinctive bright double pulse of visible light that is emitted from atmospheric nuclear weapons explosions. This signature consists of a short and intense flash lasting around 1 millisecond, followed by a second much more prolonged and less intense emission of light taking {{a fraction of a}} second to several seconds to build up. This signature, with a double intensity maximum, is characteristic of atmospheric nuclear explosions and is the result of the Earth's atmosphere becoming opaque to visible light and transparent again as the explosion's shock wave travels through it.|$|E
5000|$|The OM-4 was {{the first}} camera with a {{built-in}} multi-spot exposure meter (2% of view; 3.3˚ with 50 mm lens) which could take up to eight spot measurements and average them. Another unique feature was the selectable option to assess the darkest or brightest part of the scene, the camera adjusting the exposure based on that measure. The light meter used a dual-concentric segmented <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> to provide spot or center-weighted readings. It used a graduated, linear LCD shutter speed display {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder to precisely indicate its readings versus the actual camera settings.|$|E
40|$|The quantum {{efficiencies}} of semiconductor photodiodes {{have been}} measured at photon energies from 5 to 3500 eV.

30|$|Optimized black silicon samples {{exhibit a}} high {{responsivity}} {{that are almost}} two and five orders of magnitude {{higher than that of}} the commercial <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiodes</b> in the visible and near-infrared wavelength. By using optimized laser parameter, R. Torresa modified the front side of black silicon samples and created the 3 D p+ junction by using Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation technique to achieve boron implanting [12]. Compared to the non-texturized surface area, it has been demonstrated that the texturized devices show a 57 % increase of photocurrent. The traditional <b>silicon</b> PIN <b>photodiodes</b> show a poor absorbing ability to the light above 1.1  μm. Therefore, they cannot be used to detect the two primary telecommunication wavelengths, 1.3 and 1.55  μm. According to Aoife M. Moloney, it was established that an excess increase of 50 % in responsivity performance existed in the black silicon surface at 1.1  μm or long wavelengths [13]. Meanwhile, the threshold voltage of black <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiodes</b> is lower than that of the standard silicon-based diodes. The existence of a second photodiode junction formed between the black silicon surface and the silicon substrate made a main contribution to the lower threshold voltage.|$|R
40|$|When the {{attenuation}} {{lengths of}} beams in silicon are well below a micron, a high responsivity of <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiodes</b> {{can only be}} reached if the photo-sensitive region for detection {{is close to the}} surface.

5000|$|... 1971: Fujica ST701 (Japan): first SLR with <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> {{light meter}} sensors. Early SLR TTL meters used cadmium sulfide (CdS) cells (see Topcon RE Super and Asahi Pentax Spotmatic above), {{as they were}} the first sensors small enough to be {{internally}} mounted. However, CdS needed fairly bright light and suffered from a [...] "memory" [...] effect where it might take 30 seconds or more to respond to a light level change. Although silicon's infrared response required blue filtration to match the eye's spectral response, silicon supplanted CdS by the late 1970s because of its greater sensitivity and instantaneous response.|$|E
50|$|The FM10 is a {{mechanically}} (springs, gears, levers) controlled manual focus SLR with {{manual exposure}} control. It is operable without batteries, which are only required (two S76 or A76, or one 1/3N) {{for the light}} metering information system. This consists of an internal 60/40 percent centerweighted, <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> light meter linked to a center-the-LED exposure control system using vertically arranged +/•/- light emitting diodes (LEDs) {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the meter versus the actual camera settings. The focusing screen also has 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids. Overall, the FM10 has the features of a typical late 1970s SLR.|$|E
50|$|In manual mode, {{the camera}} is {{completely}} mechanical in operation, and only requires batteries for the light metering information system. In aperture priority mode, the batteries continued to power the meter, but are also utilized for shutter timing and the exposure control electronics. The FM3A's metering information system consisted of a match-needle system using two needles pointing along a vertical shutter speed scale {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40% centerweighted <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> light meter versus the actual camera settings. This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat EL (Nikomat EL in Japan) of 1972. The viewfinder also has Nikon's fully interchangeable bright focus screen with various options for focus.|$|E

5000|$|The FE is a manual-focus SLR with manual {{exposure}} control or aperture-priority autoexposure, and electromechanical components. As such, the FE requires batteries (two S76 or A76, or LR44 or SR44, or one 1/3N) to power its electronically controlled shutter. The batteries also power the FE's [...] "match-needle" [...] exposure control system. This {{consists of two}} needles pointing along a vertical shutter speed scale {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder. In manual mode, a black needle points out the shutter speed recommended by the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL), <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> (SPD) light meter, with 60/40 percent centerweighting, while a translucent green needle shows the actual camera-set shutter speed. The photographer adjusts the shutter speed and/or the lens aperture f-stop until the needles align.|$|E
50|$|The major {{improvements}} in the FE2 compared to the FE are <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> light meter sensors, internal printed circuit electronics, provision for through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation (essentially identical to the system introduced in the Nikon FG in 1982) and a quartz oscillator timed, bearing-mounted, titanium-bladed shutter reaching an ultra-fast top speed of 1/4000th second (plus world's fastest X-sync to 1/250th second).This design is an improved electronically controlled version of the mechanical shutter introduced in the Nikon FM2, with eight honeycomb-patterned blades instead of nine and shutter curtain travel time further reduced to 3.3 milliseconds from 3.6 milliseconds.The FE2 also introduced a unique rotating flywheel plus inertial mass damping system to minimize mirror shock vibration effects and render a mirror lock-up feature unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|The CLE has an {{electronic}} {{focal plane shutter}} to 1/1000 seconds, and a through-the-lens (TTL) <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> (SPD) exposure meter with aperture-priority automatic or manual exposure, and automated ambient and flash exposure metering system continuing to work and dynamically adjusting the shutter speed and TTL, off the film (OTF) flash during the exposure itself. The ambient metering worked in a very similar way to that employed by the then current Olympus OM-2n single-lens reflex camera(SLR) camera. Ambient light {{was measured by the}} SPD as it was reflected off a pattern on the shutter curtains. It also proved particularly useful if filters were being used. None of these features would appear on any other body for M-mount lenses until the Konica Hexar RF of 1999, which has all but TTL-OTF flash metering and dynamic exposure.|$|E

50|$|IR data {{transmission}} is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants. These devices usually conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation which is focused by a plastic lens {{into a narrow}} beam. The beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, to encode the data. The receiver uses a <b>silicon</b> <b>photodiode</b> to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms.
