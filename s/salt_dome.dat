5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on <b>salt</b> <b>dome</b> Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into <b>salt</b> <b>dome</b> formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.|$|E
25|$|In April 1947, new {{producing}} {{oil wells}} were drilled near Iago {{on the southwest}} edge of the Boling <b>salt</b> <b>dome.</b> Soon after, other successful wells were drilled on the north, northeast, and south flanks of the structure. Between 1947 and 1951, the field's production leaped {{to an average of}} 1 million barrels per year. At the end of 1952 there were 180 oil wells. In 1927, a sulphur-rich core sample was retrieved from the caprock and the production of sulphur began. From that year until 1952, about 38 million tons of sulphur were extracted from the Boling <b>salt</b> <b>dome.</b>|$|E

NatureServe considers it to be critically imperiled (S1) in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Utah, imperiled (S2) in Kansas and North Carolina, and vulnerable (S3) in West Virginia. It has become extinct in Louisiana since the limestone caprock of a <b>salt</b> <b>dome</b> at Winnfield, the only location for the fern in the state, was quarried away. It is also believed to be extinct in Ohio, where it was last collected in 1900, although suitable habitat still exists in the state.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, great {{amounts of}} {{sediment}} {{collected on the}} floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the Lisan Peninsula and Mount Sodom (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see <b>salt</b> <b>dome).</b>|$|E

50|$|Native sulfur is {{synthesised}} by anaerobic bacteria {{acting on}} sulfate minerals such as gypsum in <b>salt</b> <b>domes.</b> Significant deposits in <b>salt</b> <b>domes</b> occur {{along the coast}} of the Gulf of Mexico, and in evaporites in eastern Europe and western Asia. Native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone. Fossil-based sulfur deposits from <b>salt</b> <b>domes</b> were until recently the basis for commercial production in the United States, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. Currently, commercial production is still carried out in the Osiek mine in Poland. Such sources are now of secondary commercial importance, and most are no longer worked.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Salt</b> <b>domes</b> are {{vertical}} diapirs or pipe-like {{masses of}} salt {{that have been}} essentially [...] "squeezed up" [...] from underlying salt beds by mobilization due to the weight of overlying rock. <b>Salt</b> <b>domes</b> contain anhydrite, gypsum, and native sulfur, in addition to halite and sylvite. They are common along the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana and are often associated with petroleum deposits. Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Romania and Iran also have <b>salt</b> <b>domes.</b> <b>Salt</b> glaciers exist in arid Iran where the salt has broken through the surface at high elevation and flows downhill.

500|$|Higgins {{ventured into}} real estate at [...] first, {{and with the}} money that he saved as a logger, he started the Higgins Manufacturing Company to {{manufacture}} bricks. The business sparked his interest in oil and gas, as he used it for his kilns to burn the bricks evenly. He decided to travel to Pennsylvania to learn about these fuels and study the geographical features that give signs {{to the presence of}} underground oil. Studying geology on his own, he dedicated himself to finding these clues by reading all the United States Geological Survey reports and books that he could find. The details he learned reminded him of what some Beaumont locals back home referred to as [...] "Sour Hill Mound", a place where he frequently brought his Sunday school students for outings. This mound was described as [...] "sour" [...] due to the unpleasant sulfur smell {{that came out of the}} springs around it. Convinced that this <b>salt</b> <b>dome</b> mound had oil below it, Higgins first partnered with George O'Brien, George Carroll, Emma John, and J.F. Lanier to form the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company in 1892. It was during this time that other formally trained geologists dismissed the idea of finding oil along the gulf coast region of the United States. Higgins' personal integrity was even challenged by the local newspaper. However, his informal training in geology influenced his belief that the Spindletop field contained oil below due to the presence of mineral water and gas seepage, and he managed to convince the partners to proceed with the venture. Work began the following year, but all three of the shallow drilling attempts failed to locate oil due to the shifting sands and unstable clay under the hill. Higgins held onto his ownership and leases of land over the <b>salt</b> <b>dome,</b> but resigned from the company.|$|E
500|$|The late Paleozoic {{mountains}} collapsed as rifting in the Jurassic period {{began to}} open the Gulf of Mexico.

The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin {{of the state and}} the Gulf of Mexico passive margin began to form. Today [...] of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US oil reserves are located here. At the start of its formation, the incipient Gulf of Mexico basin was restricted and seawater often evaporated completely to form thick evaporite deposits of Jurassic age. These salt deposits formed <b>salt</b> <b>dome</b> diapirs, and are found in East Texas along the Gulf coast.|$|E
500|$|A {{controversial}} topic {{during his}} tenure as minister was {{the search for a}} radioactive waste site in Lower Saxony. In 1975, three locations had been deemed suitable for further investigation: the salt domes Lutterloh, Lichtenhorst and Wahn. Two years later, however, the state government designated the Gorleben <b>salt</b> <b>dome</b> as a single location for the repository and waste disposal center. In 2011, a commission of enquiry of the Bundestag investigated the award procedure. Journal entries of Kiep's had implied that he was {{the driving force behind the}} decision to promote Gorleben, putting the idea forward at a meeting with Albrecht and three federal ministers in Hannover on 11 November 1976. Since he had attended a meeting with delegates from the nuclear power industry on the same day, it was speculated that the lobby had exercised influence on Kiep. Appearing before the committee as a witness, Kiep claimed not to remember the events exactly but said that he considered it [...] "unlikely" [...] that he was the one who proposed Gorleben, because he did not have enough expertise in the matter.|$|E
