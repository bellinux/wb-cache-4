40|$|The {{biological}} effect of heavy ions is best described through the action cross section, {{as a function}} of the end-point of interest and the charge and speed of the ion. In track theory this is called the “ion-kill 2 ̆ 2 cross section, for it is the effect produced by a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> and its delta rays. As with nuclear emulsions the biological track structure passes from the grain count regime to the track width regime to the thindown region with an increase in LET. With biological cells, as with any detector capable of storing sub-lethal damage, with low LET irradiation the action cross section (in the ion-kill mode) is increasingly obscured by the effect of 2 ̆ 2 gamma-kill” by the influence of overlapping delta rays from neighboring heavy ions. Thus at low LET, response is dominated by the gamma-kill mode, so that the RBE approaches 1. The theory requires 4 radiosensitivity parameters for biological detectors, extracted from survival curves at several high LET bombardments passing through the grain count regime, and at high doses. Once these are known the systematic response of biological detectors to all high LET bombardments can be unfolded separating ion kill from gamma kill, predicting the response to a mixed radiation environment, and predicting low dose response even at the level of a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion.</b> Cell killing parameters are now available for a variety of cell lines.

Results are presented from tests on 19 different device types from six manufacturers which investigate their latchup sensitivity with argon and krypton beams.

Detector and circuit noise must be low enough to detect the implantation of a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> as well as the decrease in the light ion IBIC signal caused by Shockley-Read-Hall recombination when the beam scans regions of the detector damaged by the heavy ion.

40|$|We {{showed that}} a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> can wipe out the MOSFET driving current {{capability}} in small W devices. In this case the damaged oxide region may span over {{a large portion of}} the gate width, effectively hampering the channel formation. In large W devices, this effect becomes less important as W becomes larger than the damaged region. Noticeably, Moore’s law is acting in the sense of making MOSFETs more sensitive to localized damage by shrinking the device dimensions. What will happen with oxides thinner than 2 nm and alternative gate dielectrics is open to investigation. All these considerations lead to the conclusion that a MOSFET with small W may fail due to a single ion hit producing SEDC 2 well before the oxide breakdown condition is reached. RSB or SEGR may occur a long time after the device has lost most of its current driving capability and is, therefore, failed. In this case the device lifetime can no more be evaluated by considering the breakdown onset but, instead, its sensitivity to microdose effects such as those produced by high LET particles...|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{proposed}} future applications of graphene require the controlled introduction of defects into its perfect lattice. Energetic ions provide one way of achieving this challenging goal. <b>Single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> with kinetic energies in the 100 MeV range will produce nanometer-sized defects on dielectric but generally not on crystalline metal surfaces. In a metal the ion-induced electronic excitations are efficiently dissipated by the conduction electrons before the transfer of energy to the lattice atoms sets in. Therefore, graphene {{is not expected to}} be irradiation sensitive beyond the creation of point defects. Here we show that graphene on a dielectric substrate sustains major modifications if irradiated under oblique angles. Due to a combination of defect creation in the graphene layer and hillock creation in the substrate, graphene is split and folded along the ion track yielding double layer nanoribbons. Our results indicate that the radiation hardness of graphene devices is questionable but also open up a new way of introducing extended low-dimensional defects in a controlled way...|$|R

The transport {{properties of}} pores in a blend membrane are examined. The pores were produced in this membrane by a track etching technique. For this purpose, a thin polymer mem-brane was penetrated by a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> of Ni 7 + of 100 MeV, followed by preferential chemical etching of the ion track. Ion permeation measurements show that pores in polymeric membrane are charged or neutralized, which {{depends upon the}} variation in concentration of the solvent. The V–I curve at concentration, N/ 10, shows that the pores are negatively charged, whereas at concentration, N/ 20, the linear nature of V–I curve indicates that the pores approach towards neutralized state and on further concentration, N/ 40, the pores become fully neutralized, consequently the rectifier behaviour of pores has been omitted. The gas permeability of hydrogen and carbon dioxide of this membrane was measured with increasing etching time. The permeability was measured from both the sides.

40|$|The various craters {{formed by}} giant objects, {{macroscopic}} collisions and nanoscale impacts exhibit an intriguing resemblance in shapes. At the same time, the arc plasma {{built up in}} the presence of sufficiently high electric fields at close look causes very similar damage on the surfaces. Although the plasma–wall interaction is far from a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> impact over dense metal surfaces or the one of a cluster ion, the craters seen on metal surfaces after a plasma discharge make it possible to link this event to the known mechanisms of the crater formations. During the plasma discharge in a high electric field the surface is subject to high fluxes (~ 1025 cm- 2 s- 1) of ions with roughly equal energies typically of the order of a few keV. To simulate such a process it is possible to use a cloud of ions of the same energy. In the present work we follow the effect of such a flux of ions impinging the surface in the ‘‘shower’’ manner, to find the transition between the different mechanisms of crater formation. We also introduce the ‘‘shower’’-like regime of ion bombardment (underdense cloud of ions) as a subsequent regime between the single ion impact (a rare ‘‘shower’’) and cluster ions (densely packed cloud) ...|$|E

Scatter products have been found with detectors placed behind the mirror. They have been analyzed by various methods to characterize their properties and the effects produced by them in the pn-CCD.

40|$|Introduction: Heavy ions are {{nucleus of}} {{elements}} of iron, argon, carbon and neon that all carry positive electrical charges. For these particles {{to be useful}} in radiotherapy they need to accelerated to high energy by more than thousand mega volts. Also the cosmic environment {{is considered to be}} a complicated mixture of highly energetic photons and heavy ions such as iron. Therefore, the health risks to astronauts during long mission should be considered.   Materials and Methods: The induction of interphase death was tested on Chinese hamster ovary cells by exposing them to accelerated heavy ions (carbon, neon, argon and iron) of 10 - 2000 linear energy transfers (LETs). The fraction of cells that underwent interphase death was determined by observing individual cells with time-lapse photography (direct method) as well as by the indirect method of counting cells undergoing interphase death made visible by the addition of caffeine (indirect method). Results: The interphase death due to the exposure to X- rays is increased linearly as the dose exceeds the threshold dose of 10 Gy. Whereas the interphase death increases at a higher rate due to the exposure to high LET heavy ions and no threshold dose was observed. The range of LET values corresponding to the maximum RBE for the interphase death is 120 - 230 keV/µm. The probability of inducing the interphase death by a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> traversing through the nucleus is about 0. 04 - 0. 08. Discussion and Conclusion: The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of heavy ions as compared to X- rays as determined at the 50 % level of induction is increased with LET. It reached a maximum value at a LET of approximately 230 keV/µm and then decreased with further increase in LET. The range of LET values corresponding to the maximum RBE appears to be narrower for interphase death than for reproductive death...|$|E
40|$|Floating Gate (FG) memories, and in {{particular}} Flash, {{are the most important}} player in nowadays nonvolatile memory arena [1]. The basic structure of all FG memories relies on an insulated polysilicon layer (that is, the FG) interposed between the substrate and the Control Gate, CG (see Fig. 1). By accumulating a net charge in the FG we can modify the threshold voltage VTH of the FG transistor, thus storing a bit of information or more. Electrons or holes in the insulated FG cannot escape from it (at least in principle), hence granting a permanent storage of information. Electrons and holes can be injected (emitted) in (from) the FG by using Channel Hot Electron (CHE) injection or Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling [1][2]. Flash memories feature extremely high density, while maintaining good speed and reliability, but also a complex control circuitry. Single Event Effect (SEE) performances of Flash memories has been studied by several authors [3][4][5]. The most radiation sensitive part of commercial Flash memories is the complex circuitry external to the FG memory cell array [3]. For converse, the loss of the charge stored in the floating gate of a programmed cell and the consequent threshold voltage shift ÄVTH have been less frequently investigated in literature [6][7][8]. By using specially designed instrumentation and devices, we have recently shown that FG charge loss upon heavy ion irradiation is not negligible [7][8], even when it does not lead to a read error at the circuit output. The charge loss subsequent to a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> strike appears to be due to two parallel mechanisms. The first is a prompt one, taking place in times shorter than those elapsed between irradiation and measurement, and it appears as the responsible for {{the main part of the}} charge loss [8]. The second mechanism, which is the main subject of this paper, is active over long times (days and weeks) and is responsible for the slow discharge of some of the hit FGs [8]. In this context, the aim of this paper is to investigate the long-term retention issues in two advanced Flash memory technologies submitted to heavy ion irradiation...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{accelerator}} SEE {{testing is}} accomplished by removing the tops of packages so that the IC chips are accessible to heavy ions. However, ICs in some advanced packages cannot be de-lidded so a different approach is used that involves grinding and/or chemically etching away {{part of the package}} and the chip from the back side. The parts are then tested from the back side with ions having sufficient range to reach the sensitive volume. More recently, the entire silicon substrate in an SOI/SRAM was removed, making it possible to use low-energy ions with shorter ranges. Where removal of part of the package is not possible, facilities at Michigan State, NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, GANIL (France) and GSI (Germany) offer high-energy heavy ions with long ranges so that the ions can reach the devices' sensitive volumes without much change in the LET. Unfortunately, a run will typically involve only one ion species having a single energy and LET due to the long time it takes to tune a new energy. The Variable Depth Bragg Peak (VDBP) method is similar to the above method in that it involves the use of high-energy heavy ions that are able to pass through the packaging material and reach the device, obviating the need to remove the package. However, the method provides a broad range of LETs from a single ion by inserting degraders in the beam that modify the ion energy and, therefore, the LET. The crux of the method involves establishing a fiduciary point for degrader thickness, i. e., where the Bragg peak is located precisely at the sensitive volume in the device, for which the measured SEU cross-section and the ion LET are both also maxima and can be calculated using a Monte-Carlo program, TRIM. Once the fiduciary point has been established, calibrated high density polyethylene (HDPE) degraders are inserted into or removed from the beam to vary the ion LET at the device in a known manner. After each change of degrader thickness, the SEU cross-section is measured and the corresponding LET calculated from the change in degrader thickness. That information is used to generate a plot of cross-section as a function of ion LET. The advantages of this approach are that the part {{does not have to be}} de-lidded and a broad range of LETs is available from a <b>single</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> without having to go to non-normal angles of incidence to change the "effective" LET. As we will show, it is possible to obtain an entire curve of cross-section versus LET using just two or three ions. Fig. 1 shows curves of cross-section vs LET for a Freescale 4 Mbit SOI/SRAM measured at the 88 " Cyclotron at Berkeley and at NSRL. The open symbols are the data obtained from Berkeley for top-side and back-side irradiation. The solid data points are for the data obtained at NSRL using a device for which the package was intact. The data are for Iron and Gold and cover a range of LETs from 4 MeV. cm 2 /mg to 84 MeV. cm 2 /mg. The agreement between the data obtained from Berkeley and from NSRL is excellent, demonstrating that the VDBP method is capable of providing accurate values of cross-section versus LET, at least for the 4 Mbit SRAM.

In graphene this would be extremly useful with respect to tailoring its electronic properties for spintronics [10] or ultrafast transistors [11], but even direct guiding of charges may become feasible if extended defects can be realized [12].

40|$|We analyse the {{hypothesis}} that the “GSI oscillations” of the K-shell electron capture decay (EC) rates of the H-like <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> are caused by quantum beats from a coherent state of two closely spaced ground mass-eigenstates |⟩ and |⟩ of decaying H-like <b>heavy</b> <b>ions.</b> We apply this mechanism to the calculation of the +-decay rates of the H-like <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> and discuss the dynamics of the production of the H-like <b>heavy</b> <b>ions</b> with two closely spaced ground mass-eigenstates at GSI experiments. We show that such a mechanism cannot describe simultaneously the experimental data on both the EC-decay and +-decay rates of the H-like <b>heavy</b> <b>ions,</b> measured at GSI...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-range}} {{goal of the}} US <b>Heavy</b> <b>Ion</b> Fusion (HIF) {{program is}} to develop <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> accelerators capable of igniting inertial fusion targets to generate fusion energy for electrical power production. Accelerators for <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> fusion consist of several subsystems: ion sources, injectors, matching sections, combiners, induction acceleration sections with electric and magnetic focusing, beam compression and bending sections, and a final-focus system to focus the beams onto the target. We are currently assembling or performing experiments to address the physics of all these subsystems. This paper will discuss some of these experiments. 1 <b>HEAVY</b> <b>ION</b> FUSION DRIVER In a <b>heavy</b> <b>ion</b> inertial power plant, particle beams ar...|$|R
