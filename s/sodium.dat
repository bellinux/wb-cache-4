5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} <b>sodium</b> increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High <b>sodium</b> intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in <b>sodium</b> intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of <b>sodium</b> from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low <b>sodium</b> diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} of <b>sodium</b> salts from aqueous solutions is rare because <b>sodium</b> salts {{typically have}} a high affinity for water; an exception is <b>sodium</b> bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, <b>sodium</b> salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of <b>sodium</b> chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used as}} a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E
5|$|In humans, <b>sodium</b> is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for <b>sodium</b> is 500 milligrams per day. <b>Sodium</b> chloride is the principal source of <b>sodium</b> in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most <b>sodium</b> chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of <b>sodium</b> are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), <b>sodium</b> nitrite, <b>sodium</b> saccharin, baking soda (<b>sodium</b> bicarbonate), and <b>sodium</b> benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for <b>sodium</b> at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering <b>sodium</b> intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in <b>sodium</b> intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, <b>sodium</b> dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions; {{evaporation}} of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic <b>sodium.</b> The solutions contain the coordination complex (Na(NH3)6)+, with the positive charge counterbalanced by electrons as anions; cryptands permit {{the isolation of}} these complexes as crystalline solids. <b>Sodium</b> forms complexes with crown ethers, cryptands and other ligands. For example, 15-crown-5 has high affinity for <b>sodium</b> because the cavity size of 15-crown-5 is 1.7–2.2Å, which is enough to fit <b>sodium</b> ion (1.9Å). Cryptands, like crown ethers and other ionophores, also have a high affinity for the <b>sodium</b> ion; derivatives of the alkalide Na− are obtainable)|date=1974|volume=96|issue=2|pages=608–609|doi=10.1021/ja00809a060}} {{by the addition of}} cryptands to solutions of <b>sodium</b> in ammonia via disproportionation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> and {{potassium}} occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes {{inside and outside}} cells. <b>Sodium</b> is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for <b>sodium</b> is 500milligrams per day. <b>Sodium</b> chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of <b>sodium</b> in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The Dietary Reference Intake for <b>sodium</b> is 1.5grams per day, but {{most people in the}} United States consume more than 2.3grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important <b>sodium</b> compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), <b>sodium</b> nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, <b>sodium</b> thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, <b>sodium</b> is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and {{is viewed as}} a hard Lewis acid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> {{compounds}} {{have been}} known since ancient times; salt (<b>sodium</b> chloride) {{has been an important}} commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word salary, referring to salarium, money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from <b>sodium</b> mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of <b>sodium</b> and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and <b>sodium</b> compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and <b>sodium,</b> was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> forms alloys {{with many}} metals, such as {{potassium}}, calcium, lead, {{and the group}} 11 and 12 elements. <b>Sodium</b> and potassium form KNa2 and NaK. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature. It is excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of electrolytic production of <b>sodium</b> from binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl2 and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl2-BaCl2. Calcium is only partially miscible with <b>sodium.</b> In liquid state, <b>sodium</b> is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit <b>sodium</b> electrolycally on molten lead cathodes. NaPb3, NaPb, Na9Pb4, Na5Pb2, and Na15Pb4 {{are some of the}} known sodium-lead alloys. <b>Sodium</b> also forms alloys with gold (NaAu2) and silver (NaAg2). Group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury) are known to make alloys with <b>sodium.</b> NaZn13 and NaCd2 are alloys of zinc and cadmium. <b>Sodium</b> and mercury form NaHg, NaHg4, NaHg2, Na3Hg2, and Na3Hg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolNa (from Latin natrium) and atomic number11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. <b>Sodium</b> is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table, {{because it has}} a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na+ cation. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. <b>Sodium</b> is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite and rock salt (NaCl). Many salts of <b>sodium</b> are highly water-soluble: <b>sodium</b> ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus <b>sodium</b> and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> is an {{essential}} element for all animals and some plants. <b>Sodium</b> ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure and ECF compartment volume. Loss {{of water from the}} ECF compartment increases the <b>sodium</b> concentration, a condition called hypernatremia. Isotonic loss of water and <b>sodium</b> from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF hypovolemia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten <b>sodium</b> chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less electropositive than <b>sodium,</b> no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of <b>sodium</b> hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|<b>Sodium</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of <b>sodium</b> hydroxide. Among many other useful <b>sodium</b> compounds, <b>sodium</b> hydroxide (lye) {{is used in}} soap manufacture, and <b>sodium</b> chloride (edible salt) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{high demand}} of {{aluminium}} created {{the need for}} the production of <b>sodium.</b> After the introduction of the Hall–Héroult process for the production of aluminium by electrolysing a molten salt bath ended the need for large quantities of <b>sodium.</b> A related process based on the reduction of <b>sodium</b> hydroxide was developed in 1886.|$|E
5|$|The {{market for}} <b>sodium</b> is {{volatile}} {{due to the}} difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent {{the formation of a}} surface layer of <b>sodium</b> oxide or <b>sodium</b> superoxide.|$|E
5|$|Though {{metallic}} <b>sodium</b> {{has some}} important uses, the major applications for <b>sodium</b> use compounds; millions {{of tons of}} <b>sodium</b> chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. <b>Sodium</b> chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; <b>sodium</b> bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have <b>sodium</b> added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, <b>sodium</b> is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. <b>Sodium</b> hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Titanium powder is {{manufactured}} using a {{flow production}} {{process known as}} the Armstrong process {{that is similar to}} the batch production Hunter process. A stream of titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of molten <b>sodium</b> metal; the products (<b>sodium</b> chloride salt and titanium particles) is filtered from the extra <b>sodium.</b> Titanium is then separated from the salt by water washing. Both <b>sodium</b> and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more titanium tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin <b>sodium,</b> penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin <b>sodium,</b> cefotaxime <b>sodium,</b> Ceftriaxone <b>sodium),</b> three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and <b>sodium</b> and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more <b>sodium</b> than that provided by nectar and are attracted by <b>sodium</b> in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam regular {{release and}} orally {{disintegrating}} tablets are available as 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 2mg tablets, while extended release tablets are available as 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 3mg. Alprazolam oral solutions are available as 0.5mg/5 mL and as 1mg/1 mL oral solutions. Inactive ingredients in alprazolam tablets and solutions include microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, docusate <b>sodium,</b> povidone, <b>sodium</b> starch glycollate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and <b>sodium</b> benzoate. In addition, the 0.25mg tablet contains D Yellow No. 10 and the 0.5mg tablet contains FD Yellow No. 6 and D Yellow No. 10.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>sodium</b> is less {{reactive}} than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than <b>sodium</b> and {{can easily be}} distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E
5|$|Another major palladium(0) complex, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3), is {{prepared}} by reducing <b>sodium</b> tetrachloropalladate {{in the presence}} of dibenzylideneacetone.|$|E
5|$|By {{means of}} the sodium-potassium pump, living human cells pump three <b>sodium</b> ions out of the cell in {{exchange}} for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, potassium measures about 40:1, and <b>sodium,</b> about 1:10. In nerve cells, the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse—an action potential—when the charge is dissipated; <b>sodium</b> {{plays a key role}} in that activity.|$|E
5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and <b>sodium</b> from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the <b>sodium</b> was used to make <b>sodium</b> hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{produced}} from <b>sodium</b> chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis {{to separate the}} metallic <b>sodium</b> from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and <b>sodium</b> hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) where metallic <b>sodium</b> is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this <b>sodium</b> is then reacted with water to produce <b>sodium</b> hydroxide. Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that {{were built in the}} United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.|$|E
5|$|City streetlights are {{high-pressure}} <b>sodium</b> vapor lamps.|$|E
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to <b>sodium</b> fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing <b>sodium</b> fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to <b>sodium</b> fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
5|$|Hypertension causes 7.6 million {{premature}} deaths worldwide each year. (Note that salt {{contains about}} 39.3% sodiumthe rest being chlorine and trace chemicals; thus, 2.3g <b>sodium</b> is about 5.9g, or 2.7 ml of saltabout half a US teaspoon.) The American Heart Association recommends {{no more than}} 1.5g of <b>sodium</b> per day.|$|E
5|$|In {{a corner}} of our 60m3 room {{farthest}} away from the apparatus, we exploded 3mg. of <b>sodium</b> chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong <b>sodium</b> line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} <b>sodium</b> salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of <b>sodium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidence collected from Frank's body, there were also samples of residue taken from the air vents and hat rack located {{on the right side}} of the aircraft near the leading edge of the wing. These samples contained <b>sodium</b> carbonate, <b>sodium</b> nitrate, and mixtures of sodium-sulfur compounds.|$|E
5|$|Inorganic {{elements}} play critical {{roles in}} metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. <b>sodium</b> and potassium) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a mammal's mass {{is made up}} of the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, <b>sodium,</b> chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur. Organic compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.|$|E
5|$|K2 can be {{converted}} to metallic tantalum by reduction with <b>sodium,</b> at approximately 800°C in molten salt.|$|E
5|$|Lactic {{acidosis}} {{is initially}} treated with <b>sodium</b> bicarbonate, although high doses are not recommended, as this may increase intracellular acidosis. Acidosis {{that does not}} respond to administration of <b>sodium</b> bicarbonate may require further management with standard hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration.|$|E
5|$|Many organosodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} prepared. Because {{of the high}} polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well known derivatives include <b>sodium</b> cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl <b>sodium</b> ((C6H5)3CNa). Because of the large size and very low polarising power of the Na+ cation, it can stabilize large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as in <b>sodium</b> naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Membrane cell {{electrolysis}} employs permeable membrane as an ion exchanger. Saturated <b>sodium</b> (or potassium) chloride {{solution is}} {{passed through the}} anode compartment, leaving at a lower concentration. This method also produces very pure <b>sodium</b> (or potassium) hydroxide but has the disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Most {{alkali metals}} have many {{different}} applications. One {{of the best-known}} applications of the pure elements {{is the use of}} rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks, of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time. A common application of the compounds of <b>sodium</b> is the sodium-vapour lamp, which emits light very efficiently. Table salt, or <b>sodium</b> chloride, has been used since antiquity. <b>Sodium</b> and potassium are also essential elements, having major biological roles as electrolytes, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of <b>sodium</b> and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. <b>Sodium</b> and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, <b>sodium</b> vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
