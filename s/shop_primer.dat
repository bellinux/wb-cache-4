40|$|Corrosion {{protection}} of ballast water tanks is very precarious {{because of the}} aggressiveness {{of the environment and}} the difficult accessibility of the areas. Numerous accidents have led to regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Practical circumstances in yards are often not ideal; therefore it is of interest to investigate if the limits for the parameters, which determine the coating performance, as fixed by IMO are necessary and realistic. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify these limits, in particular concerning the presence of <b>shop</b> <b>primer</b> and presence of (in) soluble salts and dust on the <b>shop</b> <b>primer.</b> To simulate the possible circumstances in ballast water tanks different exposure methods have been used: exposure of coated samples to seawater at room temperature, cyclic exposure by immersion, drying and temperature change. During exposure (up to four weeks) open circuit potential and impedance measurements were performed. Moreover current was measured during anodic and cathodic polarization of samples with a holiday; this is to assess respectively the corrosion propagation and the susceptibility to cathodic delamination. Results show that presence of intact <b>shop</b> <b>primer</b> and insoluble salts are beneficial; limits for soluble salt and dust as determined by the regulations are realisti...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{inorganic-organic}} coating {{obtained by}} the sol gel chemistry is a promising technique for the achievement of homogeneous films with improved mechanical properties. The research developed in the protective optical film sector has been training for many industrial applications e. g. the metal corrosion protection through thin film used like a primer or <b>shop</b> <b>primer</b> deposition. Selecting proper wet-reaction parameters and application, the organic/inorganic precursors and additives to promote adhesion firstly, metal substrates can be thin coated. The deposition can be performed by the usual spray technique, dip-coating, or the more recently developed electrochemistry. Formulations can be studied starting from the chemical and physical aspects to satisfy many different objectives...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of coatings in ballast water tanks {{is critical for}} the safety of cargo ships. International Maritime Organization (IMO) has delivered a standard for the protection of water ballast tanks in which new built cargo vessels have to comply with {resolution MSC. 215 (82) }. In case the procedure of applying coatings differs from the IMO standard, the Performance standard for protective coatings (PSPC) gives an alternative method for approval; in this case equivalence of the protective properties has to be proved. The aim of this work is to investigate the coating performance in ballast water tanks that have serviced for more than 5 years. In this work, three different types of coating systems have been investigated by visual inspection and in situ electrochemical impedance measurements in ballast water tanks. All coating systems include <b>shop</b> <b>primer</b> plus one or two layer epoxy coatings. The results show that the impedance decreases with service time. However, all of them are in high impedance level, which means that they are in good shape to protect the ballast water tank from corrosion...|$|E
50|$|Mill {{scale is}} a {{nuisance}} when the steel {{is to be}} processed. Any paint applied over it is wasted, since it will come off with the scale as moisture-laden air gets under it. Thus mill scale can be removed from steel surfaces by flame cleaning, pickling, or abrasive blasting, which are all tedious operations that consume energy. This is why shipbuilders and steel fixers used to leave steel and rebar delivered freshly rolled from mills {{out in the open}} to allow it to 'weather' until most of the scale fell off due to atmospheric action. Nowadays most steel mills can supply their produce with mill scale removed and steel coated with <b>shop</b> <b>primers</b> over which welding or painting can be done safely.|$|R
