2500|$|World opinion: An {{international}} {{commission was}} set up at The Hague in the Netherlands in 1959 to carry out independent investigations. [...] The members were four former anti-Hitler activists, Norwegian lawyer Hans Cappelen, former Danish foreign minister {{and president of the}} Danish parliament Ole Bjørn Kraft, Dutch socialist Karel van Staal, Belgian law professor Flor Peeters, and Swiss jurist and member of parliament Kurt Scoch. [...] Following its interrogation of a number of Ukrainian witnesses between November 1959 and March 1960, the commission concluded: [...] "After four months of inquiries and the evaluation of 232 <b>statements</b> <b>by</b> <b>witnesses</b> from all circles involved, it can be established that the accusations against the Battalion Nachtigall and against the then Lieutenant and currently Federal Minister Oberländer have no foundation in fact".|$|E
2500|$|The council {{begins by}} the {{presiding}} officer stating the reported misconduct and asking the accused person to admit or deny it. If the person denies the misconduct, the presiding officer or a designate presents {{the evidence of}} the misconduct. Evidence may be presented in the form of written or oral <b>statements</b> <b>by</b> <b>witnesses</b> or other documents. An accused person's previous confession cannot be used as evidence in a disciplinary council without the member's consent. The accused member is given a chance to question the witnesses against him or her. After the evidence against the accused is presented, the accused is permitted to present evidence in response. The accused can comment on the evidence and make any other statement he or she wants to make. All witnesses and the accused may also be questioned by any member of the disciplinary council. No witness is placed under oath. Because the disciplinary council is an ecclesiastical court, rules of evidence that govern domestic courts do not apply. The church has instructed leaders that [...] "procedures in a disciplinary council must be fair and considerate of the feelings of all who participate." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a clear}} {{correlation}} between the unreliability of the testimony in a given town or region {{and the percentage of}} soldiers offering testimony. [...] In an analysis of the plausibility of testimony in Appendix A, based on other sources, Jeff Lipkes found that in the testimony about Liège and the villages to its east, the 35 depositions average 3.8 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents “probably a legend or invention” and 5 represents “very likely.” [...] Soldiers, however, rate only 2.16, while civilians average 4.14. [...] The former accounted for just 17% of the depositions. [...] Similarly, in the section on the valleys of the Meuse and Sambre, the 30 <b>statements</b> <b>by</b> <b>witnesses</b> average 3.77, with civilians rating 4.04, while soldiers only average 2.4. [...] The soldiers again comprised a low percent of the total, 16.6%. [...] It is in the region designated “The Aershot, Malines, Vilvorde, Louvain Quadrangle,” where the majority of the testimony comes from soldiers, that the most dubious depositions occur. [...] Even within this region, testimony from townspeople tends to be reliable. [...] In Aarschot, the 38 depositions average 4.0. [...] Soldiers, 31.6% of the total, averaged only 2.4, whereas the 26 civilians rated 4.73, providing credible accounts that fully tallied with other evidence.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} days of {{forensic}} linguistics in the United Kingdom, the legal defense for many criminal cases questioned the authenticity of police statements.

50|$|In 1968, the Vietnam War Crimes Working Group (VWCWG) was {{established}} by the Pentagon task force {{set up in the}} wake of the My Lai Massacre, to attempt to ascertain the veracity of emerging claims of war crimes by U.S. armed forces in Vietnam, during the Vietnam War period.The investigation compiled over 9,000 pages of investigative files, sworn <b>statements</b> <b>by</b> <b>witnesses</b> and status reports for top military officers, indicating that 320 incidents had factual basis. The substantiated cases included 7 massacres between 1967 and 1971 in which at least 137 civilians were killed; seventy eight further attacks targeting non-combatants resulting in at least 57 deaths, 56 wounded and 15 sexually assaulted; one hundred and forty-one cases of US soldiers torturing civilian detainees or prisoners of war with fists, sticks, bats, water or electric shock. Over 800 alleged atrocities were investigated, but only 23 soldiers were ever convicted on charges and most served sentences of less than a year. A Los Angeles Times report on the archived files concluded that the war crimes were not confined to a few rogue units, having been uncovered in every army division that was active in Vietnam.|$|E

50|$|Justice Kennedy, {{joined by}} Justices Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Ginsburg, {{delivered}} the opinion {{for a majority}} of the court except for Part II-B, a plurality where Justice Kennedy was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg. The Court noted that not all prior consistent <b>statements</b> <b>by</b> a <b>witness</b> were excluded from the bar against hearsay evidence. The text of FRE 801(d)(1)(B) accorded not hearsay status only prior consistent <b>statements</b> <b>by</b> a testifying <b>witness</b> used to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. The Court reasoned that to properly rebut a charge of fabrication, a prior consistent statement would need to have predated the motive to fabricate. Otherwise prior consistent statements would be admissible to rebut other forms of impeachment, and this would ignore the common law temporal requirement that the Advisory Committee Note said was adopted by the rule.|$|R

40|$|How well do hearsay rules {{function}} {{under the}} current Federal Rules of Evidence? One issue, dormant yet pulsating beneath the surface for decades, involves the admissibility of prior inconsistent <b>statements</b> <b>by</b> <b>witnesses.</b> The long-standing “orthodox” rule admitted the prior statement only to impeach the witness’s trial testimony; {{it could not be}} used as substantive evidence of the facts asserted. In 1972, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence (“the Advisory Committee” or “the Committee”) proposed an innovative rule permitting all prior inconsistent statements to be used both for impeachment and as substantive evidence—a sea change in practice. Congress, however, torpedoed the proposal for reasons that rang hollow in the mid- 1970 s and which remain so today. Experience has proven the Committee’s wisdom...|$|E
