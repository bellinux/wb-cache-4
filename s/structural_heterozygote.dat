40|$|In rye (Secale cereale L. cv. "Ailés") the progeny of a {{cross between}} a <b>structural</b> <b>heterozygote</b> for a {{reciprocal}} translocation (involving the 1 R chromosome) and a homozygote for the standard chromosome arrangement were analyzed for the electrophoretic patterns of eight different leaf isozymes and also for their meiotic configuration at metaphase I. ——The Got- 3 and Mdh- 2 b loci are linked to each other and also to the reciprocal translocation. The Mdh- 2 b locus is located in the interstitial segment of the 3 Rq chromosome arm, with an estimated distance of 8 cM to the breakpoint. Therefore, the reciprocal translocation involves the 1 R and 3 R chromosomes. ——Also, the Mdh- 1 and 6 -Pgd- 2 loci are linked (16 ± 3 cM) and have been located on the 2 Rq arm. Finally, the Per- 3 and Per- 4 loci are located on the 2 Rp chromosome arm at an estimated distance of 26 ± 4 cM...|$|E
40|$|Genic {{allozyme}} polymorphism and heterozygosity was {{studied in}} a large population of the evening primrose, Oenothera biennis, growing in North Haven, Connecticut. This species is a permanent <b>structural</b> <b>heterozygote</b> for the entire complement of 14 chromosomes, and is thus capable of accumulating and maintaining genic heterozygosity. A total of 11 protein species were examined, and these were judged {{to be controlled by}} 19 loci. Polymorphism occurs at 26 % of the loci, with only two alleles being present at each locus. The proportion of polymorphic loci per population in organisms with normal meiotic systems is no less than in Oe. biennis, indicating that structural heterozygosity is not necessarily accompanied by a greater proportion of polymorphic loci. On the other hand, the average Oe. biennis was heterozygous at 26 % of its loci, an amount considerably greater than in most other organisms. With few exceptions, all plants in the North Haven population had the same genotype. Since the species is a colonizer, {{it is likely that the}} population was founded by a single individual and retained this genotype by virtue of the genetic system...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} heat on two small {{adjacent}} segments {{at the base}} of the X chromosome was examined. Recombination in the two segments delimited by recessive lethals was measured after treatment with 30 ° and 34 °. Both segments were sensitive at 30 °, while only the proximal one responded to 34 ° treatment. When the same segments were studied in <b>structural</b> <b>heterozygotes</b> (for deletions) the relative increase in recombination was greater, suggesting that heat exerts its effect on the "pairing" rather than the "exchange" components of crossing over. The effect of c (3) G/+ on the same segments in both homozygous and heterozygous structurals was studied. The results indicate that this meiotic mutant mediates its effect on a step different than that affected by heat...|$|R
40|$|Allozyme {{inheritance}} {{and transmission}} genetics of 11 enzyme systems were determined in the permanent translocation heterozygotes Oenothera biennis, Oe. strigosa, and Oe. parviflora. Electrophoretic variation was examined first among 164 strains of <b>structural</b> <b>heterozygotes.</b> Allelic configurations were then judged from inheritance patterns in reciprocal F 1 hybrids between each of 22 ring-forming strains and tester {{strains of the}} related bivalent-formers, Oe. hookeri and Oe. grandiflora. Allozymes are inherited as codominant markers, and, as dictated by the genetic system, within a strain individual allelic variants are generally transmitted through only one germ line. Of the 20 loci resolved, only eight are polymorphic in any species, and, within species, generally only two alleles are present at each polymorphic locus. Despite the relatively meager allelic array, each of the 22 strains whose chromosome complexes were characterized is genotypically unique. Generally, within taxa, α (egg) and β (sperm) complexes differ in allele frequency at several polymorphic loci. Such variability is correlated with differences in the phylogenetic origins of complexes and not with differences in segmental arrangement within a group of related complexes...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} genetic {{analysis}} of the meiotic drive system on maize abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab 10) that causes preferential segregation of specific chromosomal regions to the reproductive megaspore. The data indicate that at least four chromosomal regions contribute to meiotic drive, each providing distinct functions that can be differentiated from each other genetically and/or phenotypically. Previous reports established that meiotic drive requires neocentromere activity at specific tandem repeat arrays (knobs) and that two regions on Ab 10 are involved in trans-activating neocentromeres. Here we confirm and extend data suggesting that {{only one of the}} neocentromere-activating regions is sufficient to move many knobs. We also confirm the localization of a locus/loci on Ab 10, thought to be a prerequisite for meiotic drive, which promotes recombination in <b>structural</b> <b>heterozygotes.</b> In addition, we identified two new and independent functions required for meiotic drive. One was identified through the characterization of a deletion derivative of Ab 10 [Df(L) ] and another as a newly identified meiotic drive mutation (suppressor of meiotic drive 3). In the absence of either function, meiotic drive is abolished but neocentromere activity and the recombination effect typical of Ab 10 are unaffected. These results demonstrate that neocentromere activity and increased recombination are not the only events required for meiotic drive...|$|R
40|$|Scorpions of {{the genus}} Tityus show holokinetic chromosomes, achiasmatic male meiosis and an absence of {{heteromorphic}} sex chromosomes, like all Buthidae. In this work, we analysed the meiotic behaviour and chromosome rearrangements of a population of the scorpion Tityus confluens, characterising the cytotypes of males, females and embryos with different cytogenetic techniques. This revealed that all the females were structural homozygotes, while all the males were <b>structural</b> <b>heterozygotes</b> for different chromosome rearrangements. Four different cytotypes were described in males, which differed in chromosome number (2 n = 5 and 2 n = 6) and meiotic multivalent configurations (chains of four, five and six chromosomes). Based on a detailed mitotic and meiotic analysis, we propose a sequence of chromosome rearrangements that could give rise to each cytotype and in which fusions have played a major role. Based on the comparison of males, females and a brood of embryos, we also propose {{that the presence of}} multivalents in males and homologous pairs in females could be associated with the presence of cryptic sex chromosomes, with the male being the heterogametic sex. We propose that the ancestral karyotype of this species could have had homomorphic XY/XX (male/female) sex chromosomes and a fusion could have occurred between the Y chromosome and an autosome...|$|R
40|$|In {{the plants}} {{collected}} from Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture, chromosome number of Aster viscidulus was reported as 2 n= 18 of diploidy and mitotic metaphase karyotype was also analysed by HUZIWARA (1957 a). In the present study, 176 plants collected from nine populations {{located at the}} central region of the Honshu of Japan, which were covering a distribution area of this species, were studied karyologically. 174 (98. 9 %) of the 176 plants {{were found to be}} diploids with 2 n= 18, and the remaining two plants (1. 1 %) were a triploid with 2 n= 27 and an aneuploid with 2 n= 19. Though the majority of diploids was karyologically similar to each other, the two plants of the diploids were <b>structural</b> <b>heterozygotes</b> which were characterized by chromosomal structural changes occurred in short arm including satellite of SAT-chromosome (L^ -chromosome, SHIMOTOMAI and HUZIWARA, 1942). The triploid plant was determined as an autotriploid by mitotic chromosome analyses and meiotic pairing analyses, and was presumed to be derived by fertilization between reduced and unreduced gametes. In the aneuploid plant, a surplus chromosome was shorter than ordinary chromosomes and 1. 8 μm in length at mitotic metaphase, and euchromatic in chromatin condensation (Heitz, 1928). In PMCs, pairing between the surplus chromosome and any of ordinary chromoseme was not found. The ten plants from a population of A. viscidulus var. alpinus, which grow in alpine zone, were also examined. There was no difference in karyological characters between A. viscidulus and the variety. It is safely said that A. viscidulus might be genetically stable...|$|R
