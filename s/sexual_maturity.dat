5|$|Great {{white sharks}} were {{previously}} thought to reach <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity</b> at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity</b> at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity.</b> Maximum life span was originally believed {{to be more than}} 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity,</b> low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the overfishing, the tilefish's age of <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity</b> has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, {{the median age of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity</b> in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females. In 2008, the median age of <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity</b> in males had risen to 5.9 years.

40|$|This {{presentation}} explores Arab youth {{sexuality and}} the challenges of studying youth sexuality in the Arab world. 330 young adults (70 % ages 18 - 25) completed an online survey that assessed their knowledge, experience, perceptions, and values related to reproductive health and sexual education, masturbation, virginity, sexual experiences and relationships, marriage, and sex and the internet. Participants primarily resided in Lebanon (79 %), but respondents also included individuals from Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, and Morocco. The results indicate that Arab youth are getting more liberal with their ideas and some practices {{with the help of}} the internet; however, the influence of religion, family values and society is still omnipresent. The author concludes that sexual education is far from complete and needs inclusion in curricula in schools and with parents.

Preliminary results on the biology (Wakefield et al., 2013) and culture (Peleteiro et al., 2014) of this species suggest that this is a fast grower. Wreckfish also acclimates easily to captivity and handling, and despite their large sizes, no mortality related to handling has been observed. This species readily accepts prepared diets in captivity, and is characterized by its low metabolism and inhabiting great water depths.

50|$|Puberty usually occurs {{from the}} ages of 10 to 16 {{years of age and}} varies between boys and girls with girls {{normally}} starting earlier than boys (Shiel, Stoppler 2012). During the time of puberty is when sexual maturation starts to occur. Numerous physical changes happen during the period of puberty. Girls start to develop breasts, have growth of pubic hair and eventually begin having menstrual cycles. Boys have an enlargement of testicles and penis, growth of pubic hair, deepened voices and muscular development. Along with physical changes during puberty there are many mental changes happening. During the adolescence stage of life, boys and girls start developing thoughts related to sexual identity and start to explore and experiment with sexual behaviors. This stage of life is when sexual maturation starts to develop and one’s gender identity and sexual orientation is being developed. This is a timeframe that can possibly become confusing for the youth going through this stage of adolescence. Feelings of frustration, anxiety or depression may occur. This could be the first signs of disorder during <b>sexual</b> maturation.Sexual <b>maturity</b> is a natural progression during the pubertal stages of adolescence. It is the timeframe where youth explore and experience sexual thoughts, situations and behaviors which ultimately lead to the identification of their gender and sexual orientation. During this timeframe abnormal feelings and thoughts can affect the progression of maturity. These abnormal occurrences would be identified as sexual maturation disorder.|$|R

Professional fishing, carried out from August to December 1996, uses FADs (Fish Attracting Devices) and surrounding nets. 2087 juvenile specimens of dolphinfish from the Ionian and southern Tyrrhenian seas, the Strait of Sicily and the Balearic islands were sampled. A small number of adult fish (39), which are not usually caught in surrounding nets, was sampled in the swordfish long-line by-catch. The gonads of the young fish were analysed monthly to establish the stage of development of the ovaries or testes, {{during the first few}} months of life. The gonads of the adult fish, sampled in the months of June-September only, were all mature. The specimens caught between October and December presented maturity stage V in the case of the females and I in the case of the males, indicating the end of the reproductive period. The gonado-somatic index (GSI) and condition factor (CF) were calculated for both genders. The trend of the GSI confirms the presence of immature specimens as regards the juvenile fish; the low value of GSI was obtained for the adults, probably associated with the post-reproduction conditions found in the October-December period. Most of the gonads sampled during the months between August and December belonged to young specimens born in early summer. This is confirmed by the juvenile stages (FL 2. 5 to 4. 3 cm) caught with plankton nets in the Strait of Messina area in July...|$|R

This research aimed to determine flowering of these variants among three of land-races which were representing geographical zone in Gunung Sewu: Nglanggeran, Blebera, and Petir. Observation on phenology, <b>sexual</b> organs <b>maturity,</b> floral structure, and display was conducted in 2015. Floral structures varied among variants. MB and KB dominated by red and maroon colors, possessed bigger perigonium, longer sexual organs but with shorter longevity, and similar/lower position of stylus to stamens. MK dominated by yellow to orange colors, smaller, similar/higher position of stylus, and longer longevity. Floral display varied among land-races but were similar among variants. Petir, with biggest population size, produced the most abundant flowers and flowering trees at all variants. Sandalwood flowered twice a year in all of land-races and variants, however, the onset and duration varied. KB flowered earliest while MB was the latest. MK possessed longest flowering period. Flowering varied among land-races due to the altitude, soils, and climatic differences. Lower altitude, drier, and warmer sites flowered earlier and shorter. Mass abortion and sequential replacement, resulting in the alteration on flowering frequency, occured due to the extreme temperature increment.

To estimate relationship of dental maturation and sexual maturation in female subjects 3). To analyse discriminatory ability of premolar calcification in assessing subjects having potential growth. Materials and Methods: Panaromic radiographs and lateral cephalograms of 90 girls subjects (before menarche) were selected for the study. Mandibular second premolar calcification stage was estimated according to Demirjian index-DI and cervical vertebrae maturation index (CVMI) was estimated using Hassel and Farman index. Results: Highly significant statistical correlation(C= 0. 603) was found between DI and CVMI stages in girls. CVMI- 2 correlated with stage DI-E, CVMI- 3 correlated with stage DI-F, CVMI- 4 and 5 correlated with stage DI-G. Dental maturation preceeded sexual maturation and 7. 8 % of the sample population showed completion before attaining <b>sexual</b> or skeletal <b>maturity.</b> Conclusion: Mandibular second premolar {{can be used as}} a preliminary method of estimating skeletal maturity. Calcification stage DI–F of premolar corresponds to peak growth in females.

40|$|Copadichromis chrysonotus is a zooplanktivorous cichlid {{member of}} the diverse fish {{community}} inhabiting Lake Malawi’s rocky, littoral habitat. Like most Lake Malawi cichlids, thisspecies’ reproductive strategy is based on maternal mouthbrooding, {{but it is the}} only littoral species known to spawn in the open water without a substrate-based territory.   This study investigated length at <b>maturity,</b> <b>sexual</b> dimorphism, spawning behaviour, breeding seasonality, fecundity, fertility, egg size, and brooding habits of C. chrysonotus in southern Lake Malawi.   Males in breeding colouration aggregated in sheltered areas at least several metres deep, and each male defended a mobile breeding territory near the surface while attempting to attract females. Breeding was mostly continuous from August to May,  with peaks in August–September and January–March. A major lull in breeding activity occurred in May and June. Mean fecundity and fertility increased significantly with female total length, while mean egg length,  mean egg mass and gonadosomatic index did not increase significantly with female total length. Females brooded their young up to 15 – 16 mm total length before abandoning them.   Open-water spawning by C. chrysonotus may be an adaptation to reduce both egg predation during spawning and competition for substrate-based breeding territories. </strong...|$|R

5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity</b> by either sex varies broadly among bovids. <b>Sexual</b> <b>maturity</b> may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained <b>sexual</b> <b>maturity.</b> The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E

40|$|Luteinizing hormone (LH), {{produced}} in the anterior lobe of the pituitary, {{is a member of}} the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis that is required for production of the sex hormones estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. Perturbations in levels of hormones associated with this axis can result in defects in <b>sexual</b> development and <b>maturity.</b> LH bears unique N-linked carbohydrate units that terminate with a sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine structure (GalNAc- 4 -SO 4) that mediates its clearance from the blood. To determine the significance of this terminal structure, we ablated the gene encoding the sulfotransferase responsible for sulfate addition to GalNAc on LH, GalNAc- 4 -sulfotransferase- 1 (GalNAc- 4 -ST 1) in mice. Mice lacking GalNAc- 4 -ST 1 exhibited increased levels of circulating LH. In male mice, this resulted in elevated levels of testosterone and precocious maturation of testis and seminal vesicles. Female mice lacking GalNAc- 4 -ST 1 demonstrated elevated estrogen levels and exhibited precocious sexual maturation and increased fecundity. Female mice remained in estrus for prolonged periods and produced almost 50 % more litters per mouse than wild-type mice over the same period of time. Thus, sulfate modification of the terminal glycosylation of LH plays a central role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis in vivo...|$|R
