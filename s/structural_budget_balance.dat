40|$|According to the Pact for Stability and Growth (PSG), in {{the medium}} term the net deficit should be close to balance or in surplus. We {{question}} {{the use of the}} net deficit as the only medium-term budgetary objective and as the main indicator for the assessment of fiscal policy. Hence, for assessing the short-term fiscal stance, we propose to analyze cyclically adjusted <b>budget</b> <b>balances,</b> whereas an assessment of sustainability of fiscal positions {{in the medium}}-term should be based on structural primary gaps. The OECD, the EU and the IMF calculate <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>balances</b> by subtracting the balance of several cyclical revenue components and only one cyclical expenditure component from the overall net deficit, under the assumption of constant output elasticities. By means of a bootstrapping simulation we demonstrate that the assumptions of these traditional methods are too restrictive. They do not even allow to determine the sign of the cyclical balances for the EU-countries. To estimate <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> <b>balances,</b> we suggest an alternative approach which is based on a statistical concept and identifies structural balances as a smooth trend. Medium term sustainability of fiscal policy is analysed within the concept of structural primary gaps. This indicator shows to what extent the current structural primary balance deviates from the primary surplus that stabilizes the debt to GDP ratio. Again, the meaning of structural is based on the same statistical concept of trend extraction. For the EU-countries structural primary gaps are calculated, referring to the net debt and gross debt concept. According to the gross debt concept and based on forecasts of the OECD Economic Outlook (December 1997), fiscal policy of all EU-countries can be considered as sustainable at least in 1999. Even if fiscal policy is already deemed sustainable in the medium-term, in some of the EU-countries structural balances will have to be further improved in order to bring fiscal positions close to balance or in surplus. Only then, compliance with the provisions of the PSG is assured. ...|$|R

In this framework, projected <b>budget</b> <b>balances</b> illustrate the path of VFI. Using a measure of fiscal sustainability developed in Auerbach (1997), this paper constructs an indicator of VFI that is based on the amount of fiscal room available, subject to a government’s intertemporal budget constraint, given underlying fiscal projections. VFI exists in this framework if one level of government has fiscal room available to reduce taxes or increase program spending [...] and satisfy its intertemporal constraint [...] while the other level of government must increase taxes or reduce spending in order to satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint.

40|$|Summary Neither {{the current}} Labour {{government}} nor the previous Conservative one {{can look back}} over their respective terms of office as periods of great success in fiscal management. Both started by strengthening their underlying <b>budget</b> <b>balances</b> for three years after taking office, but both then allowed them to drift steadily back into the red. This meant that they were already borrowing significant amounts when the onset of recession required them to borrow more. Labour is entering this recession with a similar <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> deficit {{to the one that}} it inherited from the Conservatives, but with a smaller underlying debt. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> deficit will deteriorate as far under Labour as it did under the Conservatives, but debt is very likely to rise above the peak it recorded under the Conservatives (even without the impact of recent bank nationalisations and recapitalisations). Labour recorded a similar <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> deficit in the year before this recession to that which the Conservatives recorded in the year before the last. However, the structural deficit appears to have deteriorated more sharply in the early phase of the downturn than it did under the Conservatives and as a result is set to be higher in the first year of recession than it was under the Conservatives. This largely reflects the particular impact of the credit crunch and falls in the stock market and housing market, rather than budget decisions. Labour is also going into the recession with a significantly higher level of debt than the Conservatives did. Turning to the international context, we are entering the current recession with one of the largest <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> deficits in the industrial world and a debt level that may be among the smallest in the G 7 but which is larger than that of most industrial countries. We have done less to reduce our <b>structural</b> <b>budget</b> deficit and less to reduce our debt than most other industrial countries since Labour came to office. ...|$|R
