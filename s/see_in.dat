5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces.

5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them <b>see</b> <b>in</b> low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and <b>see</b> <b>in</b> both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E

5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy {{may have been an}} invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who <b>see</b> <b>in</b> it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E
5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Both Crex crakes {{are mainly}} active during the day, {{especially}} at dawn, dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain.

40|$|Introduction: Cicatrical {{alopecia}} {{occurs in}} otherwise healthy {{men and women}} of all ages and is seen worldwide Material and Methods: A study of 40 patients was conducted to study the clinical variants and histopathology of cicatricial alopecia. Results and Discussion: n our study, it was seen that maximum number of cases of cicatrical alopecia were of LPP (27. 5 %) followed by 25 % of DLE, 20 % patients had pseudopelade of Brocq, SLE was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 5 % cases followed by Scleroderma, dermatomyositis, Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, aplasia cutis, kerion, follicular mucinosis, pemphigus, dissecting cellulitis of scalp/ pyogenic folliculitis and acne keloidalis nuchae in 2. 5 % cases each.

40|$|Background: Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a {{dermatosis}} {{characterized by}} thickened, hyperpigmented plaques, typically on the intertriginous surfaces and neck. Common in some populations, its prevalence depends on race. Clinicians should recognize AN; it heralds disorders ranging from endocrinologic disturbances to malignancy. In this review, {{we discuss the}} pathogenesis of AN and its clinical implications and management. Materials and Methods: We selected 30 patients for the study. Diagnosis of associated disorders was established by history, physical examination, body mass index (BMI), hormone measurements by radioimmunoassays of thyroidnfunction tests, free testosterone, 17 (OH) progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), cortisol, gonadotropins, prolactin, immunoreactive insulin, and C-peptide levels. Results and Discussion: In our study, the flexural involvement (flexures of groins, knees and elbows) was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 40 % patients, lip involvement was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 6. 6 % patients, and dorsal involvement was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 3. 3 % patients each. Increased serum testosterone levels were <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 13. 3 % patients and increased DHEAS levels were <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20 % patients. Regarding the types of AN, obesity induced AN or pseudo-AN was seen 70 % patients, syndromic AN was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 23. 35 % patients and malignant AN was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 6. 6 % patients. The commonest histopathological feature of patients with AN was hyperkeratosis, <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 100 % patients, papillomatosis was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 90 % patients, dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 60 % patients, horn pseudocysts were <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 30 % patients, and irregular acanthosis was <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 26. 6 % patients...|$|R
5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can <b>see</b> <b>in</b> near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E

The script also received an uncredited rewrite from Neil Cross, who previously created the Idris Elba-starring drama series Luther and wrote the del Toro-produced horror film Mama. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan were enlisted to perform uncredited rewrites when their spec script Monstropolis caught the filmmaker's attention.

5|$|Despite being {{counted as}} one of the 28 cities of Sub-Roman Britain, it seems that after the Romans left Britain in 410 Durovernum Cantiacorum was {{abandoned}} except by a few farmers and gradually decayed. Over the next 100years, an Anglo-Saxon community formed within the city walls, as Jutish refugees arrived, possibly intermarrying with the locals. In 597, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine to convert its King Æthelberht to Christianity. After the conversion, Canterbury, being a Roman town, was chosen by Augustine as the centre for his episcopal <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Kent, and an abbey and cathedral were built. Augustine thus became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. The town's new importance led to its revival, and trades developed in pottery, textiles, and leather. By 630, gold coins were being struck at the Canterbury mint. In 672, the Synod of Hertford gave the see of Canterbury authority over the entire English Church.|$|E
