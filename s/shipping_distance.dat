In practical terms this represents a sizable reduction in the sea route distance of around 4000 km or about 40 % less than the current <b>shipping</b> <b>distance</b> using the Southern Sea route (using the Indic Ocean and the Suez Canal). In a first step we estimate country-specific <b>shipping</b> <b>distance</b> reductions linked to the Northern Sea route. Using econometric gravity model estimations we then link these <b>shipping</b> <b>distance</b> reductions with changes in trade volumes. As a last step of our analysis we plug both these trade cost reductions into a CGE model to assess the impact on bilateral trade flows, sectoral output, overall welfare, and employment/wage changes. We also analyze the changes that shorter shipping routes have on transport related pollution levels, which account for both shorter distances but also on potentially larger trade volumes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ultra large ships {{have the}} {{advantage}} of scale economies, but whether they successfully getting into service depend on cargo flow, <b>shipping</b> <b>distance,</b> port efficiency and constraints, etc. The study constructs a two-objective model to determine the optimal ship size and sailings frequency and analyze the shipping economies of ultra large ships by minimizing shipping costs and inventory costs. The results show the Pareto optimal solutions of the two-objective model and optimal ship size and sailings frequency with respect to each level of inventory costs and shipping costs. The sensitivity analysis shows the optimal ship tends to be large as route flow increases. Furthermore, the economies and possibility of using ultra large ships tend to increase, as port efficiency improves, <b>shipping</b> <b>distance</b> increases, the ports of call decreases, or the relative costs of large ships decrease.
