50|$|A <b>legal</b> <b>secretary</b> is {{generally}} a secretary {{who has a}} basic understanding of legal terminology and the specific formatting required by a particular court or government agency. <b>Legal</b> <b>secretaries</b> are also typically responsible for keeping case files organized and indexed, often taking on the duties of a file clerk. Although <b>legal</b> <b>secretaries</b> may be trained to prepare some basic legal papers and letters, they generally have little or no knowledge of particular legal doctrines, statutes or regulations, and typically have no training or experience in conducting legal research or drafting legal documents, pleadings, motions, briefs or other court papers. On the other hand, a typical paralegal in the United States can perform all of these tasks under an attorney or law office.
