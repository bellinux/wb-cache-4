Production continued up until 1981 when the experiment with Lomond <b>stills</b> <b>was</b> abandoned, and the <b>stills</b> <b>were</b> replaced with regular stills.|$|R

5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there <b>still</b> <b>was</b> a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons.

The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech wide receiver Bryan <b>Still</b> <b>was</b> named the game's most valuable player. He caught six passes for 119 yards and one touchdown. He also returned a punt for 60 yards and a touchdown, and his 27-yard reception {{in the third quarter}} set up Tech's third touchdown two plays later. Still's punt return was the longest in Virginia Tech bowl-game history to that point and was surpassed in the 2008 Orange Bowl when Justin Harper returned a punt 84 yards for a touchdown. Tech tight end Bryan Jennings was the Hokies' second-leading receiver; he finished the game with six catches for 77 yards. Four other players had two or fewer receptions.|$|E
5|$|In the men's events, the Korean team shot 12 maximum {{scores of}} 10 {{to win the}} gold medal against Chinese Taipei 251-245. Losing by two points, the United States failed to fend of the Ukraine team to capture the bronze. The event causing the most upset however was the men's individual, the only event that the Korean team has never won and yet again failed to clinch. Defending {{champion}} Simon Fairweather was ousted from the competition in a first round loss due to blustery weather conditions. The wind caused some archers like Fairweather to make one-point shots, and its strength even caused others to miss their targets completely. The final matches of this event also saw competitors coming close in score, with Italian Marco Galiazzo beating the Japanese Hiroshi Yamamoto by only two points to win gold.
