40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical procedure {{for the analysis}} and the optimization of external gear pumps. The Fluid Power group of the University of Parma has implemented a numerical code for the simulation of external gear pumps and motors; the code is named HYGESim and {{it is based on}} a lumped parameter approach implemented in AMESim, writing proper submodels in C language. This work is focused on the optimization of the pump design with particular reference to the geometry of the recesses machined on the bushings. The procedure is based on a path search method known as Steepest Descent and optimizes the considered parameters starting from a design taken as initial reference. The objective functions defined for the optimization permit to account for the volumetric efficiency, the delivery pressure ripple, the maximum and minimum pressure peaks during the meshing process. An optimal design of the recesses has been proposed and a prototype of a pump, equipped with the proposed geometry of bearing blocks, was tested. Measured data and the comparisons with the experimental results obtained for the <b>stock</b> <b>pump</b> taken as reference are presented in the paper, confirming the potentials of the developed optimization methodology...|$|E

50|$|From {{high density}} storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped {{to a low}} density storage chest (tank). From there it is {{typically}} diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest. From the unrefined stock chest <b>stock</b> is again <b>pumped,</b> with consistency control, through a refiner. Refining is an operation whereby the pulp slurry passes between a pair of discs, {{one of which is}} stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60 Hz AC, respectively. The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance. This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the fibrils of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength. For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of carbon}} dioxide for neutralising pulp mill black liquor {{residuals}} and controlling paper machine stock pH has increased dramatically over the past decade. It is replacing, or supplementing, alum and sulfuric acid as the chemical of choice {{because it does not}} add any metal or sulfate ions to the water system; an important consideration with the trend to closed loop water systems in paper mills. However, dissolved and entrained gases can create production problems and paper quality faults at the wet end of the paper machine. Pin holes (where there’s a bubble of gas, there no fibre!), drainage loss and poor formation are some of the more noticeable impacts on paper quality, whilst sheet breaks and pump cavitation can create runability problems. Entrained gases in stock systems have historically been due to mechanical inclusion of air in falling <b>stock,</b> leaky <b>pump</b> glands and poor piping design. Air has a limited solubility in water (~ 120 mg/L), whilst carbon dioxide has a solubility of 1450 mg/L in water at 25 OC and 1 atm. pressure. Thus carbon dioxide can create up to 12 times more dissolved gas than air, which will erupt out of solution when the stock pressure is reduced to one atmosphere as occurs at the flowbox slice. So while entrained air was a minor annoyance, entrained carbon dioxide can be a major problem. Up until now, the method for measuring entrained gas yielded a total entrained gas result and did not distinguish between air and carbon dioxide. Recent developments have resulted in a new test procedure which allows the measurement of both total gases and CO 2. The method is simple, fast and reproducible as long as the carbon dioxide pressure-solubility ratio is borne in mind – i. e. correct sampling is a critical step in obtaining accurate results.

The sulfide tolerance of 2 - 5 g milkfish and 5 - 8 g O. mossambicus was determined in 25 -liter aquaria with flow-through sea water (100 ml min - 1) at 26 - 30 Â°C and sulfide <b>stock</b> solutions <b>pumped</b> in at 1 ml min - 1. Total sulfide concentrations in the aquaria were measured by the methylene blue method and used in the regression against the probits of % survival. Four experiments showed that the two species have similar sulfide tolerance. In sea water of pH 8 - 8. 5, about 163 Â± 68 Î¼M or 5. 2 Â± 2. 2 mg l - 1 total sulfide (mean Â± 2 se) or 10 Î¼M or 313 Î¼g l - 1 H 2 S was lethal to 50 % of the fish in 4 - 8 h, and 61 Â± 3 Î¼M total sulfide or 4 Î¼M H 2 S in 24 - 96 h (to convert all sulfide concentrations: 1 Î¼M = 32 Î¼g l - 1). Earthen pond bottoms had 0 - 382 Î¼M total dissolved sulfide (mean Â± sd - 54 Â± 79 Î¼M, n - 76); a tenth of the samples had > 200 Î¼M. The water column may have such sulfide levels under hypoxic or anoxic conditions. To simulate some of the conditions during fish kills, 5 - 12 g milkfish were exposed to an abrupt increase in sulfide, alone or in combination with progressive respiratory hypoxia and decreasing pH. The tests were done in the same flow-through set-up but with sulfide pumped in at 25 ml min - 1. The lethal concentration for 50 % of the fish was 197 Î¼M total sulfide or 12 Î¼M H 2 S at 2 h, but 28 - 53 Î¼M sulfide allowed fish to survive 6 - 10 h. Milkfish in aquaria with no aeration nor flow-through sea water died of respiratory hypoxia in 5 - 8 h when oxygen dropped from 6 to 1 mg l - 1. Under respiratory hypoxia with 30 - 115 Î¼M sulfide, the fish died in 2. 5 - 4 h. Tests with low pH were done by pumping a weak sulfuric acid solution at 25 ml min - 1 into aquaria with flow-through sea water such that the pH dropped from 8 to 4 in 5 h. Under these conditions, milkfish died in 7 - 9 h when the pH was 3. 5. When 30 - 93 Î¼M sulfide was pumped in with the acid, the fish died in 2 - 6 h when the pH was still 4. 5 - 6. 3.

2500|$|It was in 1896 that D. Ward King first {{dragged the}} road with an old frostbitten <b>pump</b> <b>stock</b> and an oak post. The {{improvement}} in the dirt roads it worked was dramatic. Until then, {{the only way to}} firm up dirt roads had been to dump layers of stone on them and then press it in with a heavy roller to make a road surface resistant to turning into muck after every rain. This method was fairly effective, but it was also labor-intensive and expensive. These stone-permeated roads were called [...] "macadamized roads". These roads took their name from their Scotch inventor, John Loudon McAdam. Using his method, roads were covered with several layers of stone, starting with large ones and then reducing their size in each successive layer. The stones in the first level would be {{about the size of a}} human head. The stones in the next layer would be about the size of a fist. The final layer would be of stones of about the size of golf balls. It was grueling work to haul this heavy stone to the places needed, to unload it in the right places and then to spread it evenly over the road surface with only horse-drawn wagons and hand-held shovels and rakes. Further, in the days before powered stone crushers, there was the additional and very arduous task of smashing much bigger rocks down to the right size for use in the respective layers. This work came to be known as [...] "making the big ones into the small ones." [...] Men did it by hand by smashing large rocks with sledgehammers. In many states, convicts did this work and sometimes even built these macadamized roads by working on the roads themselves. When these convict crews worked directly on these roads, necessarily outside the walls of the prison, each man was typically chained to the next to prevent runaways. These convict road crews became the infamous [...] "chain gangs" [...] of that day. In the days of horse power, this method was just too time-consuming and expensive to be practical for widespread use.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the value of}} load shifting and demand side flexibility for improving electric grid system operations. In particular, this study investigates to what extent residential heat pumps participating in load shifting can contribute to reducing operational costs and CO 2 CO 2 emissions associated with electric power generation and how home owners with heat pump systems can be best motivated to achieve these flexibility benefits. Residential heat pumps, when intelligently orchestrated in their operation, can lower operational costs and CO 2 CO 2 emissions by performing load shifting {{in order to reduce}} curtailment of electricity from renewable energy sources and improve the efficiency of dispatchable power plants. In order to study the interaction, both the electricity generation system and residences with heat pumps are modeled. In a first step, an integrated modeling approach is presented which represents the idealized case where the electrical grid operation in terms of unit commitment and dispatch is concurrently optimized with that {{of a large number of}} residential heat pumps located in homes designed to low-energy design standards. While this joint optimization approach does not lend itself for real-time implementation, it serves as an upper bound for the achievable operational cost savings. The main focus of this paper is to assess to what extent load shifting incentives are able to achieve the aforementioned savings potential. Two types of incentives are studied: direct load control and dynamic time-of-use pricing. Since both the electricity generation supply system and the residential building <b>stock</b> with heat <b>pumps</b> had been modeled for the joint optimization, the performance of both load shifting incentives can be compared by separately {{assessing the}} supply and demand side. Superior performance is noted for the direct-load control scenario, achieving 60 – 90 % of the cost savings attained in the jointly optimized best-case scenario. In dynamic time-of-use pricing, poor performance in terms of reduced cost and emissions is noted when the heat pumps response is not taken into account. When the heat pumps response is taken into account, dynamic time-of-use pricing performs better. However, both dynamic time-of-use pricing schemes show inferior performance at high levels of residential heat pump penetration. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{biological}} process employing green sulfur bacteria was investigated to remove sulfide (S=) from industrial wastewaters and convert it to elemental sulfur. This research {{is unique in}} that dissolved sulfide was present in the liquid influent fed into a continuous-flow photosynthetic bioreactor. A suspended-growth once-through continuous-flow stirred-tank bioreactor was successfully operated under five different experimental conditions. For the first three experiments, concentrated nutrient solution and sulfide <b>stock</b> solution were <b>pumped</b> separately into a 13. 7 L reactor at a hydraulic retention time of 45 hours and S= loading rates of 2. 1, 4. 4, and 5. 6 mg/h·L. At the lowest loading rate, nearly all influent S= was oxidized to sulfate. The middle loading rate resulted in complete conversion of S= to S 0. Steady state conditions were not achieved at the highest loading rate, resulting in the accumulation of S= in the bioreactor. In two more experiments, nutrient medium and S= stock solution were separately fed into a 12. 0 L bioreactor at S= loading rates of 3. 2 and 2. 7 mg/h·L, and hydraulic retention times of 173 and 99 hours respectively. In these trials, the loading rates were adjusted to maintain a residual of S= in the bioreactor, and consequently, there was nearly complete conversion of the consumed S= to S 0. A parameter was developed to relate the experiments of this dissertation with those reported in the literature, where smaller reactors and higher bacterial concentrations were used in batch reactors fed with H 2 S(g). This parameter described {{the capacity of the}} bioreactor to consume S=, and was calculated as the product of the radiant flux per unit reactor volume and the bacteriochlorophyll concentration. Three predictive models were developed for the bioreactor. In the yield-based model, a yield coefficient was used to link the increase in bacteriochlorophyll with the consumption of S=. Poor correlations between the rates of reaction and the concentrations of the reactant sulfur species led to the conclusion that a reaction pathway-based model was not appropriate for this system. An empirical model was proposed to relate the reactor volume, S= loading rate, reactor irradiation and bacteriochlorophyll concentration. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

Subsidies for the adoption of (more) efficient irrigation technologies are commonly proposed and enacted with the goal of achieving water conservation. These subsidies are more politically feasible than water taxes or water use restrictions. The reasoning behind this type of policy is that increased application efficiency makes it possible to sustain a given level of crop production per acre with lower levels of groundwater pumping, all else equal. Previous literature argues that adoption of more efficient irrigation systems may not reduce groundwater extraction. Rewarding the acquisition of more efficient [...] and capital intensive [...] irrigation equipment affects the incentives farmers have to pump groundwater. For instance, the farmer may choose to produce more valuable and water intensive crops or to expand the irrigated acreage after adopting the more efficient irrigation system. Hence, the actual impact of the policy on overall groundwater extraction and related aquifer depletion is unclear. The first chapter examines the effects of such irrigation technology subsidies using a model of inter-temporal common pool groundwater use with substitutable technology and declining well-yields from groundwater <b>stocks,</b> where <b>pumping</b> cost and <b>stock</b> externalities arise from the common property problem. An optimal control analytical model is developed and simulated with parameters from Sheridan County, Kansas [...] a representative region overlying the Ogallala aquifer. The study contrasts competitive and optimal allocations and accounts for endogenous and time-varying irrigation capital on water use and groundwater stock. The analysis is the first to account for the labor savings from improved irrigation technologies. The results show that in the absence of policy intervention, the competitive solution yields an early period with underinvestment in efficiency-improving irrigation technology relative to the socially efficient solution, followed by a period of over-investment. This suggests a potential role for irrigation capital subsidies to improve welfare over certain ranges of the state variables. In contrast to previous work, the findings are evidence that significant returns may be achieved from irrigation capital subsidies. Finally, a policy scenario is simulated where an irrigation technology subsidy is implemented to explore whether such a program can capture significant portions of the potential welfare gain. Results indicate that the technology subsidy can improve welfare, but it captures a relatively small portion of the potential gains in welfare. The second chapter presents a dynamic model of groundwater extraction for irrigation where climate change and technical progress are included as exogenous state variables [...] in addition to the usual state variable of the stock of groundwater. The key contributions of this study are (i) an intuitive description of the conditions under which groundwater extraction can be non-monotonic, (ii) a numerical demonstration that extraction is non-monotonic in an important region overlying the Ogallala Aquifer, and (iii) the predicted gains from management are substantially larger after accounting for climate and technical change. Intuitively, optimal extraction is increasing in early periods when the marginal benefits of extraction are increasing sufficiently fast due to climate and technical change compared to the increase in the marginal cost of extraction. In contrast, most previous studies include the stock of groundwater as the only state variable and, consequently, recommend a monotonically decreasing extraction path. In this study, the numerical simulations for a region in Kansas overlying the Ogallala Aquifer indicate that optimal groundwater extraction peaks 23 years in the future and the gains from management are large (29. 5 %). Consistent with previous literature, the predicted gains from management are relatively small (6. 1 %) when ignoring climate and technical change. The realized gains from management are not substantially impacted by incorrect assumptions of climate and technical change when formulating the optimal plan...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of breastfeeding {{have been well}} documented for both mother and child. Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for an infant and includes decreased risk for numerous diseases and illnesses. However, {{there is evidence that}} when mothers return back to work from maternity leave, they often stop breastfeeding. The present research project utilizes the Positive Deviance approach to find working mothers who have successfully breastfed their children exclusively for six months and to determine what enables these mothers to continue to breastfeed past one year of birth while working full time. The purpose is to understand why some working mothers, who face resistance and odds, succeed in effectively breastfeeding while most others do not. ^ Working mothers who continued to breastfeed past one year were found using snowball sampling through a local El Paso charter of an international organization, Mothers of Preschoolers (MOPS). MOPS is a support group for mothers with {{children under the age of}} five. Mothers were also found after attending a meeting for the Bi-National Breastfeeding Coalition. For a mother to be considered a Positive Deviant (PD), she will have to meet the following criteria: located in El Paso, TX, working full-time, must have exclusively breastfed for six months and introduced solid foods at six months while continuing to breastfeed for one year or beyond, and to have done so in the face of resistance from one or more friends, family or colleagues. After the PD mothers were identified, in-depth interviews were conducted to help understand what enables the working mother to breastfeed past one year. The identified communicative acts were both intrapersonal and interpersonal in nature. ^ Temporally, these communicative acts occurred for the working mothers, before the child was born, immediately after the child was born and in preparing to return to work. Before the child was born, the working mothers who were positive deviants made an active decision to breastfeed. These PD mothers would discuss their decisions with their partner and they would both come up with a “game plan” on how to make it work. In fact, a mutual decision was reached that baby formula will not be in the picture. Lastly, the PD mothers would purchase a breast pump before the birth of the child. ^ After the birth of their child, the PD mothers regularly sought the advice of lactation consultants to learn how to nurse properly. Many even called the lactation consultant after being discharged from the hospital. Mothers also learned their child’s feeding routines and cues, charting the feeding schedule, including carefully noting, which breast the child nursed from and for what duration. Mothers also figured out ways to deal with painful breasts and cracked nipples with over-the-counter products and holistic remedies. Some PD mothers worked out a night schedule with their husbands enabling them to bottle-feed the child breast milk that was pumped in advance. This allowed them to get at least three days of adequate sleep during the week. ^ In their preparation to return to work, most of the PD mothers were aware of their legal rights to pump milk in the workplace. Also, the PD mothers would build up a <b>stock</b> of <b>pumped</b> breast milk before returning to work. At work, the PD mothers used creative strategies to use the breast pump, and at home train caregivers on how to properly handle and administer breast milk to their child. The mothers would remind caregivers on a daily basis that her child was breastfed. If the child was under the care of a relative, the mother would go over how to properly administer breast milk through a bottle. PD mothers also nursed their child before leaving the house in the morning and soon after on arrival from work. The PD mothers clearly demonstrated the important role of communication in the various stages of breastfeeding their children. Whether it was with their spouse to gain support, or seek the advice of a lactation consultant, or train caregivers, the PD mothers employed communication as a strategic tool to engender effective breastfeeding outcomes. ...|$|R
5000|$|It was in 1896 that D. Ward King first {{dragged the}} road with an old frostbitten <b>pump</b> <b>stock</b> and an oak post. The {{improvement}} in the dirt roads it worked was dramatic. Until then, {{the only way to}} firm up dirt roads had been to dump layers of stone on them and then press it in with a heavy roller to make a road surface resistant to turning into muck after every rain. This method was fairly effective, but it was also labor-intensive and expensive. These stone-permeated roads were called [...] "macadamized roads". These roads took their name from their Scotch inventor, John Loudon McAdam. Using his method, roads were covered with several layers of stone, starting with large ones and then reducing their size in each successive layer. The stones in the first level would be {{about the size of a}} human head. The stones in the next layer would be about the size of a fist. The final layer would be of stones of about the size of golf balls. It was grueling work to haul this heavy stone to the places needed, to unload it in the right places and then to spread it evenly over the road surface with only horse-drawn wagons and hand-held shovels and rakes. Further, in the days before powered stone crushers, there was the additional and very arduous task of smashing much bigger rocks down to the right size for use in the respective layers. This work came to be known as [...] "making the big ones into the small ones." [...] Men did it by hand by smashing large rocks with sledgehammers. In many states, convicts did this work and sometimes even built these macadamized roads by working on the roads themselves. When these convict crews worked directly on these roads, necessarily outside the walls of the prison, each man was typically chained to the next to prevent runaways. These convict road crews became the infamous [...] "chain gangs" [...] of that day. In the days of horse power, this method was just too time-consuming and expensive to be practical for widespread use.The advantage of the King Road Drag was that it firmed up dirt roads by leaving a crown in the middle, which caused rain water to just run off, keeping the road dry and firm. Its crowning virtue was that, unlike pressing stone into the mud road surface, it was very quick and very inexpensive. The method quickly caught on.Draft horses, relieved of the need to drag farm wagons through mire, were able to haul a lot more farm produce to railroad sidings for transport by the railroad to distant markets. So, in 1903, Ward was employed by the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company to promote its [...] "Good Roads Campaign." [...] During 1904 and 1905 the railroad ran [...] "Good Road" [...] trains over their lines in Iowa. Ward rode these trains to instruct people along the lines on the construction and use of his invention. According to his promotional brochure, the railroad hauled him around in a [...] "private car" [...] and paid him a [...] "handsome salary". His brochure, while not naming them, stated that [...] "four important railroads" [...] had done that. However, the enthusiasm of the railroad for improved roads quickly cooled when their ridership for short trips began to drop off dramatically. With improved local roads, people started travelling locally on their own bicycles (which were the craze of the day) and their own newly acquired automobiles. However, D. Ward King and his [...] "Good Roads" [...] program were already on their way, and the end of railroad support did little to stop it.|$|R
