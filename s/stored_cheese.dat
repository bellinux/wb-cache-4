40|$|Morinda citrofolia (noni), is a {{tropical}} plant {{that has been}} studied for its content of phenolic compounds, which display antioxidant properties. Although many authors have shown that fruit pulp {{is the part of}} noni plant richer in those compounds, all parts (leaves, rods and stem) are being used as traditional medicines in tropical countries. Patulin (PAT) {{is one of the most}} common mycotoxins, frequently found in spoiled fruits (apples), moldy feeds and <b>stored</b> <b>cheese,</b> representing a serious health concern because of its genotoxic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic and teratogenic effects that are mainly mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to identify bioactive natural compounds able to reduce the deleterious effects of patulin and other mycotoxins, in order to protect the human health. This is a particularly relevant concern in tropical regions where food contamination with mycotoxins has a strong negative impact on human health. On the other hand, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) is a model alkylating agent inducing mostly point mutations. This work intended to explore the chemopreventive properties of a noni fruit hexanic extract prepared in Brazil.

40|$|Patulin is a toxic {{secondary}} metabolite {{of a number}} of fungal species belonging to the genera Penicillum and Aspergillus. It has been mainly isolated from apples and apple products contaminated with the common storagerot fungus of apples, Penicillum expansum, but it has also been extracted from rotten fruits, moldy feeds, and <b>stored</b> <b>cheese.</b> Human exposure to patulin can lead to serious health problems, and according to a long-term investigation in rats, the World Health Organization has set a tolerable weekly intake of 7 ppb body weight. The content of patulin in foods has been restricted to 50 ppb in many countries. Conventional analytical detection methods involve chromatographic analyses, such as HPLC, GC, and, more recently, techniques such as LC/MS and GC/MS. However, extensive protocols of sample cleanup are required prior to the analysis, and to accomplish it, expensive analytical instrumentation is necessary. An immunochemical analytical method, based on highly specific antigen-antibody interactions, would be desirable, offering several advantages compared to conventional techniques, i. e., low cost per sample, high selectivity, high sensitivity, and high throughput. In this paper, the synthesis of two new derivatives of patulin is described, along with their conjugation to the bovine serum albumin for the production of polyclonal antibodies. Finally, a fluorescence competitive immunoassay was developed for the on-line detection of patulin...|$|E
40|$|Four Mozzarella cheese {{samples were}} {{prepared}} from cow's milk, standardized at four different fat levels (0, 3, 5 and 7 % respectively) and stored at 4 o C for 30 days. <b>Stored</b> <b>cheese</b> was examined at 0, 10, 20 and 30 days intervals.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Sanford Klein, Douglas Reindl, and Doug Reinemann; 106 pp. Wisconsin continues to lead {{the nation in the}} production of cheese, providing about 30 % of the national supply. The industry is less secure than it once was, however, due to narrowing profit margins and competition from large plants in California and elsewhere. In 1994, the production of cheese consumed 87. 7 % of the milk produced in Wisconsin. Thus the success of the Wisconsin cheese industry is closely linked {{to the success of the}} Wisconsin dairy industry at large, which provides about three billion dollars per year in gross income. In this study, the utility use of two representative cheese plants is examined. Utility costs generally represent about 11 % of the total manufacturing cost of cheese. Utility use is one of the few variables that a plant manager can influence to improve plant profitability. The largest fraction of the energy used at a typical plant is devoted to processing whey, a byproduct of significant food value. Two types of equipment are commonly used to process or remove moisture from whey: evaporation systems and spray dryers. Through the course of this research project, models for both evaporation and spray drying equipment were developed. Pinch analysis has been applied to investigate heat recovery options such as open cycle heat pumps and heat exchange units. Significant opportunities for reduction of utility use have been identified for both the evaporation system and the spray drying system examined. Making use of the low temperature vapor rejected from the evaporation system by preheating raw milk provides two simultaneous benefits. Steam use by the ii pasteurizer is decreased, and the cooling rejection load on the cooling tower (equipped with a 60 hp motor) is eliminated. Cost savings associated with these benefits are estimated to exceed $ 70, 000 per year. In the spray dryer system studied, outdoor air is heated to 240 �F before being introduced into the drying chamber. Exhaust air leaves the chamber at 155 �F. The use of either direct or indirect heat exchange between the supply air before it reaches the burner and the exhaust air is explored. Energy cost savings in the range of $ 40, 000 to $ 70, 000 are predicted for this opportunity. In addition to the heat recovery analysis just described, this study explores an alternative control strategy to reduce electricity costs related to maintaining a cold storage warehouse through demand shifting. By sub-cooling the <b>stored</b> <b>cheese</b> during the off-peak period, it is possible to meet all or most of the cooling load in the warehouse as the sub-cooled cheese returns to its normal storage temperature. In this way, operation of the cooling equipment during peak-time can be avoided or reduced significantly. This control strategy has been examined using a finite difference model of the warehouse. The model has demonstrated the approach to be feasible. It has been estimated to result in reduced annual electric costs of about $ 15, 000.

50|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to the}} best way to <b>store</b> <b>cheese,</b> but some experts say that {{wrapping}} it in cheese paper provides optimal results. Cheese paper is coated in a porous plastic on the inside, and the outside has a layer of wax.
