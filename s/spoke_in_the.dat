All classes and athletic events were canceled through February 24, 2008. Faculty and staff returned to work on Tuesday, February 19, and for the remainder of that week received special information and training to help students upon their return to classes the following week.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} from New Zealand in 1946, Newall was raised to the peerage as Baron Newall, of Clifton upon Dunsmoor, in the county of Warwick. He <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords rarely, making five speeches between 1946 and 1948 and one in 1959, mostly {{addressing}} defence issues. Newall died at his home at Welbeck Street in London on 30 November 1963, at which time his son Francis inherited his title.|$|E
50|$|For {{aerodynamics}} and rotating weight, it {{is generally}} better to reduce <b>the</b> number of <b>spokes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wheel. For high-end wheelsets, the spokes can be shaped to have a bladed cross-section, further reducing wind resistance.|$|R
40|$|The {{results and}} {{implications}} of dynamical and reflectance studies of <b>spokes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Voyager 2 low-resolution ring movie are presented. The spoke of greater interest (Spoke 1) can be traced from its first appearance on the morning and to its terminal dispersion on the evening side. Orbital velocities, reflectances, and reflectance profiles are reported. The behavior of Spoke 1 conforms to the plasma cloud model of spoke formation and evolution proposed by Goertz and Morfill (1983). A second <b>spoke</b> observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring movie provides corroborating support for the observed behavior of Spoke 1...|$|R

5|$|Harding {{elected to}} conduct a front porch campaign, like McKinley in 1896. Some years earlier, Harding had had his front porch remodeled to {{resemble}} McKinley's, which his neighbors felt signified presidential ambitions. The candidate remained at home in Marion and gave addresses to visiting delegations. In the meantime, Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation, giving hundreds of speeches. Coolidge <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeast, {{later on in the}} South, and was not a significant factor in the election.|$|E
5|$|In {{retirement}} Denning {{moved to}} Whitchurch and continued {{the work he}} had done outside court hours, lecturing and presenting awards. He also on occasion dispensed legal advice; in February 1983 he advised Patrick Evershed on the statutory duties of water suppliers. Further hip troubles were resolved with a full replacement in March 1983, although a fall later that year forced him {{to stay at home}} for six weeks. With free time on his hands Denning <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords on matters that interested him, supporting an amendment to the Abortion Act 1967 and bills designed to allow the administration of companies in financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing {{a few feet from}} U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an audience}} of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media.

5|$|The Member {{became a}} close {{associate}} and political {{friend of the}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. After Pitt's death in 1806, Ferguson did not so easily retain his seat in Parliament. In the elections of 1806, he retained the seat by just two votes, and his opponent General Alexander Hay demanded he be investigated for bribery and corruption. Ferguson again beat Hay in the contest for the seat in June 1807, but {{this time with a}} more convincing majority of 54 to 39 votes. Ferguson was unopposed in the next three elections. Some records indicate that Ferguson never <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commons except to complain about a broken window behind his seat causing a draught. He is actually recorded as speaking on at least five occasions over the years.|$|E
5|$|With many mining {{communities}} suffering {{high levels}} of unemployment following the General Strike, some Poor Law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances. These boards used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants. With the system thrown into crisis, Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant boards, and later got Parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such boards. Though no board members were prosecuted, Chamberlain dismissed three boards, replacing their members with his own appointees. Finally, in 1929, Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely, replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities. Chamberlain <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commons {{for two and a}} half hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded, he was applauded by all parties. The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority, and the Morning Post commented that (despite Labour attacks), it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two weeks}} of his {{appointment}} as Minister of Health Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law. Chamberlain sought {{the abolition of the}} elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians which administered relief—and which in some areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. In 1929 Chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely. Chamberlain <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commons {{for two and a half}} hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.|$|E

In April a House of Commons Select Committee was investigating the atmospheric railway system proposed by Brunel.

The latter two were to be proved right <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run. <b>In</b> August <b>the</b> two gave evidence before the Gauge Commissioners {{who were trying to}} arrive at a standard gauge for the whole country. Brunel <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favour of <b>the</b> 7 ft gauge he was using on the Great Western Railway. Locke and Stephenson <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favour of <b>the</b> 4 ft 8½in gauge that they had used on several lines. The latter two won the day and their gauge was adopted as the standard.|$|R
