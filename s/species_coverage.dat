40|$|The “dehesa” is a {{traditional}} Iberian agrosilvopastoral ecosystem characterized {{by the presence of}} old scattered trees that are considered as “keystone-structures”, which favor the presence {{of a wide range of}} biodiversity. We show the high diversity of saproxylic beetles and syrphids (Diptera) in this ecosystem, including red-listed species. We analyzed whether saproxylic species distribution in the “dehesa” was affected by tree density per hectare, dominant tree <b>species</b> or vegetation <b>coverage.</b> <b>Species</b> diversity did not correlate with tree density; however, it was affected by tree <b>species</b> and shrub <b>coverage</b> but in a different way for each taxon. The highest beetle diversity was linked to Quercus pyrenaica, the most managed tree species, with eight indicator species. In contrast, Q. rotundifolia hosted more species of saproxylic syrphids. Regarding vegetation coverage, shrub coverage was the only variable that affected insect richness, again in a different way for both taxa. In contrast, beetle species composition was only affected by dominant tree species whereas syrphid species composition was not affected by tree <b>species</b> or shrub <b>coverage.</b> We concluded that the high diversity of saproxylic insects in the “dehesa” is related to its long history of agrosilvopastoral management, which has generated landscape heterogeneity and preserved old mature trees. However, the richness and composition of different taxa of insects respond in different ways to tree <b>species</b> and vegetation <b>coverage.</b> Consequently, conservation strategies should try to maintain traditional management, and different saproxylic taxa should be used to monitor the effect of management on saproxylic diversity.

Plasma-surface interactions in plasma etching processes are capable of influencing bulk plasma properties as well as determining etch rates and feature profiles.

40|$|The master {{equation}} of a lattice gas reaction tracks {{the probability of}} visiting all spatial configurations. The large number of unique spatial configurations on a lattice renders master equation simulations infeasible for even small lattices. In this work, a reduced master equation is derived for the probability distribution of the coverages in the infinite diffusion limit. This derivation justifies the widely used assumption that the adlayer is in equilibrium for the current coverages and temperature when all reactants are highly mobile. Given the reduced master equation, two novel and efficient simulation methods of lattice gas reactions in the infinite diffusion limit are derived. The first method involves solving the reduced master equation directly for small lattices, which is intractable in configuration space. The second method involves reducing the master equation further in the large lattice limit {{to a set of}} differential equations that tracks only the <b>species</b> <b>coverages.</b> Solution of the reduced master equation and differential equations requires information that can be obtained through short, diffusion-only kinetic Monte Carlo simulation runs at each coverage.

An idealized CO oxidation reaction mechanism with strong lateral interactions is used as an example system for demonstrating the reduced master equation and deterministic simulation techniques...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To define biome-scale {{hotspots}} of phylogenetic {{and functional}} mammalian biodiversity (PD and FD, respectively) and {{compare them with}} 'classical' hotspots based on species richness (SR) alone. Location: Global. Methods: SR, PD and FD were computed for 782 terrestrial ecoregions using the distribution ranges of 4616 mammalian species. We used a set of comprehensive diversity indices unified by a recent framework incorporating the relative <b>species</b> <b>coverage</b> in each ecoregion. We built large-scale multifaceted diversity-area relationships to rank ecoregions according to their levels of biodiversity while accounting for the effect of area on each facet of diversity. Finally we defined hotspots as the top-ranked ecoregions. Results: While ignoring relative <b>species</b> <b>coverage</b> led to a fairly good congruence between biome-scale top ranked SR, PD and FD hotspots, ecoregions harbouring a rich and abundantly represented evolutionary history and FD did not match with the top-ranked ecoregions defined by SR. More importantly PD and FD hotspots showed important spatial mismatches. We also found that FD and PD generally reached their maximum values faster than SR {{as a function of}} area. Main conclusions: The fact that PD/FD reach their maximum value faster than SR could suggest that the two former facets might be less vulnerable to habitat loss than the latter. While this point is expected, {{it is the first time}} that it has been quantified at a global scale and should have important consequences for conservation. Incorporating relative <b>species</b> <b>coverage</b> into the delineation of multifaceted hotspots of diversity led to weak congruence between SR, PD and FD hotspots. This means that maximizing species number may fail to preserve those nodes (in the phylogenetic or functional tree) that are relatively abundant in the ecoregion. As a consequence it may be of prime importance to adopt a multifaceted biodiversity perspective to inform conservation strategies at a global scale...|$|E

Special emphasis is devoted to point out the role of the surface charge, water structure and adsorbed oxygen containing species.

Instead, adlayer structures and the relation between adsorbed water, H 2 Oads, water dissociation products, OHads or Oads, and PtO oxide <b>species</b> <b>coverage</b> affect the whole energetics of the adsorption processes and may determine the surface reactivity.

Overall, shrub height and length tended to increase under fertilisation and warming, whereas branching increased mostly in shaded Cassiope. Morphological changes were coupled to increased secondary growth under fertilisation. The <b>species</b> <b>coverage</b> showed a remarkable increase in graminoids in fertilised plots. Shrub response to fertilisation was positive in the short-term but changed over time, likely because of an increased competition with graminoids. More erected postures and large, canopies (requiring enhanced secondary growth for stem reinforcement) likely compensated for the increased light competition in Empetrum and Cassiope but did not avoid growth reduction in the shade intolerant Betula. The impact of warming and shading on shrub growth was more conservative. The lack of growth enhancement under warming suggests the absence of long-term acclimation for processes limiting biomass production. The lack of negative effects of shading on Cassiope was linked to morphological changes increasing the photosynthetic surface. Overall, tundra shrubs showed developmental plasticity over the longer term. However, such plasticity was associated clearly with growth rate trends only in fertilised plots...|$|E
