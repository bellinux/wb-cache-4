2500|$|Leicestershire's {{record in}} 1912 and 1913 was {{marginally}} better, although in both seasons they lost more matches {{than any other}} <b>side.</b> <b>Shields</b> {{appears to have been}} a cheerful captain: Wisden noted again in its review of the 1913 season that he [...] "again faced a somewhat thankless task in the best possible spirit". He missed some matches in 1913, being replaced as wicketkeeper by Tom Sidwell, and at the end of the season he resigned the captaincy. He played only two more matches for Leicestershire, one each in 1914 and 1923.|$|E

50|$|While the {{required}} eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide side protection via a wrap-around design or <b>side</b> <b>shields.</b>|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{includes an}} organic device {{that can be}} integrated in a multilayer board made of organic material. The passive devices can be integrally fabricated on a circuit board in either surface mount device (SMD) or ball grid array (BGA) form. Alternatively, the passive device can be constructed in a stand alone SMD or BGA/chip scale package (CSP) form to make it mountable on a multilayer board, ceramic carrier or silicon platform {{in the form of}} an integrated passive device. The passive device includes <b>side</b> <b>shielding</b> on two <b>sides</b> in the SMD form and four sides in the BGA/CSP form. The <b>side</b> <b>shielding</b> can be external or in-built.

40|$|Doses to {{the eyes}} of interventional {{radiology}} staff can exceed the occupational dose limit and potentially cause radiation – induced cataracts. A protective eyewear model with <b>side</b> <b>shield</b> was evaluated to determine the effectiveness level of protection from scattered radiation, Eyewear Protection Factor (EPF). A series of dose measurement has been performed using TLD method, taking into account operator head orientation during procedures and eyewear fit. EPF was strongly influenced by {{the position of a}} radiation source and operator head orientation. It was shown that EPF for the front beam incidence vary from 2, 8 to 3, 3, while in the case of 450 beam incidence to the operator head factor values vary from 1, 2 to 2, 0 as well as for 900 incidence from 0, 7 to 1, 1. The decrease of radiation protection effectiveness is explained by a small size of <b>side</b> <b>shield</b> and possible backscattering radiation from the head itself...|$|R

50|$|Photokeratitis can be {{prevented}} by using sunglasses or eye protection that transmits 5-10% of visible light and absorbs almost all UV rays. Additionally, these glasses should have large lenses and <b>side</b> <b>shields</b> to avoid incidental light exposure. Sunglasses should always be worn, even when the sky is overcast, as UV rays can pass through clouds.|$|E

50|$|A {{player with}} {{upgraded}} firepower is lowered to single shots upon being hit. A player with basic firepower instantly loses a life. Being crushed {{by a wall}} also loses a life regardless of firepower. Three different types of shields exist: Two <b>side</b> <b>shields</b> that protect the jet left and right until it is damaged, two temporary small wave shields that rotate around the jet and a temporary invincibility orb shield.|$|E
50|$|The MirrorBit read is {{performed}} very simply by reversing {{the source and}} drain contacts. The junction depletion region extending from the drain <b>side</b> <b>shields</b> the channel from the charge {{on the side of}} the charge trapping cell that overlies the drain. The net result of this is that the drain-side charge has little effect on the current running through the channel, while the source-side charge determines the threshold of the transistor.|$|E
50|$|Combat {{involves}} special dice bearing {{skulls and}} shields. The character {{players and the}} evil wizard player use the same dice, but the evil wizard player has a smaller chance of rolling his specific shield. The number of dice used {{is determined by the}} basic statistics of the player or monster, whether they are attacking or defending, plus any modifiers due to spells or items being carried. The dice have 3 skull <b>sides,</b> 2 'Hero' <b>shield</b> <b>sides</b> and 1 'monster/Zargon' <b>shield</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on {{review of}} {{literature}} and on limited examination of nuclear power systems now proposed for space applications, a nuclear fission reactor powered system should be seriously considered as the first large (order of 50 kWe or greater) power system {{to be placed on}} a lunar base.

50|$|Unlike the 2-pounder, the new gun {{was mounted}} on a {{conventional}} two-wheeled split trail carriage. The first mass production variant—the Mk II—differed from the pre-production Mk I in having a shorter L/43 barrel, because of shortage of suitable lathes. The subsequent Mk IV was fitted with a L/50 barrel, with muzzle brake. Optional <b>side</b> <b>shields</b> were issued to give the crew better protection, but were apparently rarely used.|$|E

5000|$|As it is {{associated}} with excessive sun [...] or wind exposure, wearing protective sunglasses with <b>side</b> <b>shields</b> and/or wide brimmed hats and using artificial tears throughout the day may help prevent their formation or stop further growth. Surfers and other water-sport athletes should wear eye protection that blocks 100% of the UV rays from the water, as is often used by snow-sport athletes. Many {{of those who are}} at greatest risk of pterygium from work or play sun exposure do not understand the importance of protection.|$|E
40|$|Provided are {{methods of}} {{manufacturing}} an electrostatically clean solar array panel and the products {{resulting from the}} practice of these methods. The preferred method uses an array of solar cells, each with a coverglass where the method includes machining apertures into a flat, electrically conductive sheet so that each aperture is aligned with and undersized with respect to its matched coverglass sheet and thereby fashion a front <b>side</b> <b>shield</b> with apertures (FSA). The undersized portion about each aperture of the bottom side of the FSA shield is bonded to the topside portions nearest the edges of each aperture's matched coverglass. Edge clips {{are attached to the}} front <b>side</b> aperture <b>shield</b> edges with the edge clips electrically and mechanically connecting the tops of the coverglasses to the solar panel substrate.

50|$|On 6 March 1915 the Russians ordered 60 {{vehicles}} of an improved design, known as Austin 2nd series. This time the chassis of a 1.5 ton {{truck with a}} more powerful engine was used. The hull was shorter, with thicker armour, the driver's cab roof was modified to improve machine guns' angle of fire. Less welcome was a removal of rear access door. The army also decided it wanted a rear driving post, so after arrival to Russia all vehicles were fitted with a redesigned rear hull section, which housed a second driving post and additional hatch. Another upgrade was the addition of <b>side</b> <b>shields</b> to the machine guns.|$|E
