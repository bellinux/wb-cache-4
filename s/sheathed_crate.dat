50|$|When {{any type}} of crate reaches a certain size, more boards may be added. These boards are often called Cleats. A cleat is used to provide support to a panel when that panel has reached a size that is may require added support based on the method of transportation. Cleats may be placed {{anywhere}} between the edges of a given panel. On crates, cleat placement is often determined by {{the width of the}} plywood used on plywood <b>sheathed</b> <b>crates.</b> On other crates, cleats are often evenly spaced as required to strengthen the panel. Sometimes two cleats are added across the top panel of a crate placed as needed to give the top of the crate added strength where lifting chains or straps may press on the crate while lifting.|$|R
50|$|IATA, the International Air Transport Association, for example, doesn't allow crates on {{airplanes}} because it defines a crate as an open transport container. Although a crate {{can be of}} the Open or Framed variety, having no <b>sheathing,</b> a Closed <b>crate</b> is not open and is equally as safe to ship in as a wooden box, which is allowed by IATA.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{version of}} plywood {{was invented in}} the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, {{produced}} the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use {{in a wide variety}} of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, sub-floors, roof sheathing, wall <b>sheathing,</b> shipping <b>crates</b> and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships. The pulp and paper industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp & Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a paper-making machine that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper.|$|R
