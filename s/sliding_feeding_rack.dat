The TMR delay was applied either for one (on Tuesday; single delay, SD) or for three consecutive days (Tuesday to Thursday; repeated delay, RD) to one group at a time while the other acted as control. A week of pause was interposed between treatments and the order of the treatment was randomised. Behaviour was observed by instantaneous scan sampling every 2 min during seven half-hour periods on Tuesday and Thursday and blood samples were taken at 14 : 30 h on these days. Milk yield was recorded daily. Data were analysed by a mixed models for repeated measurements. The delay caused a marked increase in activities towards the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack</b> prior to <b>feeding</b> on day 1 when delay was applied both as SD (P< 0. 01) and RD (P< 0. 05).

Automatic concentrate dispensers and automatic milking {{systems have been}} utilised for years, and several manufacturers have introduced automatic feeding systems (AFS). AFSs allow for the increase in frequency of feed distribution with significant advantages in terms of health and production. Furthermore, they provide a reduction of man labour related to preparation of feed, distribution, and propelling the ration closer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> The present research {{was focused on the}} monitoring of a dairy farm, located in the Veneto region of Italy, during the transition from a conventional feeding system (CFS), based on a tractor operated mixing wagon, to an automatic system equipped with stationary feeding hoppers, mixing unit, and distribution wagon operating on rail. The article reports a comparative analysis of the structural modifications required for the adoption of AFS, including an analysis of the AFS/CFS systems based on their functionality, energy, and man labour requirements. In the case study, AFS represented an affordable way to reduce covered area of the housings, {{as a result of the}} reduction in width of foraging lane and the reduction of manger front length. In addition, AFS demonstrated a reduction in labour requirements and improvement of quality and consistency of work when feeding total mixed ration.

40|$|The Welfare Quality® (WQ) {{protocols}} {{are increasingly}} used for assessing welfare of farm animals. These protocols are time consuming (about one day per farm) and, therefore, costly. Our {{aim was to}} assess the scope for reduction of on-farm assessment time of the WQ protocol for dairy cattle. Seven trained observers quantified animal-based indicators of the WQ protocol in 181 loose-housed and 13 tied Dutch dairy herds (herd size from 10 to 211 cows). Four assessment methods were used: avoidance distance at the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack</b> (ADF, 44 min); qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA, 25 min); behavioural observations (BO, 150 min); and clinical observations (CO, 132 min). To simulate reduction of on-farm assessment time, a set of WQ indicators belonging to one assessment method was omitted from the protocol. Observed values of omitted indicators were replaced by predictions based on WQ indicators of the remaining three assessment methods, resources checklist, and interview, thus mimicking the performance of the full WQ protocol. Agreement between predicted and observed values of WQ indicators, however, was low for ADF, moderate for QBA, slight to moderate for BO, and poor to moderate for CO. It was concluded that replacing animal-based WQ indicators by predictions based on remaining WQ indicators shows little scope for reduction of onfarm assessment time of the Welfare Quality® protocol for dairy cattle.

The study focuses on the surface roughness, micro-hardness and surface integrity aspects on soft AISI 420 STAVAX ESR martensitic stainless steel AISI 420 material. This material is pronounced as difficult to cut materials like titanium, Inconel 718 etc. The investigation of surface integrity was done on this materials in terms of operating parameters like <b>sliding</b> speed, <b>feed</b> rate and depth of penetration (DOP) identifying the predominant factors among the selected parameters.

40|$|In alpine regions, {{cows are}} often {{equipped}} with bells during pasture season {{to ensure that}} farmers can locate them. Constant exposure to the chime of a bell may affect cows’ acoustic perception in general. The {{aim of this study}} is to test whether routine bell exposure affects the reactivity to a noise stimulus and might be associated with hearing impairment in cows. For the assessment, behavioral and cardiac indicators were used as indirect measures of hearing capacity. Cows that were either used to wearing a bell or not were exposed to a playback of low and high amplitude (=varying loudness). In addition, we tested whether wearing earplugs, mimicking hearing impairment, reduced the cows’ reactivity toward the playback. On 24 farms, half of them routinely using cowbells, 96 Brown Swiss cows were tested in a 2 [*]×[*] 2 factorial cross-over design (65 or 85 [*]dB, without or with earplugs) in a balanced order. The effects of bell experience, amplitude, and earplugs on the latency to the first behavioral and cardiac response to a 5 -s playback were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, considering dependencies within the data set. Cows reacted faster without earplugs and when they were exposed to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. The proportion of cows leaving the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack</b> after onset of the playback was reduced by bell experience and earplugs and was increased when exposed to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. Exposure without earplugs to 85 [*]dB but not to 65 [*]dB increased heart rate. Heart rate and heart rate variability indicated increased sympathetic activation during the exposure to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. In general, behavioral and cardiac indicators did not indicate severe hearing impairment due to routine bell exposure. The 85 -dB stimulus increased arousal and avoidance compared with the 65 -dB stimulus, with bell experience and earplugs leading to a general decrease in avoidance of the stimulus. This may reflect an altered acoustic perception of the playback stimulus in dairy cows that are routinely exposed to bells...|$|R

The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow.

40|$|Human-animal {{relationships}} {{are essential for}} dairy farming. They affect work comfort and efficiency, as well as milk production. A poor human-animal relation- ship can result in stress and accidents to both animals and caretakers {{and needs to be}} improved. However, many studies have demonstrated the multifactorial- ity of these relationships. We aimed at assessing the relative importance of the various factors expected to be associated with poor human-animal relationships. On 118 dairy farms, we applied a standardized avoid- ance distance test to cows at the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> The sample of farms covered a wide range of situations: lowland versus highland, small versus medium size farms, cubicles versus deep-bedded systems, milking parlor versus automatic milking systems, and Holstein versus Montbéliarde breeds. We used Poisson regres- sion to analyze the links between the number of cows that accepted being touched, and farm characteristics, animals, management, and farmers’ attitudes. A mul- tivariate analysis yielded a final model that explained 32. 7 % of the variability between farms. Calving condi- tions (“Main calving location” and “Cleaning or adding litter after calving”) accounted for {{a significant part of the}} variability observed (respectively 25. 8 and 13. 6 % of variability explained by the model, SSB). Fewer cows accepted being touched on farms where the main calv- ing location was in the barn, and where farmers cleaned or added litter after calving. The proportion of cows that accepted being touched increased with the propor- tion of lean cows in the herd (18. 8 %), with worker/cow ratio on the farm (11. 7 %), when farmers considered “health” or “human-cow relationships” as most impor- tant issues for farm success (10. 4 %), and with farm- ers’ years of experience (10. 8 %). Farmers with more negative behavioral attitudes toward cows had a lower proportion of cows that accepted being touched (8. 9 %). In conclusion, the human-animal relationship was not found to be associated with farm characteristics (e. g., housing or milking system) but varied with farmers’ attitudes and management. We confirm that cows’ fear of people is linked to negative attitudes displayed by caretakers toward cows, and is reduced in farms where several caretakers are present. Our study also suggests further exploring the key role of factors linked to calv- ing conditions, as cows are more likely to be afraid of people when disturbed at calvin...|$|R
40|$|Feeding {{operations}} in dairy cow farms are of strategic {{importance for the}} economy of the farm. In addition to being strictly related to the productivity of the cows, feeding represents one of the greater costs for farms, considering that more than 25 % of labour time is dedicated to this operation. In a context characterized by the need for maintaining high production standards and of decreasing the costs, the adoption of automated systems for the preparation and distribution of the total mixed ration (TMR) can represent a valid solution, especially in specialized farms. Automatic Feeding Systems (AFS) allow for the increase in frequency of feed distribution with a consequent optimization of dry matter ingestion by the animals, and simultaneously, assist with maintaining a higher stability of ruminal pH along with significant advantages in terms of health and production. Furthermore, they provide a reduction of man labour related to preparation of feed, distribution, and to propel the ration closer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> The present research was focused on monitoring of a dairy farm, located in the Veneto region of Italy, during the transition from a conventional feeding system (CFS), represented by a tractor-operated mixing wagon, to an automatic system equipped with stationary feeding hoppers, a mixing unit and distribution wagon operating on rail. The paper reports a comparative analysis of the functionality of the two systems, including energy consumption and man labor, for preparation and distribution of the TMR. Despite the initial capital investment and maintenance, expenditures have not been taken into account in this study, AFS represent an innovative way to reduce the labour requirements and the improve quality and consistency of work when feeding TMR. In particular, labour was reduced from 2. 5 h·day- 1 related to the CFS to 1. 02 h·day- 1 needed for the management of the AFS. The AFS also demonstrated, to be of interest, with regard to an economic point of view, reducing the costs for preparation and distribution of the TMR. The CFS, in fact, showed a cost of 1. 44 EUR·m- 3 and 0. 16 EUR·cow- 1 per day, and the consumption of energy of 24. 66 kWh·m- 3 and 2. 74 kWh·cow- 1 per day, while the AFS revealed a cost of 0. 91 EUR·m- 3 of TMR and 0. 10 EUR·cow- 1 per day, and the specific energy consumption of 6. 81 kWh·m- 3 of TMR and 0. 76 kWh·cow- 1 per da...|$|R

The need for the cartridge to slide both forwards and upwards along the feed ramp and into the barrel is the primary design consideration that makes the ogive the preferred shape for all modern automatic pistol rounds (a hollow point bullet is a truncated ogive), as there are many other shapes that are stable in ballistic flight.|$|R
