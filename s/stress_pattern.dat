500|$|Proto-Hebrew {{generally}} had pen{{ultimate stress}}. [...] The ultimate stress of later traditions of Hebrew usually {{resulted from the}} loss of final vowels in many words, preserving the location of proto-Semitic stress. Tiberian Hebrew has phonemic stress, e.g. [...] ('they built') vs. [...] ('in us'); stress is most commonly ultimate, less commonly penultimate, and antipenultimate stress exists marginally, e.g. [...] ('into the tent'). There {{does not seem to be}} evidence for stress in the Secunda varying from that of the Tiberian tradition. Despite sharing the loss of final vowels with Tiberian Hebrew, Samaritan Hebrew has generally not preserved Proto-Semitic stress, and has predominantly penultimate stress, with occasional ultimate stress. There is evidence that Qumran Hebrew had a similar <b>stress</b> <b>pattern</b> to Samaritan Hebrew.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{regularity}} of <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> in {{a language}} depends on distributional stress regularity, which arises from the <b>pattern</b> of <b>stressed</b> and unstressed syllables, and durational stress regularity, which arises from the timing of syllables. Here we focus on distributional regularity, which depends on three factors. Lexical <b>stress</b> <b>patterning</b> refers to normal <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> within words; interlexical <b>stress</b> <b>patterning</b> refers to patterns that arise from word combinations; and contextual <b>stress</b> <b>patterning</b> refers to adjustments in normal lexical <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> (such as the well-known phenomenon of “stress clash avoidance”). A corpus study was done to assess {{the effect of these}} three factors on distributional stress regularity in conversational and formal spoken English, by comparing the degree of stress regularity in stress-annotated corpus data to randomly manipulated versions of the data and to “citation-form ” <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> drawn from a phonetic dictionary. The results show that both lexical and interlexical patterning contribute significantly to stress regularity in English; contex-tual <b>stress</b> <b>patterning</b> does not, and in fact significantly reduces regularity in comparison to citation-form <b>stress</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Metrical {{phonology}} is {{a relatively}} successful linguistic theory that attempts to explain stress systems in language. This paper discusses a connectionist model that learns a variety of <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> without the incorporation, as processing primitives, of theoretical linguistic constructs such as metrical foot and parameter. An analysis of the learnability of various <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> is developed, based on learning results and connection weights developed for different stress systems. This analysis predicts that certain aspects of stress systems {{will be more difficult}} to learn, at least within the computational framework adopted. The model demonstrates an ability to generalize, and its encoding of knowledge of <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> indicates systematicity, with symmetries among <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> being reflected in the encoded knowledge. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} BTI compact model that {{is able to}} account for the complex BTI <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> {{encountered}} in complex electronic circuits. Such <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> are composed of various blocks corresponding to different circuit operation states, protocol modes or input conditions, and the blocks repeat within a composite, hierarchical structure. The present work extends a previously introduced physics-based accurate NBTI modeling while preserving its numerical efficiency. We provide insight into some principal characteristics of BTI degradation under hierarchical <b>stress</b> <b>patterns,</b> such as a non-trivial dependence on multiple duty cycles. In particular, the NBTI degradation can sensitively depend on the temporal sequence of NBTI stress blocks, and building a model on just the average stress or on stress histograms can be misleading. An SRAM cell example demonstrates this method and compares the cell's BTI failure statistics for two different hierarchic-periods <b>stress</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
500|$|Many of the phonological {{processes}} {{found in}} Irish are found also in its nearest relatives, Scottish Gaelic and Manx. For example, both languages contrast [...] "broad" [...] and [...] "slender" [...] consonants, {{but only at}} the coronal and dorsal places of articulation; both Scottish Gaelic and Manx have lost the distinction in labial consonants. The change of [...] etc. to [...] etc. is found in Manx and in most Scottish dialects. Evidence from written manuscripts suggests it had begun in Scottish Gaelic {{as early as the}} sixteenth century and was well established in both Scottish Gaelic and Manx by the late 17th to early 18th century. Lengthening or diphthongization of vowels before fortis sonorants is also found in both languages. The <b>stress</b> <b>pattern</b> of Scottish Gaelic is the same as that in Connacht and Ulster Irish, while in Manx, stress is attracted to long vowels and diphthongs in noninitial syllables, but under more restricted conditions than in Munster.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of linguistics is {{to understand}} how human language works. Typological research can help to reach this aim by revealing patterns in the languages of the world. In this chapter we will focus on stress typology, and {{we will try to}} explain why some word-based <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> are preferred over others. Our main focus will be on the <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> of two very different groups of languages, viz. the Austronesian languages and the so-called Papuan languages.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results {{from a series of}} studies of <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> in Swedish lexicalised phrases (LPs). The studies {{conducted}} were carried out with the general purpose of identifying parameters {{that can be used to}} predict <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> in Swedish LPs. An LP lexicon with part of speech and relative stress level indicated for each word unit in the LP entries was used for this purpose. The results show a strong correlation between the part of speech and the stress level of words in LPs. The studies also show that a large part of the LPs belongs to a small group of part of speech sequences and that these sequences have very homogenous <b>stress</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of {{prosodic}} transfer effects in the production and perception of three English <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> (broad-focus noun phrase, narrow-focus noun phrase and compound) {{at the level of}} word and phrase prosody by Vietnamese learners of English. The experiments examined the acoustic features and the perceptual strategies that native Australian English speakers and different groups of non-native speakers (Vietnamese beginning learners and advanced speakers of English) use to distinguish the three <b>stress</b> <b>patterns.</b> The results showed that native speakers and non-native speakers differ in their use of acoustic patterns which are optimally suited to their respective first language phonologies for realizing the three English <b>stress</b> <b>patterns.</b> Native speakers of English employed a combination of syntagmatic f 0 (and correlated intensity) contrasts and duration in distinguishing the three <b>stress</b> <b>patterns.</b> Vietnamese speakers had no problem in manipulating contrastive levels of f 0 and intensity on accent-bearing syllables but failed to realize the timing contrast between compound words and phrases and the syntagmatic contrast of accent in larger units such as polysyllabic words or phrases, as evidenced by their failure to deaccent the second element of the compound and narrow-focus patterns. Nevertheless, the advanced speakers’ ability to compress the constituents of the compounds and to deaccent the final nouns shows the effect of language learning/experience on prosodic acquisition. Possible mechanisms that underlie the transfer effects involved in three <b>stress</b> <b>patterns</b> are also discussed...|$|R
