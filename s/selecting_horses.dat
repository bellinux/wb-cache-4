40|$|Abstract. An almost exotic {{field in}} Romania, hippotherapy {{is one of}} the most {{effective}} treatments used to improve the position, balance, mobility and body functions, in all cases of impaired motor capacity, as a clearly defined method, programmed and inserted into a wider project of customize rehabilitation. Hippotherapy is considered as the first step in horse mediated therapy, followed by riding, pre-sportive and sportive rehabilitation, stages that show the increasing capacity of the person who undergoes therapy and its ever more active and independent role on the horse. The paper aims to identify and apply scientific methods of selection of horses to be included in a hippotherapy program as an alternative treatment, applied to institutionalized children with motor disabilities, as a recovery tool. Selection is based on the horses temperament, personality and reactivity, and a program for people with various disabilities will be customized and adapted to their requirements and resource availability. The results obtained show the importance of <b>selecting</b> <b>horses</b> for hippotherapy and the role they play in therapy for people with mental and motor disabilities by reducing negative effects and increase of confidence in their own possibilities...|$|E

Based on researches published in various articles and literature, we try to evaluate the suitability of the hucul horse for a horse assisted treatement. In order to make an objective assessment of the convenience of use of the hucul horse in hippotherapy, we firstly focuss on the history of this versatile breed from its first mentions through current state of hippotherapy in the Czech Republic up to critera of choice of the suitable hippotherapeutical horse and confrontation of these criteria with the character of the hucul horse. First, we describe the origins of the small mountain horse Hucul that emerged with the eponym ethnic group inhabiting the eastern Carpathians. Further we study qualities and characteristics that this breed adopted living in a fairly inhospitable mountain environment and that really makes these horses unique comparing to other breeds. Next we summarize the breed standards as described in the studbook. The chapter on the current state of farming hucul horse then covers its use in our country and in the world as well as discusses the Hucul International Federation, an international association concerned with hucul breeding in seven European countries. Particular attention is paid to the current situation in the Czech Republic. In the chapter about hippotherapy we name the purposes for which this treatment method is to be used, for which patients is this method suitable or not and what are the possible treatments and which of them are used in the Czech Republic. Last but not least, we shortly describe the basic conditions for the exercise of hippotherapy and who may conduct it and the attention is also paid to the Czech hippotherapy chamber and its current status. In the last part we mention the guidelines for <b>selecting</b> <b>horses</b> for hippotherapy and compare these standards and rules with the characteristics and qualities of the hucul horse described earlier. On the basis of this comparison we evaluate the suitability of the hucul horse for the use in hippotherapy...|$|E

What is the relationship between the main characters and the horse/horses according to the theories of Backman? What does the typical horse book look like today? What I come to conclusion in my paper is that all the horse books I analyzed have female main characters, and the girls in these books about horses take a lot of space and demonstrate themselves strong. But at the same time I have also come to the conclusion that all the girls in the books are very dependent on their horses, and in these books are all the horses of the male sex.

[...] Verily, everything has the supporter of its weight.
