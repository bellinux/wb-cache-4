60|$|Then {{her heart}} smote her. She remembered Mary's tender and assiduous nursing all the morning, {{and how she}} had already stayed from service and Sunday school; and she recollected her honour for her friends for not valuing her for her rank; and in that mood <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Psalms and Lessons, which {{she had not been}} able to read in the morning, and when she had {{finished}} them, began to examine the book- case in search of a new, or else a very dear old, Sunday book.|$|E
50|$|After {{the family}} ate Thanksgiving dinner, Ray Blount went home around 5:00 p.m. Around 9:00 p.m., Susan Blount went {{to lie down}} for a nap. Joe Blount drove Robert, Angela and Michael to a {{convenience}} store {{about half a mile}} away from the park where they bought snacks and beer. Susan soon heard a knock at the front door. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window but did not see anybody, so she returned to her nap. When the rest of family returned from the convenience store, they discovered a briefcase on the doorstep. The three teenagers were excited because they thought that the briefcase might have either money or jewels in it. After bringing the briefcase inside, Angela opened the latches and it exploded. Joe, Angela, and Michael were killed when a bomb in the briefcase exploded.|$|E
5000|$|On August 3, 2008, the Atlanta Braves {{announced}} that Caray had died, nine days before {{what would have}} been his 69th birthday. His wife, Paula, reported to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that on Sunday afternoon when she thought her husband was napping, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw a bird feeder not hanging where it should be and thought it had been blown down by the wind. When she stood up, she noticed her husband lying on the ground next to the bird feeder. [...] He had been suffering from failing health for nearly a year prior, but returned to work for the 2008 season, calling a game on radio as recently as three days before his death. Tributes to Caray were given on all of the Atlanta television stations that evening and on WGST-AM the next morning.|$|E

5000|$|Here is {{an example}} of a {{positive}} expertise prediction with a negative outcome and a positive remark: Nancy and her friend Jane were planning a trip to the beach. [...] "The weather should be nice tomorrow," [...] said Jane, who worked for a local TV station as a meteorologist. The next day was a cold and stormy one. As <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window, Nancy said, [...] "This is certainly beautiful weather." [...] Participants read stories like this but also with no expertise predictions, negative predictions, or negative remarks. Glucksberg found that when the final remark matched the outcome, participants interpreted no sarcasm. Positive remarks about negative outcomes were interpreted as more sarcastic than negative remarks to positive outcomes, but the influence of an explicit victim was not reliably greater for negative remarks. This suggests that people judge remarks as sarcastic when it is obviously false to the speaker and listener.|$|E
5000|$|Ahmed's {{younger sister}} Alesha {{arranged}} a robbery {{that took place}} at her parents' house on 25 August 2010 during which she, her brother, sisters, and parents were in the house. She was arrested and told police that her parents had killed Shafilea. She told them that after trying to force the girl to accept the arranged marriage they were afraid her refusal would bring shame on the family. Her father put a plastic bag into her mouth and suffocated her to death. [...] "Alesha, 15 at that time then saw their mother in the kitchen 'sorting through a pile of blankets and sheets' and holding a roll of black bin bags and two rolls of tape, the jury was told. 'After that had happened <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw her father with a large object wrapped in bin bags with brown tape around it.' Shortly afterwards, she saw her father leaving {{in a car with}} Shafilea's body - she assumed - inside." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dillinger {{was for a}} time imprisoned at Crown Point jail, {{although}} he later escaped. Three days after Dillinger's escape, at about 9:45 a.m. on March 6, a vehicle (green 1934 Packard Super 8, 1934 Kansas license 13-786) filled with six members of the gang parked near the curb at the Security National Bank and Trust Company in Sioux Falls. One of the bank's bookkeepers, Mary Lucas, was applying some lipstick when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and saw the Packard roll up the street. [...] "If I ever saw a holdup car, that's one," [...] she said to a bank stenographer next to her. The stenographer laughed, saying that she'd been hearing too much lately about bank robberies. Before they could {{get back to their}} desks, Dillinger, Nelson, Green and Van Meter had entered the bank and subdued both tellers and customers. Hamilton, the driver, stayed with the car, while Tommy Carroll patrolled outside the bank with a Thompson. Inside, Nelson spotted motorcycle patrolman Hale Keith who was approaching the bank on foot. He fired his Thompson at Keith through a plate glass window while standing on an assistant cashier's counter. Multiple bullets hit Keith in the abdomen, in the right leg, about six inches below the hip, the right wrist, and the right arm, just below the elbow but would survive. Nelson was reported to have laughed when Keith fell, then saying, [...] "I got one! I got one!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Phelps {{was born}} in Lily, Laurel County, Kentucky, the second child of Baptist preacher John Hinkle and Lula Hinkle (née Weaver). Phelps {{paternal}} grandfather William Hinkle was of Dutch descent. [...] At a very young age, Phelps demonstrated an unusual interest in nature. She spent countless hours studying rocks, flowers, plants, streams, clouds, and small animals. The gift of a nickel box of crayons at age five unleashed a talent and unrelenting love for drawing. [...] Phelps branched off into painting during her teen years when fortuitously a teacher provided her with some watercolors and paper.In 1922 Phelps moved from Kentucky to Hamilton, Ohio. Through the difficult depression years, child-rearing, a divorce, remarriage and rearing a family of five children she continued her painting. It was during this time that Phelps began primarily using oil paints. In the 1930s Phelps’ work was exhibited at the nearby Cincinnati Art Museum and in local arts and crafts shows. As the winner of a local talent show in 1940, Phelps won a scholarship to attend the Art Academy of Cincinnati.In the 1950s Phelps traveled to New York City {{with a sample of}} her work in order to increase her exposure in the art world. During this visit, Phelps’ work gained the attention of Otto Kallir, the founder of the Galerie St. Etienne. Kallir is most widely known for discovering Grandma Moses and promoting her work. [...] This began a long relationship between Phelps and the Galerie St. Etienne that continues today, through the children of Phelps and current Galerie St. Etienne directors Hildegard Bachert and Jane Kallir. After this trip, Phelps paintings became more widely known in the folk art world, leading to her work being exhibited in various museums. In the 1980s, Phelps’ work {{came to the attention of}} New York gallery owner and scholar of American folk art Jay Johnson. Johnson proceeded to acquire and display Phelps’ paintings in many exhibits, culminating in a solo exhibition of her work at the Jay Johnson America’s Folk Heritage Gallery. In 1989 Phelps’ exhibited two paintings in Daimaru Museum Kyoto, Japan along with other folk artists including Grandma Moses and Horace Pippin. [...] As part of the Friends of Art and Preservation in Embassies (FAPE), Phelps paintings have been displayed in United States Embassies in West Germany, Finland, and Denmark. [...] Phelps’ painting Riverfront Stadium: Phillies and Reds was featured prominently on the front cover of A People and a Nation and during the “Feelin’ in Love” segment of David Letterman’s Second Holiday Film Festival which aired in 1986.Phelps died in early 1990 at age 85. She continued to paint up until her admittance to the hospital in late 1989. During the short hospital stay before her death, Phelps requested her paint brushes in order to paint, though she was not physically able. Some of the last words she spoke as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> hospital window were “I wish I could paint those clouds”.|$|E
