50|$|The {{remains of}} Gayton's windmill, which stopped {{operating}} in 1860 {{and which is}} now converted into a house, can be seen close to the Devon Doorway Restaurant on Gayton Roundabout, a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> up Telegraph Road towards Heswall.|$|R
60|$|Reuben went up {{the stairs}} and made his way towards the window, {{standing}} a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back.</b> He could see no one moving about in the yard, and he was about to move close to it, when a tremendous crash took place below, followed by loud shouts. He ran downstairs again.|$|R
60|$|They {{were all}} {{willing to go}} after the deer, and having shut up the cabin and kicked out the campfire so that it might not set fire to the woods should a stiff breeze spring up, they set off on foot, taking to a deer trail, which ran a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> from the water's edge.|$|R
2500|$|After having {{moved over}} the Vaughan Road to within [...] of Dinwiddie Court House, Chamberlain's brigade marched a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> to the Quaker Road {{and led the}} Union advance north on that road, as Meade had ordered Warren. After leading the brigade about [...] north on Quaker Road, Chamberlain's skirmishers {{reported}} that the bridge over Gravelly Run had been destroyed and that Confederates were entrenched on the other side.|$|R
50|$|As mentioned, {{the rail}} {{consists}} of a precision crafted strip undercut to form a flattened T cross-section provided with crosswise slots at intervals interspersed with flats that allow accessories to be slid into place {{from the end of}} the rail then locked in place; slid into the slots between raised flats then moved a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> or forth or clamped to the rail with bolts, thumbscrews or levers (as per the Weaver system).|$|R
50|$|After having {{moved over}} the Vaughan Road to within 2 mi of Dinwiddie Court House, Chamberlain's brigade marched a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> to the Quaker Road {{and led the}} Union advance north on that road, as Meade had ordered Warren. After leading the brigade about 1.5 mi north on Quaker Road, Chamberlain's skirmishers {{reported}} that the bridge over Gravelly Run had been destroyed and that Confederates were entrenched on the other side.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he gave a}} cry of surprise, and to Rupert's astonishment {{left his}} side, and sprang through the crowd. With some {{difficulty}} {{he made his way}} to a young lady, who was standing with an elderly gentleman on some steps a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> from the crowd. She looked surprised at the approach of this British soldier, whose eyes were eagerly fixed on her; but not till Hugh stepped in front of her and spoke did she remember him.|$|R
60|$|After five minutes' walking Ned {{arrived at}} the market square and passed {{steadily}} down towards the south corner. The market was long since over, and the market folk had returned to their farms and villages, {{but there were a}} large number of people walking about. It was already growing dusk, and in another half hour would be dark. Ned turned when he got near the corner, strolled a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> and then turned again. He carefully abstained from seeming to stare about. The councillor and his clerk kept within a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> of him, the former wrapped up in a cloak with a high collar that almost concealed his face.|$|R
60|$|The {{moon was}} above the horizon when Kenwyne pulled up his horse to a walk {{opposite}} Allenwood Grange. The view from this point always appealed to the artist in Kenwyne. The level plain was broken here by steep, sandy rises crowned with jack-pines and clumps of poplar, and a shallow lake reached {{out into the open}} from their feet. A <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> from its shore, the Grange stood on a gentle slope, with a grove of birches that hid the stables and outbuildings straggling up the hill behind.|$|R
60|$|Now the Cydnus {{is a small}} stream, flowing by Tarsus, and {{it comes}} down from Mount Taurus at a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> from the city. Such streams are always very cold. Alexander was {{immediately}} seized with a very violent chill, and {{was taken out of}} the water shivering excessively, and, at length, fainted away. They thought he was dying. They bore him to his tent, and, as tidings of their leader's danger spread through the camp, the whole army, officers and soldiers, were thrown into the greatest consternation and grief.|$|R
50|$|A {{fountain}} and small manmade lake {{can be found}} in the middle of the infield. A small island of 5 palm trees on sand is in the middle of the lake, connected by a narrow bridge the <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> to the mainly grassy infield. There is a path which weaves through the middle of the infield, but it is not used very often, most often it is the photoshoot location for winners of major stakes races. Behind the winners circle there is a small warehouse type of building used for toteboard, lure, and gate electronic operations.|$|R
60|$|They set to work, and it {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} when, stripped to shirt and trousers and dripping with perspiration, Joe stopped for a few moments to look about. Thirty feet behind him the creek swirled furiously around a rocky head, the steep face of which was fumed and scarred by giant-powder. A stake was driven into the crest of the promontory, another could be seen a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back,</b> and straggling jack-pines and spruces followed the edge of the bank. The ground had been disturbed all round and was strewn with piles of soil and stones.|$|R
60|$|The king now {{determined}} {{to conquer the}} Palatinate, which was held by a Spanish army. He drove them before him {{until he reached the}} Rhine, where they endeavoured to defend the passage by burning every vessel and boat they could find, and for a time the advance of the Swedes was checked. It was now the end of November, the snow lay thick over the whole country, and the troops, without tents or covering, were bivouacked {{along the side of the}} river, two miles below Oppenheim. The opposite bank was covered with bushes to the water's edge, and on an eminence a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> could be seen the tents of the Spaniards.|$|R
60|$|The {{guns were}} wheeled up into {{positions}} between the infantry brigades. The troops were disposed in line, two deep; two companies of each battalion, with the stretchers and bearers, taking post at a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> farther <b>back,</b> {{to reinforce the}} front line if hardly pressed, and to supply it from the reserve store of ammunition.|$|R
60|$|After {{the meal}} they sallied out again, {{and walked to}} the tavern, which was a small place {{standing}} apart from other houses. There was a light in the taproom, but they guessed that here, as at the other stopping place, the man they wanted would be in a private apartment. Passing the house, they saw a light in a side window, and, noiselessly opening a little wicket gate, they stole into the garden. Going a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> from the window, so that the light should not show their faces, they looked in, and saw the man they sought sitting by the fire, with a table on which stood a bottle and two glasses beside him, and another man facing him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that," [...] Captain Vipon said. [...] "My idea is to put {{a man on the}} top of the cliff just above where the {{schooner}} is anchored. If she is lying there he is to light a fire a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> from the edge of the cliff. There should be another man {{on the top of the}} hill. When he sees the fire he shall show a lantern three times. We will return the signal to let him know that we see it. If the schooner goes away early in the evening the lookout is not to light the fire until he sees her returning, at whatever hour it may be. The moment we see the light we will set sail.' ...|$|R
60|$|Here, then, he waded ashore, stripped, tied {{his clothes}} in a bundle, waded a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> again, and dropped them in the sea. Then he returned, took up the bag, and carried it up the sandy beach. Opening it, he dressed himself in the {{complete}} set of clothes he had brought with him, put on the Spanish shoes and round turned-up hat, placed his money in his pocket; scraped a shallow hole in the sand, put the bag in it and covered it, and then started walking briskly along on the flat ground beyond the sand hills He kept on until he saw the first faint light in the sky; then he sat down among some bushes, until it was light {{enough for him to}} distinguish the features of the country.|$|R
60|$|As Esterbrook turned {{one of them}} he saw Magdalen {{standing}} out {{on the point of}} the next, a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> away. Her <b>back</b> was towards him, and her splendid figure was outlined darkly against the vivid sky.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in {{the smaller}} classes, the pair of works OSCAs had an ample lead of 15 laps over the {{struggling}} Porsches and running in the top-10 overall. Yet within ten minutes, with just 2 hours to go, everything fell apart. First, the leading one of Giardini crashed and rolled at Mulsanne, then the one running second hit the barriers at Dunlop curve. Pierre Leygonie ran the <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> to the pits to get equipment and advice from the pit-crew. He managed to get it going again {{and back to the}} pits to hand over to Lance Macklin but they were then disqualified at race-end for having abandoned the car. To round off a bitter race for OSCA, their last car was running second in the S-1100 class but its transmission broke in the final laps of the race.|$|R
50|$|Illinois 137 {{is called}} Buckley Road in the northwest-southeast segment, {{as well as}} the east - west segment east of Illinois Route 21 (Milwaukee Avenue). Between these segments, in {{northern}} Libertyville, business addresses use Peterson Road, however street signs name it Buckley Road, which continues west as Illinois 137 turns northwest. In North Chicago, at the east end of the Buckley Road alignment, the route turns north where it cuts Naval Station Great Lakes into two areas, and becomes Sheridan Road for most of its remaining length to the Wisconsin state line. The exception is the Amstutz Expressway, which runs from Sheridan Road near the southern border of Waukegan to Greenwood Avenue roughly 2 mi north, where the expressway abruptly ends; Illinois 137 follows Greenwood Avenue west a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> to Sheridan Road and continues north through Beach Park, Zion, and Winthrop Harbor before terminating at the state line. Sheridan Road continues north as Wisconsin Highway 32.|$|R
40|$|In {{traditional}} centrifugal microfluidic platforms pumping {{is restricted}} to outward fluid flow, resulting in potential real estate issues for embedding complex microsystems. To overcome the limitation, researchers utilize hydrophilic channels to force liquids <b>short</b> <b>distances</b> <b>back</b> toward the disk center. However, most polymers used for CD fabrication are natively hydrophobic, and creating hydrophilic conditions requires surface treatments/specialized materials that pose unique challenges to manufacturing and use. This work describes a novel technology that enjoys the advantages of hydrophilic fluidics on a hydrophobic disk device constructed from untreated polycarbonate plastic. The method, termed suction-enhanced siphoning, is based on exploiting the non-linear hydrostatic pressure profile and related pressure drop created {{along the length of}} a rotating microchannel. Theoretical analysis as well as experimental validation of the system is provided. In addition, we demonstrate the use of the hydrostatic pressure pump as a new method for priming hydrophobic-based siphon structures. The development of such techniques for hydrophobic fluidics advances the capabilities of the centrifugal microfluidic platform while remaining true to the goal of creating disposable polymer devices using feasible manufacturing schemes. close...|$|R
5000|$|The Milesians {{had to win}} {{the island}} by {{engaging}} in battle with the three kings, their druids and warriors. Amergin acted as an impartial judge for the parties, setting the rules of engagement. The Milesians agreed to leave the island and retreat a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> into the ocean beyond the ninth wave, a magical boundary. Upon a signal, they moved toward the beach, but the druids of the Tuatha Dé Danann raised a magical storm {{to keep them from}} reaching land. However, Amergin sang an invocation calling upon the spirit of Ireland that {{has come to be known}} as The Song of Amergin, and he was able to part the storm and bring the ship safely to land. There were heavy losses on all sides, with more than one major battle, but the Milesians carried the day. The three kings of the Tuatha Dé Danann were each killed in single combat by three of the surviving sons of Míl, Eber Finn, Érimón and Amergin. In her Gods and Fighting Men (1904), Augusta, Lady Gregory translates The Song of Amergin as such: ...|$|R

50|$|Just inside Lynchburg, SR 50 becomes Main Street for a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> {{before turning}} <b>back</b> {{southeast}} as Winchester Highway. It becomes Lynchburg Road and crosses the Elk River just below Tims Ford Dam; the dam is {{visible from the}} highway. Passing south of Tims Ford Lake, SR 50 continues into Winchester. This section of SR 50 between Lynchburg and Winchester is popular with area motorcyclists and sports car drivers due to its sinuousness.|$|R
50|$|Jack snipe can be secretive {{in their}} non-breeding areas and are {{difficult}} to observe, being well camouflaged in their habitat. Consequently, birdwatchers have developed a specialised technique for finding them. This involves walking through its marshy habitat until a bird is disturbed and flies up. Jack snipe will squat down and not flush from cover until an intruder is quite close. They then quietly fly a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> before dropping <b>back</b> into vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{trigger guard}} on the Model 1839 Carbine is an oval {{in shape and}} {{features}} a [...] "rearward spur" [...] that continues {{along the bottom of}} the stock a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> before curling <b>back</b> forming a small open circle. [...] The Model 1839 is distinguished from the larger Ring Lever rifles by the lack of a ring lever in front of the trigger guard and the presence of an external hammer. Cocking the external hammer back rotates the cylinder to the next position.|$|R
25|$|Wiman {{wanted to}} extend the line to Saint George so {{that all of the}} {{branches}} now under the company's control could meet in one place with the ferries to Manhattan. However, there was a problem: over most of the course of the line, it had followed the shore, along the bluffs, where ground had to be made upon to build the road. State laws were not able to grant the right to run a railroad through the property of the United States, and as a result, construction was hindered by the grounds of the lighthouse department just above Tompkinsville. The company, however, secured an act of congress permitting them to push a tunnel through the hill a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>back</b> from the shore. The grant for the tunnel was surrounded with restrictions that made slow progress inevitable. Construction of the tunnel began in 1885. The tunnel was five hundred and eighty five feet long, and was protected by massive walls of masonry on the sides, and an arch of brick two feet in thickness overhead. It was wide enough to fit two trains side by side at a time. The cost of the project was $190,000. On November 16, 1884, Wiman, James M. Davis, Sir Roderick Cameron, Herman Clark, and Louis de Jonge incorporated the Saint George Improvement Company in order to handle the land and waterfront, which was recently purchased from the estate of George Law. The new company was to handle the building of a new terminal for ferries at Saint George.|$|R
25|$|CR104 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with CR80 (Montauk Highway) {{in the town}} of Quogue. The route heads to the northwest as Quogue–Riverhead Road, a two-lane residential roadway though Quogue. After the junction with Scrub Oak Road, CR104 passes the dead end of Station Road and crosses under the Long Island Rail Road's Montauk Branch, passing a large industrial area north of the tracks. Intersecting with Old Country Road, CR104 bends northward and becomes a two-lane residential arterial once again. After this change, the route enters East Quogue, which consists of some farms and a junction with Lewis Road, where CR104 turns to the northwest once again. The route curves northward once again, entering interchange 64N and 64S of the Sunrise Highway (NY27). CR104 expands to four lanes for a <b>short</b> <b>distance,</b> merging <b>back</b> to two after the interchange.|$|R
500|$|M-311 follows 11 Mile Road between M-60 and I-94. In {{the village}} of Burlington, M-311 is known as Marshall Street. There is a jog in 11 Mile Road as it runs northwesterly between Q Drive and O Drive. At N Drive, M-311/11 Mile Road turns along N Drive a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> before turning <b>back</b> northward. Near D Drive, 11 Mile Road passes [...] Hyde Lake. M-311 crosses the Kalamazoo River just south of I-94. All of M-311 is two-lane, rural highway in forest lands and farm fields, {{and none of it}} is listed on the National Highway System.|$|R
50|$|When {{the pilgrims}} leave Mar Saba, they take Lesbos and Agath with them. After a <b>short</b> <b>distance,</b> Lesbos turns <b>back</b> {{and returns to}} the monastery, giving the pilgrims a {{military}} salute. Ungar, a new traveling companion, joins the company. A veteran of the American Civil War, he is descended from Catholic colonists and American Indians, and is the only one among them with faith. This new group travels to Bethlehem together. Once in Bethlehem, Agath leaves to join a new caravan. The remaining pilgrims pay Djaleal and Belex for their services in guiding them through the desert.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Wednesday, Maggie went {{with others to}} the prayer meeting at the black church near Russellville. Returning, Blair passed on persons who {{had been to the}} church service. He headed on to Russellville after some conversation but after going a <b>short</b> <b>distance,</b> turned <b>back</b> and took another road where the young people, including Maggie, had taken. He overtook the party and immediately walked up to his stepdaughter, who was walking in the rear with a black boy named Taylor. Pushing Taylor away, he caught her hand and said: [...] "You must go home with me on the train tonight to your grandpa", and pulled her along the road 150 to 200 yards, saying she should go. Maggie struggled to loosen herself from his grasp, saying she would rather die than go, whereupon he drew a pistol and shot her twice. She died the following Saturday, aged 16.|$|R
