5|$|Harmison prospered in Hampshire County, {{acquiring}} additional {{land and}} enlarging his Valley View estate. He later gave this acquired land {{to his children}} to establish their own homes when they married. In 1884, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad completed its South Branch, connecting the main line at Green <b>Spring</b> <b>to</b> Romney; this branch bisected the Valley View property. Charles Harmison lived at Valley View until his death on October31, 1896.|$|E

5|$|The Liliaceae are ecologically diverse. Species of Liliaceae bloom {{at various}} times from <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> late summer. The {{colorful}} flowers produce large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract insects which pollinate them (entomophily), particularly bees and wasps (hymenopterophily), butterflies (psychophily) and moths (phalaenophily). The seeds are dispersed by wind and water. Some species (e.g. Scoliopus, Erythronium and Gagea) have seeds with an aril structure that are dispersed by ants (myrmecochory).|$|E
5|$|There are two campgrounds in the park, North Campground and Sunset Campground. Loop A in North Campground is open year-round.

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum is {{most common}} in rich, mixed upland forests.

5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E

5|$|As autumn approaches, Teran takes {{advantage}} of Sea Mither's exhaustion to break free, and conflict between the two starts again. The power struggles cause the weather to change with darkening skies and howling winds. This time, Teran triumphs in the conflict termed the Gore vellye. Control {{of the ocean and}} weather is returned to Teran and Sea Mither is forced to leave. No details are given as to where she spends the winter, but during the storms caused by Teran the fishermen were consoled that Sea Mither would return refreshed and powerful in the <b>spring,</b> <b>to</b> again oust Teran from his malevolent grip over the seas.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} debt to Pit, Dark Pit takes him to the Rewind Spring so time can be {{reversed}} for Pit's body. On his journey there, he, Palutena, and Viridi learn that Hades has been profiting off the wars against the Underworld Army, Forces of Nature, Aurum, and Chaos Kin by using the souls of slaughtered humans to add numbers to his forces. Upon arrival at the Rewind Spring, Pandora is revived due to the Spring's effects on her stolen powers within Dark Pit. Pandora then uses the <b>Spring</b> <b>to</b> restore her health and ultimately her physical body, but is still defeated by Dark Pit.|$|E

5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has five}} front-country {{vehicular}} access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, {{and each has}} 350campsites which can accommodate large recreational vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta {{grows on}} sandy soil in Temperate {{coniferous}} forest and occasionally in deciduous woodlands. Among conifers {{it is mostly}} found under pines (Pinus spp.), but also sometimes under aspen (Populus spp.). The hunting period is from April to July, earlier than for other species, and the fungus may even sprout up with the melting snow. It can be abundant in some years and rare in others. The mushroom is more commonly found in places where ground has been disturbed, such as openings, rivulets, washes, timber clearings, plowed openings, forest fire clearings, and roadsides. Enthusiasts in Finland have been reported burying newspaper inoculated with the fungus in the ground in autumn and returning the following <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> collect mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Harrya chromapes is an ectomycorrhizal species, and its fruit bodies grow singly to {{scattered}} on soil. They are usually found in forests containing conifers, Betulaceae and oak in North America. The North American distribution includes eastern Canada south to Georgia and Alabama, including Mexico. It extends west to Michigan and Mississippi. The fruit season extends from late <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> late summer. In Costa Rica, where the species associates with oak, {{it has been}} recorded from the Cordillera Talamanca, the Poás and Irazu Volcano. It is also in Guatemala. In Asia, it is known from India (West Bengal), Taiwan, Japan, and in China, where it associates with trees from the beech and pine families.|$|E

5|$|He {{provided}} new fronts {{to the two}} official {{buildings of}} Rome's civic government, the Palazzo dei Conservatori, the Senatorio, and finally the Nuovo. Michelangelo designed a new façade for the dilapidated Palazzo dei Conservatori and he designed the Palazzo Nuovo to be a mirror complement, thereby providing balance and coherence to the ragged ensemble of existing structures. The construction of these two buildings were carried out after his death {{under the supervision of}} Tommaso Cavalieri. The sole arched motif in the entire Campidoglio design is the segmental pediments over their windows, which give a slight <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> the completely angular vertical-horizontal balance of the design. The three palazzi are now home to the Capitoline Museums.|$|E
5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) {{occurs in the}} late summer, and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being born the following <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> summer. The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Leotia lubrica favours damp {{deciduous}} woodland, but {{can also}} be found under conifers. Particular favoured habitats include path sides and underneath bracken, while favoured substrates include soil, moss and plant waste, where it feeds as a saprotroph. Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe, and from late <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> autumn in North America, where it is the most common Leotia species. It has also been recorded in eastern Asia, in China and Tibet, as well as in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
