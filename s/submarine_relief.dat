40|$|A {{nautical}} chart {{is a kind}} of map used to describe the seafloor morphology and shoreline of adjacent lands. One of its main purposes is to guarantee safety of navigation. As a consequence, the construction of a {{nautical chart}} follows very specific rules. The cartographer has to select and highlight undersea features according to their relevance to navigation. In an automated process, the system must be able to identify and classify these features from the terrain model. This paper aims therefore to define ontologies of the <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> and nautical chart that will be at the root of a model-oriented generalization process. To the best of our knowledge, no ontology has been defined to formalize the geographical and cartographic objects for nautical chart representation. Thus, a bottom-up approach was developed to extract and model knowledge derived from standards established by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and cartographers’ expertise. The <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> ontology formalizes undersea features describing the <b>submarine</b> <b>relief.</b> Four concepts (composition, morphometric class, shape value and depth value) are introduced to describe properties and relationships between undersea features. The cartographic representation ontology of nautical charts will define several concepts (chart, features, isobathymetric lines and soundings) for the representation of undersea features on the chart.

The major tectogenetic peculiarities of island morphostructure and its littoral morpho-sculpture include: the morphotectonic alignment of small groups of islands as well as their internal morpho-sculptural features; the appearance and alignment of abrasive rock outcrop ranges; the littoral´s parallel and interrupted alignment; the tectonic control of the coastal configuration and its accidents derived from the orthogonal design of the prevailing NW-SE and NE-SW diagonal disjunctive systems; tombolos development by faulting parallel to the coastline and uprising of small contiguous island blacks; ample distribution of microbays and microinlets generated by a high faulting density and parallel transversal cracking, the diffusion of concave shell-shaped coasts of a cumulative and biogenic nature between discreet abrasive projections; and the presence of alternating horst and graben systems as a conditioning factor for the alternation of abrasive (ends, capes and promontories) and cumulative coasts (beaches, marshes and mangroves) or inlets and bays.

A {{possible}} {{mechanism to}} explain the correlation between submarine topography and the direct sunlight specially reflected from the sea surface with variable roughness caused by the bottom-current effect was suggested fifteen years ago by Henning et al. in International Journal of Remote Sensing, 9, 45 - 67, after comparing radar satellite image and Skylab satellite photograph of the North American east coast (Nantucket Shoals) with <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> features. A case study is {{carried out in the}} famous sand waves field located at the Taiwan banks of Taiwan Strait in August 1998. The TM images, either visible bands (TM 1, TM 2, TN 3) or near infrared bands (TM 4, TM 5, TN 17), shows <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> features for sand waves, with wavelength of 300 to 2000 meters, riding on the lager scale sand ridges and channel system. Sea truth data including 660 nm beam attenuation coefficient profiles were conducted in the same period. We compare signals of TM images, attenuation coefficient profiles, and sounding maps of the Taiwan Bands. The subsurface upwelling signals with contributions of the water column and the bottom, either estimated by single or quasi-single-scattering theory or revealed by the TM images after removing the contribution of direct sunlight reflected signals from sea surface, were too week to distinguish the ridges and troughs of bedforms especially for red and near infrared bands. However, the direct sunlight specially reflected signals from the sea surface, approximately at same level in water-leaving reflectance not only for visible bands (TM 1, TM 2, TM 3) but also for near infrared bands (TM 4, TM 5, TN 17), was the major submarine bottom topography signals especially for those pixels towards the direction of the sun azimuth. Following a physical description for the lee waves appeared on free surface when the current flows round an underwater obstacle, the direct sunlight reflected signals related wave face slope, is dominated by the height and depth of sand waves and sand ridges, and current speed of the flows over those bedforms. The direct sunlight reflected signals from the sea surface could be regarded as a powerful tool to detect bedforms and other underwater obstacles...|$|E

In a contexte of coastal management and global change, these measures are used {{as a base for}} evolution scenarii. The past evolution of the coastal landform may give some good information about the best extrapolation technique for the future. On some precise site (such as Portugal or western France) geological evolution of the shore line is well known and various rates of retreat may be calculated for different time span. No linear extrapolation of present day rates succeeds in explaining past rates of retreat. A model of a non linear erosion rate has, then, to be coupled with a geomorphological model of the evolution of the erosional landform. It is suspected, from filed work evidences, that a non linear evolution of landform is linked with a scale dependant process.

This, in its turn, provides a means for purposeful, scientifically-substantiated prospecting, exploration and development of the mineral resources of the ocean. The Atlantic Ocean has been geologically and geophysically studied to a great extent and many years of investigating its floor have revealed the laws governing the structure of the major forms of its <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> (e. g., the continental shelf, the continental slope, the transition zones, the ocean bed, and the Mid-Oceanic Ridge).

Terrigenous influ-ence represents the main factor responsible for clay deposition in the Nankai Trough and Japan Trench, both marked by proximity to Japan, high <b>submarine</b> <b>relief,</b> and high sedimentation rates. The argillaceous diagenesis is of local or minor importance and includes the readjustment of fleecy to lathed smectites. The volcanic influence consists chiefly of a re-working of smectite developed by subaerial alteration of island arc rocks and secondarily of a local alteration of ash beds. The late Cenozoic clay sedimentation in the Nankai Trough (Sites 582 and 583) underwent a major change during the early Pleistocene. Hemipelagic sediments characterized by {{a wide range of}} minerals, derived from various sources charac-terizing the whole northern Philippine Sea (Leg 58 data), were replaced by turbiditic sediments with clay associations typical of a restricted southern Japanese origin (chiefly illite and chlorite). The mineralogic transition, which roughly parallels the lithologic one, occurs by short successive steps. It appears to express indirectly the tectonic activity of the southern margin of Japan, marked by the subduction of the Shikoku Basin and the formation of the Nankai Trough.

40|$|The ongoing unrest at the Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc) in {{southern}} Italy is prompting exploration of its poorly studied offshore sector. We {{report on a}} multidisciplinary investigation of the Secca delle Fumose (SdF), a <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> known since antiquity as the largest degassing structure of the offshore sector of CFc. We combined high-resolution morphobathymetric and seismostratigraphic data with onshore geological information to propose that the present-day SdF morphology and structure developed during {{the initial stages of}} the last CFc eruption at Monte Nuovo in AD 1538. We suggest that the SdF relief stands on the eastern uplifted border of a N-S-trending graben-like structure formed during the shallow emplacement of the Monte Nuovo feeding dike. We also infer that the high-angle bordering faults that generated the SdF relief now preferentially allow the ascent of hot brines (with an equilibrium temperature of 179 °C), thereby sustaining hydrothermal degassing on the seafloor. Systematic vertical seawater profiling shows that hydrothermal seafloor venting generates a sizeable CO 2, pH, and temperature anomaly in the overlying seawater column. Data for the seawater vertical profile can be used to estimate the CO 2 and energy (heat) outputs from the SdF area at ∼ 50 tons/d (∼ 0. 53 kg/s) and ∼ 80 MW, respectively. In view of the cause-effect relationship with the Monte Nuovo eruption, and the substantial gas and energy outputs, we consider that the SdF hydrothermal system needs to be included in monitoring programs of the ongoing CFc unrest...|$|E

40|$|The Ontong Java, Manihiki, and Shatsky oceanic {{plateaus}} {{are among}} the Earth’s largest igneous provinces and are commonly believed to have erupted rapidly during the surfacing of giant heads of initiating mantle plumes. We investigate this hypothesis by using sediment descriptions of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drill cores to constrain plateau subsidence histories which reflect mantle thermal and crustal accretionary processes. We find that total plateau subsidence is comparable to that expected of normal seafloor but less than predictions of thermal models of hotspot-affected lithosphere. If crustal emplacement was rapid, then uncertainties in paleo-water depths allow for the anomalous subsidence predicted for plumes with only moderate temperature anomalies and volumes, comparable to the sources of modern-day hotspots such as Hawaii and Iceland. Rapid emplacement over a plume head of high temperature and volume, however, is difficult to reconcile with the subsidence reconstructions. An alternative possibility that reconciles low subsidence over a high-temperature, high-volume plume source is a scenario in which plateau subsidence is the superposition of (1) subsidence due to the cooling of the plume source, and (2) uplift due to prolonged crustal growth {{in the form of}} magmatic underplating. This prolonged crustal growth and uplift scenario may explain the low and thus <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> during plume initiation, the late stage eruptions found on Ontong Java (90 Ma) and Manihiki (70 Ma), {{a large portion of the}} high-seismic-velocity lower crust, and the widespread normal faults observed throughout and alon...|$|E
40|$|The {{technical}} {{details of}} drilling and coring at the Kirchrode I and II sites are presented. At these sites, {{a sequence of}} claystones and marlstones from an Albian shelf basin was recovered. Constraints on {{the ages of the}} sediments in the two boreholes are provided by the occurrence of the inoceramid bivalve Actinoceramus sulcatus, the first appearance of which is used to define the Middle/Upper Albian boundary and by observed facies changes that can be correlated to the established lithostratigraphy. The cores from the two boreholes provide a rather complete, 285 -m-long sequence of the Upper Albian, with a 155. 5 -m-long overlap. Analysis of the tectonic structures showed considerable shortening in the Middle and Lower Albian part of the sequence due to normal faulting. Of the Upper Albian, only the lowermost part is affected by faults. The increase in sedimentation rates of terrigenous detritus and of marine biogenic carbonate, which occurs in the basal part of the C. auritus Subzone, is interpreted to reflect a regional change to a more humid climate and regional tectonic movements (uplift of the Rhenish Bohemian massif, subsidence of the Lower Saxony basin intensified locally by halokinetic movements). The further increase in marine productivity in the latest Albian may be related to upwelling of more nutrient-rich deep water along <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> in this shelf sea. Identification of Milankovitch cyclicity documented by the fluctuating CaCO 3 contents of the sediments is used (i) to constrain the minimum time represented by the Upper Albian deposits, and (ii) to determine the duration of the sea level cycles (Cycle V: >= 1. 6 Ma, Cycle VI: >= 2 Ma), and (iii) to establish the duration of the Late Albian ammonite subzones (e. g. Callihoplites auritus Subzone: 2. 1 Ma). Average sedimentation rates determined from the identified 100 -ka eccentricity cycles show a stepwise increase in sedimentation rates from 1 - 2 cm/ 1000 a in the Lower Albian dark claystones to 7 - 13 cm/ 1000 a in the late Late Albian. In addition to the general deepening trend through the Late Albian, two, nearly completely documented 3 rd-order sea-level cycles in the Upper Albian of Kirchrode I were recognised, plus another one, cut short by faulting, {{at the base of the}} Upper Albian (documented in Kirchrode II). These global sea-level cycles were identified on the basis (a) of the sequence of the abundance maxima of selected benthos and plankton groups, (b) of trends in the fluctuations of the CaCO 3 content, and (c) of the abundance of glauconite. The transgression periods in this Upper Albian deep shelf-basin are characterised by intensified circulation. This intensified circulation is found to have affected first the surface-near waters, resulting e. g. in an increase in the abundance of immigrant plankton and nekton species from the Tethys. At a later stage the deep water was affected, supporting then an increased population of suspension-feeding benthos, and causing condensation and erosion in the sediment at the sea floor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOna Basin {{is a small}} intra-oceanic basin {{located in}} the southwestern corner of the Scotia Sea. This region is crucial for an {{understanding}} of the early phases of opening of Drake Passage, since it may contain the oldest oceanic crust of the entire western Scotia Sea, where conflicting age differences from Eocene to Oligocene have been proposed to date. The precise timing of the gateway opening between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, moreover, has significant paleoceanographic and global implications. Two sub-basins are identified in this region, the eastern and western Ona basins, separated by the <b>submarine</b> <b>relief</b> of the Ona High. A dense geophysical data set collected during the last two decades is analyzed here. The data include multichannel seismic reflection profiles, and magnetic and gravimetric data. The oceanic basement is highly deformed by normal, reverse and transcurrent faults, as well as affected by deep intrusions from the mantle. The initial extension and continental thinning, with subsequent oceanic spreading, were followed by compression and thrusting. Several elongated troughs, bounded by faults, depict a thick sequence of depositional units in the basin. Eight seismic units are identified in a deep trough of the eastern Ona Basin. The deposits reach a thickness of 5 km, a consistent value not previously reported from the Scotia Sea. A body of chaotic seismic facies is also observed above the thinned continental crust of the Ona High. Magnetic seafloor anomalies older than C 10 (~ 28. 5 Ma) may be present in the region. The anomalies could include up to chron C 12 r (~ 32 Ma), although their identification is difficult, since the amplitude is subdued and the original oceanic crust was highly deformed by later faulting and thrusting. The magnetic anomaly distribution is not congruent with seafloor spreading from a single ridge. The basin plain is tilted and subducted southwestward below the South Shetland Islands Block, particularly in the western part, where an accretionary prism is identified. Such tectonics, locally affecting up to the most recent deposits, imply that a portion of the primitive oceanic crust is absent. Based on the stratigraphy of the deposits and the magnetic anomalies, an age of 44 Ma is postulated for the initiation of oceanic spreading in the eastern Ona basin, while spreading in the western Ona Basin would have occurred during the early Oligocene. The tectonics, depositional units and the age of the oceanic crust provide additional evidence regarding the Eocene opening of Drake Passage. The initial tectonic fragmentation of the South America–Antarctic Bridge, followed by oceanic spreading, was characterized by jumping of the spreading centers. An Eocene spreading center in the eastern Ona Basin was the precursor of the Scotia Sea. A model comprising four tectonic evolutionary phases is proposed: Phase I, Pacific subduction — Paleocene to middle Eocene; Phase II, eastern Ona back-arc spreading — middle to late Eocene; Phase III, ridge jumping and western Ona back-arc spreading — early Oligocene; and Phase IV, ridge jumping and West Scotia Ridge spreading — early Oligocene to late Miocene. The development of shallow gateways allowed for an initial connection between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and, hence, initiated the thermal isolation of Antarctica during the middle and late Eocene. Deep gateways that enhanced the full isolation of Antarctica developed in Drake Passage from the Eocene/Oligocene transition onward. A significant correlation is observed between the tectonics, stratigraphic units and major climate events, thereby indicating the influence of the local tectonic and paleoceanographic events of the Southern Ocean on global evolution...|$|E

They Occur in the transition zone between that basin and the adjacent Provence platform and correspond to various erosion marks, oriented biogenic remains (sponge spicules, belemnite rostra) and trace fossil directions (Rhizocorallium). Three local current orientations occur : 1) a westward orientation in the neritic zone, probably resulting from the trade winds that prevailed in the Tethyan domain; 2) a northward orientation in the deeper hemipelagic and pelagic zones probably resulting from a deviation of the westward Currents by the Coriolis force; 3) a southward orientation in the eastern and western margins of the studied area, possibly induced by upwellings resulting from offshore northward deviated currents. These upwellings were characterized by cold ater enriched with silica, phosphorous and organic matter. Some characteristics of the Early Aptian unconformity surface re suit from these different currents : 1) {{a specific type of}} erosion linked to mechanical and/or chemical features, 2) all erosion intensity displayed by the importance of the pre-Aptian stratigraphic gaps, 3) an erosion duration illustrated by the importance of the post-Aptian gaps.

Its northwestern flank (south facing of the Alboran Ridge) shows up to 1100 m in height and a steep and lineal slope (5 to 35 º). in the southeast, the Tres Forcas Promontory shows up to 860 m in height and a smooth slope (1. 5 to 2. 7 º) related to plastered contouritic deposits; and in the West, the Cabliers Bank is up to 740 m in height showing an irregular slope (up to 10 º). Seismic stratigraphy analysis of airgun high-resolution profiles, calibrated with ODP Site 979, reveals the SAB has been filled since Miocene times, showing the major sedimentation during the Pliocene and Quaternary, when the main tectonic uplift of their borders occurs. An angular unconformity, intra Pliocene in age, defines a break in the Alboran Ridge uplift however continued along Quaternary. The basin infill is controlled during these times by the interplay between countouritic and mass movement processes whose onset and occurrence is governed by the tectonics generated reliefs. At least seven main MMDs have been recognized by their transparent to chaotic seismic facies from Lower Pliocene to Quaternary times. Their number and distribution varies during the Pliocene-Quaternary through the basin, but two major sedimentary instability episodes occurred during the Lower Pliocene (3 MMDs with a recurrence of 0. 56 My) and the Middle Pleistocene to present (4 MMDs with a recurrence of 0. 225 My). These two episodes could be correspond to the Lower Pliocene main uplift of SAB borders and the Quaternary reactivation of tectonics structuresPeer Reviewe...|$|R
