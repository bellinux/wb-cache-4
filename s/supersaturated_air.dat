Our theory reveals a new instability mechanism in free dendrite growth, which arises when electrically enhanced diffusion near the dendrite tip overwhelms the stabilizing influence of surface tension. This phenomenon is closely related to the growth instability responsible for the visualization of charged particle tracks in cloud chambers, and is expected for enhanced diffusion of neutral molecules, but not for the case of ionic diffusion. Above a threshold applied potential, the crystal growth can no longer be described by the usual solvability theory, and requires a new physical mechanism to limit the growth velocity.

40|$|Cassie'' {{state of}} wetting can be {{established}} by trapping air pockets on the crevices of textured hydrophobic surfaces, leading to significant drag reduction. However, this drag reduction cannot be sustained due to gradual dissolution of trapped air into water. In this paper, we explore the possibility of sustaining the underwater Cassie state of wetting in a microchannel by controlling the solubility of air in water; the solubility being changed by controlling the local absolute pressure near the surface. We show that using this method, we can in fact make the water locally <b>supersaturated</b> with <b>air</b> thus encouraging the growth of trapped air pockets on the surface. In this case, the water acts as a pumping medium, delivering air to the crevices of the hydrophobic surface in the microchannel, where the presence of air pockets is most beneficial from the drag reduction perspective. In our experiments, the air trapped on a textured surface is visualized using total internal reflection based technique, at different local absolute pressures with the pressure drop (or drag) also being simultaneously measured. We find that, by controlling the pressure and hence the solubility close to the surface, we can either shrink or grow the trapped air bubbles, uniformly over a large surface area. The experiments show that, by precisely controlling the pressure and hence the solubility we can sustain the `'Cassie state'' over extended periods of time. This method thus provides a means of getting sustained drag reduction from a textured hydrophobic surface in channel flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a technique {{for measuring the}} water vapor supersaturation of normal air over a temperature range of â€“ 40 <~T<~ 0 Â°C. The measurements use an inexpensive commercial hygrometer {{which is based on}} a thin-film capacitive sensor. The time required for the sensor to reach equilibrium was found to increase exponentially with decreasing sensor temperature, exceeding 2 min for T = â€“ 30 Â°C; however, the water vapor sensitivity of the device remained high down to this temperature. After calibrating our measurement procedure, we found residual scatter in the data corresponding to an uncertainty in the absolute water vapor pressure of about Â± 15 %. This scatter was due mainly to long-term drift, which appeared to be intrinsic to the capacitive thin-film sensor. The origin of this drift is not clear, but it effectively limits the applicability of this instrument for absolute measurements. We also found, however, that the high sensitivity of the thin-film sensor makes it rather well suited for differential measurements.

40|$|The {{formation}} of CO 2 ice {{clouds in the}} upper atmosphere of Mars has been suggested in the past {{on the basis of}} a few temperature profiles exhibiting portions colder than CO 2 frost point. However, the corresponding clouds were never observed. In this paper, we discuss the detection of the highest clouds ever observed on Mars by the SPICAM ultraviolet spectrometer on board Mars Express spacecraft. Analyzing stellar occultations, we detected several mesospheric detached layers at about 100 km in the southern winter subtropical latitudes, and found that clouds formed where simultaneous temperature measurements indicated that CO 2 was highly supersaturated and probably condensing. Further analysis of the spectra reveals a cloud opacity in the subvisible range and ice crystals smaller than 100 nm in radius. These layers are therefore similar in nature as the noctilucent clouds which appear on Earth in the polar mesosphere. We interpret these phenomena as CO 2 ice clouds forming inside <b>supersaturated</b> pockets of <b>air</b> created by upward propagating thermal waves. This detection of clouds in such an ultrararefied and supercold atmosphere raises important questions about the martian middle-atmosphere dynamics and microphysics.

40|$|A parcel and a {{one-dimensional}} {{model are}} used to investigate the temperature dependence of ice crystal number density. The number of ice crystals initially formed in a cold cirrus cloud is very sensitive to the nucleation mechanism and the detailed history of cooling rates during nucleation. A possible small spread in the homogeneous freezing threshold due to varying particle composition is identified as a sensitive nucleation parameter. In a parcel model, the slow growth rate of ice crystals at low temperatures inherently leads to a strong increase in ice number density at low temperatures. This temperature dependence is not observed. The model temperature dependence occurs {{for a wide range}} of assumptions and for either homogeneous or, less strongly, heterogeneous freezing. However, the parcel model also shows that random temperature fluctuations result in an extremely wide range of ice number densities. A one-dimensional model is used to show that the rare temperature trajectories resulting in the lowest number densities are disproportionately important. Low number density ice crystals sediment and influence a large volume of air. When such fall streaks are included, the ice number becomes less sensitive to the details of nucleation than it is in a parcel model. The one-dimensional simulations have a more realistic temperature dependence than the parcel mode. The one-dimensional model also produces layers with vertical dimensions of meters even if the temperature forcing has a much broader vertical wavelength. Unlike warm clouds, cirrus clouds are frequently surrounded by <b>supersaturated</b> <b>air.</b> Sedimentation through <b>supersaturated</b> <b>air</b> increases the importance of any process that produces small numbers of ice crystals.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A nested mating {{experiment}} in which 20 males were each mated to four different females {{was used to}} obtain {{an estimate of the}} heritability of resistance to death from gas bubble disease in Columbia River fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Heritability estimates ranged from 0. 037 to 0. 038. Bioassays in 127 percent <b>air</b> <b>supersaturated</b> water were used to compare the inherent resistance to gas bubble disease of selected Columbia and Trask River stocks of juvenile fall chinook salmon. In the first of two comparative bioassays, time to 50 percent mortality in offspring from adults obtained at Little Goose Dam on the Snake River was more than twice as great as that in offspring from adults obtained from the Trask River. In the second experiment, no significant difference in resistance to death from gas bubble disease was found among several lower Columbia River stocks of fall chinook; however, the average resistance of these stocks was significantly greater than that of Trask River fall chinook. A population model which incorporated response to selection for increased resistance to gas bubble disease was used to predict the numbers of fall chinook returning in the future to Kalama Hatchery. It was found that smolt survival can be expected to show a maximum increase of five to ten percent after 30 years of selection.

40|$|D. Ing. The use of {{dissolved}} air flotation (DAF) as a water clarification process has gained momentum {{over the past two}} decades. Despite its increased application {{there is a lack of}} information concerning the understanding of the underlying principles of the process. Plants are being designed based mainly on empirical guidelines, especially with respect to the bubble production system. Bubbles are generated in the DAF process when water, <b>supersaturated</b> with <b>air</b> under pressure, is released under atmospheric conditions. The efficiency of air dissolution and precipitation determines the quantity of air available for flotation and thus, to a large extent, the success of the whole DAF process. The first part of this thesis deals with a rational model for predicting the air transfer efficiency in packed saturators which are used in most modern DAF plants to dissolve air into water. The model assumes the Lewis-Whitman two-film theory for interfacial mass transfer and uses the Onda correlations to estimate the mass transfer coefficient. The model provides good insight into the effects of key design parameters on the air transfer efficiency. The experimental verification of the model required a method for predicting the saturator air composition and a technique to practically determine the air transfer efficiency in the packed bed of an operating saturator. Both methods are described in detail in this study. The verification of the mass transfer model showed a close agreement of experimental and theoretical results and the model thus provides a powerful tool for the design of packed saturators. The second part of the thesis deals with air precipitation and the quantity of air released after depressurization. Based on a literature review on this subject it was assumed that the air release is incomplete and that it would be a function of the operating conditions of the saturation system as well as of the design of the injection nozzle across which the pressure is released. Since the injection nozzles play an important role in the DAF process numerous experiments were carried out which measured the released air volume for different nozzle configurations and saturator pressures. The results of this study showed that the air release after depressurization is indeed incomplete and that it takes a long time for all the excess air to come out of solution. It was found that the efficiency with which the air was released is a function of the saturator pressure and the nozzle design. The experimental observations led to the formulation of a two-step air release model, which explains the precipitation process in terms of a slow and fast release step. The mathematical framework for quantification of the model is provided. Once the model is quantified it will be possible to compare the performance of different injection nozzles solely with regard to their design features and independent of any parameters influencing the air release downstream of the nozzle. This model may then help to further the understanding of the precipitation process and could lead to the development of some rational guidelines for nozzle design and prediction of nozzle performance...|$|R

Contrail ice particles grow by uptake of humidity from ambient ice <b>supersaturated</b> <b>air</b> masses. By sedimentation, contrails contribute to dehydration of the upper troposphere and to humidity increases at lower levels. After advection in rising or subsiding air masses, contrail may release water at places higher or lower than where the contrail formed. The dehydration may reduce natural cloudiness and, hence, partly offset positive radiative forcing from contrail cirrus (Burkhardt and KÃ¤rcher, 2011). LES show thinner contrails when they overlap with others (UnterstraÃŸer and SÃ¶lch, 2012). The coupled CoCiP-CAM model simulates all individual contrails forming globally using a Lagrangian contrail model. The coupling accounts for conservation of humidity during contrail formation and sublimation. In the coarse global model, local changes in humidity from contrail formation become notable only when many contrails form. The simulated contrails agree well with observations. The amount of water stored inside contrails is 1 million times larger than the amount of water emitted. Contrail ice particles sediment typically 700 m.

This results that the fill Merkel number or transfer characteristic for cross-counter flow is between that of purely counter- and crossflow fills. When using CFD to model natural draught wet-cooling tower performance for isotropic fill resistance, two- or three-dimensional models are therefore required to determine fill performance. In this paper, the governing fundamental partial differential equations are derived in cylindrical and Cartesian co-ordinates to determine the cooling water temperature, water evaporation rate, air temperature and air humidity ratio in two-dimensional cross-counterflow fills for both saturated and <b>supersaturated</b> <b>air.</b> To solve these equations, a relation is proposed to determine Merkel numbers for oblique air flows by linear interpolation and extrapolation of purely cross- and counterflow Merkel numbers {{in terms of the}} air flow angle. This model is compared to analytical Merkel numbers obtained for different air flow angles using a single drop trajectory model. A linear upwind computational model and an Eulerian FLUENTÂ® model are developed to evaluate fill performance characteristics from test data and to model fill performance in cooling towers respectively. The results of these two models are compared and verified with a FLUENTÂ® Euler-Lagrange model. Â© 2010 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|We {{apply the}} match technique, whereby the same air mass is {{observed}} {{more than once}} and such cases are termed a "match", to study the dehydration process associated with horizontal advection in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) over the western Pacific. The matches are obtained from profile data taken by the Soundings of Ozone and Water in the Equatorial Region (SOWER) campaign network observations using isentropic trajectories calculated from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational analyses. For the matches identified, extensive screening procedures are performed to verify the representativeness of the air parcel and {{the validity of the}} isentropic treatment, and to check for possible water injection by deep convection, consistency between the sonde data and analysis field referring to the ozone conservation. Among the matches that passed the screening tests, we identified some cases corresponding to the first quantitative value of dehydration associated with horizontal advection in the TTL. The statistical features of dehydration for the air parcels advected in the lower TTL are derived from the matches. The threshold of nucleation is estimated to be 146 Â± 1 % (1 Ïƒ) in relative humidity with respect to ice (RH ice), while dehydration seems to continue until RH ice reaches about 75 Â± 23 % (1 Ïƒ) in the altitude region from 350 to 360 K. The efficiency of dehydration expressed by the relaxation time required for the <b>supersaturated</b> <b>air</b> parcel to approach saturation is empirically determined from the matches. A relaxation time of approximately one hour reproduces the second water vapor observation reasonably well, given the first observed water vapor amount and the history of the saturation mixing ratio during advection in the lower TTL...|$|E
40|$|The match {{method is}} applied to the {{quantification}} of the dehydration process in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) over the western Pacific. The match pairs are sought from the Soundings of Ozone and Water in the Equatorial Region (SOWER) campaign network observations with the use of isentropic trajectories. For those pairs identified, extensive screening procedures are performed to verify the representativeness of the air parcel and the validity of the isentropic treatment and to check possible water injection by deep convection, consistency between the sonde data and analysis field, and conservation of the ozone content. Among those pairs remaining, we found some cases corresponding to the first quantitative value of dehydration associated with horizontal advection in the TTL. The statistical features on the dehydration for the air parcels advected in the lower TTL are derived from the match pairs. Match analysis indicates that ice nucleation starts before the relative humidity with respect to ice (RHice) reaches the value of 207 Â± 81 % (1 Ïƒ) and that the air mass is dehydrated until the RHice reaches 83 Â± 30 % (1 Ïƒ). The efficiency of dehydration is estimated as the relaxation time of the relative humidity for the <b>supersaturated</b> <b>air</b> parcel to approach the saturation state. This is empirically estimated from the match pairs as the quantity that reproduces the second water vapor observation given the first observed water vapor amount and the sequence of the saturation mixing ratio of the match air mass exposed during the advection. The relaxation time is found to range from 2 to 3 hours, which agrees with those reported from previous studies...|$|E
