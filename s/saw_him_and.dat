5|$|The myth of Eshmun {{was related}} by {{the sixth century}} Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius. They recount that Eshmun, {{a young man from}} Beirut, was hunting in the woods when Astarte <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> was {{stricken}} by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with an axe and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven.|$|E
5|$|Before Euro 2000, Nedvěd {{was unable}} to train {{normally}} due to an ankle injury. The Czechs' first match (against the Netherlands) <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> international teammate Jan Koller hit the woodwork without scoring, before the Dutch scored a controversial penalty to win 1–0. In the second match, against France, he was fouled, where the resultant Czech penalty was converted by Karel Poborský to even the score at 1–1. Despite two shots on goal, Nedvěd could not beat French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and France won the match 2–1. He played in the third group match, against Denmark; despite the Czechs' 2–0 victory, the team was eliminated from the tournament. After Euro 2000, Nedvěd took over the national team captaincy from Jiří Němec.|$|E
5|$|Union {{military}} leaders assigned Lieutenant Colonel Samuel P. Cox to kill Anderson, providing {{him with a}} group of experienced soldiers. Soon after Anderson left Glasgow, a local woman <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> told Cox of his presence. On October 26, 1864, he pursued Anderson's group with 150 men and engaged them in battle. Anderson and his men charged the Union forces, killing five or six of them, but turned back under heavy fire. Only Anderson and one other man, the son of a Confederate general, continued to charge after the others retreated. Anderson was hit by a bullet behind an ear, likely killing him instantly. Four other guerrillas were killed in the attack. The victory made a hero of Cox and led to his promotion.|$|E

25|$|On January 5, 1934 a motorcyclist, Arthur Grant, {{claimed to}} have nearly hit the {{creature}} while approaching Abriachan (near the north-eastern end of the loch) at about 1a.m. on a moonlit night. According to Grant, it had a small head attached to a long neck; the creature <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> crossed the road back to the loch. Grant, a veterinary student, {{described it as a}} cross between a seal and a plesiosaur. He said he dismounted and followed it to the loch, but only saw ripples.|$|E
25|$|In Reformed theology, the Word of God {{takes several}} forms. Jesus Christ himself is the Word Incarnate. The prophecies about him {{said to be}} found in the Old Testament and the {{ministry}} of the apostles who <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> communicated his message are also the Word of God. Further, the preaching of ministers about God is the very Word of God because God is considered to be speaking through them. God also speaks through human writers in the Bible, which is composed of texts set apart by God for self-revelation. Reformed theologians emphasize the Bible as a uniquely important means by which God communicates with people. People gain knowledge of God from the Bible which cannot be gained in any other way.|$|E

25|$|At this point, {{hundreds}} of people fled the mall after hearing the gunshots, but many remained inside and dashed to cover. Roberts headed further toward the food court, firing at 16-year-old employee Alina Pavlenko, who was over 100 feet away, but missed. He also dropped three other magazines in his possession. He then turned back and headed toward a JCPenney store. He attempted to reload the AR-15 at that point, {{but was unable to}} do so, the weapon having apparently jammed. During that time, Nick Meli, a concealed carry permit holder, drew his Glock 22, claimed to have taken aim at Roberts, but did not fire since there was a bystander behind Roberts. Meli claims that Roberts <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> that this may have contributed to Roberts' decision to commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|Stephen invited Braham to {{take the}} lead role in his new opera Mahmoud in 1796; Braham triumphed at the première. Later that year he sang lead roles, also to acclaim, at the Italian Opera in London, an {{extraordinary}} attainment for a Briton. In 1797 he appeared in the role created for his mentor Leoni, as Carlos in Sheridan's The Duenna at Covent Garden. The long triumphant phase of Braham's career was launched, which in its early years <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Nancy singing in every major continental house as well as in Britain, to audiences which contained, in Paris (1797), Napoleon, in Livorno (1799), Nelson, and similar notables wherever else they appeared. Braham became the first English male singer to command a European reputation. In 1809 he sang in Dublin at the unheard of fee of 2000 guineas for fifteen concerts, an indisputable sign both of his fame and popularity, and of the growth of music and entertainment as industries in this period.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} stories {{surrounding}} {{the circumstances of}} his attempted murder. A version by the 19th-century Ottoman historian Ahmed Cevdet Pasha gives the following account: one of his slaves, a Georgian girl named Cevri, gathered ashes when she heard the commotion in the palace surrounding the murder of Selim III. When the assassins approached the Harem chambers where Mahmud was staying, she was able to keep them away for a while by throwing ashes into their faces, temporarily blinding them. This allowed Mahmud to escape through a window and climb onto the roof of the Harem. He apparently ran to the roof of the Third Court where other pages <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> helped him come down with pieces of clothes that were quickly tied together as a ladder. By this time {{one of the leaders of}} the rebellion, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha arrived with his armed men and upon seeing the dead body of Selim III proclaimed Mahmud as padishah. The slave girl Cevri Kalfa was awarded for her bravery and loyalty and appointed haznedar usta, the chief treasurer of the imperial Harem, which was the second most important position in the hierarchy. A plain stone staircase at the Altınyol (Golden Way) of the Harem is called Staircase of Cevri (Jevri) Kalfa, since the events apparently happened around there and are associated with her.|$|E

500|$|As in Libya, Mackay {{shared the}} hardships {{of living in the}} field with his men, and {{impressed}} them by his coolness during air raids. They watched him sit in the open during attacks; on one such occasion on 19 April 1941, Mackay waited out a two-and-a-half-hour raid when his car was hit and his driver wounded. One staff officer [...] "noticed Mackay moving in front of his tent quite unconcerned about the movement of enemy planes. He neither looked at the planes nor at the men dashing about, but they <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> those moving towards shelter stopped, and many of those who had gained shelter returned to their duties. Personal example is the only paying proposition in such circumstances". For his actions in Greece, he was mentioned in despatches a sixth time, and awarded the Greek War Cross (First Class).|$|E
500|$|Skanderbeg's next {{task was}} to {{recapture}} Trani, {{the second most important}} point in Apulia, aside from Barletta. He succeeded in capturing the commander of the garrison, Fuscia de Foxa, who had rebelled against Ferdinand. Fuscia was outside the walls of Trani with sixteen men when Skanderbeg <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> surrounded him and then tried to convince him to abandon Orsini, whereby Fuscia refused for pecuniary reasons. [...] On the morning of 28 December 1461, with Fuscia's pleas, Gracciani, the vice-commander of the garrison, surrendered Trani. Both Fuscia and Gracciani, however, refused to hand over the garrison's munitions. Skanderbeg threatened to imprison them if they did not surrender what they were asked to, forcing the two to hand over Trani's stores. After weeks of marauding, Skanderbeg and his Aragonese colleagues joined Alessandro Sforza's men. They then yielded all of the fortresses that they had recaptured to Ferdinand.|$|E
500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E

500|$|One of Darren's {{earliest}} storylines <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> friend Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) {{stand up}} to bully Mark Gibbs (Colin Parry). Darren becomes friends with Mark {{in an attempt to}} deter Mark's bullying but Mark soon after rapes Luke. Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Luke's girlfriend Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn). Dawson commented on this saying, [...] "Darren liked Mandy even before he went to America so he was gutted when he came back to discover she had started going out with Luke. And all along, Luke knew that Darren wanted to get together with Mandy ... Luke has other things on his mind and seems to be ignoring Mandy, so Darren thinks it is the perfect opportunity to make his move". Before Darren asks Mandy out he confronts Luke who [...] "gives him the green light". Dawson opined that although viewers may think Mandy and Darren are being [...] "heartless" [...] they don't know about Luke's attack so are not to blame. Dawson felt that initially the relationship is a [...] "flirty kind of friendship" [...] although Mandy realises she likes Darren and plans to use Darren as a means of reuniting with Luke. As Darren and Mandy spend more time together their relationship [...] "develops". If Darren were to find out about Luke's rape, Dawson felt Darren would help Luke get [...] "revenge" [...] on Mark. He said Mandy would either be [...] "shocked and turn to Darren for support" [...] or [...] "feel guilty about what she's done" [...] and reunite with Luke. Dawson felt if this were to happen Darren would [...] "try to shrug it off" [...] although [...] "deep down, he cares for Mandy". Dawson felt that Darren should become a [...] "hero" [...] to Luke, fixing all his problems which would rectify him beginning a relationship with Mandy.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{director}} Chris Weitz {{wanted to}} recast {{the role of}} Jacob Black for Twilights sequel, , due to the major physical changes that occur in Black between the two novels, and have an actor that would accurately portray [...] "the new, larger Jacob Black." [...] Black's role in the novel also increases significantly, with him {{falling in love with}} Bella and becoming a werewolf, putting the actor in a starring role. Representatives for Weitz had stated that they were make a full effort to recast the [...] "high-profile gig," [...] and MTV News confirmed that Weitz was looking at Michael Copon to take on the role; however, Summit Entertainment said a decision had not been made. In an attempt to keep the role, Lautner weight-trained extensively and gained approximately 30 pounds of muscle. In January 2009, Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue {{to play the role of}} Jacob in the sequel. In an interview, fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner's transformation saying, [...] "He's an entirely different person physically." [...] Stewart later said, [...] "He gets a lot of attention because he's buff, but I think as soon as the movie comes out, people are going to realize that's not why he got the job." [...] Co-star Robert Pattinson said after seeing Lautner's body, [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> thought 'Jesus, I'm going to get fired." [...] In an interview with The Wrap, Weitz said Lautner deserved a lot of credit for the movie's box office, stating, [...] "If you look at the movie, it should have been the weakest in the franchise, because Robert Pattinson doesn't play as big a role." [...] Weitz said Lautner had to [...] "pick up that slack, and if his character hadn't been emotionally, not just physically, appealing, the movie wouldn't have been as big a hit." [...] The commercial performance of the film outpaced the first film, setting several box office records including the biggest midnight opening in the United States and Canada and the biggest single-day opening. The opening weekend of New Moon is the third highest opening weekend in domestic history with $142,839,137. The Twilight Saga: New Moon also has the sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total. Critical reception was less favorable, with the movie getting a 4.6/10 average from Rotten Tomatoes, and a 44 on Metacritic. Lautner won Favorite Breakout Movie Actor at the 35th People's Choice Awards.|$|E
