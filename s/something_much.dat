5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into <b>something</b> <b>much</b> stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E

Unlike ports of the original game released for computers and other high definition platforms, the game is a full remake built from the ground-up, featuring full polygonal graphics as opposed to the pre-rendered environments of the original.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks before}} he planned to {{complete}} the symphony-requiem, Shostakovich played what he had finished to date for Sollertinsky, who was being evacuated with the Leningrad Philharmonic. While playing the music, Shostakovich realized that what he had written was not a complete work in itself but actually the beginning of <b>something</b> <b>much</b> larger, since the tensions {{brought up in the}} symphony-requiem had not been resolved. The question now became whether to stay in the city to continue working or to evacuate and resume the work after a long hiatus. By the time he decided to evacuate, it was too late—the Germans had cut off the rail link to the city. He and his family were trapped.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} his {{political}} setbacks McLane never lost his ambition for high political office. One of his last remaining political friends from the congressional days was James K. Polk, who was now President of the United States. While he dreamed of <b>something</b> <b>much</b> greater, McLane took {{a leave of absence}} from the railroad in 1845 and 1846 to return to England as Minister Plenipotentiary, primarily for the purpose of coordinating negotiations over the Oregon boundary. McLane was remembered fondly from his previous service, and renewed his old friendships. The basis of the settlement was easily established, but the hard line public position of Polk was shaken only by outbreak of the Mexican–American War. McLane succeeded in keeping the British agreeable to the eventual settlement until the administration came to the same conclusion, even if he risked suggesting the president was posturing when he insisted on “54-40 or Fight.” McLane never received the higher appointment desired and reluctantly returned to the railroad.|$|E

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end of}} Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun.

500|$|According to biographer Andrew Morton, {{the album}} made Madonna a {{household}} name, and {{was instrumental in}} introducing her star power. Martin Charles Strong, author of The Great Rock Discography felt that the album's unprecedented dance-pop and naive appeal served Madonna in establishing her base as an artist. Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Madonna's sound, and of course her look, would be heavily copied for years to come, but Madonna heralded <b>something</b> <b>much</b> bigger: {{the arrival of the}} pop diva as a singular force who put personality above all else." [...] According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández, the songs on Madonna reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished arrangement and Madonna's own vocal style. In songs such as [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Burning Up", Madonna introduced a style of upbeat dance music that would prove particularly appealing to future gay audiences.|$|E
500|$|Jay Carr of The Boston Globe called Apt Pupil [...] "most {{compelling}} for its moral dimension", enjoying the [...] "duet between Renfro's smooth-cheeked latter-day Faust and McKellen's reawakened Mephistopheles". While Carr found the film's framework to be realistic, {{he noted the}} change of pace, [...] "Perhaps sensing a narrative slackening and a smothering claustrophobia... 'Apt Pupil' veers into melodramatic devices that yank the film out of its disquieting amorality {{and turn it into}} <b>something</b> <b>much</b> more ordinary and mundane." [...] The critic concluded, [...] "It maintains a bleak integrity by not pretending to arrive at remorse. Never is there any discussion." [...] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune described Apt Pupil as [...] "a good shocker that misses the ultimate horror", finding the film's weakness to be the [...] "contrived" [...] bond between Dussander and Bowden. [...] Wilmington called the plot [...] "overly slick", asking, [...] "How can Todd not only conveniently find a Nazi war criminal in his hometown but also instantly coerce and control him?" ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, Washing Machine {{was recorded}} at Easley Studios in Memphis, where indie rock bands like Pavement, Guided by Voices and Grifters previously recorded albums. Moore remarked that {{the atmosphere in}} Memphis [...] "lent itself to avoiding {{the reality of the}} record-buying public. In the past we were always very aware of who was out there checking us out. This was the first record where we've gotten this certain level of notoriety and we were just, like, 'fuck it. He also felt that Washing Machine was conceived and recorded like some of the band's earlier albums: [...] "It hearkens back to records like Sister where we'd write a bunch of songs, go into the studio for a month, put them down, then go on the road and play them for a year. By {{the end of the year}} they'd mutate into <b>something</b> <b>much</b> more excited". Gordon credited Memphis for its relaxed atmosphere and cited the album as one of her favorites.|$|E

500|$|In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison {{credits the}} {{influence}} for his song [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder {{and leader of}} the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted. But he was not attached to it... because he was searching for <b>something</b> <b>much</b> higher, much deeper. It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [...]" [...] Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the need to break the cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation: [...] "The whole point to being here, really, is to figure a way to get out." ...|$|E
500|$|Walt Disney first {{attempted}} to adapt [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into an animated film {{soon after the}} studio released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, but the project was ultimately abandoned when the story {{turned out to be}} [...] "a really hard nut to crack". According to Keane, this was mainly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the fairy tale takes place within a tower. To overcome this, Tangleds writers were forced to develop a way of [...] "bringing Rapunzel out of the tower". Originally, the film was conceived under the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version and we had a couple of great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was <b>something</b> <b>much</b> more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale." ...|$|E

[...] Rebecca Haithcoat, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, had a more mixed opinion, writing that while the release garners {{much of the same}} excitements as the [...] "expert blend of sleek pop and those big, warm and happy belted house hooks of the ‘90s" [...] that was on Settle, it was, much like Caracal, not as good as Disclosure's debut given that it was [...] "uninspired" [...] and that none of the songs on the EP were [...] "immediate or necessary." [...] Kyle Forward of DIY magazine was also disappointed with the EP, writing that the songs were only [...] "reminders" [...] of their old sound rather than being <b>something</b> <b>much</b> more than [...] "indistinct nothingness" [...] in addition to their previous sound.|$|E

500|$|Giving {{the episode}} a 7.5 out of 10, Eric Walters of Paste stated, that [...] "Unlike last year, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{did not feel}} like a Flash episode {{featuring}} Team Arrow." [...] He expected the 2015 crossover would be bigger than previous years' noting: [...] "It is, but it's also far from complete." [...] He felt that [...] "Legends of Today" [...] {{was not so much}} a The Flash episode, but more like [...] "the first half of <b>something</b> <b>much</b> larger". In the end, he wished [...] "the show had embraced it fully". Den of Geek's Mike Cecchini gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, saying: [...] "I'm really kind of amazed at just how much work [...] "Legends of Today" [...] gets done without just becoming a massive mess." [...] He described it as [...] "a proper two-parter this year" [...] and concluded: [...] "Amidst all the Legends of Tomorrow hooplah and the fun of getting the teams together, [...] "Legends of Today" [...] still manages to move the main Flash season 2 storyline forward in a couple of neat ways." ...|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into <b>something</b> <b>much</b> sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{name had}} {{gradually}} been shortened; in Davies's pitch {{it had been}} called Rose meets the Doctor, and the journey begins, on his contract Rose Meets The Doctor, and finally shortened to Rose. Also changed from Davies's original pitch were {{the names of the}} supporting characters: Judy Tyler became Jackie Tyler, and Muggsy Smith became Mickey Smith. Davies had trouble coming up with how Mickey was supposed to be captured by the Nestene while waiting for Rose in the car, and finally realised he could be lured by a plastic wheelie bin. He commented that such instances of the ordinary being made scary made Doctor Who unique. Davies had to take out [...] "oblique" [...] references to the Autons being like terrorists, as the Eye was once a target of a terrorist attack. The entrance of the Doctor was <b>something</b> <b>much</b> debated; Tranter {{and other members of the}} production team wanted it to be more dramatic, but the scene was never reshot. Davies remarked that it reflects Rose's point of view, whereas a more dramatic entrance would reflect the audience's excitement at the Doctor coming back. The scene in which the Auton arm attacks in the Tyler's flat was originally much longer, but was revised. The episode originally underran by several minutes, and a scene with the Doctor and Rose walking was added a month or so later.|$|E
