Prague Symphony Orchestra's performance of the main theme impressed more reviewers who claimed it brought out the heroic essence of Karas with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and drama, and enhanced the impact of the quick and intense battles.|$|E

25|$|The architects {{wanted the}} {{building}} to give Bloomington residents {{the feeling that the}} courthouse belonged to them. To encourage this feeling the entrances on all four sides of the building are identical, a way to welcome people from all directions. Wanting to balance the feeling of symmetry with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> Reeves and Baile created an identical hierarchy in each facade through the use of an entrance arch, enhanced vertically by columns and topped off with a pediment. The exterior also makes use of many balustrades in the roof and other levels on the exterior. Also included are detailed egg-and-dart molding, and hood molding.|$|E
500|$|During the chorus, the lyrics—"If you wanna be my lover/You gotta {{get with}} my friends"—address {{the value of}} female {{friendship}} over the heterosexual bond, while the ascending group of chords {{and the number of}} voices creates a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> that adds to the song's level of excitement. The same pattern occurs, leading to the second chorus. Towards the end, Brown and Halliwell rap the bridge, which serves as a presentation to each of the girls' personalities. The group repeats the chorus for the last time, ending the song with energetic refrains—"Slam your body down and wind it all around"—and the word [...] "zigazig-ha".|$|E
500|$|As the {{government}} became increasingly harsh in its response to growing protests, the resistance shifted from being completely non-violent towards armed action. Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders founded the uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), a militant {{wing of the}} ANC, which began a campaign of sabotage. During this period, music was {{often referred to as}} a [...] "weapon of struggle." [...] Among MK members in training camps, a song called [...] "Sobashiy'abazali" [...] ("We Will Leave Our Parents") became very popular, invoking as it did the pain of leaving their homes. The Toyi-toyi chant also became popular during this period, and was frequently used to generate a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> among large groups to intimidate government troops.|$|E

500|$|With all his {{frequently}} noted {{attention to}} character and characters—Hazlitt's partly psychological approach to character necessarily referred to observed real-life behavior—he also frequently emphasises the art by which Shakespeare created dramatic [...] "character". Particularly in tragedy, a [...] "sense of power", he believed, {{is the essential}} medium by which a poet of genius operates {{on the minds of}} his audience. When the author instills in the reader or viewer's imagination the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> that he must have had in grasping and conveying intertwined passions, he makes us identify with a character such as Othello, and feel in ourselves the way Iago plays upon his mind so that, ironically, his weakness is made to undermine his strength.|$|E
500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a lot of really good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of like a horse race in a way, especially when you know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> I think Dodd comes off with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> and I thought that you have the chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt for {{the most}} part agreed with his {{contemporary}} Romantics that poetry can make us better human beings. The following year, in his Lectures on the English Poets, referring to tragic poetry especially, he would observe how [...] "in proportion as it sharpens the edge of calamity and disappointment, it strengthens the desire of good." [...] Yet, he remained alert to ways in which poetry can also express and reinforce our less admirable tendencies. Following an observation of Burke he notes that [...] "people flock to see a tragedy; but if there were a public execution in the next street, the theatre would very soon be empty. [...] We are [...] fond of indulging our violent passions [...] We cannot help it. The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> is as strong a principle in the mind as the love of pleasure." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's music mostly {{conveys a}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> energy, and brutality, yet [...] tender moments occur. The sounds of oboes and string {{instruments}} accompany Conan and Valeria's intimate scenes, imbuing {{them with a}} sense of lush romance and an emotional intensity. [...] According to MacDonald, Poledouris deviated from the practice of scoring love scenes with tunes reminiscent of Romantic period pieces; instead, Poledouris made Conan and Valeria's melancholic love theme unique through his use of [...] "minor-key harmony". David Morgan, a film journalist, heard Eastern influences in the [...] "lilting romantic melodies". [...] Page Cook, audio critic for Films in Review, describes Conan the Barbarians score as [...] "a large canvas daubed with a colorful yet highly sensitive brush. [...] There is innate intelligence behind Poledouris's scheme, and the pinnacles reached are often eloquent with haunting intensity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} system proved difficult to develop because computers {{of the time}} lacked power. Artificial intelligence was considered crucial, as the navigation and other aspects relied on it. According to co-designer Jonty Barnes, the team wanted the creatures complex without high computational costs. Healey {{came up with the}} idea of slapping creatures to make them work faster, and Barnes considered it a [...] "great game decision". A great deal of time was spent working on the user interface, and at one point the idea of having no interface was considered. Carter stated that the team tried to make the sounds atmospheric and industrial so players got a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Using others' 3D sound routines proved troublesome, so he and his colleague Tony Cox wrote their own. Dungeon Keeper uses lighting algorithms used in Magic Carpet, which provided effects such as fireballs lighting corridors.|$|E
500|$|Alec Meer of Eurogamer {{praised the}} developer's focus on staying true to the Transformers source material: [...] "Fall of Cybertron is a love-letter to a fictional {{universe}} created in 1984 that has ... continued to this day." [...] Matt Miller of Game Informer agreed, calling the narrative [...] "tightly crafted". G4TV's Matt Keil lauded the story, character development and voice acting. He called the game [...] "a cinematic shooter that {{stands on the}} strength of its design and gameplay". GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd stated that while the game's levels focused on flight are enjoyable and that some levels give players a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> the campaign mode was [...] "too often more exciting to watch than to play". Corey Cohen of Official Xbox Magazine gave high marks for the variety of characters players control during the campaign. He noted that each felt unique from the others, but thought that the game could have utilized the gargantuan transformer Metroplex more. Miller cited that the variety of playable Transformers and their unique abilities kept the game interesting, adding that the control scheme suited each unique character well.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} from Europe, Du Bois was more determined {{than ever to}} gain equal rights for African Americans. Black soldiers {{returning from}} overseas felt a new <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and worth, and were representative of an emerging attitude {{referred to as the}} New Negro. In the editorial [...] "Returning Soldiers" [...] he wrote: [...] "But, by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if, now that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land." [...] Many blacks moved to northern cities in search of work, and some northern white workers resented the competition. This labor strife was one of the causes of the Red Summer of 1919, a horrific series of race riots across America, in which over 300 African Americans were killed in over 30 cities. Du Bois documented the atrocities in the pages of The Crisis, culminating in the December publication of a gruesome photograph of a lynching that occurred during the Omaha, Nebraska race riot.|$|E
500|$|Manuela Sáenz is the General's long-time lover, {{his last}} {{since the death}} of his wife, 27years earlier. Her {{character}} is based on Simón Bolívar's historical mistress Doña Manuela Sáenz de Thorne, whom Bolívar dubbed [...] "the liberator of the liberator" [...] after she helped save him from an assassination attempt on the night of September 25, 1828. García Márquez's fictional portrait stimulated a reassessment of this historical figure, who is increasingly seen, according to Venezuelan historian Denzil Romero, [...] "not just as a mistress but as the intelligent, independent, forceful woman she was". In the novel, she is described as [...] "the bold Quiteña who loved him but was not going to follow him to his death". The General leaves Manuela Sáenz behind, but throughout the novel he writes to her on his journey. She also attempts to write letters to him with news of the political situation, but the mail carriers have been instructed not to accept her letters. Like the historical figure on whom she is based, the fictional Manuela Sáenz is married to Dr. James Thorne, an English physician twice her age. The historical Manuela Sáenz left Thorne after Bolívar wrote declaring his undying love for her. In the novel she is characterized as astute and indomitable, with [...] "irresistible grace, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> and unbounded tenacity".|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power {{praised the}} story {{and the number of}} lightsaber combos but criticized the game's {{easiness}} and hack-and-slash gameplay. It also praised the Wii version for its story and Force powers, but criticized the game's lightsaber controls and linear gameplay. GameSpot noticed visual glitches and problematic audio compression that detracted from the Wii version's [...] "mature and exciting" [...] story, adding that the reduced number of Force-manipulable objects helps mitigate the targeting problems experienced on other platforms. Referring to the Wii remote and nunchuck controls, GameSpot also speculated that The Force Unleashed is [...] "possibly the most waggle-heavy" [...] Wii game. Zero Punctuation criticized the Wii version's graphics and compared lightsaber combat to [...] "trying to follow an aerobics routine with both your arms tied to different windmills". The ability to upgrade Starkiller's abilities in the PS2 version, according to IGN, is not as [...] "robust" [...] as it should be, and the game's targeting system is sometimes frustrating. IGN said the PS2's real-time cutscene rendering made Starkiller seem emotionless, and that pre-rendered cutscenes would have been better. GameSpot found the DS version's plot interesting but the storytelling itself [...] "lackluster". While the DS version is easy, with Starkiller killing enemies [...] "like a hot knife through butter", GameSpot said the player's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> is not matched by a sense of freedom. GameSpot called the PSP version's camera [...] "unwieldy", but added that smaller and less cluttered environments make the targeting system less frustrating than on other platforms. The Wii version was a nominee for multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best Story and Best Voice Acting.|$|E

2500|$|In Memphis, Watson was a {{founding}} member and third president of the Nineteenth Century Club, the largest woman's club in the South. At the time, clubs were viewed as schools where women were able to extend their intellectual endeavors. The club was tied to the Women's suffrage movement, though the members {{made it clear that}} theirs was a very feminine brand of activism, often justified with explanations of how it helped women to become better in family life. Although Watson cautioned against pursuing activism {{at the expense of the}} family, she noted [...] "a new <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and capacity among American women", and published The New Woman of the New South & the Attitude of Southern Women on the Suffrage Question with suffragist Josephine Henry in 1895.|$|E
2500|$|Nicknamed [...] "the chameleon" [...] from {{an early}} point in his career, Kérékou's motto was [...] "the branch will not break {{in the arms of}} the chameleon".

Unlike some past rulers who had adopted animal symbolism intending to project a violent, warlike <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> Kérékou's symbolic animal suggested skill and cleverness; his motto suggested that he would keep the branch from breaking, but implicitly warned of what could happen to [...] "the branch" [...] if it was not [...] "in the arms of the chameleon"—political chaos. To some, his nickname seemed particularly apt as he successfully adapted himself to a new political climate and neoliberal economic policies in the 1990s.|$|E
