As a result, the Baltimore office manager of Parke Davis in charge of the sales district that included the two cities sought advice from his head office on how to handle this situation. The Parke Davis attorney advised that the company could legally [...] "enforce an adopted policy arrived at unilaterally" [...] to sell only to customers who observed the suggested minimum resale prices. He further advised that this meant that [...] "we can lawfully say 'we will sell you only so long as you observe <b>such</b> <b>minimum</b> retail prices' but cannot say 'we will sell you only if you agree to observe <b>such</b> <b>minimum</b> retail prices,' since, except as permitted by Fair Trade laws, agreements as to resale price maintenance are invalid." ...|$|R
