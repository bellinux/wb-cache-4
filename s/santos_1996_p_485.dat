40|$|The active {{sites of}} the membrane-bound {{nucleoside}} triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) regulate and are regulated by coordinated and spatially distant movements of their transmembrane helices, modulating enzyme activity, and substrate specificity. Using site-directed mutagenesis, {{the roles of the}} conserved proline residues (N-terminal: P 52 and P 53; C-terminal: P 472, P 476, P 481, P 484, and <b>P</b> <b>485)</b> of human NTPDase 3, located in the “linker regions” that connect the N- and C-terminal transmembrane helices with the extracellular active site, were examined. Single cysteine substitutions were strategically placed in the transmembrane domain (N-terminal helix: V 42 C; C-terminal helix: G 489 C) to serve as cross-linking “sensors” of helical interactions. These “sensor” background mutant proteins (V 42 C and G 489 C NTPDase 3) are enzymatically active and are cross-linked by copper phenanthroline less efficiently in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Proline to alanine substitutions at P 53, P 481, P 484, and <b>P</b> <b>485</b> in the V 42 C background, as well as P 53, P 481, and P 484 in the G 489 C background, exhibited decreased nucleotidase activities. More importantly, alanine substitutions at P 53 and P 481 in the V 42 C background and P 481 in the G 489 C background no longer exhibited the ATP-induced decrease in transmembrane cross-linking efficiency. Interestingly, the <b>P</b> <b>485</b> A mutation abolished oxidative cross-linking at G 489 C both in the presence and absence of ATP. Taken together, these results suggest a role for proline residues 53 and 481 in the linker regions of human NTPDase 3 for coupling nucleotide binding at the enzyme active site to movements and/or rearrangements of the transmembrane helices necessary for optimal nucleotide hydrolysis...|$|R
