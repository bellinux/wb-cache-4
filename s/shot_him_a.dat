25|$|After fatally {{shooting}} Bernall, Harris {{turned toward}} the next table, where Bree Pasquale sat next to the table rather than under it. Harris asked Pasquale {{if she wanted to}} die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Witnesses later reported that Harris seemed disorientedâ€”possibly from the heavily bleeding wound to his nose. As Harris taunted Pasquale, Klebold noted Ireland trying to provide aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table; Klebold <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious, but survived.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's just as {{well that}} I am warned," [...] said Honora. She raised her parasol and picked up her skirts and <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> look. Although he did not {{resemble}} in feature the great if unscrupulous Emperor of the French, he reminded her now of a picture she had once seen of Napoleon and a lady; the lady obviously in a little flutter under the Emperor's scrutiny. The picture had suggested a probable future for the lady.|$|E
6000|$|There was a moment's silence. The Dowager <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> glance; {{then her}} eyes fell. Her bosom stirred {{as if some}} strange {{excitement}} moved her. Fear and shame were her emotions; for a way she knew by which mademoiselle might be induced to go with him--not only willingly, but eagerly, she thought--to the altar.

60|$|The Swede <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> look of hatred. He did {{not know}} why that gross, obese man excited in him so violent a repulsion. But his {{thoughts}} wandered and he found his mind filled with memories of the past. He went back five and twenty years. It was when he first came to the island, weary of Apia, with its heavy drinking, its gambling and coarse sensuality, a sick man, trying to resign himself to the loss of the career which had fired his imagination with ambitious thoughts. He set behind him resolutely all his hopes of making a great name for himself and strove to content himself with the few poor months of careful life which was all that he could count on. He was boarding with a half-caste trader who had a store a couple of miles along the coast {{at the edge of a}} native village; and one day, wandering aimlessly along the grassy paths of the coconut groves, he had come upon the hut in which Sally lived. The beauty of the spot had filled him with a rapture so great that it was almost painful, and then he had seen Sally. She was the loveliest creature he had ever seen, and the sadness in those dark, magnificent eyes of hers affected him strangely. The Kanakas were a handsome race, and beauty was not rare among them, but it was the beauty of shapely animals. It was empty. But those tragic eyes were dark with mystery, and you felt in them the bitter complexity of the groping, human soul. The trader told him the story and it moved him.|$|E
