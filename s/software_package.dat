Packages may include modifications introduced by Debian to achieve compliance with Debian Policy, even to fix non-Debian specific bugs, although coordination with upstream developers is advised.|$|E

In contrast with the overall package, the <b>software</b> <b>package</b> is always a technical package in which all the files needed are combined in order to run the software product. Another concept of the <b>software</b> <b>package</b> is the version. This keeps track of the modifications made to the software product.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the {{reliability}} of (semi-) automatic left ventricular (LV) function measurements using three different <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> on the same dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) datasets and to compare agreement among the <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> Forty consecutive patients, undergoing cardiac DSCT were included (31 men, mean age 58 +/- 14 years). LV function analysis was performed with all three <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> ANOVA testing was used to determine the difference among the repeated measurements and the difference among the <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> Bland-Altman plots were computed to describe the agreement among the <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> No significant difference was found among the repeated measurements. In the comparison of the three <b>software</b> <b>packages,</b> a significant difference was observed when measurements were used with minimal user interaction. When end-diastolic and end-systolic phases were manually set, there was no overall significant difference, but in 12. 5 % of patients a large (> 10 %) difference in LVEF was found. All three <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> have good intraobserver variability, but the results of the three packages were significantly different. For clinical use, one should be aware of the clinical impact of possible segmentation flaws when (semi-) automatic LV function assessment is used...|$|R
30|$|We {{used the}} normal {{databases}} {{provided in the}} <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> Both Wolak et al. [6] and Guner et al. [7] found that the application of an institutional normal database did not significantly improve {{the performance of the}} software. Furthermore, to our knowledge, most clinical users of the <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> use a normal database provided by the vendor and not their own institutional normal database. We wanted the results to reflect the performance of the <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> in clinical routine and we therefore used the same normal databases that are available to other users of the <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b>|$|R
25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side {{you can see the}} meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and <b>software</b> <b>package</b> means that a package has to contain at least 1 <b>software</b> <b>package</b> and at the most 1 <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> So in this case a package just has to contain 1 <b>software</b> <b>package.</b> On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{reliability}} and accuracy of three different imaging <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> for three-dimensional analysis of the upper airway using CBCT images. To assess the reliability of the <b>software</b> <b>packages,</b> 15 NewTom 5 G(®) (QR Systems, Verona, Italy) CBCT data sets were randomly and retrospectively selected. Two observers measured the volume, minimum cross-sectional area and the length of the upper airway using Amira(®) (Visage Imaging Inc., Carlsbad, CA), 3 Diagnosys(®) (3 diemme, Cantu, Italy) and OnDemand 3 D(®) (CyberMed, Seoul, Republic of Korea) <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> The intra- and inter-observer reliability of the upper airway measurements were determined using intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland & Altman agreement tests. To assess the accuracy of the <b>software</b> <b>packages,</b> one NewTom 5 G(®) CBCT data set was used to print a three-dimensional anthropomorphic phantom with known dimensions to be used as the "gold standard". This phantom was subsequently scanned using a NewTom 5 G(®) scanner. Based on the CBCT data set of the phantom, one observer measured the volume, minimum cross-sectional area, and length of the upper airway using Amira(®), 3 Diagnosys(®), and OnDemand 3 D(®), and compared these measurements with the gold standard. The intra- and inter-observer reliability of the measurements of the upper airway using the different <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0. 75). There was excellent agreement between all three <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> in volume, minimum cross-sectional area and length measurements. All <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> underestimated the upper airway volume by - 8. 8 % to - 12. 3 %, the minimum cross-sectional area by - 6. 2 % to - 14. 6 %, and the length by - 1. 6 % to - 2. 9 %. All three <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> offered reliable volume, minimum cross-sectional area and length measurements of the upper airway.
