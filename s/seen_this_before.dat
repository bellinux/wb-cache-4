500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. In a retrospective {{review of the}} second season, Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Our Town" [...] a C+, describing it as [...] "scary — but mostly because of what transpires in a chicken processing plant." [...] Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B–, criticizing the clichéd opening sequence—"Haven't we <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> <b>before?</b> Like, a million times, in dozens of horror movies, and even on this very series"—the bland characters and lack of humor. However, he did compliment {{the fact that the}} plot explained enough of the villain's motives and that the episode had [...] "some sense of a community behind everything". Furthermore, he wrote that the resolution worked well despite again resorting to Scully in danger.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} pilot, Rodat {{dedicated}} a five-page montage to the alien invasion, but {{decided not to}} go through with it as it had been done before in films such as War of the Worlds. [...] "I wrote a few drafts of it and I looked at and say, 'Ay-yay-yay, I’ve <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> <b>before.</b> There’s no emotion to this. It feels like one of those montages,'" [...] he said. Rodat {{came up with the idea}} of having the children in the series [...] "harnessed by aliens". [...] "When we were working out the initial stuff, the thing that excited [...] was the idea that adults are killed if they’re a threat, and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered. The harness was a logical outgrowth of that. Then what we’ll explore is what the harnessing does to the kid over the course of the show but that also is something that’s going to have to unveil itself gradually," [...] he stated. Spielberg previously explored the idea of enslaved children in the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.|$|E

500|$|The single {{also drew}} {{comparisons}} to [...] "Party O'Clock," [...] a 2010 single by American singer Kat DeLuna, also produced by RedOne. In {{a statement issued}} to the New York Daily News, DeLuna said [...] "It's cool that artists like J.Lo are inspired by my musical sound and style. ... Jennifer helped {{pave the way for}} Latinas like myself. I love her", and insisted that there wasn't an issue. DeLuna also noted Lopez as someone who inspired her, and paved the way for someone like her to perform. Following previews of the music video for [...] "On the Floor," [...] DeLuna changed her mind about how she felt with the claims of copying. In another interview with the New York Daily News, several days after the first, she said [...] "I've <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> where the more established artist tries to take the vision and artistic ideas away from an emerging artist, and assumes no one will notice because of their bigger shadow,... Luckily, my loyal fans {{and the power of the}} Internet have let the 'Kat' out of the bag." [...] Lopez was interviewed about the issue on Hispanic-American entertainment program ¡Despierta America!. Lopez replied [...] "What? Really? I'm not aware of that...", and when pressed by the presenter a second time, insisted she had not heard rumors of the comparisons.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2007, Edmondson indicted {{term limits}} and {{initiative}} rights activist Paul Jacob {{and two others}} {{on the grounds that}} they had illegally used out-of-state petitioners to collect signatures on a ballot initiative. [...] On December 18, 2008 the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the underlying Oklahoma law that barred out of state petition circulators, noting that it was in violation of the First Amendment. Edmondson appealed the decision on behalf of Secretary of State Susan Savage. On January 21, 2009 the Tenth Circuit court denied the state's appeal, effectively ending the case. The Attorney General's office dismissed the charges against Jacob and the other defendants, with Edmondson saying [...] "The statute under which these defendants were charged has been declared unconstitutional, and the appellate process is complete...The statute is no longer enforceable." [...] on January 22, 2009. The indictment of Jacob drew criticism for being politically motivated. 2008 independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader referred to the laws such as the one Jacob was charged with breaking as “Jim Crow laws,” adding, “We’ve <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> against African Americans.

60|$|Hewet stood firmly {{between him}} and the door. He was {{determined}} to see for himself what kind of man he was.

60|$|I did not regret my {{not having}} <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> <b>before,</b> since I now saw it under {{circumstances}} so favorable. I was {{in just the}} frame of mind to see something wonderful, {{and this was a}} phenomenon adequate to my circumstances and expectation, and it put me on the alert to see more like it. I let science slide, and rejoiced in that light {{as if it had been}} a fellow creature. A scientific explanation, as it is called, would have been altogether out of place there. That is for pale daylight. Science with its retorts would have put me to sleep; it was the opportunity to be ignorant that I improved. It made a believer of me more than before. I believed that the woods were not tenantless, but choke-full of honest spirits as good as myself any day--not an empty chamber in which chemistry was left to work alone, but an inhabited house. It suggested, too, that the same experience always gives birth to the same sort of belief or religion. One revelation has been made to the Indian, another to the white man. I have much to learn of the Indian, nothing of the missionary. I am not sure but all that would tempt me to teach the Indian my religion would be his promise to teach me his. Long enough I had heard of irrelevant things; now at length I was glad to make acquaintance with the light that dwells in rotten wood.|$|E
60|$|Long pauses came {{between each}} of these remarks; they were uttered in toneless and {{monotonous}} voices. The couple stood still {{on the edge of}} the flower bed, and together pressed the end of her parasol deep down into the soft earth. The action and the fact that his hand rested on the top of hers expressed their feelings in a strange way, as these short insignificant words also expressed something, words with short wings for their heavy body of meaning, inadequate to carry them far and thus alighting awkwardly upon the very common objects that surrounded them, and were to their inexperienced touch so massive; but who knows (so they thought as they pressed the parasol into the earth) what precipices aren't concealed in them, or what slopes of ice don't shine in the sun on the other side? Who knows? Who has ever <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> <b>before?</b> Even when she wondered what sort of tea they gave you at Kew, he felt that something loomed up behind her words, and stood vast and solid behind them; and the mist very slowly rose and uncovered--O, Heavens, what were those shapes?--little white tables, and waitresses who looked first at her and then at him; and there was a bill that he would pay with a real two shilling piece, and it was real, all real, he assured himself, fingering the coin in his pocket, real to everyone except to him and to her; even to him it began to seem real; and then--but it was too exciting to stand and think any longer, and he pulled the parasol out of the earth with a jerk and was impatient to find the place where one had tea with other people, like other people.|$|E

6000|$|What gave me most {{pleasure}} (because {{it required}} no trouble nor study {{to come at}} the heart of it) were the individual relics of antiquity, of which there are some very curious ones in the cases ranged along the principal saloon or nave of the building. For example, the dagger with which Felton killed the Duke of Buckingham,--a knife with a bone handle and a curved blade, not more than three inches long; sharp-pointed, murderous-looking, but of very coarse manufacture. Also, the Duke of Alva's leading staff of iron; and the target of the Emperor Charles V., which seemed to be made of hardened leather, with designs artistically engraved upon it, and gilt. I saw Wolsey's portrait, and, in close proximity to it, his veritable cardinal's hat in a richly ornamented glass case, on which was an inscription to the effect that it had been bought by Charles Kean at the sale of Horace Walpole's collection. It is a felt hat with a brim about six inches wide all round, and a rather high crown; the color was, doubtless, a bright red originally, but now it is mottled with a grayish hue, and there are cracks in the brim, as if the hat had seen a good deal of wear. I suppose a far greater curiosity than this is the signet-ring of one of the Pharaohs, who reigned over Egypt during Joseph's prime ministry,--a large ring to be worn on the thumb, if at all,--of massive gold, seal part and all, and inscribed with some characters that looked like Hebrew. I had <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> <b>before</b> in Mr. Mayer's collection in Liverpool. The mediaeval and English relics, however, interested me more,--such as the golden and enamelled George worn by Sir Thomas More; or the embroidered shirt of Charles I.,--the very one, I presume, which he wore at his execution. There are no blood-marks on it, it being very nicely washed and folded. The texture of the linen cloth--if linen it be--is coarser than any peasant would wear at this day, but the needle-work is exceedingly fine and elaborate. Another relic of the same period,--the Cavalier General Sir Jacob Astley's buff-coat, with his belt and sword; the leather of the buff-coat, for I took it between my fingers, is about a quarter of an inch thick, of the same material as a wash-leather glove, and by no means smoothly dressed, though the sleeves are covered with silver-lace. Of old armor, there are admirable specimens; and it makes one's head ache to look at the iron pots which men used to thrust their heads into. Indeed, at one period they seem to have worn an inner iron cap underneath the helmet. I doubt whether there ever was any age of chivalry. [...] . It certainly was no chivalric sentiment that made men case themselves in impenetrable iron, and ride about in iron prisons, fearfully peeping at their enemies through little slits and gimlet-holes. The unprotected breast of a private soldier must have shamed his leaders in those days. The point of honor is very different now.|$|E
