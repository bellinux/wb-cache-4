5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} <b>slash</b> at its prey.

In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or <b>slash.</b> The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
