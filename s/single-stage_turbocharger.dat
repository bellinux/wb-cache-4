25|$|The ALTUS II, {{the first}} of the two craft to be completed, made its first flight on May 1, 1996. With its engine at first {{augmented}} by a <b>single-stage</b> <b>turbocharger,</b> the ALTUS II reached an altitude of 37,000ft during its first series of development flights at Dryden in August, 1996. In October of that year, the ALTUS II was flown in an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM-UAV) study in Oklahoma conducted by Sandia National Laboratories for the Department of Energy. During the course of those flights, the ALTUS II set a single-flight endurance record for remotely operated aircraft of more than 26 hours. In October 1996, ALTUS II set an endurance record for UAVs carrying science payloads. The vehicle spent more than 24 hours at the required altitude during an ARM-UAV.|$|E

40|$|Several {{turbocharger}} units can be {{used for}} engine boosting in series or parallel arrangements in which they are phased in and out according to the operating conditions of the engine. This technology has the potential to facilitate downsizing of automotive engines in order to yield benefits in terms of their transient performance, the fuel consumption and emissions output. This review investigates the benefits and drawbacks of series and parallel turbocharging arrangements. Since the effectiveness of using the boosting technology crucially depends on the control scheme applied, developments in the modelling and control approaches used in single-stage, series and parallel turbocharging are also examined. In comparison with <b>single-stage</b> <b>turbocharging,</b> using several turbochargers in series or parallel can provide a faster transient response without compromising the fuel consumption, while also having the potential to provide higher boost pressures. Novel non-linear and robust control approaches have demonstrated improvements in performance and robustness over traditional approaches used in commercial engine control relying on separate control loops for the different engine variables...|$|R
40|$|The Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) {{concept is}} an {{approach}} {{which has been}} proved to significantly reduce the averaged back pressure of turbocharged engines whilst still improving its combustion phasing. The standard layout of the DEP system comprises of two separately-functioned exhaust valves with one valve feeding the blow-down pulse to the turbine whilst the other valve targeting the scavenging behaviour by bypassing the turbine. Via combining the characteristics of both turbocharged engines and naturally aspirated engines, this method can provide large BSFC improvement. The DEP concept has only been applied to <b>single-stage</b> <b>turbocharged</b> engines so far. However, it in its basic form {{is in no way}} restricted to a single-stage system. This paper, for the first time, will apply DEP concept to a regulated two-stage (R 2 S) downsized SI engine. By controlling the timing of the exhaust valves separately to feed the exhaust mass flow to the high-pressure turbine or the low-pressure turbine or the exhaust pipe, it is anticipated that such system could achieve even better breathing characteristics than the standard one-stage turbocharged engine. The simulation was carried out on a heavily downsized R 2 S turbocharged SI engine model. As the major objective of this project is to explore the gas exchange process for the DEP-based R 2 S downsized engine, the knock model in the system is ignored. The results showed that PMEP is significantly improved over the entire engine speed and BSFC was decreased by up to 3 % with minimum modification of the original system. The system also showed the potential benefit for knock sensitivity and it is considered that by adding the knock model, there will be some more BSFC improvement...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIncreasing {{the degrees}} of freedom in the air path has become a popular {{way to reduce the}} fuel {{consumption}} and pollutant emissions of modern combustion engines. That is why technical definitions will usually contain components such as multi or <b>single-stage</b> <b>turbocharger,</b> throttle, exhaust gas recirculation loops, wastegate, variable valve timing or phasing, etc. One of the biggest challenges is to precisely quantify the gas flows through the engine. They include fresh and burnt gases, with trapping and scavenging phenomena. An accurate prediction of these values leads to an efficient control of the engine air fuel ratio and torque. Fuel consumption and pollutant emissions are then minimized. In this paper, we propose to use an artificial neural networkbased model as a prediction tool for the engine volumetric efficiency. Results are presented for a downsized turbocharged spark-ignited engine, equipped with inlet and outlet variable valve timing. The calibration process that is used in this study only requires steady-state operating points. The validation stage was conducted on both steady-state and vehicle transients. Model prediction is in very good agreement with experimental results while keeping a very low calibration effort and matching embedded computational requirements. The conclusion stresses that thanks to their generic structure, neural models offer an interesting potential for generalization to even more complex technical definitions...|$|E
40|$|Engine {{downsizing}} is {{a proven}} approach to reduce CO 2 emissions and improve fuel economy, but {{the approach is}} predicated on achieving high specific power without compromising reliability, drivability, or cost. One approach to engine downsizing is advanced pressure charging, placing challenging demands upon the pressure charging system. This paper addresses engine downsizing in the embodiment of a high performance and high specific power 2. 0 L gasoline engine simulated using Ricardo WAVE software. With best available conventional, <b>single-stage</b> <b>turbocharger</b> technology, the boosting system requires augmentation to maintain the same steady-state torque profile as a naturally aspirated engine of the same power and also to maintain an acceptable transient response, particularly at lower engine speeds. Having specified the requirements for the boosting system in a demanding engine downsizing application, the simulation incorporated an Aeristech 48 V high speed permanent magnet electric supercharger, connected in series with the conventional turbocharger, to augment {{the performance of the}} boosting system. The engine and boosting system was then tuned to produce a relatively consistent torque delivery of the engine across a range of engine speeds, in steady-state and transient conditions, indicating that the downsized engine with the electric supercharger would likely exhibit acceptable levels of responsiveness and desirability...|$|E
40|$|The engine concept {{partially}} premixed combustion (PPC) {{has proved}} higher gross indicated efficiency compared to conventional diesel combustion engines. The relatively simple {{implementation of the}} concept is an advantage, however, high gas exchange losses has made its use challenging in multi-cylinder heavy duty engines. With high rates of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to dilute the charge and hence limit the combustion rate, the resulting exhaust temperatures are low. The selected boost system must therefore be efficient {{which could lead to}} large, complex and costly solutions. In the presented work experiments and modelling were combined to evaluate different turbocharger configurations for the PPC concept. Experiments were performed on a multi-cylinder engine. The engine was modified to incorporate long route EGR and a <b>single-stage</b> <b>turbocharger,</b> however, with compressed air from the building being optionally supplied to the compressor. Experimental combustion heat release rates and boundary conditions were used to validate a simulation model. This model was then used to compare three different turbochargers: two single-stage turbochargers and one two-stage. The whole speed and load range was covered in the simulations to determine the engine performance. The influence of high EGR rates as well as the effect of charge air and EGR cooler gas outlet temperatures were also investigated. The simulation results showed that the two-stage turbocharger was able to give the highest load over the whole speed range with a brake mean effective pressure of 25. 6 bar, whereas the two single-stage turbochargers reached 22. 2 and 23. 1 bar respectively. The average brake efficiency was 39. 3, 39. 7 and 40. 2 %. It was found that decreasing the inlet temperature is critical for obtaining high loads and system efficiencies. Finally, it was shown that the optimal amount of EGR was dependent on the turbocharger efficiency and cooler temperatures...|$|E
