40|$|The {{quality of}} {{magnetite}} pellet is primarily {{determined by the}} physico-chemical changes the pellet undergoes as it makes excursion through the gaseous and thermal environment in the induration furnace. Among these physico-chemical processes, the oxidation of magnetite phase and the sintering of oxidized magnetite (hematite) and magnetite (non-oxidized) phases are vital. Rates of these processes not only depend on the thermal and gaseous environment the pellet gets exposed in the induration reactor but also interdependent on each other. Therefore, a systematic study should involve understanding these processes in isolation {{to the extent possible}} and quantify them seeking the physics. With this motivation, the present paper focusses on investigating the sintering kinetics of oxidized magnetite pellet. For the current investigation, sintering experiments were carried out on pellets containing more than 95 pct magnetite concentrate from LKAB's mine, dried and oxidized to completion at sufficiently low temperature to avoid sintering. The sintering behavior of this oxidized pellet is quantified through shrinkage captured by Optical Dilatometer. The extent of sintering characterized by <b>sintering</b> <b>ratio</b> found to follow a power law with time i. e., Kt(n). The rate constant K for sintering was determined for different temperatures from isothermal experiments.

Further, the sintering kinetic equation was also extended to a non-isothermal environment and validated using laboratory experiments.

Results show that the content of <b>sinter</b> of different <b>ratio</b> of Sijiaying iron ore are simple, the content of metal phase are magnetite and hematite, binding phases mainly are calcium ferrite and dicalcium silicate, and the contents of calcium ferrite are higher. The whole microstructure of sinter is uniform, which is interweaving corroded structure. The magnetites are major tiny allotriomorphic crystal. The shape of calcium ferrite is needle-like. The quality of sinter can meet the production request when the proportions of Sijiaying iron ore are from 50 % to 100 %. Iron ore of Sijiaying mine belongs to Anshan-type iron deposit, and the iron ore is one of existing larger scale iron mining which has not yet developed at the present[1]. And now, {{because of lack of}} iron ore resources at home and abroad, how to make full use of the local iron ore resources, especially effective use of local higher grade of self-produced iron ore concentrates, is a arduous problem to many steel enterprises[2, 3]. In order to reduce the sintering raw material costs and make full use of local resources, this paper has studied the structure {{and quality of}} sinter of different proportions of Sijiaying iron ore, which mainly provide reasonable technical parameters for production.

40|$|In this report, Silicon wafer based multi-layered {{print circuit}} board is presented. The {{developed}} stacked circuit board {{will lead to}} realization of 3 dimensional MEMS packaging. The through holes and trenches were formed by ICP Si deep etching and the stacked layered structure was prepared with Si fusion bonding of ICP etched wafers. Metal was filled into ICP fabricated through holes and trenches to make electrical feed through. Four Silicon wafers with ICP through holes are aligned and successfully joined by fusion bonding. The target application of this work is multi-layered Silicon based print circuit board. The electrical feed through was fabricated by injecting the Ag (80 wt%) + Cu(20 wt %) mixed with binder, low melting temperature metal, and Ag electrical conductive paste into the small diameter through holes and trenches in oxidized Silicon wafer stacked structure. A multi-component binder system comprising of EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate 35 wt%) + PW (Paraffin Wax 65 wt%) was used. Super critical debinding method is applied prior to final <b>sintering</b> process. The <b>ratio</b> of metal powder and binder was optimized. Low melting point metal and electrical conductive paste filling methods were also tried by injection and vacuum extraction. SEM observation shows that the through holes are filled with metal for a single wafer. However we have still difficulty in filling the metal into four wafers stacked layer. The electrical conductivity test was sufficient between top and bottom. Several feed through formation methods have been proposed...|$|R
40|$|Constrained {{sintering}} is {{a common}} step during the fabrication of devices such as integrated circuit boards, ceramic gas sensors or low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) modules. Due to the layered nature of those components, special challenges arise since in-plane stresses due to the geometrical constraint imposed by the substrate may cause damage and loss of functionality. Possible damage scenarios are delamination along the film-substrate interface, cracking of preexisting flaws or mud-cracking. The degree of constraint and thus {{the magnitude of the}} stresses depend {{on the nature of the}} interface, which in turn is influenced by factors such as material, substrate roughness and feature size. Due to the high cost of prototyping, prediction of the sintering behavior of different features by simulation methods is desirable. Like this, near-net shape fabrication of patterned films is achievable. In this work, patterned alumina features with thicknesses ranging from 5 µm to 32 µm and lateral dimensions between 10 µm and 500 µm have been fabricated using micro-molding in capillaries. Stripes with and without intentionally introduced flaws as well as ring structures are available. The influence of the substrate properties are studied by comparison of smooth and rough as well as plain and platinum coated sapphire substrates. Experiments are repeated with a liquid phase sintering aid in case of the smooth sapphire substrates. Vertical and lateral strain data are analyzed using white light interferometry as well as scanning electron microscopy. Stripe cross sections display lateral and vertical density gradients, leading to a high density skin at all free surfaces that encloses a porous area near the substrate. Elongated pores oriented perpendicular to the substrate are found in the stripe center, whereas pores near the edge are less oriented. Edge delamination is present in all materials and increases with decreasing thickness-to-width ratio of the ceramic stripes. Lateral and vertical sintering strains are characterized; the former are found to be strongly dependent on feature size and achieve values close to the vertical strains in the case of narrow features, whereas strong enhancement of the vertical strains and near-zero lateral strains are characteristic of the wider stripes. Substrate roughness leads to decreasing lateral strains, reduced delamination and lower densification. An intermediate platinum layer allows for larger lateral strains despite lower delamination by accommodation of lateral stresses. The degree of constraint is quantified by using the vertical-to-lateral strain ratio. All studied materials show a transition from quasi-free <b>sintering</b> behavior (<b>ratios</b> close to unity) at high thickness-to-width ratios and perfect constraint (ratios above unity) at low ratios. The transition occurs at lower ratios when metallic interlayers are present, thus reducing the degree of constraint. When a liquid phase sintering aid is present, quasi-free sintering behavior is found at lower thickness-to-width ratios than in case of solid state sintered structures. The above mentioned strain data are used to calculate the interface friction coefficient. The latter is found to follow model predictions and is used to predict the shrinkage behavior of ring structures. In addition, intentionally introduced flaws show cracking during sintering. Their propensity to crack is greater in narrow stripes; in addition, the proximity of the stripe edge results in oriented cracks perpendicular to the stripe edge. Wide stripes experience radial cracking. The degree of cracking depends on the lateral strain experienced by the overall stripe, which in turn is determined by material and substrate roughness. In-situ environmental scanning electron microscope pictures prove that crack propagation occurs via micro-crack coalescence in oriented cracks. The experimental data in this work have been placed at the disposal of simulation experts who have provided simulations using the discrete element and finite element methods. These simulation results reproduce important experimental findings such as lower sintered density in stripes on rough substrates as well as delamination and shape distortion during sintering. ...|$|R
