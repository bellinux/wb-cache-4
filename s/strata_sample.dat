Instrument testing included internal consistency, test-retest reliability, interrater reliability, item analyses, and an assessment of the objectivity. To render variation in scores, a random <b>strata</b> <b>sample</b> of 60 nursing documentations was drawn. The strata represented 30 nursing documentations with and 30 without application of theory based, standardised nursing language. Internal consistency of the subscale nursing diagnoses as process showed Cronbach's Alpha 0. 83 [0. 78, 0. 88]; nursing diagnoses as product 0. 98 [0. 94, 0. 99]; nursing interventions 0. 90 [0. 85, 0. 94]; and nursing-sensitive patient outcomes 0. 99 [0. 95, 0. 99]. With Cohen's Kappa of 0. 95, the intrarater reliability was good. The interrater reliability showed a Kappa of 0. 94 [0. 90, 0. 96]. Item analyses confirmed the fulfilment of criteria for degree of difficulty and discriminative validity of the items. In this study, Q-DIO has shown to be a reliable instrument.

40|$|Jurassic palynomorphs {{dominate}} samples 1, 3 - 6 and 10; {{these are}} {{virtually all of}} Callovian-Oxfordian age. Some minor evidence of Carboniferous and Toarcian reworking was also observed. Exclusively Callovian and Oxfordian index species are common, and forms that are indicative of the late Callovian-early Oxfordian interval are especially abundant. This indicates the incorporation of significant levels of the Oxford Clay Formation. Smaller levels of recycling from the Cornbrash and Kellaways formations are also present. These lithostratigraphical assessments indicate that this Jurassic input was local, and probably derived from the Spalding-Sleaford area of south Lincolnshire to the north-east. Sample 2 yielded a sparse palynoflora, indicating some input from probable marine Quaternary sediments; no evidence of the reworking of Palaeozoic or Mesozoic strata is present. Sample 7 produced a sparse palynoflora indicating input from Carboniferous, Jurassic/?Cretaceous and probable terrestrial Quaternary <b>strata.</b> <b>Sample</b> 8 comprises isolated chalk pebbles from a chalky till and produced a sparse palynoflora. No stratigraphically diagnostic taxa were encountered. The sparseness of the dinoflagellate cyst associations indicates that the Chalk in this sample is not from the Upper Chalk.

Low numbers of ?Rugospora spp., a Lower Carboniferous spore, and indeterminate dinoflagellate cysts were also observed.

40|$|In Chapter 1, {{a natural}} semiparametric model for {{case control study}} data is discussed, and the {{asymptotic}} properties of two simple methods of estimation are explored. The probability element of the model can be factored into a known positive function h involving the finite dimensional structural parameter, an infinite dimensional nuisance parameter {{in the form of}} the probability element dP of a distribution, and a normalizing constant. In the setup of interest, a sample of size n is available from a population with a distribution from the aforementioned model. A second, independent sample provides information only about the infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter P. The methods of estimation involve replacing the infinite-dimensional parameter with the empirical distribution function based on the second sample, and constructing semiparametric analogs of the maximum likelihood estimator and the method of moment estimator. The simplicity of these semiparametric estimators permits analysis of their asymptotic distribution even when n and m grow at different rates, yielding very natural and interpretable asymptotic results. In the case where n=o(m), the analog of the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically efficient. Chapter 2 explores a related parametric asymptotic statistics problem. Suppose a sample of size m is available from a population with density f Y(y; lambda), and an independent sample of size n is available from a population with density f X(x;lambda,alpha). Here &lambda is regarded as a nuisance parameter and &alpha is the structural parameter, where &lambda and &alpha are scalars. One approach to estimation of &alpha would be to compute the maximum likelihood estimator based on both samples. A second approach would be to first find the maximum likelihood estimator of &lambda from the first sample, and to then treat it as the true parameter when using maximum likelihood estimation based on the second sample. Chapter 2 compares the asymptotic behavior of these two estimators under different assumptions about the rate of growth of m relative to n. In chapter 3 we consider interval estimation for small area proportions based on data collected under stratified random sampling. We focus on the case where the <b>stratum</b> <b>sample</b> sizes and the true proportions are small for all strata, and for simplicity we assume equal <b>stratum</b> <b>sample</b> sizes. The objective is to construct a confidence interval for each of the true stratum proportions, P i. A commonly used small area empirical Bayes model for a single stratum's true proportion P i assumes that the distributions of the <b>sampled</b> <b>stratum</b> proportions and the prior distribution of the true stratum proportions are normal. The well-documented problems of the normal approximation to the binomial, particularly when the sample size is small and the probability of success is close to 0 or 1, raise questions about the adequacy of such a model when the P i and the <b>stratum</b> <b>sample</b> sizes are small. We argue that a more reasonable model in this setting is to assume that the <b>sampled</b> <b>stratum</b> counts have binomial distributions and that the prior distribution of the true stratum proportions follows a beta distribution. We propose a new empirical Bayes confidence interval based on this model, and examine related simulation results...|$|R

A careless sampling may introduce an important bias. This paper illustrates the risk of bias and the efficiency improvements of systematic, pps (probability proportional to size) and stratified sampling. A sampling method is proposed with the following criteria: a) Unbiased estimators are easy to compute, b) it can be combined with a stratification c) within each <b>stratum,</b> <b>sampling</b> probability is proportional to the area of the sampling unit, and d) the geographic distribution of the sample is reasonably homogeneous. Thiessen polygons computed on image centres are sampled through a systematic grid of points. The sampling rates in different strata are tuned by dividing the systematic grid into subgrids or replicates and taking for each stratum a certain number of replicates. The approach is illustrated with an application to the estimation of the geometric accuracy of Image 2000, a Landsat ETM+ mosaic of the European Union. JRC. G. 3 -Agricultur...|$|R
