(1) The temperature of the drilling tool is raised by decreasing the heat capacity of the drill. B-RING damage around the drilled hole is especially generated under drilling conditions using the super-high-speed <b>spindle</b> and micro <b>diameter</b> drill. (2) B-RING is mainly caused by the heat being conducted to the hole wall of the PWB. (3) Raising the R point height is an effective method for preventing B-RING damage.

In this study, self-lubricating flow was modelled experimentally by shearing water-in-oil emulsions in a Couette cell device (viscometer). Bitumen and two commercially available lube oils (N-Brightstock and Shellflex 81 0) were tested. Dispersed phase water concentrations ranged from 10 to 35 wt%. The ability to produce self-lubricating flow w{{as a function of}} dispersed phase water concentration, temperature, oil viscosity, spindle speed and spindle size (gap width). For tests conducted at constant temperature, the critical spindle speed required to achieve self-lubricating flow was found to decrease with increasing water concentration. The critical spindle speed at which self-lubricating flow was achieved was found to increase with increasing temperature for the emulsions tested. Flow maps showing the critical spindle speed as a function of temperature indicate a clearly delineated transition region between viscous (non-lubricating) and self-lubricating flow. The critical spindle speed required to achieve self-lubricating flow was found to be similar when the viscosities of different oils were matched by varying the operating temperature.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the dynamic response and optimal {{design of a}} lathe spindle under experimentally measured random cutting force excitations. The optimal design is based on minimizing the maximum mean square displacement response of the workpiece under the action of random cutting forces. The stochastic partial differential equation of motion characterizing {{the behavior of a}} lathe spindle-workpiece system is formulated based on the Euler-Bernoulli equation. A finite element method using beam elements is used for free vibration analysis to compute the undamped mode shapes and the natural frequencies of the spindle-workpiece system. The workpiece support at the running center has been modelled as hinged or fixed support and the theoretical results are compared with the laboratory experiments to classify the nature of the support condition. Based on the results, the end condition at the running center is classified as hinged. The effect of varying the spindle-bearing stiffness on the natural frequencies and mode shapes are also presented. The forced vibration of the spindle-workpiece system is studied by first investigating the nonstationary random response of a workpiece subjected to a constantly varying cutting tool contact in a turning operation. The results indicate that the workpiece response at the cutting tool is not significantly influenced by the tool feed rate for normal turning operations. A modal analysis in conjunction with the finite element technique is then used to calculate the mean square displacement of the workpiece. The experimentally calculated power spectral density of the cutting forces is used as the input excitation to the mathematical model. A parametric study of the effect of bearing stiffness and damping, bearing spacing, sectional rigidity, and external damper on the mean square displacement is presented.

SAE 1040 steel samples were drilled, making holes with 5 mm diameter twist drill bits in continuous feed. The drill bits were modified with “artificial” (produced by spark-erosion) and “real” (obtained by regular mechanical use) failures such as different degrees of wear in the cutting edge and the outer corner. For every drilled hole, torque and AE were simultaneously measured and acquired. In {{the first part of}} this work, the correlation between the AE parameters and torque measured during the drilling process is studied. Torque was measured as a control parameter to follow the dynamic behaviour of the drill bit. An alternative AE feature, called Mean Power (MP) showed a good correlation with torque when the moving average (MA) was computed. In the second part, the AE mean power (MP) was related to different degrees of wear in drill bits. Clusters for the different levels of wear in a 2 -D plot were obtained.

Regression model is generated with the help of SPSS- 19. Statistical validity, explanatory power and significance of the regression model is tested at 95 % confidence interval. High degree of correlation between drilling parameters and thrust force/torque has been found with almost negligible interaction amongst the drilling process parameter.

In contrast to this observation, the later-stage cells were large and oval-shaped, and the long diameter reached more than 40  µm. These cells were complicated, very large and had multi-lobed nuclei (Fig.  4 a–c). Furthermore, nuclear phase analysis revealed the existence of cells with more than 8  N ploidy (Fig.  4 d). These cells were larger in size than other frog hematopoietic cells. Taken together, these data also indicated that the FUHEN cell line was a thrombocytic cell line. The FUHEN cell line was continuously maintained in suspension culture for more than 8  years. The culture usually contained both normal- and large-size cells, and the large cells were likely mature cells because they had complicated and multi-lobed nuclei. Furthermore, the cloned single, normal-sized cells proliferated, resulting {{in the production of}} many large cells. Thus, the culture always contained both immature and mature cells, and the small FUHEN cells were the progenitors of large cells. If the small cells were only progenitor cells, all the cells would have disappeared due to differentiation into large cells; however, the progenitor cells were always present in the culture. This suggested that the progenitor cells have the ability to self-renew. The small FUHEN cells could differentiate into the mature (large) cells and could also produce more of themselves. The identification of the factor that determines the fate of FUHEN cells, whether self-renewal or differentiation, represents future work.|$|R

40|$|A tendência da fabricação de moldes e matrizes é utilizar a tecnologia de usinagem HSM (High Speed Machining), pois esta pode produzir superfícies com melhor qualidade. Isto é possível, pois pode-se aumentar o número de passes laterais de um molde, sem que haja perdas de tempo de ciclo de usinagem, melhorando assim a qualidade do produto. No entanto, com a crescente utilização desta tecnologia, o perfil gerado de uma superfície usinada com uma fresa de ponta esférica, é alterado. Isto ocorre porque, normalmente, é possível medir-se a rugosidade em duas direções, obtendo-se em cada uma delas um valor de rugosidade máxima: um é o pico (crista) entre passes laterais e o outro é a altura de crista entre avanços por dente sucessivos. Cada um deles tem maior importância em função dos parâmetros utilizados. Estudar os fatores que alteram o perfil de rugosidade se faz, portanto, necessário. O objetivo deste trabalho é verificar experimentalmente como os parâmetros de usinagem: avanço por dente, passe lateral, diâmetro da ferramenta, ângulo de inclinação do eixo axial da ferramenta de corte e direção de corte (unidirecional ou bidirecional) influenciam o perfil de rugosidade e a rugosidade máxima, além de criar um modelo matemático que possa prever estas alterações. Foi mostrado neste trabalho que o perfil de rugosidade para corte unidirecional é diferente do corte bidirecional, e que, à medida que a relação entre avanço por aresta e passe lateral cresce, a rugosidade máxima também aumenta. Mas, ao se inclinar o eixo axial da ferramenta e aumentar o diâmetro da fresa esférica a rugosidade máxima diminui. Em resumo, este trabalho visa mostrar quais são os fatores que influenciam o acabamento de superfícies usinadas com fresas de topo esférico em condições, cuja relação entre o passe lateral e avanço por dente são típicas da HSM. The {{trend in}} molds and dies {{manufacturing}} {{is the use}} of the HSM (High Speed Machining) technology, since it is able to produce surfaces with a better quality. This is possible because the number of radial passes, can be increased without lossing in the machining cycle times, enhancing the product quality. But with the arising utilization of this technology, the generated profile in a surface machined with a ball nose end milling cutter is changed. This happens because, it is usually possible to measure the surface roughness in two directions, getting in each of them a maximum surface roughness value: {{one of them is the}} peak to valley height between radial passes and the other one is the same parameter between successive feed per tooth. Each of them has major importance depending on the used cutting parameters. To study the factors that change the surface roughness profile is, therefore, necessary. The goal of this work is experimentally verify how the cutting parameters: feed per tooth, radial pass, tool <b>diameter,</b> <b>spindle</b> inclination angle and cutting direction (unidirectional or bidirectional) influences the surface roughness profile and the peak to valley roughness, besides of creating a mathematical model able to predict these changes. It was showed in this work that the surface roughness profile generated in a unidirectional cut is different of the profile generated in a bidirectional cut and that, as the ratio between feed per tooth and radial pass increases the same happens with the peak to valley surface roughness. But when the spindle is tilt and the ball nose cutting tool diameter is bigger the surface roughness decreases. This work aims to show which are the factors that influences the finishing of surfaces milled with ball nose end milling cutters using conditions whose ratio between the radial pass and feed per tooth are typical of HSM...|$|R
