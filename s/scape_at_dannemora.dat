The number of workers who obtained their support from the mine {{is likely to be}} several hundred. In each mine large quantities of wood would used in mining, a method not abandoned until the 1730s. The reason for this was partly out of fear that gunpowder would be more expensive than wood, but also for danger's sake.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Dannemora</b> mine <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora,</b> Sweden {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} iron ore mines in Sweden. The mine was closed by its owners SSAB in 1992. It may have been open since the 13th century, but the first documentary reference was in 1481. The mine supplied all the ironworks making oregrounds iron by the Walloon process (using a blast furnace and finery forge), such as Österby and Leufsta (now Lövsta). Their products were particularly pure iron, due the manganese content of the iron ore. This made it the best material for conversion to blister steel, the main variety of steel made in Great Britain between the 1610s and the 1850s. The mine has a depth of 640 metres.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Hamlin, New York, the son of Irish {{immigrants}} Thomas Elliott and Martha Jane Elliott (nee Rowley). As a child he was a devout Methodist, {{and at one point}} his parents wanted him to be a minister. As a young boy Elliott recounts that he read of the first use of the electric chair and wondered what it might be like to throw the switch at an execution. He became employed in the prison service as a regular electrician, ultimately in charge of the power-house <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> Prison in upstate New York. In that capacity he remotely assisted Edwin Davis <b>at</b> electrocutions <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> State Prison. Initially his involvement was to change the armatures on the generator in the power house, so that it would temporarily produce enough power to send over high-tension wires to the electric chair elsewhere in the prison complex. In his Memoirs - [...] "Agent of Death" [...] (see below) he recounted that when Davis visited Dannemora to conduct executions, that he would be invited to dinner at Elliott's nearby house. This on-the-job training and personal rapport with Davis ultimately stood him in good stead in 1926 when he applied for and accepted the post of [...] "State electrician", which had just fallen vacant by John Hulbert. On January 28, 1926 he officiated at his first execution, the double electrocution of Emil Klatt and Luigi Rapito. Although not wearing a mask or a hood, he tried to conceal his identity at first, not revealing his name. For each execution he was paid the same fee of $150.|$|R

40|$|Sandvik Rock Tools is {{operating}} in a highly competitive market. This requires them to constantly improve the efficiency of their organization, {{in order for them}} to maintain their position as market leaders, both in a short-term and a long-term perspective. Sandvik Rock Tools is currently working on developing and further improving their supply chain. The supply chain is a key organizational function and improvements of the supply chain aim to yield benefits like lowered total costs and better utilized inventory levels. The purpose of our work has been to develop the supply chain between Sandvik’s in-market warehouse and their customer site <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora.</b> The main focus of this thesis has been to enable automatic data collection and to lower the stock levels at the customer site in Dannemora. This would be accomplished by improving the information flow between the two entities in the observed supply chain and by enabling real-time inventory information, easily accessible to the warehouse manager. A barcode system was implemented in the warehouse <b>at</b> the <b>Dannemora</b> customer site and was integrated with warehouse management software that was developed by the authors. The implemented barcode system and the warehouse management software were used <b>at</b> the <b>Dannemora</b> customer site for a period of two months.  The effects of the implemented barcode system working in combination with the warehouse management software were observed in several operational areas after implementation, and the results were positive and beneficial. Firstly, the barcode system and warehouse management software simplified the warehouse manager’s decision process, by providing easy access to necessary warehouse management information, like realtime inventory information. Secondly, it made the day-to-day work routine of the warehouse manager easier, this being the case because the barcode system that had been implemented had digitalized and automated many tasks that had previously been performed manually by warehouse manager. An excellent example would be the simplified process for order placement and stocktaking. Thirdly, it improved the information flow between the Dannemora customer site and Sandvik’s in-market warehouse in Sandviken, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the entire supply chain, through shared information. The barcode implementation successfully lowered inventory levels by six percent on average...|$|R

500|$|Hippeastrum hybrids and cultivars {{are valued}} for their large {{ornamental}} flowers, particularly for indoor cultivation during {{the northern hemisphere}} winter. The larger the bulb, the more flowers it will produce. The largest bulbs measure 14 to 16 inches (36 to 41cm) in circumference and will produce three or more scapes (flower stems) with four or more blooms each. The commonest bulbs measure 10½ to 12½ inches (27 to 32cm) with two scapes with four to six flowers each depending on the cultivar. Some bulbs put up two flower <b>scapes</b> <b>at</b> the same time; others may wait several weeks between blooms and sometimes the second scape will have {{only two or three}} flowers rather than the usual four. A bulb needs to produce large, healthy leaves in the summer growing season before it can send up a scape the following year. Bulbs are often described by the country of origin of the bulb producers, since they may have different characteristics, e.g. 'Dutch Amaryllis', 'South African Amarylllis'. Dutch bulbs usually produce flowers first, then, after they have finished blooming (hysteranthous), the plant will begin growing leaves. [...] Bulbs from the South African growers usually put up a <b>scape</b> and leaves <b>at</b> the same time (synanthous).|$|R

Several days later, Gurino used a contact, corrupt Queens County Deputy Sherriff William Cassele, to enter the county's civil prison on the night of March 29, 1940. Cassele then forced Joseph [...] "Joe the Baker" [...] Liberto, who was being held as a material witness in the George Rudnick murder, to meet with Gurino.

5000|$|After mob boss Charles [...] "Lucky" [...] Luciano {{was imprisoned}} for pandering, Anastasio {{allegedly}} organized the arson sabotage of the French luxury liner SS Normandie. Early in 1942, {{a few months}} after the U.S. entered World War II, the brothers hit upon a clever scheme. The U.S. Navy at the time was concerned about the dangers of possible acts of sabotage against warships berthed at Brooklyn and Manhattan docks. The brothers made a deal with the Navy to release Luciano, and in return the mob would guarantee the safety of the docks as far as the Navy's interests were concerned. To get the Navy concerned they created a maritime disaster: Anastasio had been aware that over the last few months agents of naval intelligence had been scouting the Brooklyn and Manhattan waterfront looking for Italians and Germans who might be involved in a plot to sabotage Navy shipping. A French luxury liner, the SS Normandie, was being hastily converted into a troop transport and was docked at a Hudson River pier. Anthony and his brother Albert claimed they decided to sabotage the Normandie. The fire that broke out the afternoon of February 9, 1942, became one of the most spectacular in New York City's history. For hours the Normandie burned, until, listing heavily to port from all the water she had taken on, the ship finally capsized along the pier. The destruction of the Normandie prompted the Navy to approach the mob. The Navy won a guarantee that there would be no sabotaging of shipping in New York Harbor.

The third plant likewise produced at first only single-flowered scapes, with the flowers rather small and of a darker yellow; but it perished early. The second plant also died in September; and the first plant, though all three grew under very favourable conditions, looked very sickly.
