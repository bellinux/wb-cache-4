40|$|Abstract. The {{brain is}} one of the most common sites for the {{metastasis}} of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The present study describes two cases of an isolated <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> as a relapse of SCLC, which occurred more than one year after the completion of the initial successful treatment for SCLC. The tumors were identified during a regular check‑up computed tomography (CT) scan and were successfully treated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the cases of two patients with an isolated <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> as a relapse of SCLC. Although extremely rare, the possibility of such recurrences should be considered, particularly in patients who have refused prophylactic cranial irradiation...|$|E
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} ranks 5 th in {{prevalence and}} 3 rd in cancer mortality worldwide. The prognosis {{of this disease}} is very poor: the 5 -year survival rate was not more than 3 – 5 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> {{is a major}} {{complication}} of breast cancer. This study aimed to analyze the effect of age and biological subtype on the risk and timing of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> in breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified subtypes of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast by determining estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER 2 status. Time to <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> according to age and cancer subtype was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: Of the 2248 eligible patients, 164 (7. 3 %) developed <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> over a median follow-up of 54. 2 months. Age 35 or younger, HER 2 -enriched subtype, and triple-negative breast cancer were significant risk factors of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Among patients aged 35 or younger, the risk of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was independent of biological subtype (P =  0. 507). Among patients aged 36 - 59 or > 60 years, those with triple-negative or HER 2 -enriched subtypes had consistently increased risk of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis,</b> as compared with those with luminal A tumors. Patients with luminal B tumors had higher risk of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> than luminal A only in patients > 60 years. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer subtypes are associated with differing risks of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> among different age groups.

The purpose of this report was to clarify cumulative inci-dence and risk factors for <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma, and to consider recommended treatments for <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> from esophageal carcinoma. We reviewed 391 patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Median age was 65 years. Clinical stages were I, II, III, and IV in 32, 47, 150, and 162 patients, respectively. Brain imaging was performed usually when patients revealed neurological symptoms. The 3 -year cumulative incidence of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> after chemoradio-therapy was 6. 6 %. There were 4 patients with single metastasis and 8 with multiple metastases. Initial clinical stages were II, III, and IV in 1, 2, and 9 patients, respectively. Histology included squamous cell carcinoma in 10 patients and others in 2 patients. Univariate analysis demonstrated M factor, distant lymph node relapse, and recurrent lung and liver metastasis as significant risk factors of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> (P < 0. 05). Median survival time after diagnosis of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was 2. 1 months. <b>Brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was {{not directly related to}} cause of mortality.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Brain metastases {{are common in}} non-small cell lung cancer. Usual treatments include radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, these methods result in poor patient prognosis. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the effectiveness of surgical resection in the multimodality management of non-small cell lung cancer patients with synchronous <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Methods The clinical data of 46 non-small cell lung cancer patients with synchronous <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent surgical resection of primary lung tumor, followed by whole brain radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In addition, 13 out of the 46 patients underwent resection of brain metastasis, whereas the remaining 33 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery. Results The median survival time of the enrolled patients was 16. 8 months. The 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -year survival rates were 76. 1 %, 20. 9 %, and 4. 7 %, respectively. The median survival times of the patients with brain metastasis resection or stereotactic radiosurgery were 18. 3 and 15. 8 months, respectively (P= 0. 091, 2).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Brain metastases {{following}} radical radiotherapy for non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) are a recognised phenomenon; however, {{the incidence of}} symptomatic <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> is currently unknown. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify the number of patients, staged in accordance with National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance, who developed symptomatic <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> following radical radiotherapy. There are two aims: to evaluate NICE guidance; and to provide vital information on the likely benefit of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in reducing neurological symptoms from <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> METHODS: A retrospective review of 455 patients with NSCLC who had undergone radical radiotherapy in 2009 and 2010 was performed. Computer-based systems were used to identify patient and tumour demographics, the staging procedures performed and whether brain imaging had identified <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> in the follow-up period. RESULTS: The total number of patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> within 6 months was 3. 7 %. The proportion of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> within 6 months in Stage I, II and III NSCLC throughout both years was 2. 8 %, 1. 0 % and 5. 7 %, respectively. Within the follow-up period (median 16 months, range 6 - 30 months), the total number of patients who developed symptomatic <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was 7. 9 %. CONCLUSION: Patients staged in accordance with NICE guidance, of whom only 7. 7 % underwent brain staging, have a minimal incidence of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> following radical radiotherapy. The number of patients developing symptoms from <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> following radical radiotherapy may be less than the morbidity caused by PCI.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> in a contemporary group of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 53 patients with esophageal carcinoma who received radiotherapy {{as a component of}} treatment between 1998 and 2007, including patient and tumor characteristics, and subsequent diagnosis of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> The association between the histological type of esophageal cancer and the incidence of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was assessed using Fisher&#x 2019;s exact test. RESULTS: Forty-four of the fifty-three patients in this study had adenocarcinoma and nine had squamous cell carcinoma, ranging from stage IIA-IVB. Primary treatment was surgery with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (trimodality therapy) in 19 % of patients; chemoradiotherapy in 42 %; and surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy in 7 %. Twenty-five percent of patients in this study received palliative radiotherapy. The overall incidence of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> in this cohort was 13 %.

The records of 103 patients with completely resected lung adenocarcinoma between 2013 and 2014 were reviewed. Clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients were assessed in the Cox proportional hazards regression model. <b>Brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> occurred in 12 patients (11. 6 %). On univariate analysis, N 2 stage (P = 0. 013), stage III (P = 0. 016), increased CEA level (P = 0. 006), and higher PLR value (P = 0. 020) before treatment were {{associated with an increased}} risk of developing <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> In multivariate model analysis, CEA above 5. 2 [*]ng/mL (P = 0. 014) and PLR ≥ 120 (P = 0. 036) remained as the risk factors for <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> The combination of CEA and PLR was superior to CEA or PLR alone in predicting <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (area under ROC curve, AUC 0. 872 versus 0. 784 versus 0. 704).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the additional diagnostic value of diffusion and perfusion MRI in the differentiation of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Patients and methods: This retrospective study included 24 patients with histologically proven brain tumors who underwent conventional MRI with analysis of diffusion (DWI) and perfusion (PWI) MRI findings of each tumor. The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values were calculated {{in the minimum}} (ADC-MIN), mean (ADC-MEAN), and maximum (ADC-MAX) in all the tumors and the peritumoral regions. The PWI data was expressed as maximum regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) of the tumors and peritumoral regions. Results: After adding diffusion and perfusion to conventional MRI findings, {{we found that the}} accuracy of differentiation between glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and solitary metastasis increased from 70 % to 90 %. There is a significant difference in DWI signal intensity between GBM and metastatic tumors (PÂ <Â  0. 05). The ADC values of GBM were lower than that of metastatic tumors. On perfusion MRI, the maximum rCBV of the peritumoral region (rCBVP) of GBM was higher than that of brain metastases (PÂ <Â  0. 001). Conclusion: The addition of diffusion and perfusion to the MRI protocol increases the accuracy of differentiation between GBM and <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> and should be considered routinely.

40|$|Background and purpose: Brain {{metastasis}} is {{a relatively}} uncommon event in {{the natural history of}} soft tissue sarcomas. The increasing use of chemotherapy may have caused a reduction in local relapses as well as distant failures leading to an improvement in survival, thereby allowing metachronous seeding of the brain, a sanctuary site. The purpose of this report is to increase awareness amongst clinicians regarding such a possibility. Patients and methods: A review of the departmental sarcoma database following the presentation of this index case in the clinic. Results and discussion: An adolescent male who had previously been treated with surgery and radiotherapy for a spindle cell sarcoma of the left thigh developed a space-occupying lesion in the brain within 6 months of treatment of the primary tumor. He subsequently underwent resection of the presumed <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> followed by whole brain radiotherapy. On radiation he was detected to have pulmonary metastases too, for which he was offered palliative chemotherapy. The patient died of brain metastasis within 4 months. A review of the departmental sarcoma database, restricted to soft tissue sarcomas purely, maintained prospectively from 2000 till date, could not identify any other such case. Conclusion: Brain metastases from soft tissue sarcomas are rare. Patients with neurological symptoms, however, should be appropriately investigated. Surgical resection of brain metastasis could be considered for <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> in non-eloquent areas. Palliative radiotherapy is appropriate for patients with multiple brain metastases or co-existing extra-cranial disease...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the potential use of icotinib as first-line treatment to prevent <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> from advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods: This investigation {{was designed as a}} retrospective nonrandomized controlled study. Enrolled patients received either icotinib or traditional chemotherapy as their first-line treatment. The therapeutic efficacy was compared among patients with advanced. (stages IIIB and IV) lung adenocarcinoma with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -sensitive mutation. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis,</b> whereas, the secondary endpoint was overall survival(OS). Death without <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was considered a competitive risk to calculate the cumulative risk of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan–Meier method and statistical significance was determined using the log-rank test. Results: The present study included 396 patients with 131 in the icotinib group and 265 in the chemotherapy group. Among those with EGFR-sensitive mutation, the cumulative risk of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was lower in the icotinib group than in the chemotherapy group.

40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} a {{heterogeneous}} disease with different molecular subtypes. It is known that triple negative breast cancer and the HER- 2 positive breast cancer subtypes are associated with more brain metastases. We further explored different subtypes of breast cancer patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> and analyzed their clinical behaviour with particular reference to the Hong Kong Chinese population. Methodology: We reviewed all breast cancer patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> presented to the Department of Clinical Oncology in the Queen Mary Hospital, the University of Hong Kong which is a teaching hospital during January 2004 to June 2008. Sociodemographic factors, date of primary breast cancer diagnosis and the tumour features, clinical behaviour at presentation, treatment received such as surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy, time of local recurrence, <b>metastasis</b> including <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis,</b> the recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classes and treatment for the <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> were all recorded. We classified the patients into 3 main subtypes, hormone positive, triple-negative (TNC) and HER- 2 positive subtypes and further studied the clinical features and <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> behaviour. Statistical analysis using SPSS 16. 0 version was applied. Results: Altogether, there were 60 breast cancer patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> occurred during January 2004 to June 2008 requiring further management in our Department. Hormone positive patients constituted 46. 6 % while TNC accounted for 15. 5 % and HER- 2 positive patients accounted for 37. 9 % of the cohort. The majority presented with symptoms {{at the time of}} the <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> (93. 1 %) with headache being the most common symptom (43. 1 %), and 54 patients received whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and 8 patients received surgical resection of the <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> There were no significant statistical significance between the breast cancer subtypes and the metastatic behaviour except that the TNC patients were associated with concurrent lung metastasis when they first presented with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> (p = 0. 03) when compared to the hormone positive and HER- 2 positive patients. The ANOVA analysis showed there was a statistically significant difference between the RPA Classes of the patients and their time of survival after the <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> (p = 0. 002). Further ANOVA Post Hoc showed the RPA Class 3 patients were associated with shorter time of survival after <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> when compared to the Class 1 patients (2. 4 months vs 11. 8 months, p = 0. 001). However, patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> and different breast cancer subtypes did not have statistically significant different time of survival after their brain metastases. Conclusion: Hong Kong Chinese triple negative breast cancer patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> were associated with more concurrent lung metastasis. The RPA Classification still serves as a prognostic indicator with reference to the survival after <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> in the breast cancer patients when compared to the breast cancer subtypes.

40|$|Treatment of {{glioblastoma}} multiforme (GBM) and <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> remains a challenge {{because of the}} poor survival {{and the potential for}} brain damage following radiation. Despite concurrent chemotherapy and radiation dose escalation, local recurrence remains the predominant pattern of failure in GBM most likely secondary to repopulation of cancer stem cells. Even though radiotherapy is highly effective for local control of radio-resistant tumors such as melanoma and renal cell cancer, systemic disease progression is the cause of death in most patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Preservation of quality of life of cancer survivors is the main issue for patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) by virtue of precise radiation dose delivery may reduce treatment time of patients with GBM without excessive toxicity and potentially improve neurocognitive function with preservation of local control in patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Future prospective trials for primary brain tumors or <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> should include IGRT to assess its efficacy to improve patient quality of life...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: This {{randomised}} non-inferiority {{trial was}} designed to assess whether radiosurgery plus adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy (RS + WBRT) is as effective as surgery plus whole brain radiotherapy (S + WBRT) for cancer patients with a <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis,</b> with respect to overall survival and quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Major inclusion criteria were a history of systemic cancer within 5 years and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> suitable for both radiosurgery and surgery. All patients were to receive WBRT (30  Gy in 10 fractions). Between February 2003 and April 2009, 40 patients were considered eligible, 22 consented to randomisation and 21 were analysed (11 RS + WBRT, 10 S + WBRT). The trial was closed early due to slow accrual. RESULTS: The estimated median overall survival times for RS + WBRT and S + WBRT patients were 6. 2 and 2. 8 months, respectively (hazard ratio 0. 53,  95 % confidence interval 0. 20 - 1. 43, P =  0. 20). Corresponding median failure-free survival times were 3. 1 and 1. 7 months (P =  0. 20). For 19 'per protocol' patients, 2 / 10 in the RS + WBRT arm had distant intracranial failure (one also had local failure) and 3 / 9 S + WBRT patients had distant intracranial failure (no local failures). There were no grade 3 - 4 late radiation toxicities. Two months after starting treatment {{there were no significant}} differences in quality of life between the arms. CONCLUSION: This randomised trial encountered the accrual difficulties and consequent low statistical power commonly associated with interdisciplinary studies drawing from a small eligible population, but can contribute to future overviews on the management of solitary brain metastases.

40|$|Treatment {{outcomes}} {{for a patient}} with <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> after long-term relapse-free follow-up of invasive lung carcinoma were presented. Brain metastasis without other signs of disease progression was diagnosed 10 years after combined modality treatment for stage II lung cancer. Removal of intracerebral metastasis with intraoperative photodynamic therapy was performed. Histology microspecimens of the primary tumor and metastasis were similar. No signs of disease progression in the brain 9 months after surgery were found. This case demonstrates {{that it is important}} to increase cancer suspicion for patients with long-term relapse-free follow-up. The use of intraoperative photodynamic therapy with photoditazine as a sensitizer in the treatment of cerebral metastases results in a favorable anti-tumor effect, thus improving life quality of patient...|$|E
40|$|Gallbladder {{cancer is}} a common {{malignancy}} in Northern India, and it accounts for 2 - 4 % of all malignant gastrointestinal tumors. It is an aggressive tumor with early dissemination to liver and lymph nodes and associated with poor prognosis. Systemic metastases from gall bladder carcinoma (Ca) frequently occur; however, metastatic involvement of {{the central nervous system}} is rare and late manifestation and remains an ominous sign. Initial presentation of gall bladder Ca with brain metastasis is rare. We report a case of 65 -year-old women who initially presented with a <b>solitary</b> <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> from an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder, which was diagnosed incidentally when the patient presented with headache, vomiting, and right temporal region swelling. Palliative chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy were prescribed. She is symptom-free from 3 months after the completion of the treatment...|$|E

40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> from {{melanoma}} remains mostly incurable and {{the main}} cause of death from the disease. Early stage clinical trials and case studies show some promise for targeted therapies in the treatment of melanoma <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> However, the progression-free survival for currently available therapies, although significantly improved, is still very short. The development of new potent agents to eradicate melanoma <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> relies on the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that drive melanoma cells to reach and colonize the brain. The discovery of such mechanisms depends heavily on pre-clinical models that enable the testing of candidate factors and therapeutic agents in vivo. In this review we summarize the effects of available targeted therapies on melanoma <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> in the clinic. We provide an overview of existing pre-clinical models to study the disease and discuss specific molecules and mechanisms reported to modulate different aspects of melanoma <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> and finally, by integrating both clinical and basic data, we summarize both opportunities and challenges currently presented to researchers in the field...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{most common}} sites of origin for neuroendocrine {{carcinoma}} are gastrointestinal tract and its accessory glands, and lungs. Materials and Methods: One-hundred fifty cases diagnosed with metastatic brain lesions were retrieved from hospital records within 5 years. For these cases, the primary neoplasm, histopathological classification, metastasis, treatment, and fate all were studied. Results: Intracranial deposits were detected in 10 %. The primary lesion {{was in the}} lungs in 87 % of patients, and 1 patient in the breast and 1 in esophagus. Pathological classification of the primary lesion was Grade 2 (MIB- 1 : 3 – 20 %) in 1 patient and neuroendocrine carcinoma (MIB- 1 : ≥ 21 %) in 14 patients. The median period from onset of the primary lesion up to diagnosis of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was 12. 8 months. About 33 % of patients had a single metastasis whereas 67 % patients had multiple metastases. <b>Brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was extirpated in 33 % of patients. Stereotactic radiotherapy alone was administered in 20 % of patients, and <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was favorably controlled {{in most of the}} patients with coadministration of cranial irradiation as appropriate. The median survival period from diagnosis of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> was 8. 1 months. Conclusion: Most of patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis</b> from neuroendocrine carcinoma showed the primary lesion in the lungs, and they had multiple metastases to the liver, lymph nodes, bones, and so forth at the time of diagnosis of <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis.</b> The guidelines for accurate diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine carcinoma should be immediately established based on further analyses of those patients with <b>brain</b> <b>metastasis...</b>|$|R
