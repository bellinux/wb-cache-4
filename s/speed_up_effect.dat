40|$|We numerically examine driven skyrmions {{interacting}} with a periodic quasi-one dimensional substrate where {{the driving force}} is applied either parallel or perpendicular to the substrate periodicity direction. For perpendicular driving, the particles in a purely overdamped system simply slide along the substrate minima; however, for skyrmions where the Magnus force is relevant, we find that a rich variety of dynamics can arise. In the single skyrmion limit, the skyrmion motion is locked along the driving or longitudinal direction for low drives, while at higher drives a transition occurs to a state in which the skyrmion moves both transverse and longitudinal to the driving direction. Within the longitudinally locked phase we find a pronounced <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>effect</b> that occurs when the Magnus force aligns with the external driving force, while at the transition to transverse and longitudinal motion, the skyrmion velocity drops, producing negative differential conductivity. For collectively interacting skyrmion assemblies, the <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>effect</b> is still present and we observe a number of distinct dynamical phases, including a sliding smectic phase, a disordered or moving liquid phase, a moving hexatic phase, and a moving crystal phase. The transitions between the dynamic phases produce distinct features {{in the structure of}} the skyrmion lattice and in the velocity-force curves. We map these different phases as a function of the ratio of the Magnus term to the dissipative term, the substrate strength, the commensurability ratio, and the magnitude of the driving force.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{witnessed}} some psychological or behavioral deviation (such as aggressive behavior) {{might have an}} association with cerebral hemisphere cooperative dysfunction, however, it is still unclear {{whether there is an}} association between individuals with social cognitive bias and their hemispheric cooperative functions especially while the interhemisphere cooperative processing is under the conditions of emotional interferences. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the differences between the social cognitive bias group and the normal group’s interhemispheric cooperative functional activity under the conditions of with or without interferences. Methods: According to Dodge’s (1993) model of “social-cognitive mechanisms in the development of conduct disorder and depression”, a 51 items of “social cognitive bias scale” was created and was used to screen the high score group. 20 male subjects was composed of high score group and other 23 matched the control group. Stimulus tachistoscopically presented to the bilateral visual field and compared with the central. Both group’s interhemispheric cooperative functional activity were observed and compared under the conditions of without interference- i. e. base level and with the emotional interferences of white noise level and negative evaluative feedback speech level while finishing: experiment one: Chinese word-figure Stroop analogue task; experiment two: two single Chinese Characters combination task. Heart rate and respiratory rate were simultaneously recorded as index of emotional changes. Results: ① The high score group showed a decrease in processing accuracy compared with the normal group under the condition of white noise interference level in experiment one. ② Still under the condition of white noise interference level, there were more reaction time and more errors were observed in high score group than normal in experiment two. ③ Both groups showed <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>effect</b> and the strategic processing tendency of speed-accuracy trade-off effect under the condition of white noise interference level in both experiments. ④ Between group differences of interhemipheric cooperative function were not observed under the conditions of base level and the negative evaluative feedback speech level within both experiments. Conclusion: The results suggested that interhemispheric cooperative functional differences exists between the two groups, characterized as ① differences existed in interhemispheric cooperative processing strategy between the two groups, with the high score group presented “hierarchic” deficiency strategy. ② the appearance of the differences between the two groups were condition specified, and in this research it was only under the white noise interference condition. ③ the features of the differences between the two groups were the differences on multidimensional performances and with a deficit orientation in high score group. ④ the varieties of the differences were changing with cooperative tasks, as in this research the high score group performed worse in complementary cooperative task. In addition, both group adjusted the processing strategy respectively under the condition of white noise evoked emotional interference implied that the interaction between the interhemisphere cooperative processing and emotion might exist. 有研究初步证明，心理与行为异常（如攻击行为）与大脑半球协同功能活动紊乱之间存在联系，但社会认知偏离与大脑半球协同功能之间的关系，特别是当协同处于情绪干扰时的关系有待阐明。该论文的研究目的：探讨社会认知偏离者与正常人之间，两半球协同功能活动性在无干扰和有干扰条件下是否存在差异。研究方法：根据Dodge（ 1993 ）“品行障碍和抑郁发展的社会认知机制”模型，编制了 51 题组成的《社会认知偏好问卷》，并筛选出具有认知偏离高分的被试组成高分组， 20 人，男性。匹配的对照组 23 人。采用双边与中视野速示刺激呈现比较方法，观察两组在无干扰条件下以及在白噪音和言语负反馈引起的情绪干扰条件下完成——研究一：图、字Stroop效应；研究二：真、假汉字组拼任务时，两半球协同功能状况。同时记录心率和呼吸的变化作为情绪变化指标。研究结果：①图、字Stroop效应实验中，在白噪音干扰条件下，观察到高分组较对照组加工精确度的降低；②真、假汉字组拼实验中，在白噪音干扰条件下，观察到高分组较对照组反应时的增加伴随错误率的增加；③两个研究中均观察到两组加工速度的加速效应以及加工策略的速度——准确度权衡效应倾向；④两个研究中，未观察到无干扰条件和言语负反馈条件下的组间差异。研究结论：该研究提示，社会认知偏离者与正常人之间两半球协同功能存在差异。主要表现为：①两组之间半球间协同加工策略的差异，高分组表现为“等级性”低效策略；②两组之间差异的存在是条件特定的，即在受到情绪干扰时；③两组之间的差异表现为高分组多维度绩效的差异和缺陷向量上的差异；④两组之间差异的多少，随协同任务不同而变化，在该研究中两半球完成协同互补任务时，高分组的协同活动性更差。另外，该研究还提示，在白噪音引起的情绪干扰条件下两组共同表现出两半球加工策略的调整，表明此时情绪与大脑两半球协同加工具有交互作用...|$|E
40|$|Kamalski (2007) {{showed in}} a {{self-paced}} moving window paradigm that making {{a distinction between}} subjective and objective connectives is of cognitive relevance: while objective coherence markers caused shorter processing times of the last segment {{in comparison to the}} objective implicit version, subjective coherence markers did not show this <b>speeding</b> <b>up</b> <b>effect</b> in comparison to its implicit counterpart. Also, subjective markers caused shorter reaction times on the authorial intention statements in comparison to the implicit equivalent. Objective markers did not show this effect. The decreased persuasive power of (high involvement) texts with subjective coherence markers may indicate that readers experience resistance to persuasion. Kamalski concludes that the absence of a <b>speeding</b> <b>up</b> <b>effect,</b> together with the offline effects on the perceived authorial intention and persuasion scores in the subjective explicit versions, indicate that subjective markers cause a forewarning effect. 	However, there are also other explanations for the longer processing times that are found at the last segment. Noordman & Vonk (1997) argue that explicitly realized causal relations in general are faster processed than implicit causal relations. 	Like Kamalski (2007), the present eye tracking experiment investigated what the online and offline effects of subjective and objective coherence markers are. Previous research showed that markers have a facilitating effect on the reading process (e. g. Noordman & Vonk, 1992). We would like to specify this general facilitating effect of coherence markers, in a similar way to Kamalski (2007). Our results indicate a cognitive distinction between subjective and objective coherence markers. What we found {{is that there is a}} facilitating effect when an objective marker (like daardoor) is present (decrease in reading times). We found no facilitating effect of subjective markers. These results suggest that in the case of subjective markers the facilitating effect that markers generally have, is compensated by the forewarning process that is specifically related to subjective markers (like dus). Our offline measures show that the subjective explicit version makes the reader more aware of the persuasive intent of the author in comparison to the subjective implicit version. At the same time, the subjective explicit version is more persuasive in comparison to its implicit counterpart. The increased awareness of the persuasive authorial intention has a different effect on the persuasion scores than we predicted from previous experiments on the forewarning effect (Petty & Cacioppo, 1977; De Leeuw & Den Ouden, 2006) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the characterization of wind flow over complex terrain of Nygårdsfjell and numerical wind flow modelling. In the context to research focus, the main contributions of this research thesis are within the following areas: Characterization of wind flow at the Nygårdsfjell wind farm, situated in the arctic circle in Norway. Wind data is collected from the anemometers installed on the wind turbines and thereafter analysed for understanding the existing wind patterns. The analysis established existence of bi-directional high winds at Nygårdsfjell wind farm particularly during colder periods. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) solver FLUENT is used to model the wind fields over the complex terrain of Nygårdsfjell. Overall, the shear stress transport model gives good simulation results that explains the <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>effects</b> at the turbine location, which makes the wind farm a suitable site for wind energy. Local terrain effects on the wind flow over Nygårdsfjell are modelled by coupling meso-micro scale models. One set of meso-scale winds are generated from Weather Research and Forecasting model, whereas the other set is taken from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications dataset. CFD based numerical solver, WindSim, is used as micro-scale coupling partner. The proposed coupled model achieved improvements in wind speed modelling. A basic method for preliminary wind resource assessment at remote sites is proposed. The method {{is a combination of}} interpolation and extrapolation of wind data from the surrounding sites to the potential wind farm site. However, due to large disparities between the terrains and conditions, the results from this project does not contribute directly to the main research area...|$|R
