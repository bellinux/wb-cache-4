40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the history of psychology in Italy through a re-reading of the Rivista <b>di</b> <b>Psicologia,</b> which is divided into four phases. Founded in 1905 by G. C. Ferrari, from its very beginning it reflected psychological issues in our country, laboriously seeking a statute with the aim of asserting its autonomy. Characterised by its strong links with its founder in its first thirty years, it expressed the interests and orientations of the same; in the second period (1937 - 1952) it highlights the difficulties encountered by psychology at the time and the signs of a revival with growing academic acceptance. In the third phase (1955 - 1978), under the twenty-year editorship of Musatti, it reflects the reawakening of experimental research which finds within its pages well-suited space for the publication of its results. After a pause of some ten years, publication was resumed in 1989, continuing until 1995. Official journal of the Società italiana <b>di</b> <b>Psicologia</b> and, for a time, of university institutes, its aim is to move ideas and initiatives among Italian psychologists. The innumerable changes of title, editorship, etc. can lead us to a significant reappraisal of the course of the Rivista {{and at the same time}} the historical development of psychology in Italy...|$|R

40|$|In object {{substitution}} masking (OSM) {{a target}} becomes inaccessible to consciousness when a lateral mask {{stays on the}} screen after it disappears. Similarity between target and distractors along certain properties, seems to affect this effect. Particularly, the role of inhomogeneous colours between target and distractors in modulating OSM is debated. This study was aimed to evaluate the magnitude of OSM on isoluminant stimuli in both colour and letter identification. Results show high individual variability on target detectability and {{the same amount of}} OSM on both color and letter identification tasks, suggesting that it affects feature binding as much as feature detection. A dynamic 4 -dot mask: The size of masking on coloured stimuli Mereu, Stefania Dipartimento <b>di</b> <b>Psicologia,</b> Universita <b>di</b> Roma, Roma, Italy Casagrande, Maria Dipartimento <b>di</b> <b>Psicologia,</b> "Sapienza" Universita`, Roma, Italy The visibility of a target is reduced when a lateral mask remains on the display after the target disappears. This effect seems to be independent of the image-level characteristics of the stimulus. This study would verify the efficacy of a 4 -dot masking, in which an apparent motion illusion is added on coloured stimuli otherwise difficult to mask. Both localization and colour identification tasks are assessed, in both masked and unmasked conditions. Results show the efficacy of this dynamic masking on coloured stimuli, and seem to confirm the independence of 4 -dot masking from the visual characteristics of stimuli...|$|R

40|$|The article {{compares the}} ideas {{in some of}} the {{writings}} of Ellen Key (1849 - 1926) and Italian writer and educator Paola Lombroso (1871 - 1954), daughter of famous physician and criminologist Cesare Lombroso. Paola Lombroso was the author of Saggi <b>di</b> <b>psicologia</b> del bambino [Essays of the psychology of the child] (1894) and in 1904 she published La vita dei bambini [Children’s life], four years after Ellen Key’s Barnets århundrade (The Century of the Child) (1900). Of particular interest are Key’s book Kärleken och äktenskapet (Love and Marriage) (1903) and Lombroso’s book Caratteri della femminilità [Characters of femininity] (1909) which was dedicated to Ellen Key. It is clear that the two writers had many ideas in common and that Lombroso admired Key highly. While Key was more polemic and outspoken, Lombroso, daughter to a famous man who claimed to scientifically have proved that women are inferior to men, found herself in an ambiguous position. Nevertheless she also wanted to upgrade women’s contributions to society...|$|R
