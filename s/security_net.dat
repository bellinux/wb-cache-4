The 1960s saw good times for the heavy industry and Norway became Europe's largest exporter of aluminum and the world's largest exporter of ferroalloys. The University of Trondheim and the University of Tromsø both opened in 1968, one year before a network of regional colleges started being opened. Influenced by American culture and similar actions abroad, youth and students started an uproar against cultural norms. The 1960s saw an increased focus on environmentalism, especially through activism, based on ever-more conversion of waterfalls to hydro stations, pollution and the dilapidation of herring stocks. Rondane National Park was created as the country's first in 1962 and the Ministry of the Environment was the first in the world when it was established in 1972. A network of regional airports were built in Western and Northern Norway in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Membership in the European Economic Community was rejected in a 1972 referendum.|$|E

Buchanan-Smith et al.

40|$|The {{idea of a}} Basic Income Grant (BIG) has {{for long}} been an {{appealing}} alternative to the means-tested social <b>security</b> <b>nets</b> associated with the welfare state as we know it. Proponents of BIG highlight as comparative advantages its unconditionality, its inclusiveness and its administrative simplicity. Moreover, as capital-intensive investment and demographic evolutions engender a decline in activity rates, social <b>security</b> <b>nets</b> that rely on labour as both a source of financing and a condition for entry seem more and more untenable. These latter systems have however for long been in place and have a firm historical embeddedness. Hence, the introduction of BIG requires a revolutionary momentum. South Africa {{has gone through a}} period of profound societal change over the last two decades. After decades of racial exclusion, post-apartheid opened the pursuit of a progressive social inclusionary politics. South Africa {{has been one of the}} few countries where social security expenditure has been steadily on the rise since the second half of the 1990 s. The ANC-government has opted to strengthen several targeted grants (pensions, child grant, etc.), leaving the searing unemployed active population uncovered. This article contends that the introduction of a modest BIG, alongside the pre-existing grant system is a feasible and promising option as it would have a considerable beneficial effect on poverty without entailing large costs. This position is shared among an impressive coalition of civil society organisations and political parties. The article inquires why the ANC, in these conditions, shuns away from the introduction of BIG. We conclude that, how ripe South Africa may be for BIG, the ANC-ideology pushes government to strengthen the workfare-approach, including employment programmes, over a radical overhaul of the social security system. ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe concept of net assessment {{has long been}} considered an important tool for American national security strategists, and the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment {{is widely regarded as}} a key influence in security planning. However, despite calls by experts {{for the development of a}} similar net assessment office in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), only a few tentative efforts have been made to use the concepts and methodologies of net assessment for the problem of ensuring American homeland security. This article argues that a homeland <b>security</b> <b>net</b> assessment is even more necessary today, since debates over the state of the nation’s security involve discussions not only about the seriousness of the threat but also the legitimacy of the intelligence and other efforts employed to combat that threat.

The aim of this work is to show how the security properties of an IFS-net can be inspected indirectly by constructing a PrT-net and by examining the reachability graph of the constructed PrT-net. The crux of this approach is the mapping which defines how the PrTnet corresponding to an IFS-net can be created. It is shown that there exists an one-to-one correspondence between the reachable markings of the IFS-net and the reachable markings of the corresponding PrT-net.
