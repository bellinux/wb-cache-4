5|$|The name {{sperm whale}} is a {{truncation}} of <b>spermaceti</b> whale. <b>Spermaceti,</b> originally mistakenly {{identified as the}} whales' semen, is the semi-liquid, waxy substance found within the whale's head (see below).|$|E
5|$|Jojoba oil, used in {{cosmetics}} as {{an alternative}} to whale oil <b>spermaceti.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Spermaceti,</b> {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the <b>spermaceti</b> organ, and sperm oil, obtained {{primarily from the}} blubber in the body, were much sought after by eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century whalers. These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such as candles, soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialised lubricants, lamp oil, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds. Ambergris, a solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as a fixative in perfumery.|$|E
5|$|Atop the whale's skull is {{positioned}} a large complex of organs {{filled with a}} liquid mixture of fats and waxes called <b>spermaceti.</b> The purpose of this complex is to generate powerful and focused clicking sounds, which the sperm whale uses for echolocation and communication.|$|E
5|$|Modern whaling {{was more}} {{efficient}} than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. <b>Spermaceti,</b> the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales {{off the coast of}} Peru alone. After World War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.|$|E
25|$|Sperm whaling is {{the hunting}} of sperm whales for a {{substance}} called <b>spermaceti</b> {{which was used}} in cosmetics, leatherworking, and lubricants, {{as well as for}} illumination.|$|E
25|$|In August or September 1812, Lightning {{detained}} the American droits Republican and Greyhound. On 2 September 1812, Lightning {{captured the}} Alligator. Alligator, of Nantucket, {{was under the}} command of Captain Obed Swain and on her fifth voyage as a whaler. She had sailed for the Pacific in 1810 and was returning home with 1600 barrels of <b>spermaceti</b> oil.|$|E
500|$|The <b>spermaceti</b> organ {{is like a}} large {{barrel of}} <b>spermaceti.</b> [...] Its {{surrounding}} wall, known as the case, is extremely tough and fibrous. The case can hold within it up to 1,900 litres of <b>spermaceti.</b> It is proportionately larger in males. This oil {{is a mixture of}} triglycerides and wax esters. The proportion of wax esters in the <b>spermaceti</b> organ increases with the age of the whale: 38–51% in calves, 58–87% in adult females, and 71–94% in adult males. [...] The <b>spermaceti</b> {{at the core of the}} organ has a higher wax content than the outer areas. [...] The speed of sound in <b>spermaceti</b> is 2,684m/s (at 40kHz, 36°C), making it nearly twice as fast as in the oil in a dolphin's melon.|$|E
500|$|Below the <b>spermaceti</b> organ {{lies the}} [...] "junk" [...] which {{consists}} of compartments of <b>spermaceti</b> separated by cartilage. [...] It {{is analogous to the}} melon found in other toothed whales. The structure of the junk redistributes physical stress across the skull and may have evolved to protect the head during ramming.|$|E
500|$|When echolocating, {{the sperm}} whale emits a directionally focused beam of {{broadband}} clicks. Clicks are generated by forcing air through {{a pair of}} phonic lips (also known as [...] "monkey lips" [...] or [...] "museau de singe") at {{the front end of}} the nose, just below the blowhole. The sound then travels backwards along the length of the nose through the <b>spermaceti</b> organ. Most of the sound energy is then reflected off the frontal sac at the cranium and into the melon, whose lens-like structure focuses it. Some of the sound will reflect back into the <b>spermaceti</b> organ and back towards the front of the whale's nose, where it will be reflected through the <b>spermaceti</b> organ a third time. This back and forth reflection which happens on the scale of a few milliseconds creates a multi-pulse click structure. This multi-pulse click structure allows researchers to measure the whale's <b>spermaceti</b> organ using only the sound of its clicks. Because the interval between pulses of a sperm whale's click is related to the length of the sound producing organ, an individual whale's click is unique to that individual. [...] However, if the whale matures and the size of the <b>spermaceti</b> organ increases, the tone of the whale's click will also change. The lower jaw is the primary reception path for the echoes. A continuous fat-filled canal transmits received sounds to the inner ear.|$|E
500|$|At the {{posterior}} {{end of this}} <b>spermaceti</b> complex is the frontal sac, which covers the concave surface of the cranium. [...] The posterior wall of the frontal sac is covered with fluid–filled knobs, which are about 4–13 mm in diameter and separated by narrow grooves. [...] The anterior wall is smooth. The knobbly surface reflects sound waves that come through the <b>spermaceti</b> organ from the phonic lips. The grooves between the knobs trap a film of air that is consistent whatever the orientation or depth of the whale, making it an excellent sound mirror.|$|E
500|$|The <b>spermaceti</b> organs {{may also}} help adjust the whale's buoyancy. It is {{hypothesized}} that before the whale dives, cold water enters the organ, {{and it is likely}} that the blood vessels constrict, reducing blood flow, and, hence, temperature. The wax therefore solidifies and reduces in volume. The increase in specific density generates a down force of about [...] and allows the whale to dive with less effort. During the hunt, oxygen consumption, together with blood vessel dilation, produces heat and melts the <b>spermaceti,</b> increasing its buoyancy and enabling easy surfacing. However, more recent work has found many problems with this theory including the lack of anatomical structures for the actual heat exchange.|$|E
500|$|Running {{through the}} head are two air passages. [...] The left passage runs {{alongside}} the <b>spermaceti</b> organ and goes {{directly to the}} blowhole, whilst the right passage runs underneath the <b>spermaceti</b> organ and passes air through a pair of phonic lips and into the distal sac at the very front of the nose. The distal sac {{is connected to the}} blowhole and the terminus of the left passage. [...] When the whale is submerged, it can close the blowhole, and air that passes through the phonic lips can circulate back to the lungs. The sperm whale, unlike other odontocetes, has only one pair of phonic lips, whereas all other toothed whales have two, and it is located {{at the front of the}} nose instead of behind the melon.|$|E
500|$|Herman Melville's fictional story Moby Dick {{suggests}} that the [...] "case" [...] containing the <b>spermaceti</b> serves as a battering ram for use in fights between males. A few famous instances include the well-documented sinking of the ships Essex and Ann Alexander by attackers estimated to weigh only one-fifth {{as much as the}} ships.|$|E
500|$|<b>Spermaceti</b> oil (called [...] "sperm" [...] for short), {{from which}} the whale derives its name, was a prime target of the whaling industry, and was {{dominant}} for use in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles. Ambergris is a solid waxy waste product from its digestive system. It is still highly valued as a fixative in perfumes and other uses. It remains as flotsam from deceased whales, and is sought by beachcombers. The species is now protected by a whaling moratorium, and is currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
500|$|There {{were only}} a few {{recorded}} catches during the first few decades (1709–1730s) of offshore sperm whaling. Instead, sloops concentrated on Nantucket Shoals, where they would have taken right whales or went to the Davis Strait region to catch bowhead whales. By the early 1740s, with the advent of <b>spermaceti</b> candles (before 1743), American vessels began to focus on sperm whales. The diary of Benjamin Bangs (1721–1769) shows that, along with the bumpkin sloop he sailed, he found three other sloops flensing sperm whales off the coast of North Carolina in late May 1743. On returning to Nantucket in the summer 1744 on a subsequent voyage, he noted that [...] "45 spermacetes are brought in here this day," [...] another indication that American sperm whaling was in full swing.|$|E
500|$|In 1959, {{the heart}} of a 22 metric-ton (24 short-ton) male taken by whalers was {{measured}} to be , about 0.5% of its total mass. The circulatory system has a number of specific adaptations for the aquatic environment. [...] The diameter of the aortic arch increases as it leaves the heart. [...] This bulbous expansion acts as a windkessel, ensuring a steady blood flow as the heart rate slows during diving. [...] The arteries that leave the aortic arch are positioned symmetrically. [...] There is no costocervical artery. [...] There is no direct connection between the internal carotid artery and the vessels of the brain. Their circulatory system has adapted to dive at great depths, as much as [...] Myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle tissue, is much more abundant than in terrestrial animals. The blood has a high density of red blood cells, which contain oxygen-carrying haemoglobin. The oxygenated blood can be directed towards only the brain and other essential organs when oxygen levels deplete. The <b>spermaceti</b> organ may also play a role by adjusting buoyancy (see below). The arterial retia mirabilia are extraordinarily well-developed. [...] The complex arterial retia mirabilia of the sperm whale are more extensive and larger than those of any other cetacean.|$|E
500|$|American sperm whaling soon {{spread from}} {{the east coast of}} the American colonies to the Gulf Stream, the Grand Banks, West Africa (1763), the Azores (1765), and the South Atlantic (1770s). From 1770 to 1775 Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island ports {{produced}} 45,000 barrels of sperm oil annually, compared to 8,500 of whale oil. In the same decade, the British began sperm whaling, employing American ships and personnel. By the following decade, the French had entered the trade, also employing American expertise. Sperm whaling increased until the mid-nineteenth century. <b>Spermaceti</b> oil was important in public lighting (for example, in lighthouses, where it was used in the United States until 1862, when it was replaced by lard oil, in turn replaced by petroleum) and for lubricating the machines (such as those used in cotton mills) of the Industrial Revolution. Sperm whaling declined {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century, as petroleum came into broader use. In that sense, petroleum use may be said to have protected whale populations from even greater exploitation. Sperm whaling in the eighteenth century began with small sloops carrying only one or two whaleboats. The fleet's scope and size increased over time, and larger ships entered the fishery. In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century sperm whaling ships sailed to the equatorial Pacific, the Indian Ocean, Japan, the coast of Arabia, Australia and New Zealand. Hunting could be dangerous to the crew, since sperm whales (especially bulls) will readily fight to defend themselves against attack, unlike most baleen whales. When dealing with a threat, sperm whales will use their huge head effectively as a battering ram. Arguably the most famous sperm whale counter-attack occurred on 20 November 1820, when a whale claimed to be about [...] long rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship Essex. Only 8 out of 21 sailors survived to be rescued by other ships. This instance is popularly believed to have inspired Herman Melville's famous book Moby-Dick.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 1948, various {{standards}} for luminous intensity were {{in use in}} a number of countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a [...] "standard candle" [...] of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these was the English standard of candlepower. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure <b>spermaceti</b> candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120grains per hour. Germany, Austria and Scandinavia used the Hefnerkerze, a unit based on the output of a Hefner lamp.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander was {{reported}} to have arrived at Port Jackson on 1 June 1803, having arrived there from New Zealand with [...] "oil". The oil consisted of 50 tons of <b>spermaceti</b> oil. At Norfolk, Alexander picked up 18,535lbs. of pork, salted there, and brought it back to Port Jackson on behalf and account of the Government of New South Wales. At Port Jackson, Teina, the first Māori recorded to have left New Zealand since 1793, stayed with Governor King. Alexander left Port Jackson on 19 September to return Teina to New Zealand. Governor King had given him gifts to take back with him, including pigs. When they arrived at New Zealand Alexander recruited a second Māori, Maki. He and Teina then remained sailors on board Alexander {{for the next three years}} until she returned to Britain. (Teina died there but Maki survived.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{passages}} and sections of Melville's works demonstrate {{his willingness to}} address all forms of sexuality, including the homoerotic, in his works. Commonly noted examples from Moby-Dick are the [...] "marriage bed" [...] episode involving Ishmael and Queequeg, which is interpreted as male bonding; and the [...] "Squeeze of the Hand" [...] chapter, describing the camaraderie of sailors' extracting <b>spermaceti</b> from a dead whale. Rosenberg notes that critics say that [...] "Ahab's pursuit of the whale, which they suggest {{can be associated with}} the feminine in its shape, mystery, and in its naturalness, represents the ultimate fusion of the epistemological and sexual quest." [...] In addition, he notes that Billy Budd's physical attractiveness is described in quasi-feminine terms: [...] "As the Handsome Sailor, Billy Budd's position aboard the seventy-four was something analogous to that of a rustic beauty transplanted from the provinces and brought into competition with the highborn dames of the court." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{other women}} of her time, Elisabeth used little {{cosmetics}} or perfume, as {{she wished to}} showcase her natural beauty, but she tested countless beauty products prepared in the court pharmacy, or prepared by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments, to preserve it. Although one favorite, [...] "Crème Céleste", was compounded from white wax, <b>spermaceti,</b> sweet almond oil, and rosewater; she attached far less importance to creams and emollients, and experimented {{with a wide variety}} of facial tonics and waters, from which she apparently expected more results. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal bedstead, all the better to retain her upright posture, with either raw veal or crushed strawberries lining her nightly leather facial mask. She was heavily massaged and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist, and her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water. To further preserve her skin tone, she took both a cold shower every morning (which in later years aggravated her arthritis) and an olive oil bath in the evening.|$|E

He was involved in the slave trade and manufactured <b>spermaceti</b> candles, ships, barrels, rum, chocolate, textiles, clothes, shoes, hats, and bottles. [...] He became the wealthiest man in Newport but was denied citizenship on religious grounds, even though British law protected the rights of Jews to become citizens. He appealed to the Rhode Island legislature for redress and was refused with this ruling: [...] "Inasmuch as the said Aaron Lopez hath declared himself by religion a Jew, this Assembly doth not admit himself nor any other of that religion to the full freedom of this Colony.

60|$|BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).--This whale, {{among the}} English of old vaguely {{known as the}} Trumpa whale and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest {{inhabitant}} of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, {{by far the most}} valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, <b>spermaceti,</b> is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days <b>spermaceti,</b> it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same <b>spermaceti</b> was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, <b>spermaceti</b> was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of <b>spermaceti</b> became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this <b>spermaceti</b> was really derived.|$|E

When the original charge had been sustained for fifteen or twenty minutes at about 500°, the return charge was equal to 95° or 100°, and was about fourteen minutes arriving at the maximum effect. A charge continued for not {{more than two or three}} seconds was here succeeded by a return charge of 50° or 60°. The observations formerly made (1234.) held good with this substance. <b>Spermaceti,</b> though it will insulate a low charge for some time, is a better conductor than shell-lac, glass, and sulphur; and this conducting power is connected with the readiness with which it exhibits the particular effect under consideration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, old Mohi; {{ambergris}} is a morbid secretion of the <b>Spermaceti</b> whale; {{for like}} you mortals, the whale is at times {{a sort of}} hypochondriac and dyspeptic. You must know, subjects, that in antediluvian times, the <b>Spermaceti</b> whale was much hunted by sportsmen, that being accounted better pastime, than pursuing the Behemoths on shore. Besides, it was a lucrative diversion. Now, sometimes upon striking the monster, it would start off in a dastardly fright, leaving certain fragments in its wake. These fragments the hunters picked up, giving over the chase for a while. For in those days, as now, a quarter-quintal of ambergris was more valuable than a whole ton of spermaceti." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before {{resuming}} {{the thread}} of my narrative, I must not omit to mention, that in {{the head of the}} sperm whale there is a large cavity or hole called the [...] "case," [...] which contains pure oil that does not require to be melted, but can be bailed at once into casks and stowed away. This is the valuable <b>spermaceti</b> from which the finest candles are made. One whale will sometimes yield fifteen barrels of <b>spermaceti</b> oil from the [...] "case" [...] of its head. A large fish will produce from eighty to a hundred-barrels of oil altogether, sometimes much more; and when whalemen converse with each other, about the size of whales, they speak of [...] "eighty-barrel fish," [...] and so on.|$|E

But as the only mode of operation was to charge the air apparatus, and then after a quick contact with the <b>spermaceti</b> apparatus, ascertain what was left in the former (1281.), no great confidence can be placed in the results.
