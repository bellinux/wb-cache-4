One of those is the cytoplasmic Ski complex, which includes an RNA helicase (Ski2) and is involved in mRNA degradation.

A previous computational and biochemical analysis revealed a possible evolutionary relationship between miRNA precursors and some box H/ACA <b>snoRNAs.</b> Here, we investigate a similar evolutionary relationship between a subset of miRNA precursors and box C/ D <b>snoRNAs.</b> Computational analyses identified 84 intronic miRNAs that are encoded within either box C/D <b>snoRNAs,</b> or in precursors showing similarity to box C/D <b>snoRNAs.</b> Predictions of the folded struc-tures of these box C/D snoRNA-like miRNA precur-sors resemble the structures of known box C/D <b>snoRNAs,</b> with the boxes C and D often in close proximity in the folded molecule.

25|$|An unusual guide <b>snoRNA</b> U85 that {{functions}} in both 2'-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridylation of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) U5 has been identified. This composite <b>snoRNA</b> contains both C/D and H/ACA box domains and associates with the proteins specific to each class of <b>snoRNA</b> (fibrillarin and Gar1p, respectively).

25|$|Each <b>snoRNA</b> {{molecule}} {{acts as a}} {{guide for}} only one (or two) individual modifications in a target RNA. In order to carry out modification, each <b>snoRNA</b> associates with at least four protein molecules in an RNA/protein complex referred to as a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP). The proteins associated with each RNA depend on the type of <b>snoRNA</b> molecule (see <b>snoRNA</b> guide families below). The <b>snoRNA</b> molecule contains an antisense element (a stretch of 10-20 nucleotides), which are base complementary to the sequence surrounding the base (nucleotide) targeted for modification in the pre-RNA molecule. This enables the snoRNP to recognise and bind to the target RNA. Once the snoRNP has bound to the target site, the associated proteins are in the correct physical location to catalyse the chemical modification of the target base.|$|E

25|$|The two {{different}} types of rRNA modification (methylation and pseudouridylation) are directed by {{two different}} families of snoRNAs. These families of snoRNAs are referred to as antisense C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs based on the presence of conserved sequence motifs in the <b>snoRNA.</b> There are exceptions, but as a general rule C/D box members guide methylation and H/ACA members guide pseudouridylation. The members of each family may vary in biogenesis, structure, and function, but each family is classified by the following generalised characteristics. For more detail, see review.|$|E
25|$|Small non-coding RNAs are RNAs {{of as many}} as 200 bases that do {{not have}} protein-coding potential. These include: microRNAs, or miRNAs (post-transcriptional {{regulators}} of gene expression), small nuclear RNAs, or snRNAs (the RNA components of spliceosomes), and small nucleolar RNAs, or <b>snoRNA</b> (involved in guiding chemical modifications to other RNA molecules). Long non-coding RNAs are RNA molecules longer than 200 bases that do not have protein-coding potential. These include: ribosomal RNAs, or rRNAs (the RNA components of ribosomes), {{and a variety of other}} long RNAs that are involved in regulation of gene expression, epigenetic modifications of DNA nucleotides and histone proteins, and regulation of the activity of protein-coding genes. Small discrepancies between total-small-ncRNA numbers and the numbers of specific types of small ncNRAs result from the former values being sourced from Ensembl release 87 and the latter from Ensembl release 68.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{nucleolar}} maturation of eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs, many selected uridines are {{converted into}} pseudouridine by a thus far undefined mechanism.

500|$|In {{the first}} step of {{ribosome}} assembly, [...] a protein called RNA polymerase I transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA. The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA (<b>snoRNA)</b> molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.|$|E
2500|$|C/D box snoRNAs contain {{two short}} conserved {{sequence}} motifs, C (RUGAUGA) and D (CUGA), {{located near the}} 5' and 3' ends of the <b>snoRNA,</b> respectively.

This stem-box structure {{has been shown to}} be essential for correct <b>snoRNA</b> synthesis and nucleolar localization. Many C/D box <b>snoRNA</b> also contain an additional less-well-conserved copy of the C and D motifs (referred to as C' and D') located in the central portion of the <b>snoRNA</b> molecule.

However, the prognostic potential of these RNAs has not been interrogated for breast cancer (BC). The objective {{of the current study}} was to identify <b>snoRNAs</b> as prognostic markers for BC. Small RNA sequencing (Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx) was performed for 104 BC cases and 11 normal breast tissues. Partek Genomics Suite was used for analyzing the sequencing files. Two independent and proven approaches were used to identify prognostic markers: case-control (CC) and case-only (CO).
