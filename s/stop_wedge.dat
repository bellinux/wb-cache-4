50|$|The Steyr M1912 handgun is {{operated}} by a system of short recoil, the barrel unlocking from the slide by rotation. As the pistol is being fired and the recoil of the pistol is in motion, a lug and groove system around the barrel rotate the barrel 20° until a lug hits a <b>stop</b> <b>wedge</b> and holds the barrel while the slide is free to continue its rearward travel, the extractor claw withdrawing the spent casing against the breech face of the slide until the casing strikes the ejector and departs the weapon via the ejection and loading port. Shortly after ejection the slide's rearward travel is arrested by the compressed recoil spring and the abutment of mated surfaces of the slide and frame. The recoil spring is now free to return its stored energy to the cycle of the weapon by beginning to return the slide forward.|$|E
50|$|Wedges {{can also}} be used to hold objects in place, such as engine parts (poppet valves), bicycle parts (stems and {{eccentric}} bottom brackets), and doors. A wedge-type door <b>stop</b> (door <b>wedge)</b> functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door and the wedge, and the wedge and the floor (or other surface).|$|R
50|$|The primary tectonic {{driving force}} behind this {{explosive}} volcanic activity is slab roll back. During the Laramide orogeny, the subducting Farallon Plate subducted at a very shallow angle. When this <b>stopped,</b> the mantle <b>wedge</b> was opened up, {{and the result was}} the flare-up. The specifics of this opening, including possible windows or buckling of the plate, can explain specific volcanic trends within the flare-up.|$|R
50|$|A {{doorstop}} (also door stopper, door <b>stop</b> or door <b>wedge)</b> is {{an object}} or device {{used to hold}} a door open or closed, or to prevent a door from opening too widely. Alternatively, a doorstop can be a thin slat built inside a door frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed. A doorstop (applied) {{may also be a}} small bracket or 90 degree piece of metal applied to the frame of a door to stop the door from swinging (bi-directional) and converting that door to a single direction (in-swing push or out-swing pull).|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Hazzard {{was born}} on October 24, 1871 in Titusville, Pennsylvania. He was one of nine {{children}} of Hiram and Ruby (Windsor) Hazzard. [...] He would attend Kenyon College where he would receive his Theological training. [...] He was as originally part of the Class of 1895 but did not graduate. [...] He later graduated in 1899 {{with a degree in}} theology. [...] While at Kenyon he was a standout athlete including being the captain of the football team for two years. [...] He would later write about his playing days stating how good he was at <b>stopping</b> the flying <b>wedge</b> of the opponent. His tactic was to dive into the wedge [...] "...grabbing up enough feet that if a pile-up didn't occur the ball carrier would be open anyway for other defenders to get." ...|$|R
40|$|Several hundred {{accidents}} involving {{the use of}} circular saws and resulting in injury, to hands or fingers occur each year in Germany. In the presented project, new approaches {{for the prevention of}} hand injuries and for the contactless detection of fingers are being investigated for comprehensive protection on circular saws. The basic principles can be applied to other machines with manual loading and/or unloading. This paper describes several principles to distinct human skin and wood and a safety guard that prevents touching the rotating blade. In a first approach a reliable protective device with functional diversity has been developed using a passive infrared sensor in combination with a capacitive field sensor. Second the distinction between skin and wood or other material is done by dedicated kind of spectral analysis in the near infrared region. With a kind of light curtain the intrusion into the dangerous zone near the blade can be prevented. The safety guard protects the operator’s hand within 50 ms. The forces of the protective system peak at no more than 120 N. We are presenting a complete strategy for such different tasks as cutting <b>wedges,</b> <b>stopped</b> cutting and hidden cutting, which have a very high odds ratio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an electronic aircraft taxi navigation display as part of NASA's Terminal Area Productivity (TAP) Program. The impetus for the development of this specific display, and the TAP program as a whole, is the current bottleneck in surface operations experienced during low-visibility operations. Simply stated, while modern aircraft are equipped to fly and land in low-visibility conditions, they lack the related technology required to allow them to efficiently and safely navigation from the runway to the gate. Pilots under such conditions consequently taxi slower, sometimes get lost and have to stop, and occasionally collide with other aircraft. Based on a review of available display and navigation sensor technologies, and a one-year information requirements study conducted aboard several commercial aircraft flights, it was determined that an electronic aircraft taxi navigation display was the most viable option for improving the efficiency of low-visibility taxi operations. Based on flight deck observations and pilot interviews, previous map display research, other taxi map display efforts, and part-task taxi map research, an advanced taxi navigation display has been developed and is currently being tested. The taxi navigation display is presented as a head-down cockpit display and includes a track-up perspective airport surface view, taxiway, gate and runway labels, ownship position, traffic icons and collision annunciation, graphical route guidance, heading indicator, rotating compass, RVR <b>wedge,</b> <b>stop</b> bars, zoom control, and datalink message window. The development and support for each of the features will be discussed in detail. Additional information is contained in the original extended abstract...|$|R
40|$|European Geosciences Union General Assembly 22 - 27 April 2012, Vienna, AustriaThe Gibraltar Arc is fronted by an imbricated {{wedge of}} tectonic origin, {{possibly}} formed {{related to the}} subduction of a narrow segment of oceanic lithosphere under the Gibraltar Arc System. The wedge is the most outstanding structures of the Gulf of Cadiz, but its origin and activity are still a matter of debate. It has been proposed that the wedge is currently growing due to an ongoing subduction, whereas some other works propose that the <b>wedge</b> <b>stopped</b> activity during the Upper Miocene. The tectonic origin of the wedge is also debated, with propositions that it represents an accretionary wedge or a gravitational olistrostrome. Convergence and compressional deformation in the SW margin of the Iberian Peninsula has been ongoing since the Neogene, and it is currently driven by the slow NW–SE convergence (4 - 5 mm/yr) between the African and Eurasian plates. Convergence is accommodated across a broad, active deformation zone suggesting distributed deformation {{among a number of}} tectonic structures. Regional seismicity is characterized by shallow to deep earthquakes of low to moderate magnitude (Mw < 5. 5), with earthquake mechanisms are dominated by reverse to strike-slip faulting styles. To study the structure of the wedge and analyze its recent/past activity, we have undertaken a seismic investigation. We present first results of the Geomargen-I cruise carried out onboard the Spanish RV “Sarmiento de Gamboa” during November 2011. The structure of the wedge has been imaged using a 6 -km-long solid-state digital multichannel streamer with 480 channels (Sercel-Sentinel) and two, tuned G-II gun sub-arrays with a total volume of 4800 c. i. fired every 50 meters at 2000 p. s. i. (140 bar) pressure. We present a selection of post-stack time migrations of the multichannel seismic reflection profiles and high resolution bathymetry of the main tectonic elements of the wedgePeer Reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Remained {{forces of}} the 30th {{division}} fought in the Battle of Mindanao. Initially stretched over entire East Mindanao north of Davao City area, the 30th division did not actively contested the loss of Zamboanga City 10 March 1945 and subsequent US push eastward, ultimately resulting in {{the isolation of the}} 100th division in Davao City on the south flank of the 30th division. The 1st battalion of the 74th infantry regiment belonging to the 30th division has tried to <b>stop</b> the US <b>wedge</b> at the Kabacan road junction 22 April 1945, but failed. Still overstretched, the 30th division has established a roughly south-north line of defense Kabacan - Kibawe- Manolo Fortich - Macajalar Bay. Also, separate unit of approximately 2200 men was placed in Butuan Bay beaches. Because the commander of the 30th division have severely under-estimated handicaps to Japanese mobility due Philippine guerillas and air raids, the US attack to {{the southern end of the}} defensive line 27 April 1945 was impossible to counter as isolated Japanese units were overrun one after another in rapid sequence. 3 May 1945 the US forces have reached Kibawe. The Japanese infantry battalion at Maramag was able to hold back US attack 6-12 May 1945 in rearguard action, while the rest of the 30th division was trying to assemble in Macajalar Bay area. This objective was done only partially, as US 108th regiment have landed in Macajalar Bay unopposed 10 May 1945, and proceeded 30 km inland until encountering Japanese rearguard 13 May 1945 (and overrunning it 18 May 1945). Another rearguard action has happened in Malaybalay, where remnants of the 30th field artillery regiment (left behind because deemed too heavy for escape to the mountains) were able to hold back the US forces from 20 May 1945 until night of 21 May 1945.|$|R
