No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality." [...] Lovato later said: [...] "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality.

500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Eduardo Rivadavia, editor for AllMusic, criticized the album for using more modern commercial conventions and heavy use of synthesizers and keyboards {{in an attempt}} to reinvent the band's style. Rivadavia specifically pointed out [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink" [...] which he wrote [...] "wastes an aggressive vocal performance from Joey Ramone by supporting it with a shamelessly polished synthesizer backing track." [...] He goes on to call [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] "unbearably soft," [...] summing up that the album was a [...] "career low," [...] while he still rated the album three out of five stars. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] deemed both [...] "She Belongs to Me" [...] and [...] "Crummy Stuff" [...] to be [...] "defensive-sounding" [...] but called [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] an anthem, while also praising [...] "My Head Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)." [...] Rolling Stone critic David Fricke called the album a [...] "reductionist masterpiece" [...] that [...] "proves they <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more to give," [...] claiming it to rival previous albums Leave Home and Rocket to Russia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{release of}} KDE 4.0 {{was met with}} a mixed reception. While early adopters were {{tolerant}} {{of the lack of}} finish for some of its new features, the release was widely criticized {{because of a lack of}} stability and its [...] "beta" [...] quality. Computerworld reporter Steven Vaughan-Nichols criticised KDE 4.0 and KDE 4.1 and called for a fork of KDE 3.5 by rebuilding it on top of Qt4. The same reporter later praised KDE 4.3 and welcomed the KDE 3.5 continuation project Trinity. Although Linus Torvalds switched from GNOME to KDE on December 2005, he switched back to GNOME after Fedora replaced KDE 3.5 with 4.0. In an interview with Computerworld, he described KDE 4.0 as a [...] "break everything" [...] model and [...] "half-baked" [...] release, claiming that he expected it to be an upgrade of KDE 3.5, when the reality was that there were significant cases of features being regressed due to its extensive changes. (Torvalds did point out, however, that he understood why the developers in charge of the KDE project had chosen to make such drastic changes to the desktop environment in KDE 4.0 and the reason for its premature release, and that his criticism was more on the way KDE 4.0 was pushed out to the public.) Despite the criticism, reviewers such as Ars Technica’s Ryan Paul noted that the visual style [...] "is very attractive and easy on the eyes" [...] and [...] "exhibits a relatively high level of polish" [...] and that [...] "the underlying technologies <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of very serious potential".|$|E
