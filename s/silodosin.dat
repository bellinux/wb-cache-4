40|$|Abstract Background To {{assess the}} {{ejaculatory}} disorder caused by <b>silodosin</b> in the prostatic hyperplasia patients who carry out sexual actions (sexual intercourse, masturbation). Method The subjects {{of this study}} were 91 patients who had been clinically diagnosed to have LUTS/BPH at this hospital, who were administered <b>silodosin</b> at 4 mg twice a day, and who gave response to a questionnaire survey related to ejaculatory disorder. Sexual intercourse and masturbation were regarded as sexual actions in this study. Results Ejaculatory disorder occurred in 38 (42 %) of the 91 <b>silodosin</b> administration cases. Forty (44 %) of the 91 patients answered that they carried out sexual actions after oral intake of <b>silodosin.</b> When the investigation was conducted only in those who exercised sexual actions, ejaculatory disorder was observed in 38 (95 %) of these 40 patients, indicating a high incidence. When asked if disturbed by the ejaculatory disorder, 29 (76 %) of the 38 patients who had ejaculatory disorder answered yes. Oral <b>silodosin</b> was discontinued due to the ejaculatory disorder in 2 (5 %) of these patients. On the whole, the discontinuation rate of oral <b>silodosin</b> was 2 % (2 / 91 patients). Conclusion It was demonstrated that the administration of <b>silodosin</b> induced ejaculatory disorder at a high incidence.

Patients and Methods A pooled analysis of 1494 patients from three 12 -week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III RCTs was performed. Efficacy and safety data were assessed across patients with different baseline characteristics. Results <b>Silodosin</b> was significantly more effective than placebo in improving all International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) -related parameters, and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) regardless of patients age (P < 0. 041). Comparing the efficacy of <b>silodosin</b> in the different age groups, {{there were no differences}} for all the IPSS-related parameters, whereas Qmax improvement was slightly higher in patients aged < 65 years (P = 0. 009). <b>Silodosin</b> was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing all IPSS-related parameters regardless of baseline IPSS (P ≤ 0. 001). Similarly, <b>silodosin</b> was more effective than placebo in improving IPSS-related parameters regardless of baseline Qmax (P ≤ 0. 02). <b>Silodosin</b> was associated with significantly higher adverse event (AE) rates, compared with placebo, in all patient subgroups, with retrograde ejaculation being the most common. Prevalence of dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, and discontinuation rate was similar with <b>silodosin</b> and placebo in most patient subgroups. Conclusions We analysed the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>silodosin</b> in several patient subgroups, showing that <b>silodosin</b> was more effective than placebo in improving all IPSS-related parameters in all patient subgroups, whereas AEs were similar.

We performed a literature search using PubMed, Medline via Ovid, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify studies on the treatment of BPH by <b>silodosin.</b> <b>Silodosin</b> is a novel α 1 -adrenergic receptor antagonist whose affinity for the α 1 A-adrenergic receptor is greater than that for the α 1 B-adrenergic receptor. Therefore, <b>silodosin</b> does not increase the incidence of blood pressure-related side effects, which may result from the inhibition of the α 1 B-adrenergic receptor. Patients receiving <b>silodosin</b> at a daily dose of 8 mg showed a significant improvement in the International Prostate Symptom Score and maximum urinary flow rate compared with those receiving a placebo. <b>Silodosin</b> also improved both storage and voiding symptoms, indicating that <b>silodosin</b> is effective, even during early phases of BPH treatment. Follow-up extension studies performed in the United States, Europe, and Asia demonstrated its long-term safety and efficacy. In the European study, <b>silodosin</b> significantly reduced nocturia compared to the placebo.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} tamsulosin and <b>silodosin</b> {{in the context of}} medical expulsive therapy (MET) of distal ureteric stones. Patients and methods: Observational data were collected retrospectively from patients who received <b>silodosin</b> (N = 50) or tamsulosin (N = 50) as MET from January 2012 to January 2013. Inclusion criteria were: patients aged ≥ 18 years with a single, unilateral, symptomatic, radiopaque ureteric stone of 10 mm or smaller in the largest dimension located between the lower border of the sacroiliac joint and the vesico-ureteric junction. Stone expulsion rate, stone expulsion time, number of pain episodes, need for analgesics use, incidence of side effects were compared. Results: Stone-expulsion rate in the <b>silodosin</b> and in the tamsulosin groups were 88 % and 82 %, respectively (p not significant). Mean expulsion times were 6. 7 and 6. 5 days in the <b>silodosin</b> and tamsulosin group, respectively (p not significant). Mean number of pain episodes were 1. 6 and 1. 7 in the <b>silodosin</b> and tamsulosin group, respectively (p not significant). The mean number of analgesic requirement was 0. 84 and 0. 9 for the <b>silodosin</b> and tamsulosin group, respectively (p not significant).

40|$|Background and Purpose 1 -adrenoceptor (-AR) antagonists may {{facilitate}} ureter stone passage in humans. We aimed to study effects by the 1 A-AR selective antagonist <b>silodosin</b> (compared to tamsulosin and prazosin) on ureter pressures in a rat model of ureter obstruction, and on contractions {{of human and}} rat isolated ureters. Experimental Approach After ethical approval, ureters of male rats were cannulated beneath the kidney pelvis for in vivo ureteral intraluminal recording of autonomous peristaltic pressure waves. A partial ureter obstruction {{was applied to the}} distal ureter. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was recorded. Approximate clinical and triple clinical doses of the 1 -AR antagonists were given intravenously. Effects by the 1 -AR antagonists on isolated human and rat ureters were studied in organ baths. Key Results Intravenous <b>silodosin</b> (0. 10. 3 mgkg 1) or prazosin (0. 030. 1 mgkg 1) reduced obstruction-induced increases in intraluminal ureter pressures by 2137 % or 1840 % respectively. Corresponding effects by tamsulosin (0. 01 or 0. 03 mgkg 1) were 920 %. <b>Silodosin,</b> prazosin and tamsulosin reduced MAP by 1012 %, 2526 % (P < 0. 05), or 1825 % (P < 0. 05) respectively.

We evaluated the efficacy of <b>Silodosin,</b> on 187 males 50 years old or over with the diagnosis of BPH. <b>Silodosin</b> significantly improved the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) {{and quality of life}} (QOL) score from the day after administration was started. Among 166 patients whose data were available for the analysis of efficacy of <b>Silodosin,</b> 77. 5 % showed apparent subjective improvement. Eighty three patients, who had been taking another alpha- 1 blocker but without satisfactory effects, showed almost the same improvements in IPSS and QOL score after switching to <b>Silodosin</b> as the remaining 83 patients who had no preceding treatment with an alpha- 1 blocker. The improvements were not only in voiding symptoms but also in storage symptoms. The patients, who had serious storage symptoms, responded rather well to <b>Silodosin</b> and showed significant improvement. Taken together, <b>Silodosin</b> showed a quick effect for improving subjective symptoms and QOL, and was found to be useful for the management of LUTS with BPH. 2006 年 11 月～ 2007 年 10 月の前立腺肥大症 166 例(年齢 69. 9 ± 6. 4 歳) を対象にシロドシン服用後超早期での有効性を検討した。シロドシン 8 mg/日を 2 週間処方し、排尿症状日誌に国際前立腺症状スコア(IPSS) 、QOLスコア、BPH impact indexを記入してもらい、効果判定を行った。その結果、IPSSは服用開始後 1 、 2 、 3 日目と低下し、いずれの観察日も開始時と有意差を認め、 14 日目は更に低下した。QOLスコアも同様に有意な低下を示し、IPSSとQOLスコアの相関関係を認めた。また、α 1 遮断薬から切り替えた患者とα 1 遮断薬を初めて服用した患者との比較では、両群とも服用後 1 日目からIPSSは有意に低下して 14 日目まで低下し続け、 2 群間に有意差は認めなかった。 14 日目の治療判定ではExcellent 25 例、Well 99 例、Poor 36 例であり、Poor例はいずれの観察日もIPSSの低下を認めなかった。IPSSのサブスコアの排尿、蓄尿症状の変化量は服用後 1 日目より有意に改善し、蓄尿症状重症例においても同様に 1 日目より有意に改善効果を認めた。副作用は 187 例中 23 例(12. 3 %) に認め、下痢が 11 例 5. 9 %と最も多く、重篤な副作用は認めず、高齢により高くなる傾向は認めなかった。以上よりシロドシンの早期からの効果が判明し、無効な症例では早い時点で適した薬剤・治療法の提供が可能になると考えた...|$|E
30|$|A {{prospective}} double-blinded placebo controlled randomized {{study was}} conducted in our institute to compare the efficacy of oral <b>Silodosin,</b> an alpha 1 selective antagonist and Diclofenac in relieving pain after stent removal. All patients with unilateral stent placement following renal and ureteric stone endoscopic surgery were randomized into four groups: group A (Placebo), group B (Diclofenac), group C (<b>Silodosin)</b> and group D (combination of Diclofenac and <b>Silodosin).</b> Visual analogue score (VAS score) and other relevant parameters were assessed during OPD visit. Patients were handed over randomized drug envelope and asked to take the medications one hour before the stent removal. Patients were contacted 24  h after stent removal and relevant parameters were recorded. The mean VAS scores were significantly decreased in Diclofenac (2.9), <b>Silodosin</b> (3.08) and combination group (2.85) when compared to placebo (4.20) (p <  0.001). However there was no statistically significant difference in VAS scores between the treatment groups, i.e., group B, C and D (p >  0.5). Analgesics requirement and severe pain rates were not significantly reduced (p =  0.07, 0.35) in the three treatment groups when compared to placebo. Thus <b>Silodosin</b> and Diclofenac, both are effective in preventing pain after stent removal.|$|E
40|$|A {{decreased}} prostatic {{blood flow}} {{could be one}} of the risk factors for benign prostatic hyperplasia/benign prostatic enlargement. The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) shows a chronic prostatic ischemia and hyperplastic morphological abnormalities in the ventral prostate. The effect of <b>silodosin,</b> a selective alpha 1 A-adrenoceptor antagonist, was investigated in the SHR prostate as a prostatic hyperplasia model focusing on prostatic blood flow. Twelve-week-old male SHRs were administered perorally with <b>silodosin</b> (100 μg/kg/day) or vehicle once daily for 6 weeks. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as normotensive controls and were treated with the vehicle. The effect of <b>silodosin</b> on blood pressure and prostatic blood flow were estimated and then the prostates were removed and weighed. The tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 /cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CXCL 1 /CINC 1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β 1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were measured. The histological evaluation was also performed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. There was a significant increase in blood pressure, prostate weight, prostate body weight ratio (PBR), tissue levels of MDA, IL- 6, CXCL 1 /CINC 1, TNF-α, TGF-β 1, bFGF and α-SMA in the SHR compared to the WKY rat. The ventral prostate in the SHR showed the morphological abnormalities compared to the WKY rat. Prostatic blood flow was decreased in the SHR. However, treatment with <b>silodosin</b> significantly restored the decreased prostatic blood flow in the SHR. Moreover, <b>silodosin</b> normalized tissue levels of MDA, IL- 6, CXCL 1 /CINC 1, TNF-α, TGF-β 1, bFGF and α-SMA, and it ameliorated ventral prostatic hyperplasia in the SHR excluding blood pressure. <b>Silodosin</b> decreased PBR but not prostate weight in the SHR. <b>Silodosin</b> can inhibit the progression of prostatic hyperplasia through a recovery of prostatic blood flow...|$|E
40|$|Patient {{preference}} for {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH) treatment with the a 1 -blockers, tamsulosin or <b>silodosin,</b> was compared using patient-reported outcomes. Japanese patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH were randomly allocated to either the T–S group (tamsulosin 0. 2 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks then <b>silodosin</b> 4 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks) or the S–T group (<b>silodosin</b> 4 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks then tamsulosin 0. 2 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks). The primary endpoint was the preferred drug for treatment continuation at 8 weeks, determined by a patient-reported questionnaire. In total, 102 patients (mean age 70. 3 years) were enrolled and 84 (n = 42 per group) completed the study. A significant difference was observed between the proportion of patients who preferred tamsulosin (59 / 84 patients; 70. 2 %) and those who preferred <b>silodosin</b> (18 / 84 patients; 21. 4 %). A major reason for preference of either drug was ‘good efficacy’. Incidence of adverse effects was significantly lower with tamsulosin (3 / 91 patients; 3. 3 %) than with <b>silodosin</b> (25 / 88 patients; 28. 4 %). These findings indicate that tamsulosin is very effective for BPH, has few adverse effects and that patients {{want to continue to}} use it...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the optimum initial dose {{and timing of}} administration of α 1 A-adrenoceptor antagonist <b>silodosin</b> for treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH/LUTS). Ninety-eight patients were given a 4 mg dose after breakfast (group A), 4 mg after supper (group B), or 4 mg after breakfast and after supper (group C). At baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment, we assessed International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) {{and quality of life}} (QOL) index. Twenty-five percent or less improvement of total IPSS and no improvement of QOL index compared with baseline were defined as treatment failure at each evaluation point. Otherwise treatment was considered effective. In group A and group B, patients with treatment failure at 4 or 8 weeks after treatment, the dose of <b>silodosin</b> was increased to 8 mg daily. At the end of the study, 83 patients were evaluable. At 12 weeks after treatment, 20 of the 31 patients in group A and 22 of the 29 patients in group B remained on the 4 mg dose; <b>silodosin</b> was effective in 65 and 76 % of the patients, respectively. When patients with dose escalation were included, <b>silodosin</b> was effective in 81 and 90 % of the patients, respectivery. <b>Silodosin</b> was effective in 18 of the 23 (78 %) patients in group C, although improvement of total IPSS and voiding symptom score of IPSS at 12 weeks after treatment was better in group C than in group A or group B, the difference was not significant. In patients with IPSS less than 20, the degree of improvement of IPSS was similar among the 3 groups. In contrast, in patients with IPSS of 20 or greater the degree of improvement was better in group C than in group B or group C, but the difference was not significant. Storage symptom score of IPSS was significantly improved in all 3 groups without any significant difference among the 3 groups. Three patients (52, 59 and 76 years old) experienced abnormal ejaculation. In conclusion, 4 mg of <b>silodosin</b> daily showed effectiveness against BPH/LUTS, but 8 mg of <b>silodosin</b> daily might be better for patients with severe LUTS...|$|E
40|$|<b>Silodosin</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 1 BPH without obstruction is not a covered Oregon Health Plan (OHP) diagnosis. There are no off-label indications. <b>Silodosin</b> is not {{to be used in the}} treatment of hypertension. 1 Background <b>Silodosin</b> is a selective alpha- 1 adrenergic receptor antagonist used in the management of BPH. Studies have shown that alpha- 1 adrenergic receptor antagonists help to reduce symptoms and prevent clinical progression of BPH. 2 Alpha- 1 adrenoreceptors are located in the prostate, bladder base, bladder neck, prostatic capsule and prostatic urethra. <b>Silodosin</b> and tamsulosin (Flomax®) are selective antagonists at the alpha- 1 a receptors and proposed to cause less risk of hypotension compared to older non-selective agents that inhibit alpha- 1 b and alpha- 1 d adrenoreceptors, which help maintain vascular smooth muscle tone. 1, 3 BPH is evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Mild BPH is defined as IPSS scores ≤ 7 and moderate to severe BPH is ≥ 8. A clinically significant change is noted by patients when IPSS scores are reduced by 4 or more. ...|$|E
40|$|Data from phase 3 studies (NCT 00224107, NCT 00224120) of <b>silodosin</b> for {{treatment}} of BPH symptoms were analyzed {{to examine the relationship}} between treatment efficacy and occurrence of abnormal ejaculation. Men aged ⩾ 50 years with International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) ⩾ 13 and peak urinary flow rates (Qmax) of 4 – 15 [*]ml[*]s− 1 received placebo or <b>silodosin</b> 8 [*]mg once daily for 12 weeks. Silodosin-treated patients were stratified by absence or presence of ‘retrograde ejaculation' (RE). Groups were compared using analysis of covariance (for change from baseline) and responder analyses. Of the 466 patients receiving <b>silodosin,</b> 131 (28 %) reported RE and 335 (72 %) did not; 4 of the 457 patients receiving placebo (0. 9 %) reported RE. Most RE events in silodosin-treated patients (110 / 134; 82 %) were reported as ‘orgasm with absence of seminal emission. ' Silodosin-treated patients with (+) and without (−) RE showed significant improvement in IPSS, Qmax and quality of life versus placebo (P 0. 05). For RE+ patients, the odds of achieving improvement of ⩾ 3 points in IPSS and ⩾ 3 [*]ml[*]s− 1 in Qmax by study end were 1. 75 times those for RE− patients (P= 0. 0127).

30|$|Use of both Diclofenac and <b>Silodosin</b> {{and their}} {{combination}} {{did not result}} in any significant side effects in our study. Like other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse effects of Diclofenac and seen in about 10  % of patients. These side effects {{have been found to be}} dose related (Lehtola and Sipponen 1977). These side effects with Diclofenac dose of 75 – 125  mg have been much lower than with aspirin 3 – 5  g (Brogden et al. 1980). <b>Silodosin</b> is comparatively a much safer drug with excellent side effect profile due to its unmatched uro-selectivity (Van Dijk et al. 2006). <b>Silodosin</b> has been reported to be frequently associated with abnormal ejaculation however, its clinical relevance remains unclear, as subjects rarely discontinue treatment due to this side effect (Marks et al. 2009). Moreover, with the single dosing of both the drugs, these side effects are unlikely to be of clinical significance, which is supported by our study results.|$|E
