5|$|Edward {{responded with}} severe {{brutality}} against Bruce's allies and supporters. Bruce's sister, Mary, was <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> a cage outside of Roxburgh for four years. Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, who had crowned Bruce, was <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> a cage outside of Berwick Castle for four years. Bruce's younger brother Neil was executed by being hanged, drawn, and quartered; {{he had been}} captured after he and his garrison held off Edward's forces who had been seeking Bruce's wife (Elizabeth), daughter Marjorie, sisters Mary and Christina, and Isabella.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1828, however, it was <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> June 1831 before the {{building}} has risen from its foundations. This may have been because the principal architect Harrison had died the previous year and Boffo working alone {{may not have been}} an option – his alterations to Harrison's plans for the Governor's residence in Odessa had been unfavourably received.|$|E
5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses. But {{the presence of a}} surfactant provides a decrease in surface tension, which permits stability of minute droplets of oil in the bulk of water (or vice versa).|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} eight weeks of the war the bombing {{intensified}} until British bombing operations were <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> late April 1945.

5|$|Navy {{dominated}} the series early {{by winning the}} first eight games, between 1905 and 1930, which remains the longest streak. Maryland secured its first win in 1931 at a neutral site in Washington, D.C.

5|$|Spindizzy is an {{isometric}} {{computer game}} released for several 8-bit home computer formats in 1986 by Electric Dreams Software. It features action and puzzle game elements.

Development was headed by Paul Shirley, who drew inspiration from Ultimate Play the Game games that feature an isometric projection.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide, 1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water. The atmosphere is quite dusty, containing particulates about 1.5µm in diameter which give the Martian sky a tawny color when {{seen from the}} surface. It may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> it.|$|E

5|$|According to Tischendorf, Codex Sinaiticus {{was one of}} {{the fifty}} copies of the Bible {{commissioned}} from Eusebius by Roman Emperor Constantine after his conversion to Christianity (De vita Constantini, IV, 37). This hypothesis was supported by Pierre Batiffol, Gregory and Skeat believed that it was already in production when Constantine placed his order, but had to be <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> order to accommodate different page dimensions.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{struggle}} with diabetes, Mau died {{on his home}} island of Satawal at 18:30 Micronesia time, Monday, July 12, 2010. As is the tradition on Satawal, travel between the islands was temporarily <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> Mau's honour. Because there is no morgue on the island, Mau was buried the following day, and a nightly rosary was held until the memorial service on July 21 at Santa Soledad Church. Mau's son Henry Yarofalpiy will continue teaching students about their culture, preserving the legacy of his father.|$|E
5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
5|$|Between 1942 and 1944 {{large numbers}} of Allied service {{personnel}} were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January–May 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial. The railway service had been <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) {{was used as a}} temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA.|$|E

5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> the CSF is {{equivalent}} to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the six-lane {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1977, initially as the Zagreb bypass, then {{continued in the}} 1980s as {{an expansion of the}} existing two-lane road between Zagreb and Belgrade. The construction was <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> {{the first part of the}} 1990s, due to the Croatian War of Independence, and resumed in 1996. Construction of the entire route was completed in 2006; further development entails new exits, new rest areas and the reconstruction of the existing motorway. The construction cost of the A3 motorway is estimated at 7 billionCroatian kuna (approximately 958.9 millioneuro).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the promise}} of the design, many {{operational}} officers were opposed to the use of volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship. Ultimately, the Mark 16 went into limited production while work on the Mark 17 was <b>suspended</b> <b>in</b> 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the oxygen system was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E

30|$|The {{bigger the}} yield stress was, {{the better the}} slurry {{stability}} turned out to be, which could be interpreted from two aspects. On the one hand, the diameter range of bubbles that can steadily <b>suspend</b> <b>in</b> slurry increases with increasing yield stress, {{and there will be}} more bubbles in the stable suspension system to prevent sedimentation of particles. On the other hand, particles can steadily <b>suspend</b> <b>in</b> the slurry only when the yield stress is greater than the settling stress, which makes it possible that the slurry possesses good stability.|$|R
