40|$|Abstract. The current {{stage of}} {{development}} of psycholinguistics, which seeks {{the solution to the}} increasingly complex problems of the individual and society, requires the study of <b>social</b> and psychological <b>maturity</b> of the individual. In an analysis of the main areas of research are needed to study information stance, which is manifested in the <b>social</b> and psychological <b>maturity</b> of the students, in terms of psycholinguistics. The main source of its formation is argued a system of values, professional and life experience, personality philosophy, acquired knowledge, skills concerning information. In carrying out her own internal human potential in personal, social and professional spheres, information stance serves as a fundamental factor. The results of theoretical and empirical research of psycholinguistic features of students’ information stance are highlighted in the article. Theoretical justification and empirical investigation of information stance in accordance with types of <b>social</b> and psychological <b>maturity</b> of the students are realized...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} <b>social</b> and moral <b>maturity</b> of high-school {{students}} was examined. There were almost {{no significant differences}} between the students of two different educational programs. In general, the students&# 39; level of <b>social</b> and moral <b>maturity</b> is satisfyingly high, but their social skills are not quite appropriately developed. The results of behaviour in school situations reveal a quite unpleasant picture of interpersonal relations, which is probably a reflection of social relations in society. The absence of correlations between both components of <b>maturity</b> and <b>social</b> skills shows the gap between human&# 39;s reasoning and behaviour. Students know, which behaviour is moral and socially adapted, but they do not always act in congruence with that, because existing social relations often encourage different behaviour...|$|R
50|$|The {{moustache}} {{and other}} forms of facial hair are globally understood to be signs of the post-pubescent male, however those with moustaches are perceived to be older than those who are clean-shaven of the same age. This was determined by manipulating a photo of six male subjects, with varying levels of baldness, to have moustaches and beards and then asking undergraduate college students to rate both the photos of the men with facial hair and without facial hair in terms of <b>social</b> <b>maturity,</b> aggression, age, appeasement, and attractiveness. Regardless of how bald the subject was, the results found in relation to the perception of moustaches remained constant. Although males with facial hair were perceived, in general, to be older than the same subject pictured without facial hair, the moustached subjects were also perceived to be far less socially mature. The decreased perception of <b>social</b> <b>maturity</b> of the moustached men may partially be due to the increase in the perception of aggression in the moustached men, as aggression is incompatible with <b>social</b> <b>maturity.</b>|$|E

Watts worked with 92 boys in the Industrial Home School for Colored Children in the District of Columbia and 91 boys from the school they went to before {{being sent to the}} Industrial Home. Holding age (all participants were between 14 and 16) and IQ (average of 77) constant, the boys were tested to determine “whether there are: (1) differences in competency to respond to concrete situations as measured by standardized tests; (2) differences in emotional stability and tendencies toward problem behavior as measured by personality tests; (3) differences in <b>social</b> <b>maturity</b> as measured by a <b>social</b> <b>maturity</b> scale; (4) relationships among the carious tests administered, and (5) differences as determined through a questionnaire” (Watts, 1941, 192). Watts concluded that when general intelligence and age remain constant, there is no significant difference between delinquent and non-delinquent boys in their competency to respond to concrete situations. He also did not find any notable differences within their tendencies towards problem behavior, emotional stability, and <b>social</b> <b>maturity.</b> He accused oppositional findings of other studies to inadequate control. Watts argues {{that it is impossible to}} differentiate between delinquent and non-delinquent Negro boys. He did however find that there were differences in interests, habits, and other general attitudes. Lastly, he noted that the delinquent boys had less parental or adult controls in their lives.
