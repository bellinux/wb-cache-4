40|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>control</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} aspect in an inventory system. It determines the safety stock {{in order to ensure that}} products are readily available when the customers require them. The decision makers in organizations tend to rely on software solution in obtaining <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> solutions since they have to manage a massive number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). However, managers intervene in the system and use their judgement to adjust or decide on various quantitative elements. This research discusses the effects of combination of <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> methods. An extended database of approximately 1, 800 SKUs from an electronics company is analyzed. Then, a simulation experiment is performed in order to evaluate in a dynamic fashion what are the effects of applying combined <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> methods.

The study examined medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system, factors affecting performance and then propose ways for improvement {{of the performance of}} medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system at Dodoma Regional Hospital. In the study both primary and secondary data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations from 68 employees of DRH and 80 patients. Findings were analysed through qualitative techniques in which explanations were drawn, and the summary was drawn in frequency and percentage tables and figures with the use of SPSS and Excel programs. The results show that at DRH there are no fixed pre-established stock levels, order quantities, and ordering time for non-vertical programme items, and stock records are mainly kept in paper files. For non-vertical programme items, order quantities and ordering time are mainly determined basing on the available funds and stock balances while main determinant of ordering time and order quantities for items in vertical programme are stock balances and consumption rate. The results reveal that performance of medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system has been mostly affected by low information sharing among the individuals involved in the system, limited supply of items at Medical Stores Department (MSD), lack of computerised system and insufficient funds allocation. In order to improve the performance of medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system, DRH management needs to strengthen its information sharing system, undertake effective budgeting and funds allocation for medical stocks, purchase items missing at MSD from authorised suppliers of medical stocks as well as improve data management, supervisions and management follow-ups in the medical <b>stocks</b> <b>control</b> system...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{modification}} to the standard forecasting, periodic order-up-to-level inventory control approach to dealing with intermittent demand items, when the lead-time length is shorter than the average interdemand interval. In particular, we develop an approach that relies upon the employment of separate estimates of the inter-demand intervals and demand sizes, when demand occurs, directly for <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> purposes rather than first estimating mean demand and then feeding the results in the <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> procedure. The empirical performance of our approach is assessed by means of analysis on a large demand data set from the Royal Air Force (RAF, UK).

40|$|Usually in <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> studies demand {{data are}} {{considered}} as an input to the model, without explicitly considering {{that they are}} the results of a demand forecasting system. <b>Stock</b> <b>control</b> system is examined independently of the demand forecasting system, and it is assumed that demand data (or forecast errors) have been properly modelled. However, the interactions that may exist between demand forecasting methods and <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> systems, in terms of their effects on global system performances, are not considered. In the paper an approach for evaluating these interactions, based on a comparative simulation test of global system costs using historical data, is presented. The approach is explained through a real case: the replenishment, from different suppliers, of a central depot of tinned food, which supplies more than 700 items to warehouses at the lower echelon. Results of the simulation study show that traditional measures of forecast errors cannot be taken as sole indicators for the choice among different demand forecasting methods. These methods, on the contrary, have to be evaluated on the basis of total costs and service level of the global inventory <b>control</b> system. <b>Stock</b> <b>control</b> Demand forecasting Interaction Multiple item Coordinated replenishment...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the background, {{development}} and description of a mathematical <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> methodology for use within an oil and chemical blending company, where demand and replenishment lead-times are generally non-stationary. The <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> model proper relies on, as input, adaptive forecasts of demand determined for an economical forecast/replenishment period precalculated on an individual stock-item basis. The control procedure is principally that of the continuous review, reorder level type, where the reorder level and reorder quantity 'float', that is, each changes in accordance with changes in demand. Two versions of the Methodology are presented; a cost minimisation version and a service level version. Realising the importance of demand forecasts, four recognised variations of the Trigg and Leach adaptive forecasting routine are examined. A fifth variation, developed, is proposed {{as part of the}} <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> methodology. The results of testing the cost minimisation version of the Methodology with historical data, by means of a computerised simulation, are presented together with a description of the simulation used. The performance of the Methodology is in addition compared favourably to a rule-of-thumb approach considered by the Company as an interim solution for reducing stack levels. The contribution of the work to the field of scientific <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> is felt to be significant for the following reasons:- (I) The Methodology is designed specifically for use with non-stationary demand and for this reason alone appears to be unique. (2) The Methodology is unique in its approach and the cost-minimisation version is shown to work successfully with the demand data presented. (3) The Methodology and the thesis as a whole fill an important gap between complex mathematical <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> theory and practical application.

40|$|Intermittent {{demand is}} {{characterized}} by occasional demand arrivals interspersed by time intervals during which no demand occurs. These demand patterns pose considerable difficulties in terms of forecasting and <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> due to their compound nature, which implies variability {{both in terms of}} demand arrivals and demand sizes. An intuitively appealing strategy to deal with such patterns from a forecasting and <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> perspective is to aggregate demand in lower-frequency ‘time buckets’, thereby reducing the presence of zero observations. In this paper, we investigate the impact of forecasting aggregation on the <b>stock</b> <b>control</b> performance of intermittent demand patterns. The benefit of the forecasting aggregation approach is empirically assessed by means of analysis on a large demand dataset from the Royal Air Force (UK). The results show that the aggregation forecasting approach results in higher achieved service levels as compared to the classical forecasting approach. Moreover, when the combined service-cost performance is considered, the results also show that the former approach is more efficient than the latter, especially for high target service levels...|$|R
