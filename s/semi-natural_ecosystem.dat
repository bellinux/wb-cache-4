This site "Mokřad na Černickém potoce the Wetland at Černický potok stream" with wet meadow stands is a very valuable <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystem</b> thanks to a rich population of Dactylorhiza majalis, rarely spread species in the PlzeňCity District and surrounding areas.

Moreover, both fertile and sterile specimens of Dactylorhiza majalis were recorded in two experimental square plots (25 m 2) fixed in 2013. In these plots, detailed vegetation analyses were performed. As regards the next research of the site, complete list of the flora was also done as well as accessory faunistic observations focused on both the invertebrates and the vertebrates.

There is debate over whether nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) limits productivity more widely, and whether the pattern of limitation has been affected by widespread atmospheric N pollution. In a national-scale survey, floristic composition was used to derive mean Ellenberg N score (EN) for use as an independent metric of productivity. Much {{of the variation in}} EN within extensively-managed habitats could be explained by bulk-soil properties such as total C and moisture contents, reflecting the axis from wet, organic, infertile soils to drier, mineral, fertile soils. However, this main axis of variation was also explained well by bicarbonate-extractable P stock, and P stock was included in the best 88 of 255 possible models for all habitats, or the best 55 of 255 models for extensively-managed habitats. The stock of mineralisable N was much less well able to explain variation in the productivity metric, particularly in extensively-managed habitats. This suggests that P availability is a more widespread constraint to the productivity of <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in the UK than is N availability...|$|R

Most of the relevant information relates to radiocaesium, but the applicability for some other radionuclides has also been evaluated. Improved live-monitoring techniques for radiocaesium, developed since the Chernobyl accident, allow the identification of animals whose contamination levels exceed the intervention limits, so that countermeasures can be effectively chosen and targeted. Generally the most effective approach for domesticated and semi-domesticated animals is either to remove contaminated animals from the affected area or to provide uncontaminated feed. Uncontaminated feed is given continuously for dairy animals or in the final fattening stages for meat-producing animals. The introduction of other effective changes in management practices, such as changing hunting seasons for game, or slaughtering {{at a time of}} year when the animals have been grazing on less contaminated herbage, depends on a good understanding of the behaviour of radionuclides in these ecosystems. In practice, the most effective countermeasures which can be used to reduce radionuclide contamination of animals in <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems</b> will be obtained by a combination of both management changes and the use of chemical binders to prevent gut absorption. ...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{complexity}} {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} structure and diversity of ant assemblages. Following the size-grain hypothesis, smaller ant species are likely to be advantaged in more complex habitats compared to larger species. Habitat complexity can act as an environmental filter based on species size and morphological traits, therefore affecting the overall structure and diversity of ant assemblages. In natural and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> habitat complexity is principally regulated by ecological successions or disturbance such as fire and grazing. Urban ecosystems provide an opportunity to test relationships between habitat, ant assemblage structure and ant traits using novel combinations of habitat complexity generated and sustained by human management. We sampled ant assemblages in low-complexity and high-complexity parks, and high-complexity woodland remnants, hypothesizing that (i) ant abundance and species richness would be higher in high-complexity urban habitats, (ii) ant assemblages would differ between low- and high-complexity habitats and (iii) ants living in high-complexity habitats would be smaller than those living in low-complexity habitats. Contrary to our hypothesis, ant species richness was higher in low-complexity habitats compared to high-complexity habitats. Overall, ant assemblages were significantly different among the habitat complexity types investigated, although ant size and morphology remained the same. Habitat complexity appears to affect the structure of ant assemblages in urban ecosystems as previously observed in natural and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> However, the habitat complexity filter {{does not seem to be}} linked to ant morphological traits related to body size.

40|$|Ecosystem {{services}} {{are defined as}} the ecological and socio-economic value {{of goods and services}} provided by natural and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Ecosystem {{services are}} being impacted by many human induced stresses, one of them being nitrogen (N) deposition and its interactions with other pollutants and climate change. It is concluded that N directly or indirectly affects a wide range of provi- sioning, regulating, supporting and cultural ecosystem services, many of which are interrelated. When considering the effects of N on ecosystem services, it is important to distinguish between different types of ecosystems/species and the protection against N impacts should include other aspects related to N, in addition to biodi- versity. The Working Group considered the following priorities of ecosystem services in relation to N: biodiversity; air quality/atmosphere; ecosystem changes; NO 3 leaching; climate regulation and cultural issues. These are the services for which the best evidence is available in the literature. There is a conflicting interest between greenhouse gas ecosystem services and biodiversity protection; up to some point of increasing N inputs, net greenhouse gas uptake is improved, while biodiversity is already adversely affected...|$|R

We investigate macroecological patterns of bird assemblages in urbanized areas relative to <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Location World-wide. Methods We use a database of quantitative bird surveys to compare key assemblage structure parameters for plots in urbanized and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems</b> controlling for spatial autocorrelation and survey methodology. We use the term 2 ̆ 7 urbanized 2 ̆ 7 instead of 2 ̆ 7 urban 2 ̆ 7 ecosystems as many of the plots were not located in the centre of towns but in remnant habitat patches within conurbations. Results Some macroecological relationships were conserved in urbanized landscapes. Species-area, species-abundance and species-biomass relationships did not differ significantly between urbanized and non-urbanized environments. However, there were differences in the relationships between productivity and assemblage structure. In forests, species richness increased with productivity; in both forests and open habitats, the evenness of species abundances declined as productivity increased. Among urbanized plots, instead, both species richness and the evenness of species abundances were independent of variation in productivity. Main conclusions Remnant habitats within urbanized areas are subject to many ecological alterations, yet key macroecological patterns differ remarkably little in urbanized versus non-urbanized plots. Our results support the need for increased conservation activities in urbanized landscapes, particularly given the additional benefits of local experiences of biodiversity for the human population. With increasing urbanization world-wide, broad-scale efforts are needed to understand and manage the effects of this driver of change on biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|Various studies {{over the}} last 15 years have {{attempted}} to describe the processes of N retention, saturation and NO 3 − leaching in <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems</b> based on stable isotope studies. Forest ecologists and terrestrial biogeochemists have used 15 N labelled NO 3 − and NH 4 + tracers to determine the fate of atmospheric deposition inputs of N to terrestrial ecosystems, with NO 3 − leaching to surface waters being a key output flux. Separate studies by aquatic ecologists have used similar isotope tracer methods to determine the fate and impacts of inorganic N species, leached from terrestrial ecosystems, on aquatic ecosystems, usually without reference to comparable terrestrial studies. A third group of isotopic studies has employed natural abundances of 15 N and 18 O in precipitation and surface water NO 3 − to determine the relative contributions of atmospheric and microbial sources.

40|$|Millennia {{of human}} land-use have {{resulted}} in the widespread occurrence of what have been coined ‘domesticated ecosystems’. The anthropogenic imprints on diversity, composition, structure and functioning of such systems are well documented. However, evolutionary consequences of human activities in these ecosystems are enigmatic. Calluna vulgaris (L.) is a keystone species of coastal heathlands in northwest Europe, an ancient semi-natural landscape of considerable conservation interest. Like many species from naturally fire-prone ecosystems, Calluna shows smoke-adapted germination, but it is unclear whether this trait arose prior to the development of these semi-natural landscapes or is an evolutionary response to the anthropogenic fire regime. We show that smoke-induced germination in Calluna is found in populations from traditionally burnt coastal heathlands but is lacking in naturally occurring populations from other habitats with infrequent natural fires. Our study thus demonstrates evolutionary imprints of human land-use in <b>semi-natural</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Evolutionary consequences of historic anthropogenic impacts on wildlife have been understudied, but understanding these consequences is necessary for informed conservation and ecosystem management...|$|R

Largest impacts were predicted for woodland patches located within the agricultural area, while larger moorland areas were at low risk, due to atmospheric dispersion, prevailing wind direction and low NH 3 background.

Ecological intensification of agriculture represents a strategic alternative to ameliorate these drivers of pollinator decline while supporting sustainable food production, by promoting biodiversity beneficial to agricultural production through management {{practices such as}} intercropping, crop rotations, farm-level diversification and reduced agrochemical use.
