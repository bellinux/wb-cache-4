40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} process of damping of non-linear vibrations in a three-mass model of a power transmission system with a multi-disc exible friction clutch switched on and o electroma-gnetically. Steady-state motion of the system is subject to harmonic exci-tation. The problem is considered on the assumption of a uniform unit pressure distribution between the contacting surfaces of the cooperating friction discs. Structural friction, small relative sliding of the clutch discs and linear viscotic damping have also been taken into account. In the case of sliding, the friction coecient is not constant but depends on the relative angular velocity of slowly <b>sliding</b> <b>discs.</b> The aim of the analysis is to assess the in uence of geometric parameters of the system, its exter-nal load, unit pressure, viscotic damping on resonance curves and phase shift angle of steady-state vibrations. The equations of motion of the examined system are solved by means of the slowly varying parameters (Van der Pol) method and digital simulation.

The lubricating performances of GO and OLC as lubricant additives in water were comparatively evaluated using a ball-on-disc tribometer. The effects of sand blasting of a steel disc on its morphology and tribological property were evaluated. The {{results show that the}} two nanomaterials, GO and OLC, when used as lubricant additives in water effectively reduce the friction and wear of the <b>sliding</b> <b>discs,</b> which is independent of the disc surface treatment. On applying heavy loads, it is observed that GO exhibits superior friction-reducing and anti-wear abilities compared to those of OLC—a trace amount of GO can achieve a lubricating ability equivalent to that of an abundant amount of OLC. Furthermore, it is observed that sand blasting cannot improve the wear resistance of the treated steel disc, even though the hardness of the disc increased after the treatment. The possible anti-wear and friction-reducing mechanisms of the GO and OLC as lubricant additives in water are discussed based on results for the wear surfaces obtained by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [...]...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to make an {{experimental}} impact assessment of parameters pertaining to blank two-dimensional circular blank motion on intensity of its cutting {{and quality of the}} machined surfaces. Experimental data have been obtained that reveal efficiency in application of blank circular motion and improvement of its output cutting indices. A methodology has been developed for execution of comparative experimental investigations on cutting glass, nephrite and jasper specimens as under conventional conditions required for the operation so while transferring induced oscillations to boom suspension assembly that ensure specimen. The proposed methodology makes it possible to assess quantitatively intensity of specimen cutting and quality of its machined surface. The paper has shown that a positive impact of the specimen circular motion on quality improvement of its cross-cut surface is related to peculiar kinematics features pertaining to relative motion of disc side surface with cross-cut portions of the specimen surface. It has been shown that the intensifying impact of the specimen circular motion on the cutting process is primarily related to the changes in dynamic conditions of its interaction with the cutting edge of the disc. In contrast to conventional cutting when the process is going on under static pressure of contacting surfaces there is their periodical impact-frictional interaction due to transfer of circular motion to the specimen along elliptical trajectory. In this case the rate of the positive impact of the specimen circular motion on its cross-cut surface becomes higher while increasing vertical velocity component that concerns its <b>sliding</b> relative to <b>disc</b> side surface that is ensured by increasing oscillation frequency which is transferred to the boom suspension assembly.

50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance double offset butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the centre line of the disc seat and body seal (offset one), and the centre line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the triple offset butterfly valve. In this valve the disc seat contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate <b>sliding</b> contact between <b>disc</b> and seat. In the case of triple offset valves the seat is made of metal {{so that it can}} be machined such as to achieve a bubble tight shut-off when in contact with the disc.|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{approach is}} proposed {{to predict the}} sliding wear caused by a loaded spherical pin contacting a rotating disc, a condition typical of the so-called pin-on-disc test widely used in tribological studies. The proposed framework relies on the understanding that, when the pin contacts and <b>slides</b> on the <b>disc,</b> a predominantly plane strain region exists at {{the centre of the}} disc wear track. The wear rate in this plane strain region can therefore be determined from a two dimensional idealisation of the contact problem, reducing the need for computationally expensive three dimensional contact analyses. Periodic unit cell techniques are used in conjunction with a ratchetting-based failure criterion to predict the wear rate in the central plane strain region. The overall three dimensional wear rate of the disc is then determined by scaling the plane strain wear rate with a conversion factor related to the predicted shape of the wear track. The approach is used to predict pin-on-disc test data from an AlSi coating using a tungsten carbide pin. The predicted results are found to be consistent with measured data...|$|R

40|$|Scuffing is {{a severe}} form of surface damage which limits the {{performance}} of lubricated sliding machine components. It has no generally accepted criterion, although recent advances in theory and experiment suggest failure is history dependent. The theory concerns components that operate in nominal line contact and have surface roughness with a lay parallel to sliding. However, the predictions are independent of sliding speed, the observations consistent with micro-ehl could be attributable to other temperature dependent effects, some variations in contact frequency are difficult to interpret, and running-in remains unpredictable. In the present work, the capabilities of an existing twin disc machine were significantly enhanced. It was found that temperature dependent effects other than micro-ehl were relatively minor. Changes in contact frequency were associated with transitions between ehl, mixed lubrication and micro-ehl, but were dependent {{on the presence of}} a distinguishable "mainscale" wavelength in the surface roughness. A prior surface smoothing process of running-in delayed the onset of scuffing, and surface blackening accompanied running-in in mixed lubrication. Surfaces machined to have a dominant mainscale wavelength without secondary features showed little change. To investigate the effects of surface speeds on scuffing, operating conditions were restricted to test histories that induced mixed lubrication. Two regimes of behaviour were identified within a sliding speed/rolling speed domain. At higher <b>sliding</b> speeds, <b>discs</b> scuffed close to transition from ehl to mixed lubrication. At lower speeds, they ran-in and did not scuff until relatively severe, micro-ehl conditions were imposed. A theoretical heat transfer model was matched to the boundary between the two regimes. Refinement of the model suggested the criterion for scuffing in mixed lubrication to be that the load and speeds allow asperities sufficient time within the conjunction to experience a temperature rise large enough to cause local welding...|$|R

Even minor changes in optic nerve head morphology can be visualised using the so-called flicker test: Two optic nerve head photographs, taken at consecutive examinations, are superimposed by projection.

METHOD: A set of 33 pairs of serial optic <b>disc</b> <b>slides</b> was used as gold standard. These 33 pairs had been classified earlier by 3 independent groups of experts. 23 had been classified as "no change over time", 10 had been classified as "change". All 33 pairs were now evaluated by flicker comparison in a masked fashion. RESULTS: Flicker comparison usually took 1 minute per pair of slides. Sensitivity was 90 %, specificity was 65 %.

Relative amount of wear is directly correlate with the effectiveness of the lubricant due to this wear was measured by weight loss before and after testing. Result shows that viscosity and variation of load plays a vital role to characterize the behaviour of frictional force and wear...|$|R
