50|$|The {{debate on}} the use of {{dressings}} for preservation of book bindings has spanned several decades as research and experimental evidence have slowly accumulated. The main argument is, when done incorrectly, multiple disadvantages exist, and when done correctly, little to no preservation advantage occurs. Pamphlets and guidelines give numerous downsides to dressings use, including: the dressing becoming increasingly acidic and discolors and stains the leather, oxidizes (penetration and expansion of oils including displacement and weakening of fibers) and stiffens, leave a sticky surface, collects dust, wicks into adjacent materials, forms unstable surface spews, encourages biological deterioration and mold growth, blocks <b>surface</b> <b>porosity,</b> impedes further treatment, wets and swells the leather, affects surface finishes, and desiccates the leather. Meanwhile, scientific experiments have shown no substantial benefits. The main authorities on the subject, therefore, discourage it, with a caveat for special cases done under the direction of a conservator. Leather can be decorated by a variety of methods, including pyrography and beading.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The in vivo {{enrichment}} of dendritic cells (DCs) in implanted macroporous scaffolds is {{an emerging}} strategy to modulate the adaptive immune system. The pore architecture is potentially {{one of the}} key factors in controlling enrichment of DCs. However, there have been few studies examining the effects of scaffold pore structure on in vivo DC enrichment. Here we present the effects of <b>surface</b> <b>porosity,</b> pore size, and pore volume of macroporous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds encapsulating granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an inflammatory chemoattractant, on the in vivo enrichment of DCs. Although in vitro cell seeding studies using PLG scaffolds without GM-CSF showed higher cell infiltration in scaffolds with higher <b>surface</b> <b>porosity,</b> in vivo results revealed higher DC enrichment in GM-CSF loaded PLG scaffolds with lower <b>surface</b> <b>porosity</b> despite a similar level of GM-CSF released. The diminished compressive modulus of high <b>surface</b> <b>porosity</b> scaffolds compared to low <b>surface</b> <b>porosity</b> scaffolds lead to the significant shrinkage of these scaffolds in vivo, suggesting that the mechanical strength of scaffolds was critical to maintain a porous structure in vivo for accumulating DCs. The pore volume was also found to be important in total number of recruited cells and DCs in vivo. Varying the pore size significantly impacted the total number of cells, but similar numbers of DCs were found as long as the pore size was above 10 − 32 μm. Collectively, these results suggested that one can modulate in vivo enrichment of DCs by altering the pore architecture and mechanical properties of PLG scaffolds...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCryogenic {{machining}} of porous tungsten is {{an effective}} method to achieve as-machined porous surfaces. Dispenser cathodes, which are high performance electron emitting devices, rely on the (<b>surface)</b> <b>porosity</b> of porous tungsten for their functionality. Conventional (dry, flood, MQL) machining results in unwanted smearing of surface pores and {{requires the use of}} a plastic infiltrant to stabilize pores during machining. Previous studies have shown the ability of PCD tools to achieve controlled micro-fracture which occurs only at low cutting speeds (vc∼ 10 - 20 m/min) along with cryogenic cooling. This study investigates the influence of cryogenic pre-cooling time and depth of cut on the attainable surface morphology of porous tungsten. Negative rake cermet tool inserts were used to demonstrate the ability of non-diamond tools to achieve similar results. Three cryogenic pre-cooling times (60, 120 and 180 s) are compared to establish their relative effectiveness in enabling the infiltrant-free cryogenic machining of porous tungsten with the objective of achieving maximum <b>surface</b> <b>porosity.</b> It is found that increased pre-cooling time increases the as- machined <b>surface</b> <b>porosity</b> and significantly alters the deformation mechanism during machining.
