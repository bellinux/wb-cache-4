5|$|L.perlatum is {{the type}} species of the genus Lycoperdon. Molecular {{analyses}} <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> close phylogenetic relationship with L.marginatum.|$|E
5|$|A {{year before}} their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge {{published}} {{a paper in}} the journal Evolution which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of allopatric speciation might <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> possible resolution.|$|E

50|$|In a first {{proposal}} of march, 1853, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> two-manual instrument, partially reusing material of the Van Peteghem organ.A second proposal also <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> two-manual instrument with almost identical disposition.|$|R
50|$|In children, a {{posterior}} fat pad sign <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> condylar {{fracture of}} the humerus. In adults it <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> radial head fracture. The fat pad sign only occurs after an intra-articular fracture.|$|R
5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Warren Hill would have {{overlooked}} a large river valley that was to become the English Channel. Once the sea had inundated the surrounding valley, Mesolithic hunter gatherers exploited the site. Pollen analysis of peat from the Solent bed <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> lightly wooded headland free of close-knit undergrowth during this period, an ideal habitat for game.|$|E
5|$|However, {{further studies}} of the visible and near {{infrared}} spectra <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> homogeneous surface covered by an intimate 1:1 mixture of amorphous and crystalline ice, together {{with no more than}} 8% organics. The absence of ammonia hydrate excludes cryovolcanism and the observations confirm that the collisional event must have happened more than 100 million years ago, in agreement with the dynamic studies.|$|E
5000|$|Lettering made to <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> aesthetic, such as modernism, {{the natural}} world, or another genre of lettering. Examples {{of the latter}} include use of stencil or {{embossing}} tape fonts to <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> industrial aesthetic.|$|R
50|$|Yanomaman {{is usually}} not {{connected}} with any other language family. Joseph Greenberg has <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> relationship between Yanomaman and Macro-Chibchan. Migliazza (1985) has <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> connection with Panoan and Chibchan. Neither proposal has been accepted.|$|R
50|$|A {{hypothesis}} is <b>a</b> <b>suggested</b> explanation of <b>a</b> phenomenon, or alternately <b>a</b> reasoned proposal <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> possible correlation between or among {{a set of}} phenomena.|$|R
5|$|Ice rafted debris distribution: Sediment {{transported by}} ice {{does not extend}} as far East during H3/6. Hence some {{researchers}} have been moved to <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> European origin {{for at least some}} H3/6 clasts: America and Europe were originally adjacent to one another; hence, the rocks on each continent are difficult to distinguish, and the source is open to interpretation (Grousset et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|In 1910, it was {{reported}} that the tree had lost its leaves, though others <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> date of 1913, and it was completely dead by 1915. Scots pines have a natural lifespan of up to over 700 years, depending on the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to further deceive the Germans, minor {{operations}} were conducted {{in an effort to}} <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> forthcoming attack by the British First Army south of La Bassée Canal. This included an attack by the 9th Canadian Brigade against units of the German 36th Reserve Division at Mericourt Trench and a British First Army poison gas attack north of Loos, both in late July 1917.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in the chemical literature is now only of historical significance. Indeed, some further computational results have been reported, which vary from <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> preference for meta radical-anion protonation to <b>suggesting</b> <b>a</b> mixture of ortho and meta protonation.|$|R

I would take it as a favour if you would kindly think the matter over, and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary.|$|E
5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with B.ser. Tetragonae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{historian}} JK Wallenberg (in 1931) <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> Anglo-Saxon root, tynan, to enclose, {{followed by}} the Anglo-Saxon word [...] "Hamm", a land drained by dykes. Another historian, Eilert Ekwall (in 1936), <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> early owner named Teona, whose name is found in Teonanhyll in Berkshire.|$|R
50|$|Sallaberger and Westenholz (1999) <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> {{location}} {{close to}} {{the confluence of the}} ʿAdhaim river east of Samarra (at or near Dhuluiya). Similarly, Reade (2002) <b>suggested</b> <b>a</b> site in this vicinity, based on a fragment of an Old Akkadian statue (now in the British Museum) found there.|$|R
50|$|Townsend often {{embroidered}} flowers which {{exhibited a}} surprising deepness for needlework. Her floral designs <b>suggest</b> <b>an</b> influence from the William Morris and the Royal School of Art Needlework. Her technique of using various stitches and colors {{to create the}} illusion of depth <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> influence from Wheeler.|$|R
5|$|Since 1998, Austin Mast {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements. With respect to B.epica, however, Mast's results accord closely with the arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges, placing it in a polytomous clade corresponding exactly with Thiele and Ladiges' B.ser. Cyrtostylis.|$|E
5|$|The Brahmaputra River {{is often}} {{considered}} the natural {{division between the}} two subspecies, where it makes a curve around {{the eastern end of}} the Himalayas, although some authors <b>suggest</b> <b>A.</b> f. fulgens extends farther eastward, into China.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Scotland includes {{all aspects of}} population history {{in what is now}} Scotland. Scotland may have been first occupied in the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE), but the earliest surviving archaeological evidence of human settlement is of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer encampments. These <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> highly mobile boat-using people, probably with a very low density of population. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements dating from 3500 BCE, and greater concentrations of population. Evidence of hillforts and other buildings <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> growing settled population. Changes in the scale of woodland indicates that the Roman invasions from the first century CE had a negative impact on the native population.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> high PPI <b>suggests</b> <b>a</b> high project priority.|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} {{made headlines}} around the globe. Lowell Observatory, {{which had the}} right to name the new object, received more than 1,000 suggestions from all over the world, ranging from Atlas to Zymal. Tombaugh urged Slipher to <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> name for the new object quickly before someone else did. Constance Lowell proposed Zeus, then Percival and finally Constance. These suggestions were disregarded.|$|E
5|$|The small seated {{statue of}} Menkauhor wearing the robe of the Sed festival might <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> longer reign, since this festival was {{typically}} celebrated {{only after a}} ruler had spent 30 years on the throne. However, Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmüller deems this hypothesis unlikely.|$|E
5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes <b>suggest</b> <b>a</b> common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E
50|$|On the parent-reported SCAS {{for boys}} and girls ages 6-11, a total score of 31.4 and above or 33 and above <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> anxiety disorder, respectively. For boys and girls ages 12-18, a total score of 30.1 and above or 32.2 and above <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> anxiety disorder, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|An {{exponential}} {{increase in}} heat capacity near the critical temperature also <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> energy bandgap for the superconducting material. As superconducting vanadium is warmed toward its critical temperature, its heat capacity increases massively {{in a very}} few degrees; this <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> energy gap being bridged by thermal energy.|$|R
