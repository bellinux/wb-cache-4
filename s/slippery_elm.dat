The forests around the lake also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and Norway maple, while the understory contains <b>slippery</b> <b>elm,</b> European privet, Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|E
25|$|The {{mucilaginous}} {{inner bark}} of the <b>Slippery</b> <b>Elm</b> Ulmus rubra {{has long been}} used as a demulcent, and is still produced commercially for this purpose in the United States with approval for sale as a nutritional supplement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
25|$|Romalis first {{observed}} {{the results of}} illegal abortions in 1960, {{when he was in}} medical school. He was assigned the case of a young woman who had died of a septic abortion after using a folk remedy <b>slippery</b> <b>elm</b> bark. It often contains spores of the bacteria that cause gas gangrene, which is what had killed the young woman. She developed an overwhelming infection. An autopsy showed multiple abscesses throughout her body, in her abdomen, liver, lungs, and brain. Romalis never forgot that case.|$|E
50|$|Caretaker's Woods, {{named for}} the caretaker's house that was once in the area, are located on 8 acre of land along the lake, just {{to the north and}} west of Picnic Point. The land in this area slopes quite {{dramatically}} toward the lake, which means that it receives less direct sunlight in comparison {{to other parts of the}} preserve. Vegetation in this area prefers a cool, moist environment. Trees in the woods are a mix of young maples, basswoods, and <b>slippery</b> <b>elms,</b> and older red oaks.|$|R
50|$|Ulmus ''''Coolshade'''' is an American hybrid {{cultivar}} cloned from a {{crossing of}} the <b>Slippery,</b> or Red, <b>Elm</b> Ulmus rubra (female parent) and the Siberian Elm Ulmus pumila at the Sarcoxie Nurseries, Sarcoxie, Missouri, in 1946.|$|R
50|$|The <b>slippery</b> or red <b>elm</b> U. rubra is {{marginally}} {{less susceptible}} to Dutch elm disease than the other American species, but this quality {{seems to have been}} largely ignored in American research. No cultivars were ever selected, although the tree was used in hybridization experiments (see above).|$|R
25|$|In January 2007, all of {{the cities}} above, with the {{exception}} of Wolfsburg, had a tree native to each locale planted at Coolidge Park's Peace Grove, which was established to replace a 100-year-old <b>Slippery</b> <b>Elm</b> tree which was damaged in a lightning storm in August 2006. Wolfsburg was added in September 2011. The Peace Grove has eight trees: a Linden Tree, which represents Hamm, a Chinese Elm, which represents Wuxi, a Mediterranean Cedar, which represents Givatayim, a White Birch, which represents Nizhny Tagil, a Ginkgo Tree, which represents Gangneung, an English Elm, which represents Swindon, a European Hornbeam, which represents Ascoli Piceno, and an Oak Tree, which represents Wolfsburg.|$|E
25|$|Upon his return, Lewis {{entered the}} {{engineering}} program at Cornell University. While there he {{made friends with}} Lance and Larry Hoppen who later played with Orleans and Eddie Tuleja of King Harvest. Initially an active student {{and a member of}} the fraternity Eta Lambda Nu, Lewis soon lost interest in college. He signed up with a band called <b>Slippery</b> <b>Elm,</b> and in December 1969 during his junior year, he dropped out of Cornell and moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area. His aim was to continue playing music though along the way he also tried other fields of work including landscaping, carpentry, wedding and event-planning, as well as delivering and selling natural foods.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} 29 tree species that Indiana bats use during the summer. The {{greatest}} number of tree species {{are found in the}} central portion of Indiana bats' range (primarily Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and Kentucky), but this is likely because the majority of research conducted on the species has occurred in this region. Roost trees from these central states, which are mainly in the oak-hickory cover type, include silver maple, red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), white oak (Q. alba), red oak (Q. rubra), pin oak (Q. palustris), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), post oak (Q. stellata), shingle oak (Q. imbricaria), eastern cottonwood, shagbark hickory, bitternut hickory, mockernut hickory (C. alba), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American elm, <b>slippery</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus rubra), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), white ash (F. americana), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and sassafras (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
5000|$|The American hybrid elm {{cultivar}} Ulmus ''''Lincoln'''' {{was selected}} from crossings of the <b>Slippery,</b> or Red, <b>Elm</b> Ulmus rubra (female parent) and the Siberian Elm Ulmus pumila made in Aurora, Illinois, circa 1958 and patented in 1983 by Samuel Clegg of Clegg Landscaping, Plainfield, IL and Charles McFarland of Urbana, IL.|$|R
50|$|The Wych Elm {{cultivar}} Ulmus glabra ''''Flava'''' {{was listed}} in the Dieck (Zöschen, Germany) catalogue of 1887 as U. scabra (: glabra) f. flava, but without description. The tree {{should not be confused}} with Ulmus flava Michx. a probable misspelling of Ulmus fulva, a synonym of U. rubra, the <b>Slippery</b> or Red <b>Elm</b> from North America.|$|R
50|$|Asian species {{featured}} in the American DED research programs were the Siberian elm U. pumila, Japanese elm U. davidiana var. japonica, and the Chinese elm U. parvifolia, which gave rise to several dozen hybrid cultivars resistant not just to DED, {{but also to the}} extreme cold of Asian winters. Among the most widely planted of these, both in North America and in Europe, are 'Sapporo Autumn Gold', 'New Horizon' and 'Rebona'. Some hybrid cultivars, such as 'Regal' and 'Pioneer' are the product of both Dutch and American research. Hybridization experiments using the <b>slippery</b> or red <b>elm</b> U. rubra resulted in the release of 'Coolshade' and 'Rosehill' in the 1940s and 50s; the species last {{featured in}} hybridization as the female parent of 'Repura' and 'Revera', both patented in 1993, although neither has yet appeared in commerce.|$|R
