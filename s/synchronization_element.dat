It {{will be shown}} that, for certain lengths of the chain, that is for certain values of n, the damping {{of one of the}} masses at a specific position in the chain is able to constrain the vibration of the system to oscillate at a specific frequency. The damped mass {{turns out to be a}} node of the chain, subdividing it in two parts. This node can be considered as the <b>synchronization</b> <b>element</b> of the two subchains.

30|$|In the RX mode, the FSM is {{composed}} {{out of the}} three super-states. An IDLE state, as in TX mode, denotes the inactive state of the receiver. In this state, the receiver monitors the environment seeking for an incoming signal. Once a signal is detected, through an received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for instance, the receiver switches from the IDLE state to the PRE-SOF state. The PRE-SOF state consists essentially of synchronization tasks as imposed {{by most of the}} standards. Once the system enters the PRE-SOF state, a set of synchronization elements has to be detected and computed within a certain delay. If not, the system returns in the IDLE state. These <b>synchronization</b> <b>element</b> detection and computation are associated to the sof event which is defined in the DSL-based frame specification that was lately introduced. An sof detection makes the system switch from PRE-SOF to POST-SOF where a coherent data decoding is sketched. The POST-SOF state is declined into three parallel sub-states, namely the DECODING state where most of the signal processing is required, the SYNC-TRACK state in which the system keeps on tracking synchronization elements, and finally the BL-RECONF state to handle the run-time block-level reconfiguration like in TX mode.|$|E

In order to deal with the temporal relationship among the elements efficiently, the SMIL script is first converted to a synchronization model named RTSM (Real-time Synchronization Model). By traversing the RTSM, the firing time (active time) of each transition in the RTSM model could be determined. The case of inconsistency that the firing time of a transition is later than that of its following transition results in a time conflict. The corresponding elements for the pair of conflicting transitions that result in the time conflict are therefore identified. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Real systems often show complex {{behavior}} due to {{interaction among}} many elements and compose networks. To model and predict these systems, we estimate network structures {{by using only}} time-series data as behavior of systems. Because elements interacting each other show similar behavior, {{it is useful to}} apply the correlation coefficient, the partial correlation coeffi-cient, the mutual information, and the transfer entropy. However, according to network topology and strength of interaction among nodes, the efficiency of these statistical measures and the optimum measure must be different. In this study, we constitute chaos coupled systems and examine the efficiency of these measures, changing model parameters.

The control law is decentralized and it does not require a common orientation frame among all agents. We refer to synchronization of unit vectors in R 3 as incomplete synchronization, and of 3 D rotation matrices as complete synchronization. Our main contribution lies on showing that these two problems can be analyzed under a common framework, where all elements' dynamics are transformed into unit vectors dynamics on a sphere of appropriate dimension.

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{investigate}} the neuronal {{basis of the}} Gestalt rules of perception. We present a biologically-based neural network model of primary visual cortex capable of extracting image contours according to the Gestalt definition of perceptual salience. Our model draws on recent results in cortical anatomy, physiology and psychophysics that suggest that context dependent responses {{appear as early as}} the first cortical visual area. We also analyze the temporal response properties of model cells to explore the functional role of synchronization in neuronal assemblies. The model consists of orientation selective cortical units interconnected via long-distance horizontal connections using a connection pattern, which emphasizes smooth curvatures using constraints in both spatial position and orientation. Cortico-cortical connections allow the oriented units to facilitate each other, as has been observed physiologically (Gilbert, 1992). The facilitation triggers a bursting firing mode in the cortical units, much like the repetitive firing patterns of the chattering cells observed by Gray and McCormick (1996) in cat striate cortex. The cortical units then synchronize with other cortical units via the long-distance cortico-cortical connections. The sum of synchronized activity then provides a measure of perceptual salience. The model accounts for a number of recent psychophysical findings on contour detection, including Field, Hayes and Hess (1993), Polat and Sagi (1993, 1994), Kapadia, Ito, Gilbert and Westheimer (1995), Kovacs and Julesz (1993, 1994). The model was also tested on real grayscale images, and was shown to extract the contours that are judged most salient by human observers. Perhaps our major finding is that the properties of synchronization qualitatively account for psychophysical results showing that closure increases contour salience. This result holds regardless of the particular synchronization mechanism and seems to be a general property of the topology of open and closed chains of <b>synchronization</b> <b>elements.</b> We present both analytical and psychophysical evidence that argues that the salience of a contour is encoded in the amount of synchronized activity of the underlying neuronal population rather than the elevated firing rates of the individual cells. The results of the model provide a testable experimental paradigm for testing the functional significance of synchronization. ...|$|R

Assuming that nodes {{of the network}} are occupied by nonidentical self-oscillators we study various forms of their cluster synchronization. Radial cluster emerges when the nodes are synchronized along a ray, while circular cluster is formed by nodes without immediate connections but located on identical distances to the hub. By its nature the circular synchronization is a new manifestation of so called remote synchronization [Phys. Rev. E 85 (2012), 026208]. We report its long-range form when the synchronized nodes interact through at least three intermediate nodes. Forms of long-range remote <b>synchronization</b> are <b>elements</b> of scenario of transition to the total synchronization of the network. We observe that the far ends of rays synchronize first.

The as-formed lipid membrane, at the contact surface, provided a diffusion path between the drops for the chemical species governing the dynamical behavior of the BZ oscillating reaction. We showed, that the coupling mediated by the membranes had mostly an inhibitory character, and that the communication could be controlled by the insertion of sodium tetradecyl sulfate and cholesterol as membrane dopants.

When the BZ-reaction is encapsulated inside microcompartments, its chemical intermediates can serve as messengers by diffusing among different microcompartments, to trigger specific reactions leading to a collective behavior between the elements. The geometry and constitution of the diffusion pathwaysplays here an important role in governing the collective behaviour of the system. In this context, microfluidics is not only a a versatile tool for mastering the encapsulation process of the BZ-reaction in monodisperse microcompartments but also for creating geometries and newtorks with well defined boundaries [...] . The individual compartments can be engineered with selected properties using different surfactants in the case of simple emulsions, or with specific membrane properties in the case of liposomes. Furthermore, it enables the arrangment of these microcompartments in various geometric configurations, where the diffusive coupling pathways between individual compartments are both spatially and chemically well-defined. In this tutorial paper, we review a number of articles reporting various approaches to generate networks of compartmentalized Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) chemical oscillators using microfluidics. In contrast to biological cellular networks, the dynamical characteristics of the BZ-reaction is well-known and, when confined in microcompartments arranged in different configurations with a pure interdiffusive coupling, these communicative microreactors can serve to mimic various types of bio-physical networks, aiding to comprehend the concept of chemical communication...|$|R
