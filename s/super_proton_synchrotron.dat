25|$|The {{discovery}} of the W and Z bosons themselves {{had to wait for}} the construction of a particle accelerator powerful enough to produce them. The first such machine that became available was the <b>Super</b> <b>Proton</b> <b>Synchrotron,</b> where unambiguous signals of W bosons were seen in January 1983 during a series of experiments made possible by Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. The actual experiments were called UA1 (led by Rubbia) and UA2 (led by Pierre Darriulat), and were the collaborative effort of many people. Van der Meer was the driving force on the accelerator end (stochastic cooling). UA1 and UA2 found the Z boson a few months later, in May 1983. Rubbia and van der Meer were promptly awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics, a most unusual step for the conservative Nobel Foundation.|$|E
