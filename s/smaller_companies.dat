40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} debate {{in recent years}} concerning {{the value of the}} <b>small</b> <b>company</b> audit. This paper aims to explore the impact of the introduction of deregulation of the <b>small</b> <b>company</b> audit in the United Kingdom in 1994. It seeks to identify why <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> may still demand voluntary audits {{in the absence of a}} statutory requirement. Theoretical and economic factors and rationales affecting <b>small</b> <b>company</b> management choice to engage auditing are examined. Following a survey sent to <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> qualifying for audit exemption, several hypotheses underlying the demand for audits in an unregulated environment are empirically tested in a logistic regression model. Some support is found for the agency, or stewardship, hypotheses in <b>small</b> <b>company</b> choice to engage auditing...|$|R

The location of the research is at southern sumatera and the number of samples are 250 micro and <b>small</b> <b>companies.</b> We use 2 independent varables (ROI and spirituality) and a dependent variable (collecatbility).

5|$|The American music {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain kinds of music. Generally, these companies do not produce, or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences. <b>Smaller</b> <b>companies</b> often fill in the void, offering {{a wide variety of}} recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{was done}} in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several <b>smaller</b> <b>companies.</b> The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground mining in the watershed stopped. Strip mining was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all mining stopped. During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Cook was {{presented}} {{with the opportunity to}} become the CEO and controlling partner for the International Academy of Music Arts and Sciences (IAMAS Corporation). Years earlier, the company merged with its daughter company, The American Musical Academy of Arts Association, which proved profitable as there was an upswing in demand for Christian-based music and distribution opportunities. This was profitable as IAMAS was able to use its history in the entertainment industry as a door to help boost other <b>smaller</b> <b>companies</b> into existence. In 2004, the entertainment industry took a huge hit with the incoming markets of Napster, iTunes, and Amazon.com. IAMAS, no longer able to compete, decided to sell off only its American division and retain its overseas holdings. Since IAMAS Corporation had handled Cook's contracts since 1980, Cook offered to buy the company for an undisclosed amount. His offer was accepted and he officially filed for corporation status on November 24, 2004.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} commercial enterprise {{in the early}} part of the territorial era was the lucrative fur trade. At the beginning of the 19th century two British companies competed for dominance in the North American trade: Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. The North West company had used Grand Portage as its western headquarters along with other <b>smaller</b> <b>companies</b> that operated in the area. Grand Portage was one of the four principal British trading and shipping points furs in North America. Following the Treaty of Paris, in 1783, British operations at Grand Portage were technically illegal though the trade continued. However, beginning in 1801 the North West Company began re-establishing its headquarters north of the border at the newly constructed Fort William in what is now Ontario. After 1804 Grand Portage had been reduced to a minor trading center and most traders eventually abandoned the area. In 1842, the Hudson Bay Company, which had by then absorbed the North West Company, shipped out a final band of Ojibwe who were employed by the company.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some <b>smaller</b> <b>companies</b> but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E

In recent years, Amazon has been a popular channel for <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> to launch a private label product, where almost 500,000 products are released on a daily basis, many of which are private label products.
