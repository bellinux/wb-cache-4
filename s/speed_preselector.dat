50|$|The Mark III light tank {{suspension}} {{was made}} out of Horstmann coil springs controlling bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. This design, invented by Sidney Horstmann and exclusively used on lightweight vehicles, was also used up to the Light Tank Mk VI of the British Army. Apart from being relatively easy to build, compact and lightweight, it {{had the advantage of}} having a long travel, and of being easy to replace when damaged in the field. The drive sprocket was in the front, the idler-wheels were placed in the rear, with two return rollers. Power {{came in the form of}} a Henry Meadows 6-cylinder gasoline engine, producing , coupled with a four <b>speed</b> <b>preselector</b> gearbox. Steering was a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The traverse of the turret was electrically actuated.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the T-15 {{obviously}} {{was similar to that}} of the Mark III light tank prototype. The suspension was made out of Horstmann coil spring resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie.

Apart from being relatively easy to build, compact and lightweight, it had the advantage of having a long travel, and of being easy to replace when damaged in the field. The drive sprocket was in the front, the idler-wheels were placed in the rear, with two return rollers. Power came in the form of a Henry Meadows 6-cylinder gasoline engine, producing 88 hp, coupled with a four <b>speed</b> <b>preselector</b> gearbox. Steering was a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The traverse of the turret was electrically actuated. The T-15s were not equipped with a radio.|$|E
50|$|The general lay out of {{the vehicle}} mimicked that of the Vickers vehicle it was based on. The {{suspension}} was made out of Horstmann suspensions resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. This design, exclusively used on lightweight vehicles, was also used on the Light Tank Mk VI of the Royal army and was invented by Sidney Horstmann. Apart from being relatively easy to build, compact and lightweight, it had the advantage of having a long travel, and of being easy to replace when damaged in the field. The drive sprocket was in the front, but there were no idlers or return rollers. Motor power {{came in the form of}} a Meadows 5 cylinder gasoline engine, producing 51 hp, coupled with a four <b>speed</b> <b>preselector</b> gearbox. Steering was a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The traverse of the turret was man powered by the three man crew. The T-13s were not equipped with a radio.|$|E
50|$|The T26C was a {{single-seater}} {{racing car}} with a box section chassis, an unsupercharged 4.5 litre straight six engine and a four <b>speed</b> Wilson <b>preselector</b> gearbox. Chassis and gearbox were derived from the company's 1930s racing cars and {{were similar to those}} used on their post-war road cars.|$|R
