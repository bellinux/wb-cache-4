Evidence from The U. S. Army Stability Operations Field Manual is presented to illustrate the wide <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> assigned to the U. S. military.

The breakdown of traditional roles and allocation <b>of</b> new <b>responsibilities</b> is not confined to the respiratory physiotherapist within healthcare systems. Team-based healthcare and interprofessional treatment of patients is prevalent in the provision of care across the globe. New methods of healthcare delivery indicate that tasks are entrusted to those deemed competent to perform them. It has therefore been necessary to train allied health professionals to take over parts of clinical care...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the differences of the role ambiguity in offense responsibilitiesfor athletes of team sports. As sample were used 421 athletes of basketball (n= 125), handball (n= 106), volleyball(n= 78) and soccer (n= 112). We used the role ambiguity questionnaire (Role Ambiguity Scale, Beauchamp et al., 2002) and referred to the athletes’ responsibilities in offense. The correlations of items were high and ranged from. 57 to. 75, p <. 01 whereas from the one way analysis (oneway, Anova) appeared some statistically serious differences in one factor of role ambiguity (ambiguity inrelation to the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in offense), F (3, 415) = 4, 416, p <. 005.
