50|$|The upper {{critical}} temperature lies at about 760 °C {{and the lower}} one at about 500 °C. O.S. Moltschanova {{was the first person}} who exactly described the definition of the exsolution. For a phase separation the initial glass composition must lie in the miscibility gap of the ternary -- glass system. By a thermal treatment, an interpenetration structure is generated, which results from a spinodal decomposition of the sodium-rich borate phase and the silica phase. This procedure is called primary decomposition. Using an initial glass composition, which lies on the line of anomaly, it is possible to attain a maximum decomposition, which is almost <b>strainless.</b>|$|E

Building {{on the principle of}} strength-to-stiffness, a methodology for predicting the macroscopic stresses at which elements in a finite element mesh yield is developed. This analysis uses elastic strain data from one increment of a purely elastic finite element simulation to make the prediction, given knowledge of the single-crystal yield surface.

40|$|A segmer-based {{approach}} towards monomer synthesis {{was successfully}} {{carried out to}} produce a series of linear α,ω-diolefinic species with varying linker lengths. Ring-closing metathesis (RCM) using a cis-selective ruthenium catalyst yielded a large <b>strainless</b> macrocycle that then underwent entropy-driven ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ED-ROMP). When compared to the same polymerization carried out with the complementary trans-monomer, the ED-ROMP of cis-monomer demonstrated a significantly higher degree of molecular weight control. The narrow dispersity exhibited by this process suggests that a new regime of selectivity enhanced ED-ROMP (SEED-ROMP) has been achieved. Reaction kinetics for this process were probed and the process was compared to alternative polymerization methods. Finally, {{the high degree of}} control was exemplified in a series of chain extension and block copolymerization experiments. Ultimately, SEED-ROMP represents a novel method to obtain well-defined copolymers of precise molecular weights...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article {{considers}} a static problem of torsion of a cylinder composed of incompressible, nonlinear-elastic materials at large deformations. The cylinder contains a central, round, cylindrical inclusion that was initially twisted and stretched (or compressed) along the axis and fastened to a <b>strainless,</b> external, hollow cylinder. The problem statement and solution {{are based on}} the theory of superimposed large strains. An accurate analytical solution of this problem based on the universal solution for the incompressible material is obtained for arbitrary nonlinear-elastic isotropic incompressible materials. The detailed investigation of the obtained solution is performed for the case in which the cylinders are composed of Mooney-type materials. The Poynting effect is considered, and it is revealed that composite cylinder torsion can involve both its stretching along the axis and compression in this direction without axial force, depending on the initial deformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{quasiparticle}} (QP) band {{structures of}} both <b>strainless</b> and strained monolayer MoS_ 2 are investigated using more accurate many body perturbation GW theory and maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) approach. By solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) including excitonic effects {{on top of}} the partially self-consistent GW_ 0 (scGW_ 0) calculation, the predicted optical gap magnitude is in a good agreement with available experimental data. With increasing strain, the exciton binding energy is nearly unchanged, while optical gap is reduced significantly. The scGW_ 0 and BSE calculations are also performed on monolayer WS_ 2, similar characteristics are predicted and WS_ 2 possesses the lightest effective mass at the same strain among monolayers Mo(S,Se) and W(S,Se). Our results also show that the electron effective mass decreases as the tensile strain increases, resulting in an enhanced carrier mobility. The present calculation results suggest a viable route to tune the electronic properties of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) using strain engineering for potential applications in high performance electronic devices.

40|$|A general {{procedure}} for arriving at 3 -D models of disulphiderich olypeptide systems {{based on the}} covalent cross-link constraints has been developed. The procedure, which has been coded as a computer program, RANMOD, assigns {{a large number of}} random, permitted backbone conformations to the polypeptide and identifies stereochemically acceptable structures as plausible models based on <b>strainless</b> disulphide bridge modelling. Disulphide bond modelling is performed using the procedure MODIP developed earlier, in connection with the choice of suitable sites where disulphide bonds could be engineered in proteins (Sowdhamini,R., Srinivasan,N., Shoichet,B., Santi,D. V., Ramakrishnan,C. and Balaram,P. (1989) Protein Engng, 3, 95 - 103). The method RANMOD has been tested on small disulphide loops and the structures compared against preferred backbone conformations derived from an analysis of putative disulphide subdatabase and model calculations. RANMOD has been applied to disulphiderich peptides and found to give rise to several stereochemically acceptable structures. The results obtained on the modelling of two test cases, a-conotoxin GI and endothelin I, are presented. Available NMR data suggest that such small systems exhibit conformational heterogeneity in solution. Hence, this approach for obtaining several distinct models is particularly attractive for the study of conformational excursions...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of the elusive macrotetrolide 2 of 3 -hydroxybutyric acid has been approached by cyclooligomerization of enantiomerically pure (S) -beta-butyrolactone (3), promoted by the catalytic system 2, 2 -dibutyl- 1, 3, 2 -dioxastannolane/dibutyltin dichloride (DOS/DTC). The product has been isolated in 10 % yield, demonstrating {{that it is not}} inaccessible, and its structure has been proven by X-ray crystal structure analysis. DOS/DTC afforded a thermodynamically controlled cyclooligomerization mixture, which was analyzed by means of a revised version of the Jacobson-Stockmayer theory, providing an evaluation of the effective molarity (EM) parameter for the formation of the tetrameric macrolide. The EM value was found to be five times lower than the corresponding value for tetra(beta-propiolactone), its <b>strainless</b> unsubstituted analogue. The observed EM allowed a quantitative measure (1. 1 kcal mol- 1) of the strain induced in the 16 -membered macrotetrolide by the introduction of a methyl group into four homochiral stereocenters of the ring. Such relatively small strain is sufficient to depress to an appreciable extent the yield of 2 that can be expected from a thermodynamically controlled reaction. The possible origin of the observed strain is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} {{mechanics}} of an elastic ribbon subjected to twist and tensile load. Motivated by the classical work of green and a recent experiment that discovered a plethora of morphological instabilities, we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework through which we construct a 4 D phase diagram of this basic system, spanned by the exerted twist and tension {{as well as the}} thickness and length of the ribbon. Different types of instabilities appear in various 2 ̆ 2 corners 2 ̆ 2 of this 4 D parameter space, and are addressed through distinct types of asymptotic methods. Our theory employs three instruments, whose concerted implementation is necessary to provide an exhaustive study of the various parameter regimes: (i) a covariant form of the Foppl-von Karman (cFvK) equations to the helicoidal shape from planarity, and the buckling instability of the ribbon in the transverse direction; (ii) a far from threshold (FT) analysis [...] which describes a state in which a longitudinally-wrinkled zone expands throughout the ribbon and allows it to retain a helicoidal shape with negligible compression; (iii) finally, we introduce an asymptotic isometry equation that characterizes the energetic competition between various types of states through which a twisted ribbon becomes <b>strainless</b> in the singular limit of zero thickness and no tension...|$|E

The thruster was to operate at a mixture ratio (O/F) of 4, be capable of operating for 2 million lb sub f- seconds (8. 896 million N-seconds) impulse with a chamber pressure of 75 psia (52 N/square cm) and a nozzle area ratio of 40. Superimposed was also the objective of operating with a <b>strainless</b> steel spherical combustion chamber, which limited the wall temperature to 1700 F (1200 K), an objective specific impulse of 400 lb sub f sec/lbm (3923 N-seconds/Kg), and a demonstration of 500, 000 lb sub f-seconds (2, 224, 000 N-seconds) of impulse. The demonstration of these objectives required a number of design iterations which eventually culminated in a very successful 1000 second demonstration, almost immediately followed by a changed program objective imposed to redesign and demonstrate at a mixture ratio (O/F) of 8. This change was made and more then 250, 000 lb sub f seconds (1, 112, 000 N-seconds) of impulse was successfully demonstrated at a mixture ratio of 8.

40|$|A general {{treatment}} of macrocyclization reactions occurring under thermodynamic control is presented. The fundamental quantities {{on which the}} treatment is based are the effective molarities of the cyclic oligomers and the equilibrium constant for the intermolecular model reaction between monofunctional reactants (K(inter)). Four typical cases have been considered, namely, addition and condensation of a monomer of the type A-B, addition of A-A, and addition of A-A + B-B. A critical comparison with the classical theory of Jacobson and Stockmayer is presented. It is shown that the phenomenon characterized by the critical monomer concentration (cut-off point) is a limiting phenomenon which would occur only for infinitely large values of K(inter). The treatment has been successfully applied to the DOS/DTC-induced cyclooligomerization of beta-propiolactone in CDCl 3 solution that yields well-behaved ring-chain equilibrates closely adhering to the theoretical model. Best fit of the experimental product distributions to the general equations gave the equilibrium constant (K(inter)) of the intermolecular model reaction, {{as well as the}} effective molarities (EM(i)) for the cyclic oligomers from trimer to octamer. The EM(i) values decrease in proportion of the - 2. 5 power of the oligomerization degree, thus providing a strong indication that the oligomeric polylactones are essentially <b>strainless.</b> The extremely low value of K(inter) (2. 5) is responsible for the absence of a cut-off point, which is usually present in ring-chain polymeric equilibrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{energetic}} {{structure of}} the conduction band of Ge and Si are well known [1 } and at the atmospheric pressure the four lowest L 1 germanium conduction band valleys are occupied by electron in pure Ge. In pure Si at the same conditions are occupied 1 silicium valleys. Under strong elastic pressure the 1 valleys of Ge must be involved in consideration. For this reason energy structure of strained Ge 1 -xSix alloy single crystal must involve four L 1 and six 1 -germanium valleys and six 1 - silicium valleys. Under sufficiently high pressure practically all electrons will be localized in both type of 1 -valleys. Under these condition the 1 -valleys becomes accessible for direct experimental measurement [2, 3] e, consequently, theoretical considerations of transport phenomena is no purely artificial. In this communication we try to analyze the thermoemf under high hydrostatic pressure. The theory of anisotropic scattering {{has been used to}} calculate diffusion thermoemf. The intraband scattering of electrons by acoustic phonons and impurity ions and interband non-equivalent electron scattering between L 1 - and 1 – valleys as well as interband equivalent f– and g - scattering between 1 - valleys have been considered [4 - 7].

40|$|A {{directional}} effect {{has been observed}} when indentation hardness tests were made with a Double-Cone indenter on single crystals of Tin and Bismuth, The distortion around the impressions made during, the teats was studied by multiple beam interferometric techniques. The surface contours shown by the fringes revealed deformation of an unsymmetrical nature, with "piling-up" and "sinking-in occurring in directions mutually at right angles. The fringes also revealed slip traces, of step heights of the order 200 A. u. or less, crossing the hill formations. As the direction of indentation on the surface was changed, the observed interference patterns varied continuously, the amount of deformation passing from a maximum to a minimum and returning to the original form when the indenter had rotated through 180 °. Because {{of the presence of}} the slip traces an attempt was made to explain the {{directional effect}}s observed, in terms of the plastic deformation properties of the crystals and the direction of the forces exerted on the crystal during indentation. As the Indenter was rotated with respect to the crystal, {{it was found that the}} value of the shear stress t component on the activated slip planes varied in a similar manner as the measured lengths of the indentations. It is suggested that the hardness variation is a measure of the change in yield stress in the crystal, as the, deformation takes place under <b>strainless</b> conditions. <p...|$|E

40|$|Using first {{principles}} calculations {{we showed that}} the electronic and optical properties of single layer black phosphorus (BP) depend strongly on the applied strain. Due to the strong anisotropic atomic structure of BP, its electronic conductivity and optical response {{are sensitive to the}} magnitude and the orientation of the applied strain. We found that the inclusion of many body effects is essential for the correct description of the electronic properties of monolayer BP; for example while the electronic gap of <b>strainless</b> BP is found to be 0. 90 eV by using semilocal functionals, it becomes 2. 31 eV when many-body effects are taken into account within the G 0 W 0 scheme. Applied tensile strain was shown to significantly enhances electron transport along zigzag direction of BP. Furthermore, biaxial strain is able to tune the optical band gap of monolayer BP from 0. 38 eV (at - 8 % strain) to 2. 07 eV (at 5. 5 %). The exciton binding energy is also sensitive to the magnitude of the applied strain. It is found to be 0. 40 eV for compressive biaxial strain of - 8 %, and it becomes 0. 83 eV for tensile strain of 4 %. Our calculations demonstrate that the optical response of BP can be significantly tuned using strain engineering which appears as a promising way to design novel photovoltaic devices that capture a broad range of solar spectrum...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of CAD and retouching software leads {{no longer to}} creation on the white sheet but to choose information and to transform predefined formats in a <b>strainless</b> environment. Like in a supermarket, we must choose among a lot of tools and pre-established operational protocols that crowd the field of view. Drawing working detail is modifying a downloaded block; preparing a perspective is retouching a photo in Photoshop; drawing a survey is decimating the points of a laser-scanner cloud, to remove the excess material that captures the shape (such as Michelangelo said). The most of our work is to build structures of relationships and to run processes: only the printer physically creates the final tangible product. Our body is no {{more involved in the}} drawing act: every operation starts with the same pressure on the mouse’s left button, while sitting for hours in front of a vertical screen. The ease of deforming and multiplying leads to losing sight of goals and scale of representation: the consequent graphic product is often standardized and hypertrophic, with an amount of useless information and visual noise. Moreover this practice cancels the semantic role of line in favour of a photo-realism that bypasses the graphic standards and reduces the active contribution of observers, for it loses the role of place of dialogue between imagination and reality. In this context, the {{practice of}} hand drawing takes on the role of antidote to this waste of resources, to uncritically acting, to the mechanical copy and paste. The additive operational sequence of hand drawing didactically can mimic the construction phases. The implicit resistance of paper and pencil involves the whole body and perspectival sketches anticipate the exploration of the physical environment not only visually but also tactilely. Economy and semantic regulate the small effort of each line: each single sign is strictly necessary and significant, full of connotative attitude that calls the observer back to an active role in interpreting and imagining. Moreover free hand drawing turns on an eye-hand continuous feedback that exalts the heuristic potential of designing process...|$|E

40|$|A simple {{model was}} {{developed}} for the approximation of ring strain energies of homo- and heterometallic, six- and eight-membered cyclic organometallic group 14 oxides {{and the degree of}} puckering of their ring conformations. The conformational energy of a ring is modelled as the sum of its angular strain components. The bending potential energy functions for the various endocyclic M–O–M′ and O–M–O linkages (M, M′=Si, Ge, Sn) were calculated at the B 3 LYP/(v) TZ level of theory using H 3 MOM′H 3 and H 2 M(OH) 2 as model compounds. For the six-membered rings, the minimum total angular contribution to ring strain, ERSGmin was calculated to decrease in the order: cyclo-(H 2 SiO) 3 (13. 0 kJ mol− 1) >cyclo-H 2 Sn(OSiH 2) 2 O (7. 0 kJ mol− 1) >cyclo-H 2 Ge(OSiH 2) 2 O (4. 9 kJ mol− 1) >cyclo-H 2 Si(OSnH 2) 2 O (3. 4 kJ mol− 1) >cyclo-(H 2 SnO) 3 (1. 7 kJ mol− 1) >cyclo-H 2 Si(OGeH 2) 2 O (0. 8 kJ mol− 1) ≈cyclo-H 2 Ge(OSnH 2) 2 O (0. 7 kJ mol− 1) >cyclo-H 2 Sn(OGeH 2) 2 O (0. 1 kJ mol− 1) ≈cyclo-(H 2 GeO) 3 (0 kJ mol− 1). All of the six-membered rings were predicted to adopt (nearly) planar conformations (a= 0. 996 <a< 1). By contrast, all eight-membered rings were predicted to adopt <b>strainless,</b> but puckered conformations. The degree of puckering was predicted to increase in the order: cyclo-(H 2 SiO) 4 (a= 0. 983) <cyclo-H 2 Sn(OSiH 2 O) 2 SiH 2 (a= 0. 959) <cyclo-(H 2 SiO) 2 (H 2 SnO) 2 (a= 0. 942) < cyclo-H 2 Si(OSnH 2 O) 2 SiH 2 (a= 0. 935) <cyclo-(H 2 SnO) 4 (a= 0. 916) <cyclo-(H 2 GeO) 4 (a= 0. 885). The differences in ring strain and the degree of puckering were linked to the different electronegativities of Si, Ge and Sn.
