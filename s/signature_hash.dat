SGC became obsolete when Internet Explorer 5.01 SP1 and Internet Explorer 5.5 started supporting strong encryption {{without the need}} for a separate high encryption pack (except on Windows 2000, which needs its own high encryption pack that was included in Service Pack 2 and later).

The reason certificate authorities can charge a premium for SGC certificates is that browsers only allowed {{a limited number of}} roots to support SGC.|$|E
50|$|Despite of the {{advantages}} of distributed search, it shares several same security concerns as the traditionally centralized case. The security concerns can be classified into three categories: data privacy, data integrity and secure social search. Data privacy protection is defined as the way users can fully control their data and manage its accessibility. The solutions for data privacy include information substitution, attributed based encryption and identity based broadcast encryption. The data integrity is defined as the protection of data from unauthorized or improper modifications and deletions. The solutions for data integrity are digital <b>signature,</b> <b>hash</b> chaining and embedded signing key. The solutions for secure social search are blind signature, zero knowledge proof and resource handler.|$|E

Keywords : Digital <b>signature,</b> <b>Hash</b> function, Zero-knowledge proof. 1 Introduction A lot of identification schemes based on zero-knowledge proof techniques have been developed [1 - 6] and all these identification schemes can be converted into digital signature schemes by the Fiat-Shamir technique [1]. Most authors of these signature schemes claimed that t-bit hash values are sufficient to achieve a security level of 2, based on the observation that the birthday attack seems not applicable to their schemes (e. g., t 72 in Fiat and Shamir [1] and Schnorr [4] and t = 64 in Guillou and Quisquater [2, 7]).

40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{in detail the}} design {{and the development of}} a software research star algorithm, embedded on a star tracker, by the ISAE/SUPAERO team. This research algorithm is inspired by musical techniques. This work will be carried out as part of the ESMO (European Student Moon Orbiter) project by different teams of students and professors from ISAE/SUPAERO (Institut Supe ́rieur de l’Ae ́ronautique et de l’Espace). Till today, the system engineering studies have been completed and the work that will be presented will concern the algorithmic and the embedded software development. The physical architecture of the sensor relies on APS 750 developed by the CIMI laboratory of ISAE/SUPAERO. First, a star research algorithm based on the image acquired in lost-in-space mode (one of the star tracker opera- tional modes) will be presented; it is inspired by techniques of musical recognition with the help of the correlation of digital <b>signature</b> (<b>hash)</b> with those stored in databases. The musical recognition principle is based on finger- printing, i. e. the extraction of points of interest in the studied signal. In the musical context, the signal spectrogram is used to identify these points. Applying this technique in image processing domain requires an equivalent tool to spectrogram. Those points of interest create a hash and are used to efficiently search within the database pre- viously sorted in order to be compared. The main goals of this research algorithm are to minimise the number of steps in the computations in order to deliver information at a higher frequency and to increase the computation robustness against the different possible disturbances...|$|E
