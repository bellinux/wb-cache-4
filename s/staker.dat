50|$|Most {{commonly}} known as <b>Staker</b> Wallace or The <b>Staker,</b> his first name was most likely Patrick. His nickname was given to him after death. Some sources give his first name as William or Edmond (Edmund), but these {{are less likely than}} Patrick. In her 1909 book about her ancestor, Eunice Graham Brandt referred to <b>Staker</b> as William. After being beheaded, his head was put on a stake for everyone to see. Thus, <b>Staker</b> Wallace. The monument in his honour in Martinstown, Limerick, refers to him as Edmond. Unfortunately, contemporary news accounts in the Limerick Chronicle are long-lost. Nonetheless, his correct first name can be established from other sources.|$|E

5000|$|The courts {{similarly}} {{dismissed the}} theory that the victim was sexually active. The evidence presented by the prosecution to support <b>Staker's</b> being sexually active was evidence concerning an incident when she was molested at the age of 8 and an incident of masturbation, and extensive testimony about a pair of red lace panties that she owned. The defense argued that this evidence should never have been introduced because it violated the rape shield law. Typically, this law is invoked by prosecutors to limit the argument by the defense that the victim is the [...] "type of person" [...] who is {{more likely to engage in}} sexual activity; however, the law also bars prosecutors from presenting the same type of evidence.

[...] A document on the United Irishmen in Limerick found in the 1940s in the Irish State Paper Office listed prisoners in the new gaol (jail) in 1798. Ten of those listed had been executed, including a Patrick Wallis. [...] Wallis and Wallace are interchangeable spellings of his surname. Both were used in County Limerick at the time.|$|R

A needs assessment study aimed at improving aviation students’ English language skills was supplemented with qualitative and quantitative data through interviews, survey questionnaire and focus groups. Quantitative data was collected, by administering a survey questionnaire to investigate aviation students’ opinions in regards to language descriptions set by ICAO namely: pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, fluency, comprehension, and interaction. The survey yielded findings that support {{the need for a}} Blended Learning Program. The results of the focus groups and interviews further confirmed {{that there is a need}} for higher proficiency in English language.
