500|$|Minot's full NSI {{took place}} {{beginning}} on 17 May 2008, and {{was conducted by}} inspectors from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the USAF's Air Combat Command (ACC). On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed {{in the area of}} nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, [...] "Overall, their assessment painted a picture of <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> need to work on in the areas of training and discipline". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, [...] "It makes you wonder what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base." [...] Minot passed the follow-up inspection on 15 August 2008.|$|E

60|$|Still, {{we saved}} {{quite a number}} of {{household}} articles. <b>Some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> broke and some we forgot, and some things were too big to move in this way; but we did very well, considering the circumstances.|$|E

The Land of We All [...] "It is {{an obvious}} but simple {{distinction}} — though rarely made — that there are <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that <b>we</b> can do because we are humanity, and <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that <b>we</b> can do because we are persons, {{and that there is}} some radical and absolute difference between the two classes of things. They do not overlap. A person can no more invade Normandy than an army can play the violin." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} disgraceful," [...] said Jackman, [...] "the {{way in which}} Government neglects that matter of boats. <b>Some</b> <b>things,</b> <b>we</b> know, will never be {{generally}} adopted unless men are compelled to adopt them. Another biscuit, Barret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's too bad," [...] said Mrs. March, and, {{as she did}} {{not offer}} any {{solution}} of the matter, I thought it rather heartless of her {{to go on and}} rub it in. [...] "And we were just planning <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> could do together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the poet}} sighed. [...] "I suppose you are partly right. Meteorology {{certainly}} {{has the advantage}} of humanity in <b>some</b> <b>things.</b> <b>We</b> cannot make much of age here, and hereafter we can only conceive of its being turned into youth. Fancy an eternity of sensibility!" ...|$|E

"Then," [...] said Mister Woodchuck, [...] "there are <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that <b>we</b> {{know that}} you don't; and {{although}} a woodchuck might not be of much account {{in one of your}} schoolrooms, you must forgive me for saying that I think you'd make a mighty poor woodchuck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! {{you must}} not talk about it. There are <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> cannot bear to hear. Oh! it is late to begin, but I may yet live a few years. I can never wipe out the past, but perhaps a brief space in the future may yet be mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{saying about}} {{levelling}} upward, and not downward, may seem very fine {{to those who}} cannot see its self-involved absurdity. But the truth is, that, to gain the true level, in <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> <b>we</b> must cut downward; for how can you make every sailor a commodore? or how raise the valleys, without filling them up with the superfluous tops of the hills? ...|$|E

"It is the English custom, Emilie," [...] {{her sister}} said; [...] "and I {{can assure you}} that my husband and I have got very English, in <b>some</b> <b>things.</b> <b>We</b> do not love our country less, but we see that, in many respects, the English ways are better than ours; and we admire the {{independence}} of the people, every man respecting himself, though giving honour, but not lavishly, to those higher placed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I should, if it {{were twice}} as far, Chloe. There are <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> must get. Don't look alarmed, I shall take Dan with me. Now, let me see. In the first place there are lemons for making drink and linseed for poultices, some meat for making broth, and some flour, and other things for ourselves; {{we may have to}} stay here for some time. Tell me just what you want and I will get it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean that}} there is any hurry about it, today; but we ought {{certainly}} to lay in as large a store as we can, of things that will keep. <b>Some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> may get cheaper, in a short time, than we can now. A lot of the Jew and native traders will be leaving, if they see there {{is really going to be}} a siege; for you see, the town is quite open to the guns of batteries, on the other side of the neutral ground.|$|E
60|$|I {{know that}} there is a dark side to this picture; that with all this {{increase}} of wisdom, there has come conceit, and trust in deceitful riches, and want of trust in God, and obedience to His law. I know that in <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> are not better, but worse than our forefathers; God forgive us for it! But the good came from God; and that man is very unwise and unthankful too, who despises God's great gift of science, because fallen man has defiled His gift as it passed through his unclean hands.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} shot on digital video. In an {{introduction}} that {{appears on the}} Dynamic:01 DVD, Lynch calls the film [...] "an experiment based on some idea", and says the film [...] "was always some kind of tie in to bananas, information concerning bananas, so we can all learn <b>some</b> <b>things</b> as <b>we</b> enjoy the shows". Then he laughs.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps--since most of {{what the}} wood folk know {{is a matter of}} learning, not of instinct--his mother teaches him <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that <b>we</b> have never yet seen.

60|$|Being {{so young}} and inexperienced then, and unconsciously swayed in some degree by those local and social prejudices, that are the marring of most men, and from which, for the mass, there seems no {{possible}} escape; at first I was surprised that a colored man {{should be treated as}} he is in this town; but a little reflection showed that, after all, it was but recognizing his claims to humanity and normal equality; so that, in <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> <b>we</b> Americans leave to other countries the carrying out of the principle that stands at the head of our Declaration of Independence.|$|E
60|$|Say on, say on; but {{know you}} this, and lay it to heart, war-voting Bench of Bishops, that He on whom we believe himself has enjoined us {{to turn the}} left cheek if the right be smitten. Never mind what follows. That passage you can not expunge from the Bible; that passage is as binding upon us as any other; that passage embodies the soul and {{substance}} of the Christian faith; without it, Christianity were like any other faith. And that passage will yet, by the blessing of God, turn the world. But in <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> must turn Quakers first.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] I continued, {{determined}} {{to follow up}} this new train of ideas on which I had so luckily stumbled, [...] "that we are not so far apart in mind after all. About <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> stand quite away from each other, like the widely diverging branches of a tree; but, like the branches, we have a meeting-place, and this is, I fancy, {{in that part of}} our nature where our feelings are. My accident in the hills has not disarranged that part of me, I am sure, and I can give you an instance. A little while ago when I was standing behind the bushes watching you all, I saw this young lady----" ...|$|E

5000|$|Goodlatte stated, [...] "We're open {{to working}} with them on {{language}} to narrow bill's provisions, but I think {{it is unrealistic to}} think we're going to continue to rely on the DMCA notice-and-takedown provision.

6000|$|... "Yes; {{after we}} had been there about a month {{he said he had}} enough. He's fearfully restless; he's very much out of health. Mother and I said to him that if he was restless in Paris he needn't hope for peace anywhere. We don't mean to leave him alone till he takes us back." [...] There was an air of keen {{resolution}} in Miss Ruck's pretty face, of lucid apprehension of desirable ends, which made me, as she pronounced these words, direct a glance of covert compassion toward her poor recalcitrant father. He had walked away a little with his wife, and I saw only his back and his stooping, patient-looking shoulders, whose air of acute resignation was thrown into relief by the voluminous tranquillity of Mrs. Ruck. [...] "He will have to take us back in September, any way," [...] the young girl pursued; [...] "he will have to take us back to get <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> have ordered." ...|$|E
6000|$|And yet, {{it will be}} said, {{there are}} <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> can not produce [...] in free {{competition}} with England. Of course there are; and it is [...] to be hoped it will long continue so. If there are not some kinds [...] of commodities which foreigners can produce to better advantage [...] than we, {{then there will be}} no possibility of any foreign trade [...] whatever; since, if they can send us nothing, they can take [...] nothing from us. To deny this position, is to say that the export [...] and import trade of the United States (amounting in 1883 to more [...] than $1,500,000,000) is of no profit, and had best be entirely [...] destroyed, in order that a few industries in which we have no [...] natural advantages (and which employ less than one seventeenth of [...] the laborers in the United States) should be continued at a loss [...] to the general productiveness of our labor and capital, and so to [...] a general diminution of wages and profits.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Chancellor {{thought they}} were. She was {{surprised}} at <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> observed, and concluded that perhaps she hadn't done the Europeans justice--she has got such an open mind, it's {{as wide as the}} sea!--while I incline to the opinion that on the whole we make the better show. The state of the movement there reflects their general culture, and their general culture is higher than ours (I mean taking the term in its broadest sense). On the other hand, the special condition--moral, social, personal--of our sex {{seems to me to be}} superior in this country; I mean regarded in relation--in proportion as it were--to the social phase at large. I must add that we did see some noble specimens over there. In England we met some lovely women, highly cultivated, and of immense organising power. In France we saw some wonderful, contagious types; we passed a delightful evening with the celebrated Marie Verneuil; she was released from prison, you know, only a few weeks before. Our total impression was that it is only a question of time--the future is ours. But everywhere we heard one cry--'How long, O Lord, how long?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|The team {{president}} of the Patriots (Jonathan Kraft) is quoted in the book as saying [...] "It was a very, very strange time, and when you are not an expert at this business - you know we were still very new to the business - it can be educational. Big Bill (ie. Parcells) had kept us in the dark {{on a lot of}} things. He probably misled us on <b>some</b> <b>things.</b> And <b>we</b> didnt know how to go about questioning it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I daresay we all {{pray for}} <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that <b>we</b> really don't want, {{if we were}} only honest enough to look into our hearts," [...] owned Aunt Jamesina candidly. [...] "I've a notion that such prayers don't rise very far. I used to pray that I might be enabled to forgive a certain person, but I know now I really didn't want to forgive her. When I finally got that I DID want to I forgave her without having to pray about it." ...|$|R
