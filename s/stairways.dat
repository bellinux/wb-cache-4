5|$|All the {{buildings}} are interconnected through steps and <b>stairways</b> made in rocks. There are a few rickety wooden bridges along the paths and <b>stairways</b> also to cross over. The temple {{at the highest level}} has a frieze of Buddha. Each building has a balcony, which provides lovely views of the scenic Paro valley down below. The Monasteries have ancient history of occupation by monks, as hermitages.|$|E
5|$|Platform A6 {{encloses}} {{the western}} extreme of the Group A plaza. The platform has two levels, the upper {{of which has}} a vertical cornice. The platform faces east onto the plaza; access was via two <b>stairways</b> flanked by balustrades terminating in vertical cornices. Platform A6 was built over an older {{version of the same}} building; this earlier construction phase was smaller and its <b>stairways</b> were destroyed in order to build the <b>stairways</b> of the final version. During restoration work carried out by archaeologists the back wall and a section of the facade were left exposed. Four funerary urns were found associated with the platform, mostly interred under the front of the building.|$|E

50|$|The temple is of a style {{typical of}} the Postclassic period (c. 950-1539 AD) in the Guatemalan Highlands. The northeastern side of the temple was {{accessed}} by a double <b>stairway,</b> with a single <b>stairway</b> {{on each of the}} other sides. Directly opposite the double <b>stairway,</b> another double <b>stairway</b> climbs the lower platform of the two terraces. On the southeastern side, the single <b>stairway</b> is matched by a single <b>stairway</b> in a platform opposite. The temple and the platform are not perfectly aligned, but there appears to have been an attempt to produce general symmetry.|$|R
50|$|The central <b>stairway</b> is {{accessed}} {{from the}} L-shaped central hallway, which leads from an interior doorway in the kitchen. The hallway also provides {{entrance to the}} dining room and to the parlor. The central <b>stairway</b> featured a 3-step spiral at its base as late as the mid-1950s. That space now contains two landings instead. From the first landing, two steps downward through a former door once provided an additional entrance to the library. Beneath the first-floor <b>stairway</b> is a straight flight of stairs leading to the basement. On the second floor, {{at the top of the}} central <b>stairway,</b> there is an original <b>stairway</b> with one landing and one turn, leading to a trap door in the cupola. The central <b>stairway,</b> the circular <b>stairway,</b> and the cupola <b>stairway</b> all feature original, low handrails with three/quarter balusters.|$|R

5|$|Platform A9 is to {{the east}} of the ballcourt (A11) and faces towards it. It had four access <b>{{stairway}}s</b> set between corniced balustrades; each stairway had nine steps.|$|E
5|$|Platform D5 is a south-facing range {{structure}} of great length {{with just two}} access <b>stairways.</b> Excavations uncovered a number of funerary urns deposited under {{the back wall of}} the structure, the only example burial urns being interred behind such a platform.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stairway</b> is lit by five <b>stairway</b> {{windows and}} two cupola windows.|$|R
25|$|In some ab anbars, {{such as in}} Qazvin, the <b>stairway</b> {{and storage}} would be {{constructed}} adjacently alongside each other, whereas in Yazd the storage and <b>stairway</b> often had no structural connections {{to each other and}} the <b>stairway</b> was positioned independently.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>stairway</b> {{leading to}} the summit of Moro Rock was {{constructed}} of wood and installed in 1917. This <b>stairway</b> deteriorated significantly by the late 1920s, and was replaced in 1931 by the present Moro Rock <b>Stairway,</b> built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Unlike the earlier <b>stairway,</b> the new <b>stairway</b> adopted a design policy of blending with the natural surfaces to the greatest extent possible. The 797-foot-long <b>stairway</b> was designed by National Park Service landscape architect Merel S. Sager and engineer Frank Diehl, following natural ledges and crevices. It has 400 steps {{that lead to the}} summit of Moro Rock. Changes since the original construction have impaired the integrity of the design.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn pursue {{of a new}} {{potential}} {{sustainable energy}} source as a respond to global warming, a literature study was conducted, resulting in a decision to design an energy-harvesting <b>stairway</b> that generates electricity from humans stepping movement's potential energy. This paper discusses the planning and the concept developing in designing the <b>stairway.</b> As an initial step, the <b>stairway's</b> product characteristics is defined using brainstorming. The characteristics were later processed into a questionnaire spread to 42 respondents to obtain the <b>stairway's</b> customer's needs. An NPD approach using TRIZ was utilised to determine the <b>stairway's</b> product specification based on the customer needs obtained...|$|R

5|$|In the Late Classic {{there appears}} to have been greater public access to the acropolis, with <b>stairways</b> {{communicating}} between the various terraces leading up to the south range. During the Terminal Classic, these <b>stairways</b> were filled in, as were many of the access doorways to the acropolis itself, with some buildings being sealed completely. This closing of public access to the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time. The acropolis complex was abandoned by the city's elite in the Terminal Classic, a time when most of the city centre was also deserted by its residents. Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of the acropolis, this combined with the remains of two individuals very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the fort there is a {{courtyard}} planted with trees. Around it on various levels are rooms, enclosures and towers accessible through a complex set of <b>stairways</b> that may have once had a defensive purpose.

25|$|In a {{multi-story}} building, {{an internal}} <b>stairway</b> (away from broken windows) often {{acts as a}} safe haven, due to the stairs reinforcing the walls and blocking any major debris falling from above.

50|$|Around 1900 a stone <b>stairway</b> {{was built}} on the rocks in order to reach the terrace of the rock on which the castle stood, in order {{to use it as a}} viewing point. This stone <b>stairway</b> was {{refurbished}} in 2007 by the Pirmasens-Land municipal authorities. A wooden <b>stairway</b> may originally have been used to access the castle.|$|R
5|$|Structure 10 borders the {{northeast}} side of Plaza 4 and is unrestored although some original stonework is evident.

5|$|Valuable {{clues about}} Han {{architecture}} {{can be found}} in Han artwork of ceramic models, paintings, and carved or stamped bricks discovered in tombs and other sites. The layout of Han tombs were also built like underground houses, comparable to the scenes of courtyard houses found on tomb bricks and in three-dimensional models. Han homes had a courtyard area (and some had multiple courtyards) with halls that were slightly elevated above it and connected by <b>stairways.</b> Multi-story buildings included the main colonnaded residence halls built around the courtyards as well as watchtowers. The halls were built with intersecting crossbeams and rafters that were usually carved with decorations; <b>stairways</b> and walls were usually plastered over to produce a smooth surface and then painted.|$|E
