40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{liquidity}} regulation in jurisdictions with a limited supply of highquality liquid assets, using a model based on Bech and Keister (2013). We show how introducing a liquidity coverage ratio in such settings can have significant side effects, leading to a large liquidity premium and pushing the risk-free rate {{to the floor of the}} central bank’s interest rate corridor. Adding a committed liquidity facility allows the central bank mitigate these effects, regardless of whether it is implemented as a fixed-price <b>standing</b> <b>facility</b> or using a fixed-quantity auction format. By pricing committed liquidity appropriately, the central bank can control either the equilibrium liquidity premium or the quantity of liquid assets held by banks, but not both. We argue that the optimal pricing arrangement likely aims to balance these two considerations and will depend on local market conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we compare two {{mechanisms}} for implementing monetary policy: <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> and open market operations. We show that any equilibrium allocation {{that can be}} attained with open market operations can be replicated with <b>standing</b> <b>facilities,</b> but that the converse is not true. Furthermore, the set of equilibrium allocations that can be attained with <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> is weakly dominated in terms of welfare by the set of equilibrium allocations that can be attained with open market operations. However, if the central bank chooses the optimal policy for each mechanism, the allocations are equivalent.

40|$|The {{banking system}} is modeled {{in a closed}} system of {{financial}} accounts, whereby the equilibrium volume of bank intermediation between households and corporates reflects structural parameters such as household preferences, comparative cost structures of heterogeneous banks, loan demand of corporates, {{and the difference between}} the borrowing rate and the deposit facility rate of the central bank. The model also allows understanding the link between this difference (the width of the central bank <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> corridor) and the stance of monetary policy, and how this link changes during a financial crisis. It is shown how the narrowing of the <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> corridor can make more accommodating the stance of monetary policy in a financial crisis.

40|$|This paper reviews some of {{the issues}} confronting central banks in their choice of {{monetary}} operating instruments and techniques. As a result of efforts by governments to improve efficiency in financial systems, together with developments in financial information, computation and communication technology, central banks are having to increasingly rely on flexible operating instruments and techniques which convey in a convincing manner to market participants their near-term objectives. This has contributed to the relative decline in the importance of <b>standing</b> credit <b>facilities</b> and the greater reliance on flexible open market intervention techniques. Policy signalling and disclosure have increasingly become essential elements in short-term monetary management. ...|$|R

The model combines profit maximising behaviour by commercial banks with the central bank supplying the liquidity that keeps the market rate on target.

An averaging provision reduces the use of <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> and interest rates volatility in all days except for {{the last day of the}} maintenance period. Whenever banks have different maintenance horizons both the spikes in volatility and use of <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> disappear. The paper also compares two different liquidity supply policies and finds that the level of liquidity necessary to keep the rates on target depends on not only the aggregate but also assets values of individual banks.

In this paper we treat this intervention more generally as a country insurance contract, and examine its implications in a stylized set-up.

In particular, we find that the case for country insurance is stronger for crisis-prone volatile economies, especially so if assistance is made contingent on the occurrence of adverse external macroeconomic shocks. Overall, our findings argue in favor of fairly-priced country insurance or insurance-type <b>standing</b> credit <b>facilities</b> that can be factored in ex ante by the borrowing government, as opposed to the customized discretionary bailoutsFinancial Crises, Bailouts, Moral Hazard, Insurance Effect,...|$|R
