5|$|At {{about the}} same time as the realignments in Michigan, two-lane {{bypasses}} of Manitowoc and Port Washington in Wisconsin were opened in 1957. The state built a divided-highway segment that opened the following year running from the Milwaukee area northward to the Ozaukee–Milwaukee county line. The highway was rerouted to run further inland, bypassing Haven, Wisconsin, in 1959. In late 1961, the highway in Michigan was rebuilt in northern Iron and southern Baraga counties between Amasa and Covington as the state <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> sharp corners in the routing and finished paving US141; a similar project was completed in 1972 south of Amasa to Crystal Falls.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department rerouted M-33/M-72 near Fairview in late 1951 {{or early}} 1952, turning the former route back to local control. The last section of M-33 was paved in {{southern}} Cheboygan County {{in the late}} 1950s. The southern end was extended slightly to end at the M-76 freeway that opened between Alger and Standish; that freeway was redesignated as part of I-75 in 1974. A minor realignment of M-32/M-33 east of Atlanta <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> some curves in the road in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The high-definition upgrade {{was not as}} {{difficult}} as it might have been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed to be set as there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were <b>smoothed</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the Big Bang {{model for}} the {{formation}} of the universe, Inflationary Cosmology predicts that after about 10−37 seconds the nascent universe underwent exponential growth that <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> nearly all irregularities. The remaining irregularities were caused by quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field that caused the inflation event. Before the formation of stars and planets (after 10−6 seconds), the early universe was smaller, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from its white-hot fog of interacting plasma of photons, electrons, and baryons.|$|E
25|$|This {{argument}} {{works for}} a finite sum of exponentials, and correctly establishes {{that there are no}} singularities in the free energy of a system of a finite size. For systems which are in the thermodynamic limit (that is, for infinite systems) the infinite sum can lead to singularities. The convergence to the thermodynamic limit is fast, so that the phase behavior is apparent already on a relatively small lattice, even though the singularities are <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> by the system's finite size.|$|E

25|$|The goal of density {{estimation}} {{is to take}} {{a finite}} sample of data and to make inferences about the underlying probability density function everywhere, including where no data are observed. In kernel density estimation, the contribution of each data point is <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> from a single point into a region of space surrounding it. Aggregating the individually smoothed contributions gives an overall picture {{of the structure of the}} data and its density function. In the details to follow, we show that this approach leads to a reasonable estimate of the underlying density function.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Renaissance decided upon an Italian theme, but {{spent too}} long with their brand and pricing for the themed {{day that they}} could not buy from the wholesalers, thus forced to buy from {{elsewhere}} and resulting in increased food costs. Although their income was high and their services <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> after a shaky start, the team suffered from a lack of supplies that resorted to them cutting prices in half on their pizzas, with their expenditure being much higher due to their high cost overruns. Meanwhile, Alpha chose a Bollywood theme, yet while they managed to arrange all their printing for free, they were forced to cancel their lunch service due to the food not being prepared properly. They soon turned things around by focusing on a sales strategy of selling admission tickets for £5 that were redeemable against dinner, which proved to be a decisive idea as they secured a healthy profit, even before they had served a meal.|$|E
25|$|The team first {{considered}} {{spinning the}} radar dish around a vertical axis and then angling the dish {{up and down}} a few degrees with each complete circuit. The vertical motion could be <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> by moving continually rather than in steps, producing a helix pattern. However, this helical-scan solution had two disadvantages; one was that the dish spent half of its time pointed backwards, limiting the amount of energy broadcast forward, and the other was that it required the microwave energy to somehow be sent to the antenna through a rotating feed. At a 25 October all-hands meeting attended by Dee, Hodgkin and members of the GEC group at GEC's labs, {{the decision was made to}} proceed with the helical-scan solution in spite of these issues. GEC solved the problem of having the signal turned off half the time by using two dishes mounted back-to-back and switching the output of the magnetron to the one facing forward at that instant. They initially suggested that the system would be available by December 1940, but as work progressed it became clear that it would take much longer.|$|E
25|$|Bode {{designed}} the velocity computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a {{finite difference method}} instead of differentiation. Under this scheme the target positional coordinates were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a potentiometer or a cam. The velocity was then calculated by taking {{the difference between the}} coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times. This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to random signal impulses (spikes). It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern digital signal processing theory rather than to the classical Calculus-based analog signal processing approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it {{is an integral part of}} modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm. In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating coordinate transformation-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.|$|E

25|$|Most pottery {{found at}} the Nodena Site is of the kind known as Mississippian Bell Plain. It was buff colored, {{contains}} large fragments of ground mussel shell as a tempering agent, and isn't as smooth and polished as other varieties. Other kinds found there are much finer, with a finer ground shell as a temper, some instances being so finely ground as to look untempered. The Nodena Phase people put a bowl and a bottle into a grave with the bodies, usually of the finer variety of pottery. Shapes and decoration were varied in the mortuary pottery, from brighly colored abstract spiral designs, to elaborate effigy vessels depicting human heads, animals, and hunters and their prey. Pottery made by the Nodena people was built up from strips of clay, and then <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> by the potter, much like other pottery in the Eastern America area where the potters wheel was unknown. Slips using galena for white, hematite for red, and sometimes graphite for black were used to paint the pottery, with a red on white swastika design being particularly popular. Sometimes incising was used (an example is the incised raptor image on the effigy head pot pictured), although it is rare in Nodena pottery.|$|E

25|$|Result: Odyssey {{decided on}} a 1940s theme at a premium price, while Platinum went with a theme based around Alice in Wonderland and the Mad Hatter's tea party, and much cheaper pricing. Things {{generally}} went smoothly on Odyssey, {{though there was a}} major argument between Alice and Maria over the pricing, as Alice wanted to offer discounts for senior citizens, while Maria felt everyone should pay full price. They struggled to attract customers as the day went on, and had to resort to slashing prices as the task drew to a close. Despite the price cutting, it only managed to pull in 2 extra customers. On Platinum, David had trouble effectively leading the team, which resulted in Ashleigh making a lot of the decisions: on the second day, their tea service rapidly descended into chaos, with David still struggling to lead the team, and customers failing to be served in a timely manner. However, the service <b>smoothed</b> <b>out</b> as the day progressed and they took over £100 more than Odyssey. Despite their better overall execution of the task, Odyssey spent £100 more money, which proved decisive in the end figures. Odyssey had a profit of £91, and Platinum had a profit of £316, more than 3 times the amount of Odyssey.|$|E
