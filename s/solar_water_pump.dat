40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} as a Minor Field Study (MFS). It focuses on <b>solar</b> <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> for small-scale farmers in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. The purpose is to investigate the possibilities for rural farmers to operate their irrigation with solar power instead of their current option: fossil fuels, primarily petrol. The {{study was conducted in}} three phases, starting with pre-study in Sweden, followed by field study in Tanzania from January to March 2015 and finishing with summarizing and calculating in Sweden. Fuel powered <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> has a cheap capital cost; however, it is expensive and problematic to maintain and operate. <b>Solar</b> powered <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> is almost completely opposite.

The discharge heads of 1 and 2 Â m were tested. The pump could operate at the collector temperature of about 70 - 90 Â Â°C and vapor gage pressure of 10 - 18 Â kPa. It was found that water circulation within the SWHS ranged between 15 and 65 Â l/d depending upon solar intensity and discharge head. Moreover, the max water temperature in the storage tank is around 59 Â Â°C. The max daily pump efficiency is about 0. 0017 %. The SWHS could have max daily thermal efficiency of about 21 %. It is concluded that the thermal efficiency was successfully improved, except for the pump one. The new SWHS with 1 Â m discharge head or lower is suitable for residential use.

By developing such renewable energy based grids, farmers will be able to receive considerable revenue on monthly basis by selling the excess power to the grid for a period of 25 years.

40|$|In this {{research}} poultry housing model {{was developed to}} study {{the possibility of using}} solar and wind energy to cool air inside the house during the hot summer months in Sudan. In this model the roof was heated by solar energy, creating negative pressure in a well insulated air cavity left under the roof. As a result, air convection from the air cavity generated suction force to pull air through evaporative cooling pads installed on the wind ward side. Direct wind force helped in enhancing cool air flow into the shed. An air cowl was installed at the outlet of roof cavity to assist in air suction from the shed. Daily readings of air temperature outside, inside the model and in roof air cavity were taken on hourly basis throughout the study period (October to December). Also, readings of relative humility and air speed were taken. The results obtained showed that, the efficiency of cooling pads varied between (0. 64 to 0. 73), the average cool air temperature varied between (20. 3 to 26. 9 oC) during the peak thermal hours of the day. This range was well within in the acceptable range for poultry rearing. cooling air velocity in the model varied between (0. 23 to 1. 21 m/s), while the air flow rates varied between (0. 621 to 3. 21 m 3 /s) and this was in the acceptable range for poultry.
