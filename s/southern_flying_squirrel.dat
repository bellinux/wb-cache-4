2500|$|Although {{it shares}} the {{temperate}} climate found in Southern Ontario, {{its proximity to}} Lake Ontario moderates winter temperatures and it also benefits from a sheltering effect of the Niagara Escarpment, allowing the most northerly tracts of Carolinian forest to thrive on the Escarpment that runs through western sections of city. Several species of flora and fauna usually found only in more southern climes have their only Canadian presence here including paw-paw, green dragon (Arisaema dracontium), tuckahoe (Peltandra virginica), American columbo (Frasera carolinensis), wall-rue (Asplenium ruta-muraria), plus the Louisiana waterthrush, the hooded warbler, the <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> and the rare eastern pipistrelle. Near the visible promontory of Mount Nemo that rises some 200m (650ft) above the lake level, a [...] "vertical forest" [...] of white cedar clinging to the Escarpment face includes many small trees that {{are more than a}} thousand years old.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} also home to the {{northern}} flying squirrel and the <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel,</b> which depend on trees with holes for nesting and food storage.

40|$|ABSTRACT. —It is {{commonly}} assumed that population estimates derived from trapping small mammals are accurate and unbiased or that estimates derived from different capture methods are comparable. We captured <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Glaucomys volans) using two methods to study {{their effect on}} red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) reproductive success. <b>Southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> were captured at and removed from 30 red-cockaded woodpecker cluster sites during March to July 1994 and 1995 using Sherman traps placed in a grid encompassing a red-cockaded woodpecker nest tree and by hand from red-cockaded woodpecker cavities. Totals of 195 (1994) and 190 (1995) red-cockaded woodpecker cavities were examined {{at least three times}} each year. Trappability of <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> in Sherman traps was significantly greater in 1995 (1. 18 %; 22, 384 trap nights) than in 1994 (0. 42 %; 20, 384 trap nights), and capture rate of <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> in cavities was significantly greater in 1994 (22. 7 %; 502 cavity inspections) than in 1995 (10. 8 %; 555 cavity inspections). However, more <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> were captured per cavity inspection than per Sherman trap night in both years. Male <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{were more likely to be}} captured from cavities than in Sherman traps in 1994, but not in 1995. Both male and female juveniles were more likely to be captured in cavities than in traps in both years. In 1994 males in reproductive condition were more likely to be captured in cavities than in traps and in 1995 we captured significantly more reproductive females in cavities than in traps. Our data suggest that population estimates based solely on one trapping method may not represent true population size or structure of <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels...</b>|$|R

40|$|We use {{museum and}} other {{collection}} records to document large and extraordinarily rapid {{changes in the}} ranges and relative abundance of nine species of mammals in the northern Great Lakes region (white-footed mice, woodland deer mice, southern red-backed voles, woodland jumping mice, eastern chipmunks, least chipmunks, <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> common opossums). These species reach either the southern or the northern limit of their distributions in this region. Changes consistently reflect increases in species of primarily southern distribution (white-footed mice, eastern chipmunks, <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels,</b> common opossums) and declines by northern species (woodland deer mice, southern red-backed voles, woodland jumping mice, least chipmunks, northern <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels).</b> White-footed mice and <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> have extended their ranges over 225 km since 1980, and at particularly well-studied sites in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, small mammal assemblages have shifted from numerical domination by northern species to domination by southern species.

5000|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{are highly}} social mammals {{and have been}} {{observed}} flying and foraging together in large groups. [...] Additionally, they often aggregate together in dens, especially as seasonal temperatures decline in order to conserve energy. Compared to individuals who nest alone in winter, squirrels in aggregates can save 30 percent more energy. [...] Although <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> do show a preference for relatedness, they are tolerant of nonrelated but familiar individuals, possibly because {{in addition to providing}} heat energy for the aggregation, outsiders will promote outbreeding.|$|R
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> nest {{in natural}} {{cavities}} and woodpecker holes, or build nest out {{of leaves and}} twigs. Leaf nests are used as a refuge or a resting site and are used primarily in summer, whereas cavities are used for breeding and more intensively during winter. Cavities used by <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are found in small snags, average 23.27 cm diameter at breast height, or large living trees, average 50.42 cm dbh, with entrances that average 4.7 cm in width by 9.4 cm in height which are an average of 6.36 m above the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The size of {{the home}} range of <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> varies greatly. [...] Average home range {{estimates}} are 2.45 hectares, 9.0 hectares, and 16.0 hectares [...] for adult males, 1.95 hectares, 3.9 hectares, and 7.2 hectares [...] for adult females, and 0.61 hectares for juveniles. Significant overlap exists among the home ranges. Near the northern limit of the <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> distribution, home range increases in size as mast-producing trees become more dispersed. This trend is also observed in fragmented forests where nesting and foraging areas become widely spaced.|$|R

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} winter habitat selection for <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Glaucomys volans) in northern latitudes where winter conditions are harsher than southern latitudes and resource availability is particularly limiting. Winter den tree characteristics and use by 19 <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> (10 females and 9 males) were investigated from November through February in 2010 - 2011 and 2011 - 2012. The mean home range size using 100 % minimum convex polygon for 18 individuals was 3. 40 ha (± 0. 46 0. 46 SE) {{and there was no}} significant difference between genders (P= 0. 56) or ages (P= 0. 50). The mean 95 % fixed kernel home range size was 0. 15 ha (± 0. 46 0. 02 SE). The mean number of den trees used was 3. 7 (± 0. 45 SE) over winter months. There were no significant differences detected between genders (P = 0. 68) or ages (P = 0. 69) for total number of den trees used. Individuals primarily selected sugar maple (Acer saccharum) as den trees over other tree species. Results indicated that den trees (n= 26) were taller, had larger diameters and higher decay levels than other available trees in the immediate vicinity (n= 52). Genetic relatedness of winter aggregations revealed low relatedness - 0. 22 (95 %CI: ± 0. 17) and no evidence of <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> preferentially nesting with kin was detected. <b>Southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> require mature stand characteristics during winter months and, late-successional forest conditions should be retained for the persistence of the species in its northern range. The study also provides baseline data for analyzing genetic relatedness of G. volans winter aggregations in the northern range of the species...|$|R

50|$|Flying {{squirrels}} {{are usually}} nocturnal, {{since they are}} not adept at escaping birds of prey that hunt during the daytime. They eat according to their environment; they are omnivorous, and will eat whatever food they can find. The North American <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> eats seeds, insects, gastropods (slugs and snails), spiders, shrubs, flowers, fungi, and tree sap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> or the assapan (Glaucomys volans) is one {{of three}} species of the genus Glaucomys, the only flying {{squirrels}} found in North America. It is found in deciduous and mixed woods in the eastern half of North America, from southeastern Canada, to Florida. Disjunct distribution for populations of this species have been recorded in the highlands of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> {{is found}} in eastern {{deciduous}} forests or mixed forests of North America. [...] Large hickory and beech trees are more abundant in intensively used areas of their home ranges. Also, maple and poplar, as well as oak trees make favorable habitat.

Foxes were also once residents, but the increasing number of coyotes spotted in Central Park and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx may account for the foxes' apparent current absence.|$|R
50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrels</b> are nocturnal, feed on {{fruit and}} nuts from trees such as {{red and white}} oak, hickory and beech. They store food, {{especially}} acorns, for winter consumption. They also dine on insects, buds, mushrooms, mycorrhizal fungi, carrion, bird eggs and nestlings and flowers. Predators include snakes, owls, hawks and raccoons. Domestic house cats can be dangerous to these animals.|$|R
50|$|The {{brown rat}} {{and the house}} mouse were both {{introduced}} and their habitat range throughout the Eastern U.S. Weasels such as the fisher and short-tailed weasel {{are found in the}} northeast. The eastern chipmunk, fox squirrel, eastern gray squirrel and the woodchuck are found throughout the region, while the <b>southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> and northern flying squirrel are more common in the southeast, the American red squirrel is more common in the northeast. The least weasel is native to the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
50|$|The are 44 {{species of}} flying {{squirrel}} worldwide. The {{fact that most}} of them live in Asia has led to the hypothesis that they originated there. Only two species are found in the Americas: the Northern flying squirrel lives in deciduous and mixed woods all across Canada as well as down into the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada; the <b>Southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> lives in the Eastern half of North America from southern Canada down to Florida, with isolated pockets in Central America.|$|E
50|$|Other {{small mammals}} that {{commonly}} are {{found on the}} refuge include eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). These species are most common in pine-oak forests where acorns are abundant. <b>Southern</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Glaucomys volans) is recorded for the Upper Wells and Brave Boat divisions, but they probably also occur in other areas with mature pine-oak forest. Other small mammals that are known or are likely to occur on the refuge include hairy-tailed mole (Parascalops breweri), star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata), smoky shrew (Sorex fumeus), and house mouse (Mus musculus).|$|E
