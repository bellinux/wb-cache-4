Home use of these complex medical devices implies several risks. Acknowledgement of the risks by all the parties involved - industry, government agencies, health practitioners and insurance companies - and adequate communication between all parties in the chain of care, as well as the implementation of proper preventive measures, will enhance patient safety. In general, risks are higher when a technology is invasive, used for life support or for the application of substances, and when it is applied to a large number <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> Risks are often related to use errors and arise because at home poorly qualified persons, such as patients or informal carers, are using the device as well.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} In-hospital fall-related {{injuries}} {{are a source}} of personal harm, preventable hospitalisation costs, and access block through increased length of stay. Despite increased fall prevention awareness and activity over the last decade, rates of reported fall-related fractures in hospitals appear not to have decreased. This cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to determine the efficacy of the 6 -PACK programme for preventing fall-related injuries, and its generalisability to other acute hospitals. Methods 24 acute medical and surgical wards from six to eight hospitals throughout Australia will be recruited for the study. Wards will be matched by type and fall-related injury rates, then randomly allocated to the 6 -PACK intervention (12 wards) or usual care control group (12 wards). The 6 -PACK programme includes a nine-item fall risk assessment and six nursing interventions: ‘falls alert’ sign; <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> in the bathroom; ensuring patient’s walking aids are within reach; establishment of a toileting regime; use of a low-low bed; and use of bed/chair alarm.

As many people were admitted more than once, this represented 31 411 individual patients. Patients’ characteristics and length of stay were similar for intervention and control wards. Use of 6 -PACK programme components was higher on intervention wards than on control wards (incidence rate ratio 3. 05, 95 % confidence interval 2. 14 to 4. 34; P< 0. 001).

Conclusions: Positive changes in falls prevention practice occurred following the introduction of the 6 -PACK programme. However, no difference was seen in falls or fall injuries between groups.

Specialist roles for HCAs are beginning to emerge. The ‘Care Crew’ at Royal Berkshire Hospital is a team of HCAs lead by a band 4 assistant practitioner. The structure of the Care Crew involves the development of HCAs to become recognised and valued members of a team, working independently to provide support and care for people with challenging behaviours, including those with dementia. Methods Care Crew members receive a programme of training and support from the Practice Educator in Dementia. Patients are referred to the Care Crew by nurses from 8 wards including elderly care, renal and bone fragility unit. The Care Crew provide one-to-one support and group activities. One-to-one support can be provided for any patient who is distressed, confused, unsettled, presents with challenging or aggressive behaviours, risk of causing harm to themselves or others, or {{are at risk of}} leaving the ward without being discharged.

However, accreditation and recognition of that role has been devolved to the autonomic regions. The opinions of the RT may be relevant to future decisions; Methods A comprehensive questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, academic and research achievement and personal views about their role, was sent to 201 RTs in the Murcia Region of Spain. The responses are described using median and interquartile ranges (IQR); Results There were 147 replies (response rate 73 %), 69 % male, mean age 45 ± 7 yrs. RTs perception of the residents' initial knowledge and commitment throughout the program was 5 (IQR 4 - 6) and 7 (IQR 5 - 8), respectively. As regards {{their impact on the}} PMT program, RTs considered that their own contribution was similar to that of senior residents. RTs perception of how their role was recognised was 5 (IQR 3 - 6). Only 16 % did not encounter difficulties in accessing specific RT training programs. Regarding the RTs view of their various duties, <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> care was accorded the greatest importance (64 %) while the satisfactory completion of the PMT program and <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> day-to-day activities were also considered important (61 % and 59 % respectively).
