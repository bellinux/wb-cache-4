5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
5|$|Avoidance of risk factors, {{including}} <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> air pollution, is {{the primary}} method of prevention. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend {{on the type of}} cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.|$|E

5|$|It was the {{influence}} of Playford's mother Elizabeth that contributed to his relative Puritanism and social habits.

40|$|Tobacco consumption, {{responsible}} for six million deaths each year, {{is a large}} concern for social marketers. Social cognitive theory suggests that self-efficacy is a key predictor of smoking behavioural change. According to this theory, enhancement of self-efficacy is an effective method for smoking cessation. Yet not much {{work has been done}} by social marketers to understand how different social marketing tools such as marketing mix affect self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>smoking</b> behaviour. This research has systematically gathered and meta-analyzed intervention studies by finding elements of marketing in them and their effect on self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>smoking</b> cessation. This study also looks at the relationship between self-efficacy enhancement <b>and</b> <b>smoking</b> cessation. By studying the nature of relationships between marketing mix and self-efficacy, self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>smoking</b> cessation, <b>and</b> marketing mix <b>and</b> <b>smoking</b> cessation, we inspect the mediating influence of self-efficacy on the 4 P’s (product, price, place and promotion) of marketing mix <b>and</b> <b>smoking</b> cessation...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To compare {{tobacco control}} {{policies}} independently {{and as a}} package through a simulation model to project <b>smoking</b> prevalence <b>and</b> associated future premature mortality in Argentina beginning in 2001. Methods. A simulation model of tobacco control policies known as SimSmoke was modified using data for Argentina on population, fertility <b>and</b> mortality, <b>smoking</b> prevalence, <b>and</b> to-bacco control policies in effect between 2001 and 2004. We used the Argentina Tobacco Policy Simulation model (ATPSM) to consider the effect on smoking prevalence of changes in taxes and prices, clean air laws, media campaigns, cessation programs, and youth access policies on <b>smoking</b> initiation <b>and</b> cessation rates. <b>Smoking</b> prevalence <b>and</b> relative risks of smoking were used to estimate smoking-attributable mortality. The ATPSM was used to project <b>smoking</b> prevalence <b>and</b> smoking-attributable deaths during the period 2001 – 2034. Results. The largest reductions in <b>smoking</b> prevalence <b>and</b> premature mortality were pre-dicted for a comprehensive tobacco control policy package, but relative reductions {{of as much as}} 30 % were also predicted for large tax increases.

5|$|Dot {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics; {{she has been}} referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by Alistair McGowan, and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections.|$|E

He added that Levski abstained from <b>smoking</b> <b>and</b> drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E

40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWASs) {{have identified}} associations between the CHRNA 5 –CHRNA 3 –CHRNB 4 gene cluster <b>and</b> <b>smoking</b> heaviness <b>and</b> nicotine dependence. Studies in rodents {{have described the}} anatomical localisation and function of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) formed by the subunits encoded by this gene cluster. Further investigations that complemented these studies highlighted the variability of individuals’ <b>smoking</b> behaviours <b>and</b> their ability to adjust nicotine intake. GWASs of smoking-related health outcomes have also identified this signal in the CHRNA 5 –CHRNA 3 –CHRNB 4 gene cluster. This insight underpins approaches to strengthen causal inference in observational data.
