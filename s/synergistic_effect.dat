In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E

25|$|Reactions run at {{temperatures}} {{as low as}} 100°C are possible by using zirconium salts as a cocatalyst in place of bromide and manganese acetate. It is thought that the zirconium(IV) acts to oxidize Co(II) to the active Co(III). This alone shortens the induction period, and {{has been shown to}} have a <b>synergistic</b> <b>effect</b> with ketones. However, a greater amount of cobalt acetate is required than the common industrial process and is ineffective over 160°C.|$|E
25|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} (Ace-K) is 200 times {{sweeter than}} sucrose (common sugar), {{as sweet as}} aspartame, about two thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a <b>synergistic</b> <b>effect</b> in which the blend is sweeter than its components.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survival}} of cancer cells are greatly related to their surrounding microenvironment. To understand the regulation under the impact of anti-cancer drugs and their <b>synergistic</b> <b>effects,</b> we have developed a multiscale agent-based model that can investigate the <b>synergistic</b> <b>effects</b> of drug combinations with three innovations. First, it explores the <b>synergistic</b> <b>effects</b> of drug combinations in a huge dose combinational space at the cell line level. Second, it can simulate the interaction between cells and their microenvironment. Third, it employs both local and global optimization algorithms to train the key parameters and validate the predictive power of the model by using experimental data. The research results indicate that our multicellular system can not only describe the interactions between the microenvironment and cells in detail, but also predict the <b>synergistic</b> <b>effects</b> of drug combinations...|$|R

25|$|The {{two major}} {{risk factors for}} esophageal squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} are tobacco (smoking or chewing) and alcohol. The combination of tobacco and alcohol has a strong <b>synergistic</b> <b>effect.</b> Some data suggest {{that about half of}} all cases are due to tobacco and about one-third to alcohol, while over three-quarters of the cases in men are due to the combination of smoking and heavy drinking. Risks associated with alcohol appear to be linked to its aldehyde metabolite and to mutations in certain related enzymes. Such metabolic variants are relatively common in Asia.|$|E
25|$|Penicillin {{remains the}} {{drug of choice}} for {{treating}} streptococcal infections, and S.dysgalactiae strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin have never been reported. Treatment duration varies from 5 days to 3 months, depending on the clinical diagnosis. Second-line agents include macrolides and clindamycin, although increasing resistance, due to both efflux and target modification, has been documented in some geographic regions. Aminoglycosides are not active against streptococci due to their lacking respiratory metabolism. However, administered in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, aminoglycosides appear to produce a <b>synergistic</b> <b>effect</b> towards streptococci. Streptococcus dysgalactiae is uniformly susceptible to glycopeptides and oxazolidones.|$|E
25|$|In a {{case study}} by Gondim et al. 2010, a seventy–seven-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease (PD) was {{administered}} amantadine {{after a year of}} various other antiparkinsonian treatments. Two days into her treatment, she started to experience musical hallucinations, which consisted of four musical pieces. The music persisted until three days after cessation of the drug. Although the patient was taking other medications at the same time, the timing of onset and offset suggested that amantadine either had a <b>synergistic</b> <b>effect</b> with the other drugs or simply caused the hallucinations. Although the case wasn't specific to intoxication, it leads to the idea that persons with PD who are treated with certain drugs can experience musical hallucinations.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has been}} able to show the {{function}} of niacin in the pathway lipid metabolism. It is seen that this vitamin can decrease the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, IDL and Lipoprotein (a) via several mechanisms: (1) Directly inhibiting the action of DGAT2, a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis; (2) It has the ability to bind to the receptor HCAR2 thereby decreasing lipolysis and FFA flux to the liver for triglyceride synthesis; and (3) increased apoB catabolism. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol levels are increased by niacin through direct and indirect pathways. (4) Niacin decreases CETP mass and activity, and this <b>synergistic</b> <b>effect</b> with the decrease in triglyceride levels, can indirectly raise HDL cholesterol levels. The study has also been able to show direct effects on the beta chain of ATP synthase (5) and on production (6) and hepatic uptake (7) of apoA-I also increase HDL cholesterol levels. Thus by affecting the pathway reducing lipid levels help in reducing CVD.|$|E
