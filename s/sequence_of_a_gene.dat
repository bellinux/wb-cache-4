5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene,</b> which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E

25|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} is {{a molecular}} biology method {{that is used}} to make specific and intentional changes to the DNA <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> and any gene products.

25|$|Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR): for amplifying DNA from RNA. Reverse {{transcriptase}} reverse transcribes RNA into cDNA, {{which is then}} amplified by PCR. RT-PCR is widely used in expression profiling, to determine {{the expression of a}} gene or to identify the sequence of an RNA transcript, including transcription start and termination sites. If the genomic DNA <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> is known, RT-PCR can be used to map the location of exons and introns in the gene. The 5' end of a gene (corresponding to the transcription start site) is typically identified by RACE-PCR (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends).|$|E
25|$|Within minutes, {{bacterial}} ribosomes start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, RNA replicase is synthesized {{early in}} the process. Proteins modify the bacterial RNA polymerase so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host’s normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on {{to become part of}} new virions within the cell, helper proteins that help assemble the new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Walter Fiers (University of Ghent, Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> (1972) and of the viral genome of bacteriophage MS2 (1976).|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleotide}} <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>gene's</b> DNA specifies {{the amino}} acid <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein through the genetic code.

TRAP also shares with certain extracellular glycoproteins, including TSP, the cell-recognition signal Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), which {{has been shown to be}} crucial in the interaction of several extracellular glycoproteins with members of the integrin superfamily.

50|$|Genes {{generally}} {{express their}} functional effect through {{the production of}} proteins, which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in the cell.
