5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> physically {{capable of}} reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} generally respects non-Muslims' {{right of}} worship; however, state governments carefully control {{the building of}} non-Muslim places of worship and the allocation of land for non-Muslim cemeteries. Approvals for such permits <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> granted very slowly.|$|E

25|$|While {{traditional}} zongzi are {{wrapped in}} bamboo leaves, {{the leaves of}} lotus, reed, maize, banana, canna, shell ginger and pandan <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> used as substitutes in other countries. Each kind of leaf imparts its own unique aroma and flavor to the rice.|$|E
25|$|South Bass Island has the island-village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio which attracts young crowds who <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> {{prone to}} general merriment.

25|$|Shelters <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> {{unable to}} meet state {{standards}} for occupancy, such as testing fire sprinklers or ensuring that exits are clearly marked. In New York city, 2015, the state withheld funding from many shelters which did not meet standards or which had poor conditions.|$|E

25|$|Marian apparitions <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> {{reported}} to recur {{at the same}} site {{over an extended period}} of time. In the majority of Marian apparitions only one person or a few people report having witnessed the apparition. Exceptions to this include Zeitoun, Fátima, and Assiut where thousands claimed to have seen her over a period of time.|$|E
25|$|Other {{medications}} {{may be used}} {{in conjunction}} with other procedures to stabilize a person who has sustained a significant injury. While positive inotropic medications such as norepinephrine <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> used in hemorrhagic shock as a result of trauma, {{there is a lack of}} evidence for their use. Therefore, as of 2012 they have not been recommended. Allowing a low blood pressure may be preferred in some situations.|$|E
25|$|Many times, {{books that}} need to be {{restored}} are hundreds of years old, and the handling of the pages and binding has to be undertaken with great care and a delicate hand. The archival process of restoration and conservation can extend a book's life for many decades and is necessary to preserve books that <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> limited to a small handful of remaining copies worldwide.|$|E

25|$|One {{particular}} semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz {{on a date}} in a restaurant. They <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> {{waited on}} by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when {{he is about to}} report a complaint about the food.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, a pacu {{was caught}} in the Øresund, a strait between Sweden and Denmark. This led to media reports mistakenly warning that the fish could attack testicles. The reports were based on a joke (referring to their actual feeding on tree nuts) that was not meant to be taken seriously. Nevertheless, their very strong jaws made for {{crushing}} plant seeds and alike means that fishermen and aquarists <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> warned about the powerful bite that may cause traumatic injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{privacy of}} {{correspondence}} is {{guaranteed by the}} constitutions of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, and is alluded to in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The control of the contents inside private citizens' mail is censorship and concerns social, political, and legal aspects of civil rights. International mail and packages are subject to customs control, with the mail and packages are often surveyed and their contents <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> edited out (or even in).|$|E

25|$|Huntsman spiders, {{members of}} the family Sparassidae (formerly Heteropodidae), are known by this name because of their speed and mode of hunting. They also are called giant crab spiders because of their size and appearance. Larger species <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> {{referred}} to as wood spiders, because of their preference for woody places (forests, mine shafts, woodpiles, wooden shacks). In southern Africa the genus Palystes are known as rain spiders or lizard-eating spiders. Commonly they are confused with baboon spiders from the Mygalomorphae infraorder, which are not closely related.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{assumption}} {{is to compare}} power densities at the same pressure, choosing the ion temperature for each reaction to maximize power density, and with the electron temperature equal to the ion temperature. Although confinement schemes can be and <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> limited by other factors, most well-investigated schemes {{have some kind of}} pressure limit. Under these assumptions, the power density for p–11B is about 2,100 times smaller than that for D-T. Using cold electrons lowers the ratio to about 700. These numbers are another indication that aneutronic fusion power is not possible with mainline confinement concepts.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{nutrients}} {{are available in}} the must and skins of the grapes themselves but <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> supplemented by winemakers with additions such as diammonium phosphate (DAP), freeze-dried micro-nutrients (such as Go-Ferm and Ferm-K) and even the remnant of dead or extracted yeast cells such that the fermenting yeast can break down to mine for available nitrogen and nutrients. One historical winemaking tradition that is still practiced in some Italian wine regions is the ripasso method of adding the leftover pomace from the pressing of other wines into a newly fermenting batch of wine as an additional food source for the yeast.|$|E
