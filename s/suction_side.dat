25|$|Where {{the flow}} over the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> of a {{transonic}} wing is accelerated to a supersonic speed, the resulting re-compression can be by either Prandtl-Meyer compression {{or by the}} formation of a normal shock. This shock is of particular interest to makers of transonic devices because it can cause separation of the boundary layer at the point where it touches the transonic profile. This can then lead to full separation and stall on the profile, higher drag, or shock-buffet, a condition where the separation and the shock interact in a resonance condition, causing resonating loads on the underlying structure.|$|E

Numerical simulations of the flow field and heat transfer of squealer blade tip are performed in this study. The effects of the Reynolds number, the clearance gap to width ratios (C/W = 5 % - 15 %) and the cavity depth to width ratios (D/W = 10 %- 50 %) on fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are obtained. The temperature and velocity distributions inside the cavity, the local heat transfer coefficients, and the average Nusselt numbers for the pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides</b> of the turbine blade tip are determined. This paper {{presents the results of}} the effects of Reynolds number, clearance gap and width ratios on the Nusslet number for the pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides</b> of squealer turbine blade tip.

For this reason the connection of the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> of the pump is larger in diameter than the connection of the pressure side. In case of the use of multi-pump assemblies, the suction connection of the pump is often combined. It is preferred to have free flow to the pump (pressure at inlet of pump at least 0.8 bar).

40|$|In gas turbines, {{the blades}} of axial turbine stages rotate in close {{proximity}} to a stationary peripheral wall. Differential expansion of the turbine wheel, blades, and the shroud causes variations {{in the size of the}} clearance gap between blade tip and stationary shroud. The necessity to tolerate this differential thermal expansion dictates that the clearance gap cannot be eliminated altogether, despite accurate engine machining. Pressure differences between the pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides</b> of a blade drives a flow through the clearance gap. This flow, the tip leakage flow, is detrimental to engine performance. The primary detrimental effect of tip leakage flow is the reduction of turbine stage efficiency, and a second is the convective heat transfer associated with the flow. The surface area at the blade tip in contact with the hot working gas represents an additional thermal loading on the blade which, together with heat transfer to the <b>suction</b> and pressure <b>side</b> surface area, must be removed by the blade internal cooling flows. Experimental results concerned with the local heat transfer characteristics on all surfaces of shrouded, rectangular cavities are reported.

5000|$|<b>Suction</b> <b>side</b> surface {{cavitation}} forms {{when the}} propeller is operating at high rotational speeds or under heavy load (high blade lift coefficient). The {{pressure on the}} upstream surface of the blade (the [...] "suction side") can drop below the vapor pressure of the water, resulting {{in the formation of}} a vapor pocket. Under such conditions, the change in pressure between the downstream surface of the blade (the [...] "pressure side") and the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> is limited, and eventually reduced as the extent of cavitation is increased. When most of the blade surface is covered by cavitation, the pressure difference between the pressure side and <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> of the blade drops considerably, as does the thrust produced by the propeller. This condition is called [...] "thrust breakdown". Operating the propeller under these conditions wastes energy, generates considerable noise, and as the vapor bubbles collapse it rapidly erodes the screw's surface due to localized shock waves against the blade surface.|$|E

The local effectiveness values obtained by the computations agreed well with the experimental data from IR thermography. The effect of blowing ratio on the overall effectiveness is found to be strongly dependent on the vane material conductivity. The effect of blowing ratio is also found to be different towards the pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides</b> of the stagnation region.

40|$|Part I of {{this paper}} {{presents}} airfoil heat transfer data obtained in a rotating turbine model at its design rotor incidence. This portion of the paper presents heat transfer data obtained in the same model for various combinations of Reynolds number and inlet turbulence and for a very wide range of rotor incidence. On the suction surfaces of the first stage airfoils the locations and lengths of transition were influenced by both the inlet turbulence level and the Reynolds number. In addition it was demonstrated that on the first stage pressure surfaces combinations of high Reynolds number and high turbulence can produce heat transfer rates well in excess of two-dimensional turbulent flow. Rotor heat transfer distributions indicate that for relatively small deviations from the design incidence, local changes to the heat transfer distributions were produced on both pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides</b> near the stagnation region. For extremely large negative incidence the flow was completely separated from the rotor pressure surface producing very high local heat transfer...|$|R

Five morechanges are made to the leading edge profile of the new design, {{in order to assess}} different degrees of unsteadiness. These changes show that their contribution on stageefficiency is rather minor, while they have a huge reduction on blade loadings. Moreover, it is shown that the shorter radial distance of vaneless space does not necessarilymean an increased loading thanks to the eliminating in-phase fluctuations on pressureand <b>suction</b> <b>sides.</b> It is found that the impeller reacts to the upstream static pressure disturbance, whichis caused by the applied geometry change and its resultant flow field in the wedge diffuser, but not to the radial location of a certain profile. In addition, the results indicatethat the wedge diffuser aerodynamic performance is driven by time-averaged flow fieldbehaviour...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Optimal design {{techniques}} are not routinely {{used in the}} industry when dealing with complex physical phenomena, due to high computing costs. The parameterization method described in this paper {{is based on the}} differentiation and high-order Taylor-series expansion of the discretized Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A flow database containing the derivatives of the physical variables with respect to the design variables is produced by the Turb’Opty c ○ parameterization tool and thoroughly explored by a multi-objective Genetic Algorithm coupled to the extrapolation tool Turb’Post c ○. The optimization case of an automotive engine cooling fan blade is fully described. Five geometric parameters have been chosen to characterize the fan blade. Three objective functions have been taken into account: the minimization of the loss coefficient, the maximization of the static pressure rise and the minimization of the torque. Two geometric constraints have been imposed to the extrapolated profiles: the monotonicity of the thickness variation and the convexity of the pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides.</b> Quantitative results are finally discussed. A noticeable reduction in CPU time cost has been demonstrated. ...|$|R
50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters the pump {{and an outlet}} where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to be}} at the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the discharge side of the pump. Operation of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the <b>suction</b> <b>side</b> so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a centrifugal pump is too low, a device may trigger the pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.|$|E
50|$|To set {{the heat}} {{output of the}} burner, the rate of fuel {{delivery}} via the nozzle must be adjustable.

Unfortunately, nowadays, the noise emissions from wind turbines represent one of the main obstacles to widespread the use in populated zones. Moreover, the energetic efficiency of these wind turbines has to be high even at low and medium wind velocities because, usually the cities are not windy places. The numerical results clearly show that the wakes after the trailing edge are the main noise sources. In order to decrease the power of these noise sources, we should try to decrease the intensity of wakes after the trailing edge, i. e. the aerodynamic fields from pressure and <b>suction</b> <b>sides</b> would have to be almost the same near trailing edge.
