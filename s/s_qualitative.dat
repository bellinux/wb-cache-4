40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the capability of a standardized battery of Luria 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>qualitative</b> neuropsychological techniques in discriminating between right, left and diffuse brain-injured subjects. A total of sixty medically confirmed brain-damaged subjects were equally divided among the three groups. Subjects were assigned to two groups (right, left) according to medically proven lateralized brain injury to either the right or left hemisphere in the absence of verifiable insult to the opposite hemisphere. A third group was also selected in which medical evidence confirmed damage to both hemispheres (diffuse group). All three groups were matched for age and education. All subjects were tested on a standardized version of 269 Luria 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>qualitative</b> neuropsychological test items. The items were divided into 11 sections based upon Luria 2 ̆ 7 s theory of brain function. Each of the 11 sections plus a right and a left hemisphere scale as well as an overall impairment scale yielded 14 summary measures of performance representing several areas of neuropsychological ability and overall severity of brain dysfunction. Analysis of variance and discriminant analysis were used to compare the three groups on these 14 summary measures. Analysis of variance revealed on significant difference between the three groups on the Left scale with the left group performing poorest.

Of 21 compounds with good antiplasmodial activities (50 % inhibitory concentrations [IC 50 s], ≤ 20 μM), 8 members were found to inhibit sorbitol-induced lysis of parasitized erythrocytes to a significant extent (≤ 40 % of control values) at a concentration (10 μM) that was close to their antiplasmodial IC 50 <b>s.</b> <b>Qualitative</b> structure-activity analysis suggested that activity was governed {{to a greater extent}} by a substitution on ring B than on ring A of the chalcone template.

40|$|This first {{monitoring}} update highlights {{findings from}} SMERU 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>qualitative</b> studies in seven communities and media monitoring up to mid-October 2009. The studies {{reveal that the}} current global financial crisis (GFC) in Indonesia has had {{a variety of different}} impacts.

The level of severity, however, varies across livelihood types and exposure to the developed countries hit hard by crisis. The sectors that experienced export booms due to the depreciation of the Rupiah during the 1997 / 98 Asian Financial Crisis have tended to be more severely affected by the current GFC. Despite signs of mild recovery, there is an indication of a declining trend in wage levels among industrial laborers. In the community, the poorest have been the most severely impacted.

40|$|The {{concept of}} theme is {{critical}} to the accurate interpretation of qualitative data. A literature review of qualitative research methodology and nursing research studies reveals considerable diversity in the identification of themes, the interpretation of the concept, and its function in data analysis. Part of the problem is the transfer of research methods from other disciplines to the study of nursing phenomena. The transfer often results in a blending of distinct research methods that compromises methodological rigor in data analysis and theory generation. A definition of theme is developed from the literature review and interdisciplinary definitions and descriptions. Five aspects of a theme and criteria foundational to the definition and concept of theme are iden-tified. Implications of the concept of theme are presented for the conduct and application of research findings to the practice and development of nursing science. Even though nursing science and theory are still evolving, it is evident that qualitative methodologies are integral to both. During the 1990 <b>s,</b> <b>qualitative</b> methodology surged to the forefront of nursing research.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} widely used {{transgenic}} animal models in biology is Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. Chemical information from this exceedingly small organism is usually accomplished by studying populations to attain sample volumes suitable for standard analysis methods. This paper describes a direct sampling technique capable of obtaining 50 - 300 nL of hemolymph from individual Drosophila larvae. Hemolymph sampling performed under mineral oil and in air at 30 s intervals up to 120 s after piercing larvae revealed that the effect of evaporation on amino acid concentrations is insignificant when the sample was collected within 60 <b>s.</b> <b>Qualitative</b> and quantitative amino acid analyses of obtained hemolymph were carried out in two optimized buffer conditions by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection after derivatizing with fluorescamine. Thirteen amino acids were identified from individual hemolymph samples of both wild-type (WT) control and the genderblind (gb) mutant larvae. The levels of glutamine, glutamate, and taurine in the gb hemolymph were significantly lower at 35 %, 38 %, and 57 % of WT levels, respectively. The developed technique that samples only the hemolymph fluid is efficient and enables accurate organism-level chemical information while minimizing errors associated with possible sample contaminations, estimations, and effects of evaporation compared to the traditional hemolymph-sampling techniques...|$|E

ANC-cards, partograms, hygiene, interventions, cord clamping, labour support and the women <b>s</b> <b>qualitative</b> experience were compared with the guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant literature.
