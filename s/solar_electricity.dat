5|$|In 2008, <b>solar</b> <b>electricity</b> was not cost {{competitive}} with bulk, baseload power. However, it does provide electricity {{when and where}} power is most limited and most expensive, which is a strategic contribution. <b>Solar</b> <b>electricity</b> mitigates the risk of fuel-price volatility and improves grid reliability. Since then costs have decreased to make <b>solar</b> <b>electricity</b> increasingly competitive.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and wind power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. <b>Solar</b> <b>electricity</b> consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E

40|$|<b>Solar</b> thermal <b>electricity</b> {{is a type}} of {{renewable}} energy technology of special interest for Andalusia (southern Spain) because of the large number of annual sunshine hours. This paper estimates the impact on productive activities of increasing the production capacity of the installed solar thermal plants in Andalusia. Using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach, estimates of the changes in the economic sectors’ activity under two different scenarios are obtained: i) based on two types of <b>solar</b> thermal <b>electricity</b> plants currently in operation; and ii) based on an increase from 11 MW in 2007 to 800 MW installed capacity by 2013 to comply with the ‘Plan Andaluz de Sostenibilidad Energética (PASENER) – Sustainable Energy Plan for Andalusia’. For the case of a parabolic-trough solar collector power plant, results show that compliance with the PASENER goal would increase the level of the productive activities by around 30 %. For the alternative technology – a solar-tower power plant – results show that activities would increase by around 5 % for 30 years, the estimated lifetime of this type of plant. Thus the impact of the <b>solar</b> thermal <b>electricity</b> plants on the productive activities of the PASENER compliant production goal would be remarkable.

25|$|The {{photovoltaic}} effect is {{the transformation of}} light into electrical energy, as in solar cells. Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity. Although sunlight is free and abundant, <b>solar</b> <b>electricity</b> is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due {{to the cost of}} the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems. Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, and the United States.|$|E
500|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>electricity</b> is {{inherently}} variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition solar is intermittent due to day/night cycles and unpredictable weather. How {{much of a}} special challenge solar power is in any given electric utility varies significantly. In a summer peak utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands. [...] In winter peak utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their capacity factors.|$|E
500|$|In an {{electricity}} {{system without}} grid energy storage, generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be {{go up and}} down in reaction to {{the rise and fall of}} <b>solar</b> <b>electricity</b> (see load following power plant). [...] While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. [...] Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections, energy storage or demand side management. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing baseload generation contracts.|$|E

40|$|Australia is {{a country}} with a vast amount of natural {{resources}} including sun and wind. Australia lies between latitude of 10 – 45 °S and longitude of 112 – 152 °E, with a daily solar exposure of between less than 3 MJ/(m 2 day) in winter and more than 30 MJ/(m 2 day) in summer. Global solar radiation in Australia varies between minimum of 3285 MJ/(m 2 year) in Hobart to 8760 MJ/(m 2 year) in Northern Territory. As a result of this wide range of radiation level there will be a big difference between costs of <b>solar</b> PV <b>electricity</b> in different locations.

For this purpose we have developed an economical model and a computer simulation to determine the accurate unit price of grid-connected roof-top <b>solar</b> photovoltaic (PV) <b>electricity</b> in A/kWh for all state of Australia.
