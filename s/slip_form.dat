5000|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>forming,</b> {{continuous}} poured, continuously formed, or slipform {{construction is}} a construction method in which concrete is poured into a continuously moving <b>form.</b> [...] <b>Slip</b> <b>forming</b> {{is used for}} tall structures (such as bridges, towers, buildings, and dams), as well as horizontal structures, such as roadways. Slipforming enables continuous, non-interrupted, cast-in-place [...] "flawless" [...] (i.e. no joints) concrete structures which have superior performance characteristics to piecewise construction using discrete <b>form</b> elements. <b>Slip</b> <b>forming</b> relies on the quick-setting properties of concrete, and requires a balance between quick-setting capacity and workability. Concrete needs to be workable enough to be placed into the form and consolidated (via vibration), yet quick-setting enough {{to emerge from the}} form with strength. This strength is needed because the freshly set concrete must not only permit the form to [...] "slip" [...] by the concrete without disturbing it, but also support the pressure of the new concrete as well as resist collapse caused by the vibration of the compaction machinery.|$|R

5000|$|The slip forming {{technique}} was in {{use by the}} early 20th century for building silos and grain elevators. James MacDonald, of MacDonald Engineering of Chicago was the pioneer in utilizing <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> concrete for construction. His concept of placing circular bins in clusters was patented, with photographs and illustrations, contained in a 1907 book, “The Design Of Walls, Bins, And Grain Elevators”. In 1910, MacDonald published a paper “Moving Forms for Reinforced Concrete Storage Bins,” [...] describing the use of molds for moving forms, using jacks and concrete to form a continuous structure without joints or seams. This paper details the concept and procedure for creating <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> concrete structures. On May 24, 1917, a patent was issued to James MacDonald of Chicago, [...] "for a device to move and elevate a concrete form in a vertical plane".|$|E
50|$|Concrete curb may be {{constructed}} by setting forms by hand, filling them, letting them set up, and then removing the forms. When {{large quantities of}} curb are to {{be constructed}}, it is often more efficient to use a <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> casting machine. Curbs can also be precast at a central location and trucked to the construction site.|$|E
50|$|Concrete shear {{walls are}} {{reinforced}} with both {{horizontal and vertical}} reinforcement (Figure 4). A reinforcement ratio {{is defined as the}} ratio of the gross concrete area for a section taken orthogonal to the reinforcement. Construction codes of practice define maximum and minimum amounts of reinforcement as well as the detailing of steel bars. Common construction methods for in-situ reinforced concrete walls include traditional shuttered lifts, <b>slip</b> <b>form,</b> jump form and tunnel form.|$|E

5000|$|The Great North Road {{runs through}} the village (now B1164), though the {{majority}} of traffic now uses the modern A1 trunk road, which splits the village in two. The village was bypassed in July 1967, opened by Stephen Swingler. The section of road, known as Carlton to Markham Moor, or the Sutton-on-Trent, Weston and Tuxford Bypass, was built by Robert McGregor & Sons, with concreting aggregates supplied by Hoveringham Gravels (later bought by Tarmac). The eight-mile section was authorised by Tom Fraser with a contract for £2.7 million, but ended up costing £3.4 million. The section is notable for the first use in British construction of the <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> paver using pervious concrete. The bridge sections came from Boulton & Paul Ltd in Norwich.|$|E
40|$|Constructing {{buildings}} using <b>slip</b> <b>formed</b> {{load bearing}} wall panels is becoming increasingly popular in Sri Lanka due to several advantages; low cost, environmental friendliness and rapid construction technique. These wall panels are already successfully implemented in many low rise buildings. However, the seismic capacities of these buildings have not been properly studied.

(WJE) {{evaluated}} potential {{nondestructive evaluation}} (NDE) methodologies {{that may be}} effective in 1) identifying internal defects within <b>slip</b> <b>formed</b> concrete barriers and 2) assessing the corrosion condition of barrier dowel bars. The evaluation was requested by the Bridge Maintenance and Inspection Unit of the Iowa Department of Transportation (IaDOT) and the Bureau of Bridges and Structures of the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). The need arose due to instances in each Department’s existing inventory of bridge barriers where internal voids and other defects associated with <b>slip</b> <b>forming</b> construction methods were attributed to poor barrier performance after completion of construction and where, in other barrier walls, unintentional exposure of the dowel bars revealed extensive corrosion-related section loss at previously uninspectable locations, reducing {{the capacity of the}} barriers to resist traffic impact loads. WJE trial tested potential NDE techniques on laboratory mock-up samples built with known defects, trial sections of cast-in-place barriers at in-service bridges in Iowa, and <b>slip</b> <b>formed</b> and cast-in-place barrier walls at in-service bridges in Illinois. The work included review of available studies performed by others, field trial testing to assess candidate test methods, verification of the test methods in identifying internal anomalies and dowel bar corrosion, and preparation of this report and nondestructive evaluation guidelines...|$|R

40|$|When {{applying}} the <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> system, the early setting time of concrete {{corresponds to the}} hardening time of early-age concrete indicating that cast-in-place concrete has developed sufficient strength to be safely stripped off the form. This hardening time is thus an important indicator for {{the determination of the}} slip-up velocity of the <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> system. Therefore, need is for a technique enabling to evaluate the early hardening time of concrete in order to secure the safety of the <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> system {{and the quality of the}} constructed concrete. Among the methods using ultrasonic waves, this paper applies the surface wave velocity to evaluate the degree of hardening of concrete so as to estimate the early setting time and decide the slip-up time of the <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> system. To that goal, penetration resistance test, compressive strength test and surface wave velocity measurement test are performed concurrently with respect to the mix materials and curing temperature of concrete. The test results are used to derive the relationship between the compressive strength and surface wave velocity according to the early hardening time of concrete. Continuous wavelet transform is applied for the measurement of the surface wave velocity. The validity of the application of the continuous wavelet transform is verified through numerical analysis. Finally, the surface wave velocity required for the slip-up of the <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> system is proposed and the applicability of the proposed surface wave velocity for the determination of the climbing time of the <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> system is verified by means of tests on a reduced-scale <b>slip</b> <b>form</b> system prototype...|$|E

50|$|Jump forming, {{also known}} as {{climbing}} forming, is a method of construction whereby the walls are cast in discrete lifts. It is a stop-start process with day joints formed at each lift level. Similar to <b>slip</b> <b>forming,</b> jump forming is only efficient for structures with repetition of wall arrangement. Moreover, it is convenient for adding connections and extrusions at the floor level due to the discrete features. Nevertheless, the inclusion of day joints leaves higher chances for defects and imperfections.|$|R
