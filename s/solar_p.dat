40|$|Analyses of a 3 D {{simulation}} {{of the upper}} layers of a solar convective envelope provide constraints on the physical quantities which enter the theoretical formulation of a stochastic excitation model of <b>solar</b> <b>p</b> modes, for instance the convective velocities and the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. These constraints are then used to compute the acoustic excitation rate for <b>solar</b> <b>p</b> modes, P. The resulting values are found ~ 5 {{times larger than the}} values resulting from a computation in which convective velocities and entropy fluctuations are obtained with a 1 D solar envelope model built with the time-dependent, nonlocal Gough (1977) extension of the mixing length formulation for convection (GMLT). This difference is mainly due to the assumed mean anisotropy properties of the velocity field in the excitation region. The 3 D simulation suggests much larger horizontal velocities compared to vertical ones than in the 1 D GMLT solar model. The values of P obtained with the 3 D simulation constraints however are still too small compared with the values inferred from solar observations. Improvements in the description of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum and its depth dependence yield further increased theoretical values of P which bring them closer to the observations. It is also found that the source of excitation arising from the advection of the turbulent fluctuations of entropy by the turbulent movements contributes ~ 65 - 75 % to the excitation and therefore remains dominant over the Reynolds stress contribution. The derived theoretical values of P obtained with the 3 D simulation constraints remain smaller by a factor ~ 3 compared with the solar observations. This shows that the stochastic excitation model still needs to be improved. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E

Modeled profiles of the solar rotation demonstrated the potential advantage of such a technique. Here we develop a new analysis procedure which finds the best estimates of the shift of each m of a given (n,ℓ) multiplet, commonly expressed as an expansion in a set of orthogonal polynomials, which yield the narrowest mode in the m-averaged spectrum. We apply the technique to the GONG data for modes with 1 ≤ℓ≤ 25 and show that it allows us to measure lower-frequency modes than with classic peak-fitting analysis of the individual-m spectra.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the frequency {{dependence of the}} power spectral density of low-degree <b>solar</b> <b>p</b> modes by comparing measurements {{with the results of}} a stochastic-excitation model. In the past it was common practice to use the total power in such investigations. Using the maximum of the power spectral density instead provides a direct comparison with the measured mode heights in the observed power spectrum. This method permits a more careful calibration of the adjustable parameters in the excitation model, a model which we present here, for the first time, in a format that precisely and unambiguously relates the amplitudes of the modes of oscillation to the Reynolds stress in the equilibrium model. We find that errors in the theory of the linear mode damping rates, particularly at low frequency, have a dramatic impact on the predictions of the mode heights in the spectral density, whereas parameter changes in the stochastic excitation model, within a plausible domain of parameter space, have a comparatively small effect...|$|E

To effect this study we have made use of some approximate to 10 yr of full-disc, "Sun-as-a-star" Doppler velocity data collected by the Birmingham-Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON). A coherent combination of observations made by all six BiSON sites provided the principal time series of data. This set was then modulated by a whole series of different window functions and the resulting sets analyzed. The windows were made from different combinations and numbers of BiSON stations. We find that for the majority of low-l modes the bias in the frequencies given by the effects of the window function is not significant. However, for modes above approximate to 3300 muHz, and some l = 2 modes near approximate to 2500 muHz, the bias is important when the frequencies are extracted from long datasets...|$|E
