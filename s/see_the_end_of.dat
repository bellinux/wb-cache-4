5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|Pompey's death did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the civil}} wars since {{initially}} Caesar's enemies were manifold and Pompey's supporters continued {{to fight on}} after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost {{perhaps as much as}} a third of his army when his former commander Titus Labienus, who had defected to the Pompeians several years earlier, defeated him at the Battle of Ruspina. However, after this low point Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the Battle of Munda in Iberia. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.|$|E

25|$|But the UFW was not {{the only}} union to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Delano grape strike as an opportunity. Six {{thousand}} drivers and packing workers in the Salinas Valley in California, represented by the Teamsters, struck on July 17, 1970 effectively preventing most of the nation's summer lettuce crop from reaching consumers. The price of iceberg lettuce tripled overnight, and thousands of acres of lettuce were plowed under as crops spoiled on the ground. The strike ended on July 23, but the contract included a special agreement by the growers to give the Teamsters, not the UFW, access to farms and the right to organize workers into unions.|$|E
25|$|Casals died in 1973 at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico, {{at the age}} of 96, from {{complications}} of a heart attack he had three weeks earlier.

He did not live to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Franco dictatorial regime, which occurred two years later, but he was posthumously honoured by the Spanish government under King Juan Carlos I which in 1976 issued a commemorative postage stamp depicting Casals, in honour of the centenary of his birth. In 1979 his remains were interred in his hometown of El Vendrell, Catalonia. In 1989, Casals was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.|$|E

Cézanne died 22 October 1906 (aged 67). His works included Maison dans les arbres (no. 323), Portrait de Femme (no. 235) and Le Chemin tournant (no. 326). Constantin Brâncuși entered three plaster busts: Portrait de M. S. Lupesco, L'Enfant and Orgueil (no. 218 - 220). Raymond Duchamp-Villon exhibited Dans le Silence (bronze) and a plaster bust, Œsope (no. 498 and 499). His brother Jacques Villon exhibited six works. Kees van Dongen showed three works, Montmartre (492), Mademoiselle Léda (493) and Parisienne (494). André Derain exhibited Westminster-Londres (438), Arbres dans un chemin creux (444) and several other works painted at l'Estaque.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the war in 1945, the Soviet people {{expected}} to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the devastation of Nazism, and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges. But, sealed trains began carrying large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet Gulags. Some were Nazi collaborators who had fought under General Andrey Vlasov, but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men. Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet concentration camps. White emigres who had returned due to pledges of amnesty were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the Anti-Fascist Committee and other organizations. Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the Leningrad Affair and the so-called Doctor's Plot, while whole ethnic groups were deported to Siberia.|$|E
25|$|During the war, Colt's {{was still}} {{prevented}} by the American laws from infringing Rollin White's patent. Nevertheless, the war {{made a huge}} fortune for the company, allowing Sam Colt to become America's first manufacturing tycoon, {{though he did not}} live to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the war; he died of rheumatic fever on January 10, 1862. His close friend and firearms engineer, Elisha K. Root, took over as Colt's company president. On February 4, 1864 a fire destroyed most of the factory, including arms, machinery, plans, and factory records. On September 1, 1865, Root died, leaving the company in the hands of Samuel Colt's brother-in-law, Richard Jarvis. The company's Vice-president was William B. Franklin, who had recently left the Army {{at the end of the}} Civil War. With the Civil War over and having no new military contracts, Colt's Manufacturing was forced to lay off over 800 employees.|$|E

As Rijadi was riding atop a tank towards the final rebel stronghold on 4 November, a volley of machine gun fire erupted in his direction. A single bullet rebounded off the tank's armour and into Rijadi's abdomen. After being rushed to a hospital ship, Rijadi insisted on returning to the front; instead, the doctors gave him much morphine and attempted unsuccessfully to treat the gun wound. Rijadi died that night; the battle ended the same day. [...] Rijadi was buried in Ambon.|$|E
500|$|There are two {{shooting}} modes: Precision and Slingshot. In Precision, players {{control the}} shot by sliding their {{fingers along the}} bottom of the screen, which calculates the arc and direction of the shot. In Slingshot, like Angry Birds, players draw back their shots like slingshots. The shot grows in power the longer the screen is held, and the shot is fired when the player lets go. Weak shots will also arc down with gravity, and strong shots will decrease in power if held too long. There are no power-ups, no gamified micropayments, and no pause function, but there are achievements such as living to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the universe.

500|$|Wary of his ageing Arsenal {{team and}} the club's {{inadequate}} reserves (as proven by the Walsall match), it was around this time that Chapman noted to club director George Allison: [...] "The team's played out, Mr Allison, we must rebuild". Chapman started the process, signing Ray Bowden, Pat Beasley and Jimmy Dunne, and had converted the young George Male from left half to right back. Unfortunately, he would not live to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the season, let alone complete the task of rebuilding his side. Arsenal went into 1933–34 looking to retain the title, and started consistently; they worked {{their way to the}} top of the league and were a comfortable four points clear after a goalless draw with Birmingham City on 30 December 1933. This proved to be Chapman's last match in charge.|$|E

More generally, the tremendous volatility in all commodity markets makes it nearly impossible for producers and the food industry {{to plan for the}} future. But farmers need to begin planning for their 2009 crop, and food producers need to make procurement plans for the remainder of this marketing year.

500|$|The {{lifetime}} of British writer, philosopher, and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft (17591797) encompassed {{most of the}} second half of the eighteenth century, a time of great political and social upheaval throughout Europe and America: political reform movements in Britain gained strength, the American colonists successfully rebelled, and the French revolution erupted. Wollstonecraft experienced only the headiest of these days, not living to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the democratic revolution when Napoleon crowned himself emperor. Although Britain was still revelling in its mid-century imperial conquests and its triumph in the Seven Years' War, it was the French revolution that defined Wollstonecraft's generation. As poet Robert Southey later wrote: [...] "few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the memory of the French Revolution was, nor what a visionary world seemed to open upon those who were just entering it. Old things seemed passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race." ...|$|E
500|$|Benbow {{was made}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the King's {{ships in the}} West Indies on 9 March 1698 and instructed to tackle the issue of piracy. He sailed in November, the first leg taking him from Portsmouth to Madeira. Sailing under his protection from the Salé pirates was the Paramore, under Edmond Halley, then sailing to the North Atlantic to carry out experiments to observe magnetic variations. Benbow finally reached Barbados in February 1699, {{and moved to the}} Spanish Main aboard his flagship, the 60-gun HMS Gloucester. He threatened the governor of Cartagena with a blockade, and so compelled him to restore two English merchant ships that he had detained. These ships had been intended to take part in an expedition against the Scottish Darién scheme. Without the ships, this became impossible and the colonists were saved for the time being. This was counter to the English government's desire to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish colonising efforts, and in June Benbow and the other West Indies governors received orders [...] "not to assist the Scotch colony in Darien." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} shows in Fox's Animation Domination block, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club praised the episode for having [...] "some actual plot and continuity". She concluded her review, writing: [...] "Jillian has been a pretty good addition to the Family Guy universe, and I think I'm actually sad to see her and Brian break up." [...] She graded the episode B+, the second-highest grade of the night. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote that the episode [...] "managed to rise about the generic plotline and deliver a pretty solid half-hour of entertainment that told a cohesive (and somewhat sad) main story, with just enough gags {{to fill in the}} rest of the time." [...] Haque graded the episode 7.8 out of 10, and wrote that it was [...] "definitely sad to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Brian and Jillian relationship, especially considering the great performance put on by Drew Barrymore." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad called it [...] "a fairly pedestrian episode with a few cute gags".|$|E
