40|$|The term Doppler {{should be}} {{capitalized}} because {{it refers to}} Christian Johann Doppler, an Austrian physicist (1803 – 1853). He described a phenomenon whereby the frequency of sound changes when it is reflected off a moving object. If the object is moving towards the observer, <b>reflected</b> <b>sound</b> frequency is increased (blue shift), while if the <b>reflecting</b> <b>object</b> is {{moving away from the}} observer, the sound frequency decreases (red shift). This is analogous to a moving ambulance with its siren on; the siren pitch increases as ambulance approaches and decreases as it receeds. The Doppler Effect may be used also in ultrasound. With normal grey scale ultrasound we rely on amplitude of <b>reflected</b> <b>sound</b> waves and the reflectivity of anatomic structures is proportional to the intensity (or amplitude) of the <b>reflected</b> <b>sound</b> and hence brightness on the scanner display. If frequency (rather than amplitude) is analysed, one can detect motion on the basis of Doppler shifts. These frequency shifts can be quantified reasonably accurately according to direction, velocity and also acceleration, all of which provide specific signatures that help identify both normal and diseased blood vessels. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Blind {{people may}} detect {{objects from the}} {{information}} in <b>reflected</b> <b>sounds,</b> echolocation. Detection {{as a function of}} the number of clicks compared to a continuous noise was tested by presenting clicks of 5 ms with rates from 1 to 64 clicks during a 500 ms period and a 500 -ms continuous white noise. The sounds were recorded in an ordinary room through an artificial binaural head. The <b>reflecting</b> <b>object</b> was an aluminum disk, diameter 0. 5 m, at distances of 1 and 1. 5 m. These sounds were later presented to 3 blind and 16 sighted participants in a laboratory using a 2 AFC methodology. The task was to detect which of the two sounds that contained a <b>reflecting</b> <b>object.</b> Feedback was provided. The blind participants had a higher detection than the sighted, but there were also differences among the blind. These results are put in relation to physical features such as the autocorrelation function and spectral variations. Blind people use sounds to find out how the world around them is constituted.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} for real-time reflection on curved objects. In our algorithm, we first determine the regions on the reflectors where reflections are likely to exist. To {{reduce the cost of}} rendering the reflections, for each <b>reflected</b> <b>object,</b> a local cube map, called a layered depth texture, is constructed. At run time, a fragment program is used to search the intersection point of the reflective ray from the reflector with the layered depth textures. For a convex <b>reflected</b> <b>object,</b> a single layered cube map is sufficient to ensure geometrically correct reflection results. For a concave object, a multi-layered cube map is needed, which can be generated using the depth-peeling technique. Our search algorithm for reflection rendering does not depend on the geometry complexity of the <b>reflected</b> <b>objects.</b> In addition, the construction of the layered depth textures does not depend on the viewpoint, so it only needs to be done once...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Radar is {{a system}} that uses {{electromagnetic}} waves to detect, locate and measure the speed of <b>reflecting</b> <b>objects</b> such as aircraft, ships, spacecraft, vehicles, people, weather formations, and terrain. It transmits the electromagnetic waves into space and receives the echo signal <b>reflected</b> from <b>objects.</b> By applying signal processing algorithms on the reflected waveform, the <b>reflecting</b> <b>objects</b> can be detected. Furthermore, the location and the speed of the objects can also be estimated. Radar was originally an acronym for “RAdio Detection and Ranging”. Pulse Compression is an important signal processing technique used in Radar Systems to reduce the peak power of a radar pulse by increasing the length of the pulse, without sacrificing the range resolution associated with a shorter pulse and different techniques Barker code and LFM are implemented...|$|R
