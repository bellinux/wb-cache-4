40|$|Before recommending {{a feeding}} {{strategy}} for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, {{it is important}} to conduct a holistic assessment of all related emissions, including from those arising from feed production, digestion of these feeds, managing the resulting manure, and other on-farm production processes and inputs. Using a whole-systems approach, the Holos model, and experimentally measured data, this study compares the effects of alfalfa silage- versus corn silage-based diets on GHG estimates in a simulated Canadian dairy production system. When all emissions and sources are accounted for, {{the differences between the two}} forage systems in terms of overall net GHG emissions were minimal. Utilizing the functional units of milk, meat, and total energy in food products generated by the system, the comparison demonstrates very little difference between the two <b>silage</b> production <b>systems.</b> However, the corn <b>silage</b> <b>system</b> generated 8 % fewer emissions per kg of protein in food products as compared to the alfalfa <b>silage</b> <b>system.</b> Exploratory analysis of the impact of the two <b>silage</b> <b>systems</b> on soil carbon showed alfalfa silage has greater potential to store carbon in the soil. This study reinforces the need to utilize a whole-systems approach to investigate the interrelated effects of management choices. Reported GHG reduction factors cannot be simply combined additively because the interwoven effects of management choices cascade through the entire system, sometimes with counter-intuitive outcomes. It is necessary to apply this whole-systems approach before implementing changes in management intended to reduce GHG emissions and improve sustainability...|$|R

After two years, earlier corn harvest did not result in greater intercrop growth or higher soil N levels compared with later corn harvest and there was no significant soil N contribution by legume intercrops in either harvest period.

40|$|Some of {{the best}} quality silage ever made has come from round bales sealed in plastic. On the other hand, {{some of the worst}} silage that I have ever seen {{likewise}} came from round bales in plastic. These extremes in quality are related to procedural techniques for putting up round bale silage and problems that can occur during storage. If proper techniques are followed, excellent quality silage can be produced, especially from late summer and fall cuttings. But if bales are not managed properly, it can be a disaster resulting in total loss of the silage. It may be easier to preserve hay crop silage in upright, trench and bunker silos than in large bales sealed in plastic. Plastic is much more susceptible to air leaks and oxygen infiltration than concrete or steel, so the ease of maintaining an oxygen-free storage environment is much less for bales surrounded by plastic than for conventional silos. The round bale <b>silage</b> <b>system,</b> sometimes referred to as `balage', has a number of advantages over hay and conventional silage systems: 1.

40|$|Abstract: As an {{alternative}} system to glass jars, mini-silo consisting of polypropylene (PP) container for laboratory studies of fermentation dynamics in silage was proposed {{in our previous}} study. However, suitability of this mini-silo was questioned, as {{there was a slight}} probability of air penetration into container, which would lead to silage deterioration. In this study, an improvement of the original mini-silo system for ensiling was undertaken. A non-transparent PP container was replaced with a see-through container made of co-polymer poly-propylene (PP), which had a lid with layer of silicon on its edge, which made this mini-silo practically air-proof. The lid was equipped with a special water valve, for releasing of gas products of the fermentation from the silage. Moreover, the see-through container made a provision for monitoring of micro-organisms growth and thus better explanation of the obtained results on silage microbiological status. The improved <b>silage</b> <b>system</b> was tested in an experiment in which alfalfa was compacted into transparent containers with addition of two bacterial inoculants.

40|$|End {{of project}} reportSilage is made on {{approximately}} 86 % of Irish farms, and 85 % of these make some baled silage. Baled silage {{is particularly important}} as the primary silage making, storage and feeding system on many beef and smaller sized farms, but is also employed as a secondary system (often associated with facilitating grazing management during mid-summer) on many dairy and larger sized farms (O’Kiely et al., 2002). Previous surveys on farms indicated that the extent of visible fungal growth on baled silage was sometimes quite large, and could be a cause for concern.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{one in a series}} of three that {{addresses}} the issue of forage loss in harvest, storage, and feeding of animals. Forage loss occurs primarily by two modes: 1) escape of forage from the mass of forage as it moves through handling and storage processes and 2) microbial deterioration. Escape of forage can often be observed as forage lying on the ground or on top of equipment surfaces. Most microbial deterioration is invisible and may only be detected by a temperature rise in the forage or a darkening as the forage oxidizes. The obscurity of microbial deterioration has led many producers to believe they have minimal forage loss. In fact, they may experience appreciable (5 - 20 %) losses before they see visual evidence of molds on forage.

The methods of approach to this problem are (1) to assess the state-of-the-art biofuel SC studies, (2) to provide a decision support tool based on a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for the cellulosic biofuel supply chain design problem (BSCP), (3) to devise an exact solution method to solve large-scale instances of BSCP, (4) to evaluate a biomass logistics system based on biomass modules, by using new simulation elements for new machines, and (5) to compare several biomass logistics systems based on biomass module, bale, and silage, using simulation models. The {{first part of this}} dissertation broadly reviews the literature on biofuel SCs, analyzing the state-of-the-art biofuel and petroleum-based fuel SC studies as well as relating generic SC models that have been published over the last decade to the biofuel SC (An et al., 2010 a). The resulting analysis proposes fertile opportunity for future research to contribute to improving biofuel SC. The second part of this dissertation formulates BSCP as a MIP model, which is a time-staged, multi-commodity flow, network design problem with an objective of maximizing profit (An et al., 2010 b). The model prescribes strategic level decisions (i. e., facility locations, capacities, and technology types) as well as plans for transportation routes and material flows (i. e., quantities produced, stored, and transported) in each time period. A case study demonstrates managerial use in application to a region in Central Texas. The third part of this dissertation provides an exact solution method to solve BSCP. An embedded structure can be transformed to a generalized minimum cost flow problem, which is used as a sub-problem in a CG approach. This study proposes a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the sub-problem in O(m), generating improving path-flows. To accelerate branch-and-bound (B&B) search, it develops an inequality, called the partial objective constraint (POC), which is based on the portion of the objective function associated with binary variables.

The benefits of low input barley systems were also investigated; barley fields were subjected to two separate herbicide sub-treatments on a split-field design (high input broad-spectrum or low input narrow spectrum herbicides). The abundance of plant resources and invertebrates was assessed for three growing seasons during summer and winter for each crop type. The study clearly demonstrated the value of spring barley {{for the provision of}} plant resources when compared to the other <b>silage</b> cropping <b>systems,</b> whilst invertebrate responses were variable. No differences in plant and invertebrate resources were found between the barley treatments. Throughout the year, forage maize afforded the lowest provision of resources for farmland birds, and because it is likely that maize will continue to be grown in pastoral areas, the value of this habitat needs to be improved if farmland birds are to benefit. To provide plant and invertebrate resources for farmland birds in pastoral landscapes we strongly advocate the growing of spring sown barley whole-crop silage followed by over-wintering stubbles. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Currently, biomasses {{contribute}} to the European energy supply-chain by an average amount of 4 %. With reference to the Italian situation, {{in the last years}} about 10 % of the overall maize area is earmarked to biogas production causing a changing in its harvesting operations. In particular, due to the wide surface to collect in a short harvesting period, the mowing, chopping, transport and ensiling operations must be well adapted in order to avoid bottlenecks that otherwise would lead to unproductive periods of delay, idle machines and, as a result, higher costs that could reduce the overall efficiency. Ensiling, in this sense, {{is one of the key}} issues that could affect the sustainability of such biomass, both from an economical and environmental point of view.

40|$|Present-day {{agricultural}} technology {{is facing the}} challenge of limiting {{the environmental impacts of}} agricultural production – such as greenhouse gas emissions and demand for additional land – while meeting growing demands for agricultural products. Using the well-established method of life-cycle assessment (LCA), potential environmental impacts of agricultural production chains can be quantified and analyzed. This study presents three case studies of how the method can pinpoint environmental hot spots at different levels of agricultural production systems. The first case study centers on the tractor as the key source of transportation and traction in modern agriculture. A common Austrian tractor model was investigated over its life-cycle, using primary data from a manufacturer and measured load profiles for field work. In {{all but one of the}} impact categories studied, potential impacts were dominated by the operation phase of the tractor’s life-cycle (mainly due to diesel fuel consumption), with 84. 4 - 99. 6 % of total impacts. The production phase (raw materials and final assembly) caused between 0. 4 % and 12. 1 % of impacts, while disposal of the tractor was below 1. 9 % in all impact categories. The second case study shifts the focus to an entire production chain for a common biogas feedstock, maize <b>silage.</b> <b>System</b> boundaries incorporate the effect of auxiliary materials such as fertilizer and pesticides manufacturing and application. The operation of machinery in the silage production chain was found to be critical to its environmental impact. For the climate change indicator GWP 100 (global warming potential, 100 -year reference period), emissions from tractor operation accounted for 15 g CO 2 -eq per kg silage (64 % of total GWP 100), followed by field emissions during fertilizer (biogas digestate) application with 6 g CO 2 -eq per kg silage (24 % of total GWP 100). At a larger system scale that includes a silage-fed biogas plant with electricity generated by a biogas engine, silage cultivation operations are no longer the largest contributor; the most important contributor (49. 8 %) is methane slip from the exhaust of the biogas engine. In the third case study, the biogas plant model is energy system in an Alpine municipality of Western Austria is expanded to include a hypothetical system that uses mainly hay from currently unused alpine grassland in a local biogas plant. Here, the relative environmental impacts depend strongly on the fossil fuels that are assumed to be displaced by the local biogas plant; methane slip emissions from the exhaust dominate the impact of the hypothetical local biogas scenario. Taken together, the case studies demonstrate the potential and limitations of LCA as a technique to support decisions of agricultural stakeholders at a variety of scales. Choosing the proper system scale is key to a successful application of this method...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to reduce}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and dependency on fossil fuels {{has been one of}} the main driving forces to use renewable resources for energy and chemicals. The integrated use of grassland biomass for the production of chemicals and energy, also known as Green Biorefinery (GBR), has received much attention and several European countries have developed GBR systems, including Austria, Denmark and Germany. In Ireland, approximately 90 % of the 4. 3 million hectares used for agriculture is under grassland and used in livestock production systems. Recently livestock numbers have declined and a surplus of grass biomass is predicted. GBR has potential to provide supplementary income from this surplus grass. As part of a scoping study, I assessed the economic, technical and environmental feasibility of a GBR in an Irish context, and developed a blueprint for a first generation GBR. Scenario analyses suggested that the ideal catchment area for a GBR was 700 - 800 ha depending on biomass availability within the catchment area, and the availability should be in excess of 30 % in order to contain transport costs. An added benefit of a decentralised GBR facility processing approx. 0. 8 t of dry matter per hour is that it allows for ease of operation, and better knowledge of the source and quality of the herbage being supplied. The viability of a GBR will be highest in areas which experience declining numbers of livestock and lower farm income, particularly. This mainly, but not exclusively, occurs in areas with many beef farms. These areas have a high potential availability of surplus grass biomass and in such a situation the GBR would not have to compete with traditional agricultural commodities, but rather would provide potential supplementary income to farmers. The transitional development of a GBR system is likely to be most successful if current harvesting practices (i. e. a two-cut <b>silage</b> <b>system)</b> are adopted. The quality of the biomass from such a harvesting system is compatible with the basic GBR technologies used to produce insulation materials and proteinaceous products for animal feed. In the longer-term, higher value products could be produced by retro-fitting the GBR facility. Analyses also showed that feedstock quality can be best controlled by operating a silage-only system, with on-site ensiling of the grass material at the GBR facility. The use of silage as a feedstock also facilitates year-round operation of the GBR facility. Biorefinery processes are energy intensive. Therefore, the viability of the GBR largely depends on self–sufficiency for energy. This can be achieved by anaerobic digestion of the fibre slurries that remain after processing. The residual material remaining after the anaerobic digestion can be used as fertiliser on the farm supplying the biomass, as part of a “waste management strategy” that aims to maintain nutrient balance between the GBR and the source farms. This recycling will reduce direct costs of the supplying farms. The blueprint outlined in this thesis provides a framework for the development of a first generation GBR. The blueprint has also identified key areas that require further research: improved ensiling techniques, integration of livestock farming systems and GBR systems, and nutrient budgeting of the GBR system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to determine impacts of corn <b>silage</b> production <b>systems</b> that included a rye cover crop and application of liquid dairy manure in the spring and fall on water quality and soil characteristics. Four management systems were each replicated four times: traditional, double-crop, roll-down, and undercut. Manure was applied below the soil surface during the undercutting process; otherwise, manure was surface applied. In the roll-down system, the rye crop was flattened with a heavy roller after manure application. Rainfall was simulated within 48 h of manure application to produce runoff events. Grab samples of runoff were collected and composited for analysis. Soil samples were collected prior to treatments in the fall and spring. The roll-down system had no significant effect on water quality (sediment, nutrients, bacteria) as compared to the traditional system. While the roll-down system may require an occasional tillage operation to prevent surface compaction, it is recommended in situations where reduction of residual herbicide applications is a primary concern. The undercut system displayed evidence of a compaction layer developing below the disturbed soil layer. The undercut system reduced loadings of all nutrients, but increased losses of total suspended solids, as compared with all other systems. Mean volume of runoff from the undercut system was less than half that from any other system. Overall, the undercut system is recommended over the other systems analyzed for preventing transport of manure constituents to surface water, but should be evaluated in a complete dairy system before it is implemented by producers...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to produce an updated reference of the eco-efficiency of NZ dairy farm systems and to analyse the implications of intensification on their eco-efficiency. Results for an average NZ dairy farm system were compared with those for three dairy farmlet systems representing a wide range in intensification practices. A low input system (LI) (no N fertiliser, no brought-in feed supplement, stocking rate of 2. 3 cows/ha) was compared with an N-fertilised farm system (NF) (170 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year, 3 cows/ha) representing a first level of intensification and with an N-fertilised and maize <b>silage</b> supplemented <b>system</b> (NFMS) (170 kg fertiliser-N/ha/year, 13 t DM maize silage/ha/year, 5. 2 cows/ha), representing a possible future intensification option. Their eco-efficiency in terms of milk production and land use was compared using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. NZ dairy farm systems rely on favourable temperate climate conditions and long-term perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture, to achieve eco-efficient milk production and land use compared to European systems. However, intensification of NZ dairy farms was shown to be detrimental to their eco-efficiency in terms both of milk production and land use functions and could greatly reduce their advantage compared to European systems. The eco-efficiency of LI was very high whatever the functional unit which is remarkable from an LCA perspective. NF and NFMS had a similar eco-efficiency except for energy use which corresponded to the most critical hot spot of NFMS. All studied NZ systems presented some areas for improvement where some new technologies available for dairy farms might play a promising role in the future. Finally, it should be highlighted that the comparison with European studies based on the literature available needs validation through a more comprehensive study using harmonised methodology and assumptions across countries.

There was a significant effect of stage of lactation and month on Ca content. Month included numerous significant factors such as maximum daily temperature, day length and radiance duration. This study clearly showed that both cow genotype and lactation stage affects milk Ca content. However, the lactation stage did not explain all the seasonal variations of milk calcium content observed in this trial...|$|R
40|$|Crop yield map is {{a useful}} means to {{quantify}} yield variations within the fields {{and to provide a}} scientific basis for implementing site-specific crop management strategies. This research explores the feasibility of developing a new <b>silage</b> yield monitoring <b>system</b> by employing a new mass flow sensor based on using the momentum of chopped material impacting a pivoted plate loaded by a retractable spring installed {{at the end of a}} chopper discharge spout. A precise rotary potentiometer was used to measure the degree of pivoted plate rotation. To save and process the output voltage of the potentiometer, a programmable circuit comprising of AVR microcontroller ATMEGA series and MAX 232 microchip was used and the output data was sent to a portable computer for further processing. To calibrate the output signal of the sensor versus instantaneous chopped material flow rate, the chopper was fed artificially with predetermined mass flow rates of 6, 8 and 10 kg s- 1 of silage corn at five replications for each feeding rate. The results of statistical analysis showed high correlation between degrees of the pivoted-plate rotation and instantaneous feed rates with adjusted R 2 of 0. 98. To evaluate the accuracy of mass flow rate estimation, a platform scale weighing system was used during the field tests. The statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between sensor mass flow rate estimation and platform scale weighing system output. By using the resulted calibration equation, yield map of a silage cornfield was generated...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} implications of manipulating nitrogen (N) inputs and management strategies for beef production systems were assessed. One-hectare grassland farmlets were grazed to a target sward height by beef steers; herbage surplus to grazing requirements was cut for <b>silage.</b> Three <b>systems</b> were compared: ‘CN’, conventional mineral N application to a grass monoculture and broadcast slurry; ‘TN’, tactical mineral N application at fortnightly intervals to a grass monoculture with slurry injection {{and the early}} housing of cattle; ‘GC’, a mixed grass/white clover sward with no mineral N addition and slurry injection. Comparisons were made on two contrasting soil types: a freely-draining sandy loam (site 1) and a poorly drained clay (site 2). Financial budgets for 1999 - 2000 show that estimated gross profit margins (gross outputs minus variable costs), after deducting contractor’s charges for sward preparation and fertiliser spreading, were highest for treatment CN at both sites Î(€ 1552, € 1356 and € 1461 ha- 1 for site 1 and € 1562, € 1281 and € 1287 ha- 1 for site 2, for treatments CN, TN and GC, respectively). Treatment TN was penalised by increased costs associated with an extended housed period {{and the need to}} purchase additional silage for winter feeding which cost € 242 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 250 ha- 1 at site 2. Savings in N fertiliser for TN in comparison with CN (€ 44 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 39 ha- 1 at site 2) were more than offset by the increased costs of fortnightly fertiliser applications (€ 54 ha- 1 at site 1 and € 46 ha- 1 at site 2). Treatment GC benefited from zero costs for the purchase and spreading of mineral N fertiliser but was penalised by increased variation in forage DM production which resulted in a shortfall in winter fodder requirements with a replacement cost of € 250 at site 1 and € 435 at site 2. The best overall economic performance after the allocation of all possible relevant costs (variable, fixed and capital) in terms of the relative net profit margin, was for GC at site 1 and for CN at site 2 (-€ 1358, -€ 2399 and -€ 1304 ha- 1 at site 1 and -€ 1122, -€ 2810 and - € 1380 ha- 1 at site 2, for CN, TN and GC, respectively). The opportunity costs of reducing N surpluses at the gross profit margin level (after contractor’s charges) for treatments TN and GC over treatment CN were calculated at € 2. 29 kg- 1 N surplus for TN and € 0. 67 kg- 1 N surplus for GC at site 1, with corresponding values of € 4. 91 and € 1. 57 at site 2.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{profitability}} of various double cropping systems established at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) at Purdue University {{during the years of}} 2008 and 2009. The double cropping systems under review included winter wheat followed by different grain and silage varieties of corn, sorghum, sweet sorghum and soybean. Enterprise budgets were constructed to estimate annual net returns (ANR), direct and total cost of production, breakeven prices and direct and total costs per ton of dry matter (DM). The effect of yield variation is measured on ANR and breakeven prices. Mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of yields, ANR and, breakeven points were calculated for all cropping systems under review. Based on 2009 data, results showed three economically competitive ANR from double cropping systems: winter wheat harvested as green chop followed by soybean with $ 29. 41 /acre; winter wheat harvested for silage in combination with soybean resulting in $ 63. 08 /acre and; winter wheat harvested for silage followed by sweet sorghum silage with $ 79. 04 /acre. When yield data from 2008 and 2009 was considered, seven double cropping systems had positive average annual net returns. Winter wheat harvested as green chop (WWGC) followed by soybean results is the double cropping system with the lowest positive average ANR at $ 1. 68 /acre. It is also the double cropping systems with the highest variability according to the ANR coefficient of variation (27. 6692). Winter wheat grain (WWG) followed by sweet sorghum silage resulted in average ANR of $ 17. 46 /acre with the second highest ANR CV at 4. 7937. Winter wheat grain double cropped with sorghum silage has the highest average ANR with $ 243. 60 /acre, followed by winter wheat silage combined with sweet sorghum silage with an average ANR of $ 129. 60 /acre. These two double cropping systems are also associated with low ANR variation, based on their coefficients of variation of 0. 6762 and 0. 3930, respectively. Therefore, WWS followed by sweet sorghum <b>silage</b> is the <b>system</b> with the lowest variation and the second highest average ANR. Winter wheat silage followed by sorghum has an ANR CV of 0. 6639; average ANR are the third highest with $ 129. 60 for this system. These systems can potentially improve agricultural sustainability through enhanced soil cover during the winter and reduced soil erosion. Additionally, these cropping systems could provide flexibility and market diversity to crop producers, who could target livestock, grain, and silage production, and/or biomass production for the ethanol industry. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{concerns}} about sustainable agriculture {{and the needs}} to reduce the use of concentrates has led researchers to investigate new approaches in feeding systems for dairy cows. The beginning of lactation is a threatening episode in cow’s life. The increasing nutrient demands for milk production often overcomes their capacity to ingest enough feed to supply their nutrient demands. In addition, exist other factors besides the physical constrains that may influence intake in cattle i. e. metabolic changes, diet composition or animal characteristics. The use of concentrates, which are rich in energy, seem to be crucial to compensate the energetic deficiencies in this lactation stage. Therefore, the hypothesis of this experiment was that cows fed with low concentrate levels {{during the first six}} weeks of lactation would have higher silage intake but lower milk yield and a more negative energy balance. Thirty-one cows were used in the experiment during their first six weeks of lactation. The herd comprised cows with different lactation number and two breeds, Swedish Holstein and Swedish Red. Two diets with different amounts of concentrate and ad libitum silage were offered. The low concentrate group (LC) received 4 - 5 Kg of concentrate depending on lactation number and the High concentrate group (HC) received 14 - 15 Kg. The concentrate was based on by-products with the peculiarity of being rich in neutral detergent fibre (NDF) (88 %DM, 179 g/Kg DM CP, 67. 4 g/Kg DM Fat, 328 g/Kg DM NDF, 53. 6 g/Kg DM Ash, 32. 5 g/Kg DM Starch and 13. 2 MJ/Kg DM ME). The silage used was clover-grasssilage with low content in NDF and highly digestible (36. 5 % DM of fresh matter, 80 % OMD, 138 g/Kg DM CP, 391 g/Kg DM NDF, 83 g/Kg DM Ash, 11. 7 MJ/Kg DM ME and pH= 4. 3). All cow were milked twice daily in an Automatic Milking Rotary (AMR) <b>system.</b> <b>Silage</b> and concentrate intakes, milk yield, body weight (BW), and camera body condition score (BCS) were recorded on daily basis. Visual BCS and milk sampling for composition analysis were measured the second, fourth and sixth week of lactation for each cow. From the data collected, energy corrected milk (ECM) and energy balance (EB) were calculated. The effect of treatment was not significant for total dry matter intake (DMI), total metabolizable energy (ME) intake, energy corrected milk (ECM), energy balance (EB), and BCS. Silage intake was significantly higher within LC group. Effects of parity and breed were statistically significant for all the parameters measured except for the effect of breed and lactation number on energy balance. In conclusion, dairy cows fed with low concentrate diets during early lactation could compensate their energetic requirements for both body maintenance and milk production by eating more silage of high digestibility...|$|R
40|$|Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in Indiana {{is highly}} {{dependent}} upon environmental {{factors in the}} growing season and the management imposed by the producer. The objectives of the first study, located in Evansville and West Lafayette, Indiana in 2009 and 2010 were {{to determine the effects}} of seeding rate, nitrogen fertilizer, seed treatment-insecticide, foliar insecticide and foliar fungicide treatments on responses of seven varieties of soft red winter wheat. Wheat varieties did not vary in their responses to management inputs in either year or location. A second topdress application of nitrogen fertilizer (increasing N rate from 140 to 190 kg N ha- 1 at Evansville and from 132 to 176 kg N ha- 1 at West Lafayette) led to an increase in yield in challenging years, though this effect was reduced in highly productive environments. The yield increase was not associated with a decrease in grain quality measured by protein content, milling and baking qualities. In addition, economic analysis of the production systems showed that in high producing years and locations, investing in additional nitrogen decreased profit. In challenging environments, the higher investment in both seed and nitrogen resulted in higher annual net returns on both a per land area and per unit of grain yield basis. ^ In the second study, the primary objective was to determine whether winter wheat based cropping systems in the Midwest have the potential to produce grain, forage or biofuel feedstock that is profitable. Fifteen winter wheat based double cropping systems and five single crop systems were studied near West Lafayette, Indiana in the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons to measure the impacts of no-till planting into wheat stubble and delayed planting on grain and dry matter yield, forage quality and potential energy yield. Winter wheat was harvested at boot, heading and at grain maturity stages as either whole plant silage or grain plus straw. The second crops tested were corn for grain, whole-plant silage corn, grain sorghum, sweet sorghum, silage sorghum and soybean. Each of these double-crop species were seeded on at least two planting dates as soon as possible after wheat harvest. Budgets were developed to gauge the profitability of the systems, and liquid fuel potential and total energy content of each system were assessed using conversion values from recent literature. This study found significant dry matter (DM) yield losses associated with planting grain corn, silage corn, and silage sorghum (but not soybean) into wheat stubble compared to bare ground. Differences in protein and fiber content, and digestibility were a function of double-crop species and planting dates. Enterprise budgets revealed that single crop systems or double cropping wheat with soybean were most profitable at the first planting date. At the second planting date, the ensiled winter wheat and soybean double-crop system was profitable in both years, while the silage sorghum and sweet sorghum double crop systems were profitable in one of the two years. At the third planting date, all five systems generated losses in 2009, but the soybean and <b>silage</b> sorghum double-crop <b>systems</b> generated a profit in 2010. All cropping systems were assessed for total energy yield, measured by total heat of combustion (GJ ha- 1). The maximum energy yielding systems at each planting date were wheat greenchop plus silage sorghum, wheat silage plus silage corn, and winter wheat grain/straw plus silage sorghum for the three wheat harvests, respectively. Total heat of combustion (GJ ha- 1) trends followed with those observed for liquid fuel in the form of fermentation or cellulosic ethanol conversion. Selected alternative cropping systems based on winter wheat were highly productive in terms of tonnage, economic and energy yields, but the overall system productivity was very dependent on the crop management plus harvest options adopted in both wheat and any crops that followed. ...|$|R
