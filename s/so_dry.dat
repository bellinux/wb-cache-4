5|$|In South Africa, {{the common}} {{starling}} {{was introduced in}} 1897 by Cecil Rhodes. It spread slowly and by 1954 had reached Clanwilliam and Port Elizabeth. It is now common in the southern Cape region, thinning out northwards to the Johannesburg area. It {{is present in the}} Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and the Free State provinces of South Africa and lowland Lesotho, with occasional sightings in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and around the town of Oranjemund in Namibia. In Southern Africa populations appear to be resident and the bird is very much associated with man, his habitations and pastures. It favours irrigated land and is absent from regions where the ground is baked <b>so</b> <b>dry</b> that it cannot probe for insects. It may compete with native birds for crevice nesting sites but the indigenous species are probably more disadvantaged by destruction of their natural habitat than they are by inter-specific competition. It breeds from September to December and outside the breeding season may congregate in large flocks, often roosting in reedbeds. It is the most common bird species in urban and agricultural areas.|$|E
25|$|While the United Kingdom is not {{particularly}} noted for extreme weather, it does sometimes occur, and events such as floods and drought may be experienced. The summer of 1976, for example, experienced temperatures as high as , and it was <b>so</b> <b>dry</b> the country suffered drought and water shortages.|$|E
25|$|In the {{far eastern}} part of the state the Chihuahuan Desert dominates due to low {{precipitation}} and extremely high temperatures; some areas of the {{eastern part of}} the state are <b>so</b> <b>dry</b> no vegetation is found like the Sand Dunes of Samalayuca. There are two distinctive climate zones found in the {{eastern part of the}} state: Hot Desert (BWh) and Cool Desert (BWk) which are differentiated by average annual temperature due to differences in elevation. There is a transition zone in the middle of the state between the two extremely different climates from the east and west; this zone is the Steppe characterized by a compromise between juxtaposed climate zones.|$|E

25|$|The Laurentian Highlands, the Interior Plains and the Interior Highlands lie {{between the}} two coasts, {{stretching}} from the Gulf of Mexico northward, far beyond the national boundary, to the Arctic Ocean. The central plains are divided by a hardly perceptible height of land into a Canadian and a United States portion. It is from the United States side, that the great Mississippi system discharges southward to the Gulf of Mexico. The upper Mississippi {{and some of the}} Ohio basin is the semi-arid prairie region, with trees originally only along the watercourses. The uplands towards the Appalachians were included in the great eastern forested area, while {{the western part of the}} plains has <b>so</b> <b>dry</b> a climate that its native plant life is scanty, and in the south it is practically barren.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys and {{intestines}} of a camel {{are very}} efficient at reabsorbing water. Camels' kidneys have a 1:4 cortex to medulla ratio. Thus medullary part of camel's kidneys occupy {{twice as much}} area as a cow's kidney. Secondly, renal corpuscles have a smaller diameter, which reduces surface area for filtration. These two major anatomical characteristics enable camel to conserve water and limit the volume of urine in extreme desert conditions. Camel urine comes out as a thick syrup, and camel feces are <b>so</b> <b>dry</b> {{that they do not}} require drying when the Bedouins use them to fuel fires. The camels are able to live in difficult conditions without drinking water due to their ability to produce small and pretty dry droppings as well as they use the water to maintain their body’s temperature to fit with the region surrounding them (Breulmann, et al., 2007).|$|E

500|$|While {{the storm}} was over water, small craft {{advisories}} were issued by the Coast Guard in addition to cautioning people on vacation in South Padre Island to avoid the beaches. However, {{as it was a}} Sunday evening, most of the ships were already coming into port. As Amelia approached the Texas coast, gale warnings were issued for the area from Brownsville to Port O'Connor on July 30. Due to it forming in close proximity to the coast, warnings were issued as soon as {{the storm was}} named. [...] As the state had been {{in the midst of a}} severe drought the previous six weeks, there was hope that Amelia would relieve the dry conditions. However, the drought conditions would benefit the floods from the storm due to the ground being rendered <b>so</b> <b>dry</b> that it was unable to soak up all the rain from the storm.|$|E

40|$|Critical {{loads of}} acid {{deposition}} for ecosystems in South China are derived by synthesizing the critical loads of acid deposition for soils, the critical loads of <b>SO</b> 2 <b>dry</b> deposition for ecosystems, as well their exceedance. The results {{show in the}} southeast of Sichuan province around Chongqing municipality, the central and north of Guizhou province around Guiyang municipality, and the most areas of Jiangsu province, both the critical loads for soils and critical loads of <b>SO</b> 2 <b>dry</b> deposition are exceeded. In Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and some areas among Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, the critical loads of <b>SO</b> 2 <b>dry</b> deposition is the only restricting factor. There is no area where the critical load for soil is the only restricting factor in South China, so only the critical load for soil {{is not enough to}} be the basis to make sulfur abatement scheme...|$|R

2500|$|From 1977 onwards the RLI was {{forbidden}} to wear shorts on operations, {{due to the}} dangerous visibility of the soldiers' white legs. [...] This rule was strictly adhered to, but a rule which required troops to wear ankle-boots when in para-stops was often broken. [...] The number of parachute injuries on ops was insignificant, despite (or perhaps, because of) around half of landings falling into trees. Sometimes they fell onto boulders or buildings or fences or boggy ground. [...] Fields varied from as hard as concrete to soil <b>so</b> <b>dry</b> and diffuse that it swallowed them up.

2500|$|Natal has {{a typical}} {{tropical}} climate, specifically a tropical {{wet and dry}} climate, with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and pleasant trade winds blowing from the ocean. February is the warmest month, with mean maxima of 31°C (88°F) and minima of 24°C (75°F), while July is the coolest with mean maxima of 28°C (82°F) and minima of 21°C (69°F). Rainfall is heavy at around [...] per year, {{but there is a}} dry season between about September and January that is more distinct than further south on the Atlantic coast. Nonetheless, the weather is not <b>so</b> <b>dry</b> as to preclude the growth of tropical rainforest and, since colonisation by Portugal, sugar cane.|$|E

2500|$|On June 26, 2001, the Hubble Space Telescope {{spotted a}} dust storm brewing in Hellas Basin on Mars (pictured right). A day later the storm [...] "exploded" [...] {{and became a}} global event.

[...] The season following that dust storm had daytime temperatures 4K below average. [...] This was attributed to the global covering of light-colored dust that settled out of the dust storm, temporarily increasing Mars' albedo.|$|E
