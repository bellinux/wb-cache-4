40|$|The {{need for}} a unifying <b>scale</b> <b>anchor</b> for {{isotopes}} of CO 2 in air was brought to light at the 11 th WMO/IAEA Meeting of Experts on Carbon Dioxide in Tokyo 2001. During discussions about persistent discrepancies in isotope measurements between the worlds leading laboratories, {{it was concluded that}} a unifying <b>scale</b> <b>anchor</b> for Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) of CO 2 in air was desperately needed. Ten years later, at the 2011 Meeting of Experts on Carbon Dioxide in Wellington, it was recommended that the Jena Reference Air Set (JRAS) become the official <b>scale</b> <b>anchor</b> for isotope measurements of CO 2 in air (Brailsford, 2012). The source of CO 2 used for JRAS is two calcites. After releasing CO 2 by reaction with phosphoric acid, the gases are mixed into CO 2 -free air. This procedure ensures both isotopic stability and longevity of the CO 2. That the reference CO 2 is generated from calcites and supplied as an air mixture is unique to JRAS. This is made to ensure that any measurement bias arising from the extraction procedure is eliminated. As every laboratory has its own procedure for extracting the CO 2, this is of paramount importance if the local scales are to be unified with a common anchor. For a period of four years, JRAS has been evaluated through the IMECC 1 program, which made it possible to distribute sets of JRAS gases to 13 laboratories worldwide. A summary of data from the six laboratories that have reported the full set of results is given here along with a description of the production and maintenance of the JRAS scale anchors. 1 IMECC refers to the EU project "Infrastructure for Measurements of the European Carbon Cycle" ([URL]) ...|$|E

However, exposure to trait-implying sentences that described actors with real names and were accompanied with photos of the actors resulted in contrast under both memorization and impression instructions (Experiment 1). Furthermore, contrast ensued when trait-implying sentences were accompanied with information that suggested a person attribution, whereas assimilation ensued when that information suggested a situation attribution, independent of processing goals (Experiment 2).

40|$|The {{offshore}} oilfield {{industry is}} continuously developing unique and break-through technologies and systems to extract hydrocarbons from ever increasing ocean depths. Due {{to the extreme}} depths being explored presently, large anchors are being utilized to secure temporary and permanent facilities over their respective drilling/production site. A vertically loaded, torpedo-style, deepwater mooring anchor developed by Delmar Systems, Inc. {{is one of these}} anchors. The OMNI-Max anchor is an efficient, cost-effective alternative for use as a mooring system anchor intended for floating facilities. The OMNI-Max is designed to free-fall towards the ocean bottom and uses its kinetic energy for self-embedment into the soil, providing a mooring system anchor point. Values such as drag coefficient and terminal velocity are vital in predicting embedment depth to obtain the mooring capacity required by the floating facility. Two scaled models of the Mark I OMNI-Max anchor were subjected to a series of tests in the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Texas A & M University to evaluate the overall drag coefficient and penetration depth. The 1 / 24 scale model was tested by measuring the amount of penetration into an artificial mud mixture. The 1 / 15 scale model was attached to a tow carriage and towed through a water-filled tank to measure the drag forces and evaluate the drag coefficient. The anchor terminal velocity was measured using underwater cameras to track the free fall of the model anchor through 15 ft of water inside the tow tank. The 1 / 24 scale model penetrated the mud an average of 22 inches from the leading tip of the anchor to the mud surface, approximately 1. 5 anchor lengths. The penetration depth increased as impact velocity increased, while the penetration depth decreased as the fins were retracted. The 1 / 15 <b>scale</b> <b>anchor</b> was towed at 6 different velocities producing a varied total drag coefficient between 0. 70 and 1. 12 for Reynolds number flows between 3. 08 E 05 and 1. 17 E 06.

The 1 / 15 <b>scale</b> <b>anchor</b> was allowed to free-fall in the tow tank and obtained an average terminal velocity of and 14. 6 feet per second. The drag coefficients ranged from 0. 46 to 0. 83, which increased as the fins were retracted.

30|$|The {{thoughtful}} {{selection of}} response options for new pediatric PRO measures is important, however, {{there is very}} little empirical basis for the type of response scale selected or attributes of the response scale including, number of response options, visual orientation of the scale (for example, vertical vs. horizontal), and response <b>scale</b> <b>anchor</b> wording. The United States Food and Drug Administration emphasizes the importance of self-report in pediatric populations rather than proxy-report, but do not recommend any specific response options for inclusion in a PRO measure. However, several response option types commonly seen in PRO instruments are listed for consideration in their 2009 Guidance for Industry, titled Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims [4]. Typical response options employed in PRO instruments include verbal rating scales (VRS), visual analogue scales (VAS), numeric rating scales (NRS), and various graphical scales such as a Faces scale.

I explore different outlier rejection criteria {{designed to give}} a reduced chi-squared of unity and compare the results with the R 11 rejection algorithm, which produces a reduced chi-squared that is substantially less than unity and, in some cases, to underestimates of the errors on parameters. I show that there are sub-luminous low metallicity Cepheids in the R 11 sample that skew the global fits of the period-luminosity relation. This has a small but non-negligible impact on the global fits using NGC 4258 as a distance <b>scale</b> <b>anchor,</b> but adds a poorly constrained source of systematic error when using the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as an anchor. I also show that the small Milky Way (MW) Cepheid sample with accurate parallax measurements leads to a distance to NGC 4258 that is in tension with the maser distance. I conclude that H 0 based on the NGC 4258 maser distance is H 0 = 70. 6 +/- 3. 3 km/s/Mpc compatible within 1 sigma with the recent determination from Planck for the base six-parameter LCDM cosmology. If the H-band period-luminosity relation {{is assumed to be}} independent of metallicity and the three distance anchors are combined, I find H 0 = 72. 5 +/- 2. 5 km/s/Mpc, which differs by 1. 9 sigma from the Planck value. The differences between the Planck results and these estimates of H 0 are not large enough to provide compelling evidence for new physics at this stage. Comment: 14 page...|$|E
40|$|Measurements from {{multiple}} laboratories {{have to be}} related to unifying and traceable reference material in order to be comparable. However, such fundamental reference materials are not available for isotope ratios in atmospheric methane, which led to misinterpretations of combined data sets in the past. We developed a method to produce a suite of synthetic CH 4 -in-air standard gases {{that can be used to}} unify methane isotope ratio measurements of laboratories in the atmospheric monitoring community. Therefore, we calibrated a suite of pure methane gases of different methanogenic origin against international referencing materials that define the VSMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water) and VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) isotope scales. The isotope ratios of our pure methane gases range between − 320 and + 40  ‰ for δ 2 H–CH 4 and between − 70 and − 40  ‰ for δ 13 C–CH 4, enveloping the isotope ratios of tropospheric methane (about − 85 and − 47  ‰ for δ 2 H–CH 4 and δ 13 C–CH 4 respectively). Estimated uncertainties, including the full traceability chain, are <  1. 5  ‰ and <  0. 2  ‰ for δ 2 H and δ 13 C calibrations respectively. Aliquots of the calibrated pure methane gases have been diluted with methane-free air to atmospheric methane levels and filled into 5  L glass flasks.

Further dissemination of N 2 O isotopomer analysis, however, is hampered {{by a lack of}} internationally agreed gaseous N 2 O reference materials and an uncertain compatibility of different laboratories and analytical techniques. METHODSIn a first comparison approach, eleven laboratories were each provided with N 2 O at tropospheric mole fractions (target gas T) and two reference gases (REF 1 and REF 2). The laboratories analysed all gases, applying their specific analytical routines. Compatibility of laboratories was assessed based on N 2 O isotopocule data for T, REF 1 and REF 2. Results for T were then standardised using REF 1 and REF 2 to evaluate the potential of N 2 O reference materials for improving compatibility between laboratories. RESULTSCompatibility between laboratories depended on the analytical technique: isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) results showed better compatibility for δ 15 N values, while the performance of laser spectroscopy was superior with respect to N 2 O site preference. This comparison, however, is restricted by the small number of participating laboratories applying laser spectroscopy. Offset and two-point calibration correction of the N 2 O isotopomer data significantly improved the consistency of position-dependent nitrogen isotope data while the effect on δ 15 N values was only minor. CONCLUSIONSThe study reveals that for future research on N 2 O isotopocules, standardisation against N 2 O reference material is essential to improve interlaboratory compatibility.

40|$|Abstract For {{anchoring}} CO 2 isotopic {{measurements on}} the δ 18 OVPD-CO 2 scale, the primary reference material (NBS 19 calcite) {{needs to be}} digested using concentrated ortho-phosphoric acid. During this procedure, great {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the isotopic composition of the liberated gas is accurate. Apart from controlling the reaction temperature to ± 0. 1 °C, the potential for oxygen isotope exchange between the produced CO 2 and water must be kept to a minimum. The water is usually assumed to reside on the walls in the headspace of the reaction vessel. We demonstrate here that a large fraction of the exchange may also occur with water inside the acid. Our results indicate that both exchange reactions {{have a significant impact on}} the results and may have largely been responsible for scale inconsistencies between laboratories in the past. The extent of CO 2 /H 2 O oxygen exchange depends on the concentration (amount of free water) in the acid. For acids with a nominal H 3 PO 4 mass fraction of less than 102 %, oxygen isotope exchange can create a substantial isotopic bias during high-precision measurements with the degree of the alteration being proportional to the effective isotopic contrast between the acid and the CO 2 released from the calcite. Water evaporating from the acid at 25 °C has a δ 18 O value of − 34. 5 ‰ relative to the isotopic composition of the whole acid. This large fractionation is likely to occur in two steps; by exchange with phosphate, water inside the acid is decreased in oxygen- 18 relative to the bulk acid by ∼ − 22 ‰. This water is then fractionated further during evaporation. Oxygen exchange with both water inside the acid and water condensate in the headspace can contribute to the measured isotopic signature depending on the experimental parameters. The system employed for this study has been specifically designed to minimize oxygen exchange with water. However, the amount of altered CO 2 for a 95 % H 3 PO 4 at 25 °C still accounts for about 3 % of the total CO 2 produced from a 40 [*]mg calcite sample, resulting in a δ 18 O range of about 0. 8 ‰ when varying the δ 18 O value of the acid by 25 ‰. Least biased results for NBS 19 -CO 2 were obtained for an acid with a δ 18 O value close to + 23 ‰ vs. VSMOW. In contrast, commercial acids from several sources had an average δ 18 O value of + 13 ‰, amounting to a 10 ‰ offset from the optimal value. This observation suggests that the well-known scale incompatibilities between laboratories could arise from this difference with measurements that may have suffered systematically from non-optimal acid-δ 18 O values, thus producing variable offsets, depending on the experimental details. As a remedy, we suggest that the δ 18 O of phosphoric acid reacted with calcites for establishing a δ 18 O <b>scale</b> <b>anchor</b> be adjusted, and this should reduce the variability of the δ 18 O of CO 2 evolved in acid digestion to less than ± 0. 05 ‰. The adjustment should be made by taking into account the difference in δ 18 O between the calcite-CO 2 and the acid, with a target difference of 16 ‰. With this strategy, agreement between δ 18 O scales based on water, atmospheric CO 2, and carbonates as well as data compatibility between laboratories may be substantially improved.
